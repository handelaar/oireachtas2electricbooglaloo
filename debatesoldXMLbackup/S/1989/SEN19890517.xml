      <P>I wish to announce for the information of the House that arising from the complaint made by Senator Jack Harte over last week's television coverage of the expression of sympathy for the late Deputy Frank Cluskey a letter has been received from RTE saying the omission of Senator Harte in the expression of sympathy in that programme is profoundly regretted and was due to a technical mishap.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>As the leader of the Labour group may I put on record the fact that we also received an apology from RTE. We accept it was a technical problem although it was an unfortunate one and it should not have happened.  On behalf of the Labour group I want to say we were formally notified of that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not intended to speak but I feel I must say something.  It arises from the fact that I have received a letter from a Mr. Wesley Boyd objecting to my <Col N="1682" /> comments.  He feels the way I commented made it look as though I was accusing him of editing me out&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>He asked if I would clear his name in the Seanad Chamber and I am trying to do that.  When I rang Telefís Éireann and asked with whom I could raise the complaint I was put through to some lady and in my irritation I forgot her name.  She told me the best thing to do would be to ring Mr. Wesley Boyd the following morning.  Naturally I assumed he was the person who would deal with the complaint.  I mentioned him here.  I would like to go on record as saying that if it came across in the record that I was accusing him of being insensitive or indolent, that was not intended.  My complaint was with whoever was responsible for the editing.  If Mr. Wesley Boyd feels offended about that, I would like to put on record that there was no intention to do that.  I understand he cannot be available at five minutes notice for somebody ringing up with a complaint as he has a job to do.  I would like to place that on the record and apologise to Mr. Boyd if he felt I was doing the wrong thing.</P>

      <P>Thank you.  I have notice from Senator Denis Cregan that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The delay by the Minister for the Environment in giving the go-ahead to the downstream river crossing in Cork.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Katharine Bulbulia of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Finance to clarify the position of Water-ford in the Government decentralization programme by identifying the State agency or agencies to be located there and by giving a firm <Col N="1683" /> projection of the stage processing of the relocation.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Paul Bradford of the following matter:</P>
    <P>In view of the recent High Court judgment on Mallow Hospital the need for the Minister for Health to state clearly his support for the continuance of full general hospital services at Mallow.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Donie Cassidy of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Communications to call on the RTE Authority to change their present policy on radio and demand a higher percentage of Irish-produced MOR programmes on the air.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Cregan, Bulbulia and Bradford as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected the matter raised by Senator Cregan and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Bulbulia and Bradford may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>
    <P>I regret I have to rule that the matter raised by Senator Donie Cassidy is not suitable for discussion on the ground of lack of ministerial responsibility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. W. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Item No. 1 from now until 6.30 p.m. and we will then take Item No. 2.  If Item No. 1 is not completed at 6.30 p.m. we will go back to it at 8 p.m. and continue until we have Second Stage completed.  For <Col N="1684" /> the benefit of Members, I understand there will be a delegation from Czechoslovakia here at 7 p.m. &mdash; I only got that notice a few minutes ago &mdash; and it will look better if as many of us as possible are present at that time.</P>

      <P>A parliamentary delegation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamRyan" hpid="Mr. W. Ryan Mr. W. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, a parliamentary delegation.  Tomorrow's business will be the Great Blasket Island Bill, Committee and remaining Stages.  It will commence after the Order of Business, at 10.30 a.m. I mentioned we were sitting at 10 a.m. because I hoped to get the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill taken earlier but that was not possible.  The House will sit at 10.30 a.m. and the first item will be the Great Blasket Island Bill.  We will then go to Committee Stage of the Finance Bill and complete it tomorrow evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KatherineBulbulia" hpid="Mrs. Bulbulia Mrs. Bulbulia">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a little unclear about what would appear to me to be a suggestion of haste about the Finance Bill.  Traditionally in the House the Finance Bill has got a very good and detailed airing.  The acting Leader of the House appears to be suggesting that there is some pressure on us to complete Second Stage today and to complete Committee and Final Stages by tomorrow.  On this side of the House we would find such an atitude unacceptable, particularly as we are aware of the fact that constitutionally the Bill does not need to be completed this week and that next week is sufficient time.  While there may be a reason for visiting a certain haste upon us, nevertheless on behalf of my party I would like to register a very strong protest and to state that we will not comply with any suggestion or any wish on the part of the Government side of the House to deal with the Finance Bill in a hasty way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Also, on the Order of Business, may I ask the acting Leader of the House when Item No. 27 will be taken.  There is a certain urgency about this.  Dental benefits for spouses are not in place for all deserving people throughout the country <Col N="1685" /> and many people are looking for a speedy resolution of this matter.  It is felt that a debate in this House on the issue would certainly help and would keep up the momentum for change.  I would like a reply to that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to check that Item No. 2 will not be taken before 6.30 p.m. if Item No. 1 concludes before that, although that is unlikely.</P>
      <P>To clarify the situation regarding the Finance Bill, Members of this House have always been conscious of their constitutional responsibility regarding the Finance Bill.  As I understand it, Senator Ryan said we will not be taking that Bill tomorrow because it will not be available and for that reason we are starting at 10.30 a.m. to take the Bill on the Great Blasket Island.  Is it still likely that the Finance Bill will be taken tomorrow?  It will not be completed tomorrow because there is detailed discussion on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to endorse what Senator Bulbulia has said.  I am not quite sure what is the hurry with the Finance Bill but it is somewhat inconsistent with the way the proceedings of this House have been run.  We are being asked possibly to come back this evening at 8 p.m. and go on for as long as the Second Stage takes.  I do not think there is any pressing reason that the House knows why we should rush this Bill through.  Maybe the Leader of the House in his reply could tell us if we finish Second Stage today, whether it is intended not only to take Committee Stage tomorrow but to complete Committee and all Stages this week or to go on until next week.  I am really asking if it is intended to have a guillotine and what is the actual programme for the Finance Bill because it is important.  I have not received a copy of the Bill yet. I may be in a minority there but it seems as if it is to be rushed through with unseemly haste.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to raise very briefly a matter relating to the conduct of business in the House.  For a long time it was the custom in the House <Col N="1686" /> that Senators did not read contributions from scripts.  However, for some time now it seems to have been honoured more in the breach than the observance. It is of interest that this was noted adversely in the public reaction to the televised proceedings last week.  I respectfully suggest that you would consider reviving this convention and implementing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I want simply to join in the concern expressed by other Senators at what appears to be considerable haste in processing the Finance Bill.  It is a lengthy piece of legislation and it has only just arrived in our office, so in order to facilitate us in making considered contributions to this debate a lack of haste would be a good thing.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask for further information on a matter I raised on the Order of Business over a month ago, that was a matter I referred, on your advice, to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges from whom I have heard absolutely nothing.  Perhaps you would be in a position to advise me as to how I can best proceed from here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>On the basis of the comments of the acting Leader of the House in relation to the delegation who are visiting this House this evening, may I ask that the acting Leader or those Members who will be present &mdash; unfortunately I will be unable to be there myself &mdash; convey to the parliamentary delegation from Czechoslovakia the very serious concern in this country at the gross abuse of human rights in Czechoslovakia, particularly to artists, musicians and writers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to last week, you will be aware that there was widespread discussion on the televising of the House, with positive and negative comments being made.  Looking beyond that, may I ask the acting Leader of the House to assure us that no developments <Col N="1687" /> outside this House or by people or influences outside this House will be allowed to have any negative impact on the possibility of continuing the televising of this House.  I would like to get a commitment from the Leader of the House that we will pursue that matter as quickly as possible because it appears there are&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is my understanding we have allowed an officer of this House to participate in the meeting as an observer. The House should be aware that the other House did not allow the Seanad to participate as an equal on continuing decisions about whether or not to televise Oireachtas proceedings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamRyan" hpid="Mr. W. Ryan Mr. W. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it very clear that we are not taking the Finance Bill in haste.  We are taking it today and tomorrow.  Senators can speak as long as they like but we will finish Second Stage today.  We will commence Committee Stage tomorrow after the Great Blasket Island Bill which we will probably finish at 2 p.m.  It is all very fine for certain <Col N="1688" /> people to say there is no hurry with the Finance Bill but it has to be law by Thursday, 25 May.  I am sure there are many people who might not like to have to come back here next Monday or Tuesday. I am very confident Senators are getting plenty of time to discuss it.  We can have a long day today and a long day tomorrow and we will get through the Finance Bill.</P>
      <P>I was asked when we are taking Item No. 27.  I suggest to the Fine Gael Party that they put it down as their party's motion in about three weeks time.  I cannot give them any other guarantee about it.  Broadcasting was mentioned by Senator O'Toole.  That is a matter for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>
      <P>With regard to the delegation who are coming to the House today, should the Cathaoirleach welcome them here?  It is a new thing in this House.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to take the opportunity, on my first visit to your refurbished Chamber to congratulate you on the lovely surroundings.  I know the Office of Public Works must share the credit for the lovely result.</P>
      <P>This Bill is an essential part of the process of implementing the Government's budget.  It is designed to give statutory effect to the important taxation provisions which I announced on budget day as well as other significant changes in the tax area.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to be able to circulate an up-to-date explanatory memorandum with the text of the Bill.  The memorandum contains a detailed description of the individual provisions of the Bill, taking account of the amendments which were made in the course of its passage through the Dáil.  I hope this will facilitate Senators in their deliberations on the Bill.</P>
      <P>While the emphasis in our discussions today is on taxation matters, these can only be assessed in a meaningful way as part of the Government's overall budgetary and economic strategy.  I would like to take this opportunity, therefore, to review for this House our recent budgetary and economic progress and the prospects as I see them at present.  I will then move on to discuss the main provisions of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The transformation which has taken place in the economy owes much to the improvement in the public finances which has been effected in the past three budgets. The budgetary difficulties had to be tackled head-on if we were to turn the economy onto the path of higher growth and increased jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Exchequer borrowing has been cut from almost 13 per cent of GNP in 1986 to 5.3 per cent in this year's budget.  All the indications are that we will, in fact, end the year below target for the third year in succession.  This improvement has resulted in ever-growing confidence in the economy, both at home and abroad, low inflation, low interest rates and better <Col N="1691" /> competitiveness.  These are vital ingredients for further progress.</P>
    <P>Even more important than the actual budgetary results &mdash; dramatic though these are &mdash; is the acceptance by the business and financial community that there will be no drift back to the bad old ways of excessive spending and borrowing. The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the <i>National Development Plan</i>, which together provide our strategy blueprint, make clear that borrowing will continue to be reduced.  There is, in fact, no alternative to doing so, given the huge costs of servicing the overhang of borrowing and debt which soak up so much of our resources and limit our room for manoeuvre.  In this context I might as well put on record that the national debt standing at £24.5 billion represents £7,000 for every man, woman and child in this country.  The servicing of that debt represents £40 a week out of every taxpayer's pocket for those people at work.</P>
    <P>A very significant component of Exchequer expenditure is, of course, public service pay.  Members of the House will be aware that there have been recent significant developments on the public service pay front.  I would like to refer briefly to them.</P>
    <P>In my Budget Statement I expressed concern about the build-up of special increases in the public service and the resultant burden that was facing the Exchequer both immediately and in the short term.  I announced my intention to invite the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to meet me to discuss the whole issue with a view to arriving at a mutually acceptable solution.</P>
    <P>The meeting between Congress and myself took place on 8 March and after that Department officials met with Congress representatives on 10 occasions. These discussions resulted in a draft package designed to meet the situation.</P>
    <P>The general effect of the package is that awards which have been around for some time and those which might come from claims that are well through the process will be paid on a phased basis over the period 1 July 1989 to 1 October <Col N="1692" /> 1990.  Other claims will fall to be implemented on a phased basis over the period May 1991 to October 1992.  The package also provides for a moratorium on the processing of further claims until 1991 and a commitment to co-operation in measures designed to enhance the efficiency and quality of the public services.</P>
    <P>From the Government's point of view the package has the advantage that it restores order to the very difficult situation that was evolving.  The effect is that the cost of these increases will now be spread over a number of years in a way which will facilitate the budgetary process in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>From the staff side point of view the element of certainty which has been restored to the implementation of increases arising from the negotiating machinery, albeit on a phased basis, will be of considerable benefit and should result in a further period of industrial relations stability in the public service. I am hopeful that the package will be endorsed by the unions also.</P>
    <P>As regards overall costs, I am confident that, under the package of measures negotiated, the 1989 provision for special pay increases will not be exceeded.  The cost in 1990 and later years will depend on the outcome of cases which are still under negotiation or awaiting adjudication. However, I expect that the cost of special pay increases in 1990 will be broadly in line with their cost in 1989 and that the cost of public service pay up to end 1993 will be within the parameters underpinning the Government's <i>National Development Plan.</i></P>
    <P>The economic fundamentals are good and the achievements of the past two years are being consolidated.  We are seeing an upswing in almost all the major indicators and the economy is set to grow rapidly this year.  The pattern of development looks set to be rather different from, and more satisfactory than, that experienced earlier this decade.  Whatever growth there was then came primarily from the external side, reflecting rapid growth in industrial exports.  Domestic demand was weak.  We are now <Col N="1693" /> seeing personal consumption, and investment in particular, growing strongly. These will provide the major impetus to economic progress in 1989.  More importantly, the rising trend of investment provides a solid foundation for further sustainable output growth in the years ahead.  Investment is the life blood of growth and jobs.</P>
    <P>Let us look briefly at the key indicators. Retail sales rose by more than 2 per cent last year.  Over January and February this year the volume of retail sales was about 8 per cent higher than in the comparable months of 1988.  New car registrations were up by 35 per cent on 1988.  I am confident that this year will see an expansion in the volume of personal consumption at least of the order I suggested at budget-time &mdash; 3 per cent &mdash; but probably more.</P>
    <P>At budget-time I felt that investment in plant and machinery would rise by 8 per cent.  The strength of imports of capital goods over recent months certainly suggests that this is attainable.  This view is supported by the CII/ESRI Business Survey which shows that industrial capacity is running at high levels.</P>
    <P>At the same time, an important turnaround is taking place in building and construction.  New private house starts in the first two months of 1989 were 26 per cent higher than last year.  Employment in the building industry has begun to turn around.  In the first quarter of 1989 it was 6 per cent above the comparable level a year ago.  As this year progresses, the first impact of the increased EC Structural Funds, for which I made provision in the budget, should have a further positive impact on building activity.</P>
    <P>The pick-up in domestic demand is showing itself in rising industrial output. Manufacturing output in January was 13 per cent higher than in January 1988. However, domestic demand, though important, cannot support the level of expansion of industrial output that we need.  Continuing solid export performance is the way to raise growth in output and to bring about the kind of employment increase that is required. That is why we must keep our unit costs <Col N="1694" /> moving down.  I am confident we can achieve another major expansion in industrial output this year, given recent developments in our competitive position and the outlook for demand in our export markets.</P>
    <P>On the trade front, the seasonally adjusted surplus of exports over imports for the first quarter was £612 million, up over £100 million on the same period last year.  Both exports and imports rose substantially.  The rise in exports more than offset import growth, leading to a net improvement in the trade balance.</P>
    <P>At this stage of the year, it seems another substantial trade surplus is on the cards.  Even allowing for higher profit repatriations by foreign firms here, we can look forward to a further balance of payments surplus &mdash; roughly the same size as last year's surplus in nominal terms.  Our balance of payments position thus continues to be in excellent shape despite the pick-up in domestic demand.</P>
    <P>Summing up, at the time of the budget I forecast that output growth this year could be of the order of 3½ per cent. Events since then suggest that this may be on the conservative side.  Indeed, a number of commentators believe that growth could reach 4 per cent this year.</P>
    <P>This kind of progress bodes well for job prospects and for our ability to reduce unemployment, which are the priority goals of the Government and influence everything we are doing.</P>
    <P>The initial evidence on jobs may not appear impressive &mdash; the increase of 6,000 in total employment which took place in the year to April 1988, as disclosed by the latest labour force survey. But this increase was significant.  It marked an end to a long period of declining employment, a pattern which must have seemed almost irreversible at times. It was achieved, too, in a period of savings in public expenditure, and demonstrated that correcting the imbalance in the public finances is consistent with increasing employment.  While we must await the next labour force survey for statistical backing, there is no disagreement among commentators and economists that the pace of employment <Col N="1695" /> growth has speeded up since April 1988 &mdash; and that the outlook is for a rapid pace of expansion over the immediate future. For the present year I am confident that the budget forecast of an increase of 16,000 in non-agricultural employment will be achieved.</P>
    <P>Although other factors will have contributed, the downward trend in unemployment also reflects the success of the Government's employment policies.  The seasonally adjusted live register peaked as far back as May 1987.  The most recent figures show a fall of 7,600 in the month to end-April 1989.  This was the biggest fall for any month since April 1971 and brought the seasonally adjusted live register total to its lowest point for three years.  We anticipate that this downward trend will continue and this year the average live register is expected to fall to 232,000 compared with over 241,000 last year.</P>
    <P>We have come a long way in a little over two years, but we have much further to go.  The Government remain firmly committed to the policies of the <i>Pro-gramme for National Recovery</i>.  The National Development Plan, as I have indicated, complements and builds on that programme.</P>
    <P>The plan charts the course to be taken in gearing up the economic infrastructure and the productive capacity of the economy with the increased assistance of the Community' Structural Funds.  The development programmes set out in the plan will give a stimulus to the economy in the immediate years ahead but their ultimate, and more significant, contribution lies in the longer term improvement they will make to the ability of the economy to compete and grow and produce jobs.</P>
    <P>The EC provision of increased Structural Funds to help strengthen the economy is one of three vital elements underpinning our potential for progress. Pursuit by Government of the policies I have outlined, in order to provide a stable, growth-oriented policy framework, is a second.  There is a third key <Col N="1696" /> ingredient on which the long-term performance of our economy depends.  This is the commitment of all, whether in industry, agriculture, the trade unions or elsewhere, to actions which will ensure a growing ability to compete on international markets and to maintain &mdash; if not recapture &mdash; market share here at home.</P>
    <P>In this context I want to refer briefly to some issues which have been the subject of considerable comment recently.</P>
    <P>In relation to inflation, there have been a number of unfavourable external developments over recent months.  The price of oil has risen sharply, in part because of production restrictions brought about by unfortunate accidents in different parts of the world; also the dollar has strengthened in recent months against most world currencies; most significantly, world inflation generally has increased somewhat.  We live in a small open economy.  We cannot isolate ourselves from these global developments. What matters most is not the rate of inflation itself, but, rather our performance relative to our trading partners. Despite some increase, it is worth stating again that the latest inflation figure here, 3.3 per cent in the year to mid-February, is low by the standards of other countries and especially by comparison with the UK, where price increases, on the most recent figures, are running little short of 8 per cent.  We must ensure that we retain our relative position as a low inflation economy, in which category we are now grouped with some of the strongest economies in Europe.  This requires that we do not add to imported inflation by unwarranted domestic cost increases.</P>
    <P>There has been much comment also about interest rates and credit.  As Senators will be aware, the Central Bank has statutory responsibility for interest rates.  Under the Central Bank's arrangements, the Associated Banks recently increased their rates.  This increase reflected the recent increases in international interest rates.</P>
    <P>The increase here must be viewed against a background that our interest rates have dropped dramatically from <Col N="1697" /> their level of early 1987.  Even after the recent increase, Irish interest rates remain at a relatively low level, both in comparison with their level in nearly 1987 and with the level of rates in our most important trading partner, the UK.  For instance, the prime lending rate of our Associated Banks is still a full 5 percentrage points below the corresponding rate in the UK.  The Government will continue with their policy of ensuring that the domestic environment permits rates to be kept at the lowest possible level consistent with the international situation and with our membership of the EMS.</P>
    <P>It was only to be expected that the growth in consumer spending would give rise to some increase in the underlying rate of growth of personal credit.  The important point is that this increase in growth should not be excessive and should not begin to fuel inflation.  The Government's and the Central Bank's expectation would be that, following recent meetings with the main credit agencies &mdash; the banks and the building societies &mdash; those agencies would exercise the required prudence in their lending operations.  Also, the interest rate increase should assist in ensuring that moderation prevails.  The evidence available so far on personal sector credit growth does not indicate a need for further remedial action, but the Government and the Central Bank will continue to monitor the situation closely.</P>
    <P>Overall I remain very confident about the economy for this year and for the medium-term.  We have set the right framework.  Our partnership with Europe is working, both to provide wider markets and to assist us in developing our economy so that we can better tackle those markets, and the response of all sectors, which has been so important to the resumption of economic progress over the past two years, augurs well for future advance.</P>
    <P>Despite the constraints imposed by the overriding need to put the public finances in order, the Government have given high priority to tax reform.  The high rates of personal taxation in this country have reflected the sins of the past.  They are <Col N="1698" /> the inescapable mirror image of excessive spending and borrowing.  The very real danger existed in 1986 that, far from coming down, income tax rates would have to go still higher as the public finances careered out of control.  High income tax rates are the enemy of personal incentive and motivation and of job creation and they lead to the emigration of many skilled young people.</P>
    <P>The Government have made a resolute start in tackling this problem over the past two years.  Our approach, which is reflected in the Bill now before the House, has been: to devote as much resources as possible to relieving the burden of personal taxation; for this purpose, to broaden the tax base by tightening up on collection and enforcement and cutting back on certain reliefs and incentives, while introducing new incentives to help develop certain sectors; to overhaul the system of corporation tax so as to make it more conducive to job creation; and generally to simplify the tax system, in particular by the progressive extension of self-assessment.  Our aim is to get a simpler and fairer system in which everybody will pay a fair share of tax and where there will be effective sanctions against tax evasion and avoidance.</P>
    <P>Considerable progress has been made in the past two years in reducing the burden of personal taxation.  Following the changes in the present Bill, the Government will have provided more than £700 million of income tax relief on a cumulative basis over the period of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  This compares with the programme commitment of £225 million.  We have, in short, given more than three times the amount we undertook to provide in the programme.</P>
    <P>Despite the fact that at long last we have started to reduce the actual rates of tax, I am in no sense complacent.  The burden is still far too high for so many people.  We are determined to make further progress in reducing income tax as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>EC developments will also influence the shape of our tax system in the future. The proposals for harmonisation of <Col N="1699" /> indirect taxes have been the subject of much discussion in the Community. These proposals raised major problems for nearly all member States, Ireland included.  The proposals have been undergoing a rethink in the Commission and the clear indications are that revised proposals will be forthcoming shortly. We have taken a constructive role in the discussions, since we attach such importance to the success of the internal market project.  We have had, necessarily, to draw attention to the budgetary implications of the proposals and their potential impact on our efforts to reduce our direct taxes burden, if we had to suffer a huge loss of revenue.</P>
    <P>The EC is also discussing some aspects of taxes on savings and of corporation tax but the implications of these proposals are less clear at present.</P>
    <P>I would now like to turn to the approach underlying individual sections of the Bill and to draw the attention of the House to the more significant items.</P>
    <P>As is the usual practice, the early sections of the Bill make provision for the income tax reliefs announced in the budget.  Section 1 increases the income levels at which tax liability commences. The general tax exemption limit is being increased from £2,750 to £3,000 for a single person and from £5,500 to £6,000 for a married couple.  The age exemption limits are also increased, to £3,400 for single persons aged 65 years or over and £4,000 for single persons aged 75 years or over.  Qualifying married couples will of course, have their age exemption limits increased to double these amounts.</P>
    <P>The section also augments these basic exemption limits by an addition of £200 for each dependent child.  This addition is a new feature of our income tax code and is targeted at low-income families. Its impact can be dramatic and will mean, to take just one example, that a married couple with three children, who are taxed under PAYE on one income of £6,600 per annum, will now be entirely exempt from income tax and thus save up to £495 on their 1988-89 tax bill.</P>
    <P>Section 2 provides for the changes in <Col N="1700" /> income tax rates and bands.  The top rate of tax is being reduced to 56 per cent and the standard rate to 32 per cent.  This deduction in the standard rate, which is the first for over 20 years, also applies to the deposit interest retention tax and to the withholding tax on professional fees. The income tax bands are also being widened: the 48 per cent band is being extended to £3,100 for a single person and £6,200 for a married couple, while the standard rate band is being extended to £6,100 for a single person and £12,200 for a married couple.</P>
    <P>Sections 7 and 8 deal with the restrictions on life assurance and mortgage interest relief which I announced in the budget.  Life assurance relief is being confined to 80 per cent of its previous levels, while the percentage of mortgage interest within the relevant ceilings which qualify for relief is being reduced to 80 per cent from 90 per cent, at which it has stood since 1987.  The yield from these measures is £16.8 million in 1989 and £27.9 million in a full year.  This has met a small part of the gross cost of the major package of personal reliefs announced in the budget.</P>
    <P>I want to refer now to two new provisions which I know will be of particular interest to this House.  Section 4 provides for the introduction of a special income tax relief to encourage people to come and live in inner city areas and renovate houses there that are historically or architecturally significant.</P>
    <P>Section 19 of the Finance Act, 1982, already allows relief for expenditure on the maintenance, repair, etc. of heritage houses provided public access is allowed on at least 30 days per year.  In addition, section 44 of the Finance Act, 1986 provides for relief, spread over ten years, on half the net cost of construction or refurbishment of grant-sized houses in the designated inner-city areas.</P>
    <P>During the Finance Bill debate in this House last year, it was argued very strongly by Senator Norris and others that, while these existing reliefs were valuable incentives within their particular contexts, they were not available to those individuals who sought to maintain the <Col N="1701" /> architectural heritage and social fabric of our cities by purchasing and restoring Georgian and other large old houses and making them their own homes.</P>
    <P>The new relief combines many of the features of section 19 of the Finance Act 1982 &mdash; such as the determination by the Office of Public Works of scientific, historical, architectural, or aesthetic merit &mdash; and of section 44 of the Finance Act 1986 &mdash; in that the Houses will have to be in a designated area and relief will be confined to 50 per cent of the cost of repairs.  However, there will be no public access requirement and the upper size limit set by section 44 will not apply.  In order to meet the high initial repair bills likely to be faced by claimants under the new schemes, the ten year-spread of relief which operates under section 44 is reduced, with half of the allowable relief claimable in the first year and the balance over the following five years.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Finance Act, 1969 provides for an income tax exemption for certain earnings of creative writers, composers and artists.  To qualify for the relief, claimants seek a determination from the Revenue Commissioners that their work is original and creative, and has cultural or artistic merit.  However, there is no provision in section 2 for appeal against the refusal of the Revenue Commissioners to make the necessary determination.</P>
    <P>Section 5 seeks to meet that criticism by making provision for an appeal mechanism in cases where the Commissioners fail to make a determination within six months of the claimant applying for the relief.  Such appeals must be lodged within 30 days of the expiry of the six-month period allowed for Revenue's consideration of the case, and the claimant must have co-operated with the Commissioners by providing samples of his or her work, or such other evidence to back up the claim as may have been requested by Revenue.</P>
    <P>Section 9 makes significant changes in the business expansion scheme.  The original intention of this scheme was to encourage the provision of equity capital for high-risk companies which offered the <Col N="1702" /> prospect of substantial gains to the economy in terms of output and jobs.  In return for the provision of risk capital to these companies the general body of taxpayers made available an attractive relief for investors.</P>
    <P>Recent well-publicised developments in the use of the scheme had been diverting it away from this very desirable objective. The Government were left with no alternative but to act to prevent these abuses.  We were determined to do so, however, in a way that would not interfere with BES funding for deserving projects. The whole point of section 9 is, in fact, precisely to ensure that funds will be targeted as originally envisaged and that the available funds will not be earmarked for safe projects for which BES was not intended.</P>
    <P>Under the section the new measures will apply in respect of shares issued on or after 12 April 1989, which was the date of publication of the Finance Bill. The section introduces five measures, as follows: it provides that, where BES money is being used for the purchase of a ship, that ship must represent a beneficial addition to the Irish shipping register; it imposes a limit of £2.5 million on the amount of money a company or group of companies can raise under the scheme; it excludes from the scheme international leasing and related financial services; it also excludes self-catering accommodation in the city or county of Dublin and the urban areas of Cork, Waterford, Limerick and Galway; and, finally, it provides that BES relief will not be available on shares in relation to which options for guarantees are held which provide for sale at other than market value at the end of the five-year period for which shares must be retained under the scheme.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the option for a trader to have annual accounting for PAYE/PRSI, as announced in the budget, has been given effect through regulations already made by the Revenue Commissioners on 23 March last under existing legislation.  The change in relation to VAT is provided for in section 58 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1703" /> I want to stress that the purpose of the annual accounting facility is to ease the administrative burden on small traders and to release resources in the Office of the Collector General for other purposes. As a further measure to ease the compliance burden on small traders, section 55 provides for an increase in the VAT registration thresholds from £12,000 to £15,000 in the case of traders providing services and from £25,000 to £32,000 in the case of traders supplying goods.  It is some years since these limits were last adjusted and it is now timely to increase them so as to take smaller traders out of the VAT net.</P>
    <P>Sections 18 and 19 introduce new taxation arrangements for unit trusts and similar investment funds.  As a result of the EC directive on undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities, fund management represents an area of great opportunity for this country, since funds coming within the scope of the directive can be freely marketed out of Ireland to the residents of other EC member states.  This opportunity, and the job creation potential which goes with it, will be focused in the International Financial Services Centre in the Custom House Docks area.</P>
    <P>Section 18 introduces a new tax regime for funds locating in the centre so as bring our tax treatment into line with the position in certain other countries competing for the business.  In short, the funds will not be subject to taxation on their income or capital gains provided that they are under management by a company in the centre, are established for the benefit exclusively of persons resident outside the State and are subject to the new regulatory regime for such funds which has now been put in place by my colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, on foot of the UCITS Directive. The same tax arrangements are being made for funds which locate in the Shannon Airport zone.</P>
    <P>Section 18 also deals with funds outside the financial centre and the Shannon zone which are subject to the new regulatory regime.  Such funds similarly will not now <Col N="1704" /> be liable to tax in their own right.  However, the Irish-resident unit holders in the fund will be taxed on the income and the gains and a withholding tax will apply in order to facilitate collection of this tax. This revised tax treatment will be broadly consistent with the tax treatment of funds in other EC countries.</P>
    <P>The changes proposed in section 18 will help Irish funds to maintain a competitive position <i>vis-à-vis</i> foreign funds selling into the Irish market.  This is an important consideration since, as a result of the EC directive and of progress in liberalising exchange controls on Irish residents, funds can be marketed to Irish residents, from other EC countries just as funds can now be marketed out of Ireland to the residents of all EC member states.  I will be keeping the question of the competitive position of Irish funds under close scrutiny in the coming months.</P>
    <P>Section 21 introduces a number of measures to restrict the cost to the Exchequer of domestic-sourced section 84 loans.  This cost has gone up considerably in recent years.  The main reasons for this escalation in cost are the 60 per cent increase in the volume of these loans since February 1986 and the development of what are known as high-coupon section 84 loans.  These new style loans are taken out in high-interest rate foreign currencies and are much more costly to the Exchequer than section 84 loans taken out in Irish pounds.</P>
    <P>The measures in section 21 curtail the Exchequer cost by imposing restrictions on the categories of borrowers, on the total volume of the loans and on the number of lenders.</P>
    <P>New rules were introduced last year for the distribution by companies of dividends from different types of profits for tax purposes.  Following discussions with a number of representative bodies and companies a number of amendments are now being made to these rules, as provided in sections 24 and 25.  The main change is that, instead of being confined in the first instance to the mix of profits of the immediately preceding year, a company can now pay dividends out of the mix of profits of any one or more <Col N="1705" /> previous year in the past nine years. Where such profits no longer exist, the company can go back earlier than nine years.  This change gives companies much more flexibility in regard to dividend distribution.</P>
    <P>While we are cutting back in the Bill on a number of incentives, to which I have already referred, we are taking new incentive measures to help build up certain sectors.</P>
    <P>The previous capital allowance tax relief for toll roads expired on 31 March 1989 and is being replaced, in section 17, by a significantly improved incentive measure.  This new provision will be available countrywide for a period of three years and will encourage the private sector to get involved in major investment in toll road development.</P>
    <P>Section 22 extends the categories of computer services which qualify for the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax.  This extension is being introduced in response to recent developments in the computer industry, which is a very important sector of the economy.</P>
    <P>Section 23 amends section 39a of the Finance Act, 1980, to give effect to the recent decision of the EC Commission agreeing to the removal of the 50-jobs ceiling for Shannon non-manufacturing companies wishing to qualify for the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax.</P>
    <P>Section 28 amends the existing provisions giving relief for corporate investment in films.  The current limit on tax-relieved investment of £100,000 each year for three years is being replaced with a new limit of £600,000 which can be availed of in either of two ways; an investor company will have the option of putting £600,000 in one year into a single film production, or investing up to £200,000 each year for up to three years in one or more film projects.</P>
    <P>Section 30 extends for a further three years the special rate of capital gains tax which applies in respect of certain shares including those dealt with on the Smaller Companies Market of the Stock Exchange.</P>
    <P>Section 34 to 52 provide for the confirmation of the budget day increases in <Col N="1706" /> excise duties and for a number of other measures in the area of customs and excise.  Excise licences are being rationalised and updated, generally in line with inflation, relief of duty is being provided in respect of wine and cider used in the production of certain beverages; there are also provisions to terminate the practice of tax-free betting and to introduce a ten-year driving licence at a charge of £20.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill covers VAT.  The main changes relate to the measures announced on budget day and provide for: an increase in VAT rate on livestock from 1.4 to 2 per cent; an identical increase in the farmers' flat-rate VAT refund; the VAT element of the annual accounting option which I referred to earlier; that is the small traders one, where instead of making monthly or bimonthly returns they only have to make one in the year; the reduction from 25 to 10 per cent in the rate on works of art.  I am also extending this provision to cover literary manuscripts and certain other works of craftmanship over 100 years old. The precise extent of this latter concession will be set out in the regulations.</P>
    <P>In addition to the foregoing there are a number of other measures.  Section 54 restores a position that applied in VAT law until a recent High Court judgment. Under the section legal services supplied in insurance-related court cases will be regarded as being supplied to the policyholders who, being VAT-registered in most instances, can recover the VAT charged on them.</P>
    <P>The change in section 56A is also necessitated by a court decision.  Last year the 5 per cent rate of VAT was applied to electricity supplies.  In a case involving an appeal against a Revenue VAT estimate, a Circuit Court judge decided that the activities of a cable television company constitute the supply of electricity and if no legislative action were taken the result would be that the supply of cable TV would be liable at the 5 per cent rate of tax rather than the standard rate of 25 per cent.  As this is totally contrary to the intention underlying the law, and as a considerable loss <Col N="1707" /> of tax over time would result from the court decision, I am specifically excluding the supply of communications signals from the 5 per cent.</P>
    <P>Sections 61 to 63 provide for a change in the VAT treatment of optical services. Since the inception of the VAT system in 1972 the professional services of opticians, including supplies of spectacles and lenses by them, have been exempt from the tax.  In 1987 the European Court of Justice decided that this was a misapplication of EC VAT law and that, while the professional service of eyesight testing could be exempt, the supply of goods in the course of the service must be liable to VAT.  As the court's ruling is binding, I am levying the 10 per cent VAT rate on spectacles and contact lenses.  I am making arrangements that low vision aids used by the partially sighted will be relieved from VAT. Despite the application of tax to spectacles, there should be no corresponding increase in their price as opticians will in future be able to recover input VAT on their business purchases.  The change will be postponed until 1 November to allow opticians time to make the necessary arrangements.</P>
    <P>In response to representations from Threshold, and following the Dáil debate on Committee Stage, I have decided to remove the stamp duty charge on leases of residential property where the annual rent payable under such leases does not exceed £6,000 per annum.  The point had been made that the existing rates of duty militate against longer leases and greater security of tenure.  Section 72 of the Bill accordingly provides that leases of residential property for a term not exceeding 35 years and at an annual rent not exceeding £6,000 per annum will be exempt from stamp duty.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Bill deals with capital acquisitions tax.  It provides for the new arrangements for self-assessment.  Since the middle of 1987 the Revenue Commissioners have operated a pilot scheme for the voluntary self-assessment of this tax.  This pilot scheme has been a success <Col N="1708" /> due in no small measure to the co-operation and assistance of the legal profession. The Government welcome this kind of co-operation which is in the interests of all concerned, taxpayers and practitioners included.  As a result, self-assessment can now be put on a statutory basis and this represents a further development of tax administration.</P>
    <P>If a self-assessment system is to work properly it is critical that taxpayers disclose fully the assets which are subject to tax and compute their liabilities correctly. The Bill, therefore, provides for increased penalties and powers of enforcement.  One innovation is the introduction of a surcharge for the significant undervaluation of property. Without a provision of this type, systematic undervaluation of property could become a serious problem and could diminish the benefits of self-assessment.  It has, however, been pointed out that in the case of certain types of property &mdash; such as, for example, works of art &mdash; a valuation made in good faith could turn out to be very wide of the mark.  In such a case the surcharge would be due in law notwithstanding the fact that the person submitting the valuation had acted in good faith.  The Revenue Commissioners could, of course, waive the surcharge in such cases.  Nevertheless, in response to points raised in the Dáil, the Government have decided to introduce a statutory right of appeal against the surcharge in circumstances such as those I have just mentioned and this is incorporated in section 79 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The present Bill contains a number of provisions to counter the avoidance of tax.  Let me say at the outset that there is nothing new about that.  Every Finance Bill has introduced a number of specific anti-avoidance measures aimed at particular abuses.  The specific measures in this year's Bill are in sections 86 to 90. The problem about specific measures is that, by definition, they can be introduced only after a particular loophole or abuse has come to light.  In the meantime there may be a substantial loss of revenue to the detriment of the general body of taxpayers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1709" /> This brings me to the novel element of this year's Bill &mdash; the general anti-avoidance provision contained in section 86.  This provision is analogous to similar provisions in other countries who have reached a similar conclusion to ours: that such a provision is needed to protect the interests of the Exchequer and the general body of taxpayers.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the new general provision is to enable the Revenue Commissioners to counteract certain transactions which have little or no commercial reality but are entered into primarily for tax avoidance purposes.  The intention is to enable the Revenue Commissioners, subject to specified procedures and safeguards for taxpayers, to disallow the tax benefits of such transactions.</P>
    <P>Before any action can be taken by them to disallow a benefit, the Revenue must first of all form an opinion that a transaction is a tax avoidance transaction. Having formed such an opinion, they must then notify the taxpayer concerned who has 30 days in which to contest it by appealing to the Appeals Commissioners. There is provision too for the rehearing of an appeal by the Circuit Court and the stating of a case for the High Court on a point of law.</P>
    <P>There is, therefore, no question of giving an unfettered general power to the Revenue Commissioners.  At the end of the day, an appeal to the courts is available and, in the case of a dispute, it will be the judgment of the courts and not the opinion of tax officials which will finally determine the outcome.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil concern was expressed about the grounds for appeal under the general anti-avoidance provision.  In particular there was concern that an impossible burden of proof was being placed on taxpayers.  While that was not the case, in the spirit of reassuring taxpayers the approach to appealing against an opinion formed under the section has been changed from one of &ldquo;reasonableness&rdquo; to one of &ldquo;correctness&rdquo;.  The Appeal Commissioners and the courts will uphold an opinion of the Revenue Commissioners only if they consider it to be correct and <Col N="1710" /> they can look at all the facts of the case in arriving at their decision.</P>
    <P>Much has been made about the alleged uncertainty for business and investment in the anti-avoidance provisions.  Some of this is hard to take coming as it does from those who were involved in the very lucrative tax avoidance industry.  I would like to assure Senators that genuine business transactions, even if carried out in a tax efficient manner, have nothing to fear from the new legislation.  There is no need for any uncertainty in the mind of the genuine businessman or the person making legitimate use of a tax relief provided by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Apart from the general safeguards to which I have referred, a specific limiting provision on the actions of the Revenue Commissioners has been inserted in subsection (3) of section 86.  This is designed to give comfort to the genuine taxpayer and to protect the efficacy of tax incentives and reliefs provided by the Oireachtas for the benefit of businesses and private individuals.  In relation to incentive reliefs, I should say too that the Revenue Commissioners already provide an advance opinion service to reassure investors that they will qualify for the reliefs.</P>
    <P>There are, therefore, no grounds for the assertion that the general provision will create uncertainties for genuine business, personal or family transactions.  The only transactions that are affected are those that set out purely and simply to engage in artificial tax avoidance.  In other words, so long as a transaction is arranged primarily for a trading, professional, vocational, domestic, personal or any other purpose which is not the avoidance of tax, it will not be affected by the new provision.</P>
    <P>I want to make it absolutely clear that the fact that a transaction is carried out in a tax efficient manner does not bring it within the scope of the new provision. The legislation does not make tax efficiency illegal, whether for business or family purposes.  The target of the provision is, as I have said, those types of artificial transactions that are undertaken primarily for tax avoidance purposes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1711" /> The general anti-avoidance provision will apply to transactions carried out on or after budget day, when I indicated that new legislation was proposed.  It will apply to transactions completed before budget day only where the tax which it is sought to avoid arises as a result of activities which took place wholly after budget day.  To make this abundantly clear, I introduced an amendment to the general provision, which was being interpreted more widely in a retrospective sense, in the course of Committee Stage in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Section 92 provides for a revised scheme of VAT and excise remissions or refunds to disabled people, as drivers and as passengers.  The existing scheme, based on section 43 of the Finance Act, 1968, has proved to be unsatisfactory in a number of respects, not least in that the present medical criterion, that a person must be &ldquo;wholly or almost wholly without the use of each of his legs&rdquo; has excluded otherwise deserving cases.  From an administrative point of view, there is also a need to bring together the different elements of the existing arrangements so that uniform and more equitable conditions apply.</P>
    <P>The provision I have introduced in the Bill seeks to make good these deficiencies. It would enable the Minister for Finance to make regulations for remissions of road tax, refunds of VAT and excise duty on vehicles, and refund of excise duty on petrol or diesel.  The main criterion of disability will be that a person must be &ldquo;severely and permanently&rdquo; disabled, with the result that he or she would be unable to drive a car unless it is specially constructed or adapted.  The scheme will also apply to disabled persons as passengers, where significant car adaptation is needed.  It would be my intention to specify, as necessary, in more detail what medical conditions might be covered by this.  This would be done in the regulations.  Let me stress, however, that this definition is intended to cover a wider range of disability than that in use at present.  The whole point is to broaden eligibility to cover cases at present <Col N="1712" /> excluded.  For example, I envisage that persons of small stature who have mobility problems will be included, as will amputees of foot or leg and amputees of both hands.</P>
    <P>In addition to this important broadening of the scope of eligibility, it is proposed that in future all medical certification will be provided by the director of community care of the health board in whose area the applicant normally resides.  There will be provision for appeal against a refusal to allow eligibility. The regulations will also specify a number of controls and limits, the chief of which will relate to the maximum size of vehicle to be assisted &mdash; 2,000 c.c. &mdash; and to the maximum total amount of VAT and excise duty to be refunded: £7,500 in respect of a car and this will be indexed to the increase in car prices.</P>
    <P>Finally, let me say to all those who are at present in receipt of a remission or refund of tax under the existing scheme that they will not have to undergo any further process of medical certification to retain eligibility for the particular form of tax refund they enjoy at present.</P>
    <P>These are the main provisions in the Bill to which I wished to draw attention. We will have an opportunity to discuss them in more detail in Committee.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KatherineBulbulia" hpid="Mrs. Bulbulia Mrs. Bulbulia">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>May I at the outset welcome the Minister to the House.  It is his first time to come here with this portfolio and I look forward to a useful debate on the Finance Bill.  Indeed, I wish the Minister well for his tenure of office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is doing well.  His brief is important, not alone for the Government and his party, but obviously it is important for every man, woman and child in this country that the Minister is successful in what he does.  I would like to comment on the fact that he has shown a broad-minded generosity of spirit in his acceptance of amendments in another place.  It is in that spirit of co-operation that we on the Fine Gael side make our contribution to the debate.  Of course, we have some reservations and I will express <Col N="1713" /> those during the course of my contribution.</P>
    <P>As the Minister has said and as other contributors will mention, the Finance Bill is, of course, the legislative measure which brings into effect the budgetary provisions announced last January.  It is, in fact, the third Finance Bill of the present Administration.  I believe it is unremarkable and disappointing legislation. I do not say this in a spirit of mere Opposition rhetoric.  It was, in fact, the general reaction which greeted the publication of the Finance Bill earlier in the year.  There is an economic or political consensus on fiscal matters and, as a result, a favourable economic climate has been engendered.  It is my view that the Minister failed utterly to exploit this to the potential which it has to benefit all the citizens in the State.</P>
    <P>Neither in the budget nor in the Finance Bill is there any particular evidence of thinking or planning for economic growth or job creation.  The Minister in his speech even referred to a certain feeling of disappointment at the rate of job creation, and he is right to feel disappointed. Just yesterday in Waterford I happened to be involved in canvassing for the European election and as such had an opportunity to talk with a number of people.  Over and over again the one message coming home was: what is the Government doing about jobs?  There is tremendous lack of satisfaction at the performance of Government on that score.  The budget and the Finance Bill reflect a certain failure in this area.  As I see it, containment and relative inaction are the name of the game.</P>
    <P>I also want to know what has the budget and the Finance Bill got to say to the one million people who live below the poverty line in our country.  To me it is incredible that the Minister would speak for virtually 45 minutes, make a major financial speech, and the word &ldquo;poverty&rdquo; does not even arise in the context of what he has to say.  What does this Finance Bill say to the 240,000 people unemployed in the country?  Does it offer hope?  Does it offer prospects to the approximately 100,000 people who have <Col N="1714" /> emigrated either voluntarily or involuntarily? The answer, I am afraid, is a resounding &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  It says nothing to these people.</P>
    <P>Why has this come about?  This minority Government came into office having perpetrated one of the greatest political deceptions that I or anyone else can remember.  They then proceeded to hijack the economic policy of another party and with the ultra zeal of the convert they introduced a series of cuts and retrenchments without any regard for coherence, consistency or social planning. I am afraid that kind of mindless, unthinking, fiscal policy is starting to become unstuck right around the country.  Even loyal Fianna Fáil backbenchers, such as, for example, Councillor Jackie Healy-Rea, are starting to stand up and be counted and to say, &ldquo;Up with this we will not put.  It is not good enough&rdquo;.  I think the message is being brought home to the Government that all is not well and that the fiscal policy as such is unthinking and rigid and is not the product of the Government's own thinking in the area.</P>
    <P>On the credit side the results of the policies have, at the very least, ensured that the basics of fiscal policy have shown some improvement.  By that I mean a stabilisation of the debt to GNP ratio. But they have also had extremely negative and downright damaging effects on the poor, the ill, the young and the longterm unemployed.  That is because, in my view and in the view of my party, Fianna Fáil &mdash; the minority party in power &mdash; stand guilty of the crime of plagiarism, the theft of another's ideas which are given out as one's own.  This can never be right.  It always results badly because behind the stolen ideas there is, as I have illustrated, no thought, no evolution of social policy, no checks and balances and no feeling for people &mdash; and feeling for people is the very essence of politics. That is why the Government are not meeting with the success they would wish. That is why problems are arising on so many fronts.  It gives me no pleasure to stand in this House to say that, but I would be failing in my duty as a public <Col N="1715" /> representative if I did not bring home to the Minister the failure aspect of the policy in addition to commending some of the useful measures which have been introduced in this Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>Our problems in this country have been identified indeed to the point of a certain stultifying boredom.  There cannot be anybody in the country who cannot recite at least part of the dreary litany of problems which we have.  What should accompany this is a straightforward, clear and attainable list of measures which will help us to overcome our difficulties.  The Minister has made reference in his speech to tax reform but, as we in Fine Gael see it, this budget and Finance Bill were not really about tax reform.  What is on offer in this legislation is really miniscule and it falls far short of what is required.</P>
    <P>This morning driving from Waterford I heard an interesting debate conducted on the abolition of rates between Miriam Hederman-O'Brien, who headed the Commission on Taxation, and a former Member of this House and indeed of the other House, Professor Martin O'Donoghue. I thought to myself, while listening to the arguments being tossed back and forth: are we forever going to have to listen to this kind of debate or is a Government operating in an ideal situation with a strong consensus on the economic front ever going to be in a position to take up the issue of tax reform and introduce meaningful changes which will give people a feeling that what is happening in this country in the tax area is fair, just and equitable?  I would like to stress that by tax reform I am not talking about tax cuts.  That is why we in Fine Gael have come forward and have said to the Government; can we extend the economic consensus to include tax reform?</P>
    <P>We recognise that whatever choices are necessary to bring in tax reform are painful political choices, extremely difficult choices, and they can probably only be made on the basis of an extremely strong Government with a huge majority and who have nerves of steel, or on the basis of a consensus-type approach which <Col N="1716" /> is on offer and which to date has sadly been spurned.  There is a certain arrogance which is manifest in this refusal to accept what is a very generous offer, a high-minded offer which is for the good of the country and the people.  I find it disappointing in the extreme that this offer has not been taken up.  It is a unique opportunity offered to a minority Administration to commence reform in an area that is crying out for attention.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked about a phased programme of tax reform.  He should let us into the secret.  What is the programme? Is the aim still to put two-thirds of taxpayers on the standard rate of income tax?  The five reports of the Commission on Taxation are becoming archival material.  They continue to gather dust and they fail to be reflected in Government policy.  The public will not be disturbed by any radical innovative moves from this Administration.  All they are doing is tinkering with the margins, indulging in a few largely cosmetic tricks and avoiding substantive, meaningful change for which people are crying out.</P>
    <P>As I have already said, I want to make it abundantly clear that what I am talking about is tax reform and not cuts in taxation. I am talking about a root and branch examination of the entire system, a listing of objectives in order of priority and a clear charting of the routes to be taken in attaining the clearly enunciated objectives.  Reductions of tax bands, which we have seen in this legislation, are largely a minor affair.  That kind of reform merely relates to gross pay or salary.  Taxation, as we very well know, is omnipresent.  The maxim, &ldquo;If it moves, tax it,&rdquo; seems to rule OK and that is an extremely depressing reality.  That reality of gross and excessive taxation is driving people away from this country in droves and it is extremely dispiriting.  The lack of governmental drive and initiative in this area merely adds to the gloom.  Many of the people who have emigrated are not merely the young and unemployed but also those who cannot stomach any longer an appalling tax regime. Reductions in tax rates and expansion of bands is for many people too little, too <Col N="1717" /> late.  We cannot wait until the public finances are brought into order.  We have to move on several fronts simultaneously.</P>
    <P>Emigration is draining so much away from our country.  Some of the best people are leaving and entire rural areas are denuded of their young.  Yet, it is quite extraordinary to think that a Minister for Finance would come into this House and omit to make reference to emigration in the context of his Second Stage presentation of the Finance Bill.  It is no wonder he did not refer to it because it is nothing to be proud of.  It is shameful and negative.  It is dragging us down, it is weakening, it is demoralising and it is utterly disappointing that it does not even rate a sentence, a word of recognition, in the context of what has been a major Government speech.  No amount of glossing over this can conceal it.  In the context of 1992 and the increased opportunities and challenges, creeping in is a philosophy which indicates that it is good for our young people to go to Europe and it is not such a bad thing if they even go further afield.  That is true to some extent if they choose to do so, but so many of them do so in an involuntary capacity. That must be recognised and measures must be put in place to deal with it.</P>
    <P>This Finance Bill which should be a major economic and social instrument does nothing to address either poverty or emigration.  I believe the Government view it as a partial solution to our problems and content themselves with platitudinous statements and the occasional allocation of funding to emigrant organisations who indeed do Trojan work in often picking up the pieces of the young lives which have been blighted and traumatised by ill-prepared and unthinking moves away from Ireland.</P>
    <P>I would like to comment on the business expansion scheme which the Minister has referred to.  Section 7 of the Bill contains amendments to the existing scheme of relief for investment in corporate trades.  Incidentally, I would like to pay tribute to the Minister for ensuring that we got an updated explanatory memorandum.  It is something I have raised over and over again with the <Col N="1718" /> former Minister, Mr. MacSharry, and we finally got it for the first time last year. From the Minister's contribution, I see how he, too, will find it as a useful guide when we come to deal with Committee Stage because some sections, by dint of repetition, have a certain number attached to them and it is very difficult to transpose thinking in relation to that.  I am grateful for it and hope to use it to good effect.</P>
    <P>The changes in relation to the business expansion scheme are generally welcome because they are designed to eliminate some of the abuses of that scheme which had been roundly condemned and highlighted, in particular by my Fine Gael colleague, Deputy John Bruton, who was eloquent on the issue.  I am very pleased indeed that the so-called holiday homes in urban areas will no longer qualify for tax relief under the business expansion scheme.  In the past the purchase of these houses was motivated solely as a tax avoidance measure and had no commercial or job creation reality.  People knew that was the case and saw it to be so.  It was in many instances a scam and something that was unwelcome and I am very pleased indeed that it has been nipped in the bud.  There were serious abuses in this area and I am pleased the Minister responded to the strong criticisms of people like Deputy John Bruton and others who consistently drew attention to what was happening.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that there is a proposal to disqualify from tax relief financial transactions which are solely for the purpose of tax avoidance.  Tax shelters should not be an option in our economic plans because they are not just or fair. One of the contributors in the Dáil debate made a very racy reference to the fact that these types of schemes were a sort of fiscal cocaine to a certain economic glitterati which I thought was an amusing reference but a very accurate one, to what was happening and an indication of how some people seized on that kind of loophole to benefit themselves in no uncertain manner.</P>
    <P>I insist on saying a few words about something the Minister omitted to talk <Col N="1719" /> about.  I hope when he is concluding Second Stage he will be able to explain why he was able to come in and present a Finance Bill without referring to the people who are poor and povertystricken. Over one-third of Irish people live in poverty &mdash; that is not my figure.  I know it has been disputed by many people who do not wish to believe it is so.  The Minister, I know, is a &ldquo;hands on&rdquo; politician who, I am sure, moves around in Longford-Westmeath.  He has seen both rural and urban poverty at first-hand and knows it is crying out for remedial action.</P>
    <P>The ESRI carried out a survey which was published by the Combat Poverty Agency.  Based on my own experience and also my knowledge of the track record of the ESRI and the Combat Poverty Agency, I believe this is reliable information.  It is proof positive that there is poverty in this country and that it is widespread.</P>
    <P>Poverty and inequality are growing. There are now somewhere between 2 and 4 per cent more poor people than was the case in the early eighties.  It is important to establish just who these people are and what reliefs this budget and this Finance Bill will bring to them.  There are far too many households headed by unemployed people.  There are large families, small farmers and their families and other people &mdash; and the Minister made some reference to them in relation to their improved tax situation &mdash; in extremely low paid employment.  Many of these people are employed because they believe in the dignity of work and they do not wish to be unemployed but they would be better off if they were collecting social welfare.</P>
    <P>Another group of people who are severely affected by poverty is women who find themselves in a position of rearing children on their own.  The sick and disabled are also a high risk category, though I would express relief that something was done for disabled drivers but we will develop that more on Committee Stage.  This was done largely at the <Col N="1720" /> vehement prompting of my party colleague, Deputy Ivan Yates, who drew attention to a particularly sad and poignant case where somebody was manifestly disadvantaged because of the nonsense in the legislation as it then existed.</P>
    <P>The attitude of the Irish people towards poverty is something that was covered in the ESRI report.  It indicated the Irish people expressed a view that an income of between £55 and £65 a week for a single person and a <i>pro rata</i> increase for a married person is necessary if one is to avoid poverty.  Such figures are very close to the levels of social welfare payment which were recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare in their report which, in addition to the five reports of the Commission on Taxation, is also sadly, gathering dust and is failing to be evaluated, considered and implemented in a coherent manner, although some minor titivations have been introduced in recent days.  A significant number of people are not receiving their full social welfare entitlements. In relation to the family income supplement, only between 13 and 22 per cent of those families eligible are actually in receipt of the benefit.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill should always be an indication of a political philosophy, or at least anyone reading it and studying its provisions should be able to have an idea of what kind of society the framers of the legislation want but I am afraid that kind of message is not coming through in this Finance Bill.  I had hoped it would have come through in the Minister's speech today which was competent and able and which dealt in detail with the various measures contained in the Bill but it was not coherent and expressive in terms of the philosophy behind Government thinking and that of his party.  One is left with the view that there is very little of substance in the Bill and that the phrase the Minister used &mdash; and which I expect he now regrets because it got him into a lot of trouble &mdash;&ldquo;steady as she goes&rdquo; is the sort of mentality which is driving this Government along.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1721" /> There is no suggestion that the Government or the Minister have grasped the urgency of the situation except in the sole area of the stabilising of the debt-GNP ratio.  There is a single item agenda approach to fiscal matters and at this stage, well into the life of this Administration and perhaps nearing the close of it, I do not think that attitude is good enough.  The socio-economic divisions of our society are hardening and there is increased polarisation.  This has not yet reflected itself in the political system to any significant degree but I am firmly of the view that it will.  What it is doing at the moment is engendering a certain terrifying apathy and acceptance on the part of people who are now being categorised or called a sort of permanent under-class in our society.  These people, the ones who remain behind, are daily growing more apathetic and the ones with any drive, spark or ambition are, sadly, moving away and often are very poorly equipped to do so.</P>
    <P>I think it is reasonable to invite the Government to state clearly in which direction are we moving or are we standing still.  It is extremely worrying indeed and I am not happy that we have the kind of coherent message coming through today as to what is being done for these people.  This speech today was for the &ldquo;haves&rdquo;.  It was for the people of property in our community.  It had nothing whatsoever to say to the poor and to those who are forced to emigrate. The Minister must represent all the people in this country and so must all of us who are privileged to stand here in the House today and enunciate the views of those whom we represent.</P>
    <P>I will save what I have to say about particular measures for Committee Stage of the Bill.  There are some good provisions in it despite my criticisms which I feel obliged to make.  I would be failing in my duty if I came in and gave a blank acceptance of everything and a bland response without voicing my concerns.  I am fearful that inflation is going to be a problem and I think we are moving in that direction.  There are certain indicators that are extremely disturbing <Col N="1722" /> indeed.  The Minister cannot be particularly happy about the increase in the mortgage rates.  If indicators are accurate, there is a view that there will be a further increase later in the year and that is obviously something that will impart on the economy.  The Fine Gael group in the Seanad will not be opposing the Second Stage of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to welcome the Minister for Finance to the House.  When listening to much of the contribution made by Senator Bulbulia, I felt I was looking at the wrong Minister &mdash; I thought Deputy Woods, the Minister for Social Welfare, would be a more appropriate person to be here because much of what Senator Bulbulia referred to was more appropriate to a social welfare Bill.  I would just make the comment to her that, while we are talking about a Finance Bill, if the Coalition Government who were in office up to 1987 had not doubled the national debt we would have, under the Minister for Finance, Deputy Reynolds, a budget surplus of £1 billion in this year's Estimates.  That would have done a lot for tax reduction, tax reform and welfare recipients&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KatherineBulbulia" hpid="Mrs. Bulbulia Mrs. Bulbulia">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>I hate to interrupt the Senator but what about the role of the then Opposition?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;although in this year's budget there is a provision of £156 million for social welfare recipients, the highest ever increase for the long term unemployed. Despite the gloom and doom which has been preached by Senator Bulbulia, the majority of financial and economic commentators in this country and the world over are saying clearly that the trends for this country in terms of financial and economic growth are excellent. As the Minister has mentioned, we have low rates of interest and inflation and we have a tremendous export performance which leads to large surpluses in our balance of payments.  Even allowing for the fact that there has been a 1 per cent increase in bank rates recently our bank lending rate is still 5 per cent <Col N="1723" /> below the UK level.  As the Minister indicated in his speech, 3.3 per cent was the reckonable figure for inflation as at midFebruary 1988.  There are other indicators, for example, the matter of industrial peace.  We have had the lowest number of strikes and days lost in 1988 for 25 years.  These are very encouraging signs.</P>
      <P>While accepting that &mdash; and here I agree with Senator Bulbulia &mdash; we have high unemployment and emigration rates, something I know the Government are concentrating on, again in this area there are encouraging signs.  We created 29,000 new jobs in 1988 and it was recently announced that there are 7,600 fewer people unemployed.  That is surely an encouraging sign.  Senator Bulbulia used a lot of her time speaking about unemployment.  However, we must see from where we have come, as it were. In 1984, 1985 and 1986 approximately 25,000 to 26,000 jobs were being lost each year.  The reasons for this were that we were uncompetitive, we had high interest rates, high inflation and high insurance costs.  Costs generally rose enormously resulting in closures and loss of jobs.</P>
      <P>The real objectives of this Government clearly are economic growth and advancement, the provision of jobs, a better standard of living for our people and the use of the resources we possess for that purpose.  As I said, there is much evidence, despite what Senator Bulbulia has said, that our country is again emerging from the shadows of a very dark period.  We can look to the future with confidence.  The signs, as I said, abound and I will comment briefly on that at a later stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are still struggling, particularly in the area of jobs and I accept that fully.  I repeat that last year's figures were encouraging but I believe we are still living with a hangover of a decade of failure.  The underlying trend in unemployment has been steadily downward. Senator Bulbulia referred to the fact that there is no reference to unemployment in the Bill.  She must accept &mdash; I know she will &mdash; that the last link in the chain <Col N="1724" /> of economic recovery is in the area of job creation and we have seen that in the past.  It is a fact of economic life.  We have seen the economy improve in Great Britain but it took eight years for jobs to come on stream.  We will surely experience something similar to what happened there.  The full effect of our recovery will come with the provision of many jobs. The reality is that we must get the national finances right before it can filter down to job creation throughout rural Ireland.  The Government are a little more than two years in office and they cannot correct overnight a situation which they inherited and which was badly handled for so many years.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Finance Bill itself, the question of personal taxation, of course, is something that interests all of us.  The high level of personal taxation is something that has been an impediment to the creation of employment.  It has caused many of our most talented and able people who should take up careers in this country to go abroad where there is a better tax regime.  However, in this budget, for the first time in 20 years, the standard rate of tax has been reduced, as we know, from 35 per cent to 32 per cent and also from 58 per cent to 56 per cent. It is a modest start but nonetheless a start and is something which I know the Government will continue.  The Finance Bill provides for reductions in DIRT and witholding tax and also for increases in the tax bands.  One might say that is nothing spectacular but it is a start and, hopefully, it will be maintained in the years ahead.  What we are doing is maintaining progress in this area, which started in 1987, by reducing the burden of personal taxation and increasing the incentive to work.</P>
    <P>The Government have indicated on many occasions, and they recognise full well, that the high level of personal and certain other forms of taxation, by adversely affecting the cost competitiveness of the economy, is a major impediment to the achievement of sustained economic growth and employment. There is a broad agreement that high personal taxes are a disincentive to <Col N="1725" /> enterprise.  They undermine the work incentive and they directly inhibit the whole concept of job creation.  Against this background it is necessary to recognise how the reliefs in income tax that were introduced by this Government in recent years have played an important role in the pay settlements agreed in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
    <P>I am sure the further easing of personal taxation will be an important objective of the fiscal policy of this Government in the medium term.  It is important that the Government have been pursuing a phased programme of tax reform while, at the same time, having regard to achieving an overall reduction in Exchequer borrowing.  This is to be seen in, and obviously is crucial, to the stimulation of sustained economic recovery. The tax reform programme announced in the budget and which is spelled out in this Finance Bill can be summarised in a few ways: first, by a reduction in personal taxation, secondly, new development incentives and, thirdly, further improvements in tax administration and reasonable measures to counteract transactions which are aimed primarily at tax avoidance and which, if not properly curbed, could prove costly to the Exchequer.  It is only by effective tax administration and a broadening of the tax base, combined with savings on Government expenditure, that we will be able to achieve the lower level of personal tax we all desire. This, for me, is clearly a basic belief and is one that is very much in the minds of the Government.</P>
    <P>I do not for one moment say that ordinary taxpayers will object in any way to the measures introduced in this Bill to counter tax avoidance.  One purpose of the Bill is to counteract certain transactions which are carried out primarily to create an artificial tax reduction or to avoid or reduce a tax charge.  Indeed, under the terms of section 81, the Revenue Commissioners are entitled to form the opinion that a transaction is a tax avoidance transaction and where they form such an opinion they will give to each person whom they consider is attempting to avoid tax by reason of the <Col N="1726" /> transaction a notice in writing describing the transaction, the amount of tax which they consider the person is attempting to avoid and the steps which they propose to take in order to ensure that the tax is not avoided.</P>
    <P>Section 81 (8) &mdash; as it appears in the Bill, as amended in Committee &mdash; will have the effect of ensuring that the Appeals Commissioners and the courts will be the final arbiters of what actually constitutes tax avoidance.  It is, as the Minister indicated in his speech to us, a new development in Irish tax law.  The need for it was highlighted by the decision in the McGrath court case.  Following that decision it was clear that the means to counter tax avoidance schemes had to be fundamentally reviewed if the Exchequer was not to incur a major loss of tax revenue.</P>
    <P>I hope, of course, that this anti-avoidance section is designed specifically to ensure that only those who are intent on avoiding taxes will be affected.  In my opinion this section is not designed to create uncertainties for genuine business transactions or for the normal use of recognised tax reliefs.  For that reason this section clearly allows safeguards for legitimate transactions to continue. Indeed, I was very pleased to note that the Minister has given assurance that genuine people have nothing to fear.</P>
    <P>Mortgage interest relief is of interest to everybody.  It is part and parcel of this Finance Bill as well.  This Government's firm resolve to break the cycle of increased Government borrowing and increased taxation showed results earlier than many of the financial and economic commentators had thought possible.  As we reduce Government borrowing and the size of the tax take, we leave room for real economic growth.  For many years the burden of income tax increased year in year out and for many households the most effective way of reducing this burden was through mortgage interest relief.  Mortgage interest relief is, of course, the biggest single element of Government support in the private housing sector.  It costs £160 million a year <Col N="1727" /> in revenue foregone and has become a significant factor in the income tax structure. Now that the Government are reducing income tax, I think they can also move to reduce the reliefs which people previously had to avail of in order to manage their income tax affairs to best advantage.</P>
    <P>Clearly, the total elimination of mortgage interest relief would represent a very serious blow to many people. However the combination of low mortgage interest rate &mdash; the lowest for something like 20 years &mdash; and the income tax reliefs announced in the budget provide some element of scope for a further reduction this year.  A reduction from 90 per cent to 80 per cent &mdash; in section 6 of the Bill as passed by Dáil Éireann &mdash; of the proportion of interest on which tax relief is allowed will help to counteract to some extent the inflationary pressures on house prices which, if unchecked, could have implications for the wider economy and, indeed, in time would push up interest rates.</P>
    <P>I can see the reason for the Minister reducing mortgage interest relief to 80 per cent.  However, wearing my insurance hat and admitting a vested interest, I hope it will stop at 80 per cent because it has been a great selling point for those in the business of selling life assurance contracts.  We are very much under insured and a great deal of work can be done in this area.  The Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce, with responsibility for Trade, Deputy Séamus Brennan, revealed recently that approximately 60 per cent of the Irish people of insurable age were found to be without life cover; only 40 per cent of married couples have life cover, and only 17 per cent of the farming community have life cover.  The life assurance companies obviously see the present move as not being beneficial to them.  That is understandable.  It is also not beneficial in the selling of life contracts.</P>
    <P>The Minister has commented on excise duties.  I congratulate him on terminating <Col N="1728" /> the practice of tax-free betting.  The introduction of a ten year driving licence at a charge of £20 will be welcomed by many people, including myself.  I tend to renew my licence from time to time and the idea of getting a ten year licence at a charge of £20 appeals greatly to me.</P>
    <P>I must express my concern about trends in house prices in certain areas, which manifested themselves towards the end of last year and have accelerated since then.  I am not talking about the housing market, in general, as there is still a very good supply of suitable type houses at a reasonable price for young couples who want to buy their first home. I am concerned primarily with the very much publicised development in certain market segments, in particular in Dublin and Galway, and I am sure it also applies in Limerick and Cork.  Certainly, some of the recently reported prices for houses in these areas are startling, to say the least.  Whether such price rises will be sustained is, in my opinion, highly debatable.</P>
    <P>Indeed, the reports of the prices of sites in some areas are even more startling. One would have to question whether these prices could ever be viable by the time the houses are built.  Both builders and financiers would be well advised to bear this in mind.  It is clear that the current house price inflation is to a very large extent being caused by trading up. We must not forget that the underlying demographic picture does not lead one to believe that this can be sustained in the long term.  There is no evidence that the supply of housing is, or indeed will be in the foreseeable future, seriously out of line with demand.  However, I fear that these trends will spread throughout the housing market with very serious consequences for families seeking their first homes, or they will promote inflation in the economy at large.</P>
    <P>The mortgage market, as it has developed over the past two years, has many welcome features.  It certainly has provided an adequate supply of mortgage funds at reasonable cost.  It has featured for the first time a healthy degree of <Col N="1729" /> competition between the various different financial lenders.  However, there is a danger that this competition can be carried to extremes.  It is my opinion that is the major factor in the bidding up of the price of certain types of property.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt the Government are fully aware of what has happened in the UK over the past years.  Property values particularly in parts of the south-east have escalated dramatically, with the result that the value of people's collateral increased beyond their wildest dreams and enabled them to borrow.  This also gave the financial institutions an incentive to lend and, in turn, there was an incentive to borrow, along with the capacity to borrow.  A general atmosphere of confidence was generated in a very real way which resulted in a huge increase in consumer spending, a great deal of which went on imports which threw the UK balance of payments out of line.  Last year the Chancellor of the Exchequer predicted a deficit in the balance of payments of about £4 billion and as a result of irresponsibility reducing rates of taxation, of escalating house prices and of the increase in consumer expenditure, the UK balance of payments deficit was in the region of £18 billion, as against the expected £4 billion deficit.  This put pressure on the currency, and in order to protect sterling interest rates have increased 11 or 12 times in a period of less than 12 months.</P>
    <P>We must learn from this and avoid the pitfalls at all costs.  We are in a very advantageous position of having seen what happened in the UK, and must take remedial action to avoid the same thing happening here.  The restriction on the mortgage interest relief is one such action that can properly be taken here.  Had house prices been controlled in England I have no doubt that their situation would not be as bad as it is today.</P>
    <P>I worry about intense competition between the various financial institutions to give out money like it was confetti. If this continues we could experience a renewed consumer boom.  There is evidence of this in many areas.  The demand for cars was up 54 per cent in the first <Col N="1730" /> quarter and we have had increased demand for imports and clothing, footwear and furniture.  We also have had a spiralling house prices in many parts of the country.  I know the Government are conscious of the fact that if they ignore the danger signals they may be forced to take more severe corrective action later on.</P>
    <P>In making those personal observations, I want to make it clear that I am neither a financial expert nor an economist, but I can see what is happening.  When I see people who would not get £20 credit from a bank or a building society some years ago now getting loans of £20,000 and more I have to ask questions.  When people get loans of three or four times their annual income to buy houses, I have to ask questions.  When people get loans in excess of 100 per cent of the price of the house they are buying I have to ask questions.  When I see people getting one, two and sometimes three mortgages from different institutions I have to ask questions. I read of a one-bedroomed gatelodge in Dublin selling for £202,000 and I have to ask questions.</P>

      <P>In places like Renmore in Galway houses were selling for £30,000 last year and now they are selling for £46,000 or £47,000.  The cut-throat competition may well be to the detriment of lenders and borrowers in the long term and could undermine the development of an orderly mortgage market in the future. There has been a very hard sell in respect of endowment mortgages.  It is unbelievable what is going on.  Indiscriminate selling of this type of mortgage product frequently involves overstating the potential benefits and does not have sufficient regard to the suitability of these products for individual house purchasers. Certain vested interests have been engaged in what looks like a deliberate hype in the housing market.  They have added a dimension of unreality to this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The curtailment of mortgage interest <Col N="1731" /> relief and the reduction in relief on insurance premiums and endowment mortgages were aimed in part, at least, at dampening down inflationary trends in the housing area.  It is hopped that these changes will act in some way as a moderating influence.  I take this opportunity to ask all lending agencies to adopt a more restrained approach with a view to ensuring long term stability in the mortgage and housing markets.  The Minister in his speech said, and I quote:</P>
    <P>The important point is that this increase in growth should not be excessive and should not begin to fuel inflation.  The Government's and the Central Bank's expectation would be that, following recent meetings with the main credit agencies &mdash; the banks and the building societies &mdash; those agencies would exercise the required prudence in their lending operations.</P>
    <P>I support that.  He goes on to say that:</P>
    <P>... the interest rate increase should assist in ensuring that moderation prevails. The evidence available so far on personal sector credit growth does not indicate a need for further remedial action, but the Government and the Central Bank will continue to monitor the situation closely.</P>
    <P>I would ask the lenders and the borrowers to learn from what happened when the banks threw money at the farming community in the seventies.  We know what happened then.</P>
    <P>The borrowing capacity of taxpayers is increasing for many reasons.  When that trend takes place within an economy there is a natural tendency to purchase more imported consumer goods.  I worry that we are in danger of importing inflation into the economy.  It is ironic that because of the success of this Government's financial policies over the past two and a quarter years there is a danger that inflation will come back into the economy.  Rather than take drastic action, such as had to be taken in the <Col N="1732" /> United Kingdom, this has to be monitored carefully.  I am glad the Minister has indicated that in his address to us.</P>
    <P>Are we failing to cash in on spiralling house prices?  At a time of extremely high house prices, the inability of the Revenue Commissioners to assess and collect the high yield due on residential property tax which has been with use since 1983 is inexcusable.  I am not sure of the reasons the yield is derisory.  It was £2.5 million last year and with a little extra effort that income could be increased dramatically.</P>
    <P>I turn briefly to the Government scheme which encourages investment in tourism and other areas &mdash; the business expansion scheme.  We all agree that the development of the Irish tourist sector, having regard to its labour intensive nature, is central to the Government's medium term strategy on employment. At present there is the equivalent of 67 full time jobs in tourism while exports from this sector makes it Ireland's largest source of foreign earnings.  Tourism has a great potential but it needs to be harnessed. In this context the Government extended the business expansion scheme in the 1987 budget in order to stimulate tourist-related investment.  The extension of the scheme was specifically designed as a means of maximising our share of the very fast expanding specialist holiday segment of the tourist market.  I congratulate the Minister for amending the scheme in this year's Finance Bill and for clarifying precisely what is a genuine tourist enterprise.</P>
    <P>The business expansion scheme was introduced in 1984 to encourage the private investor to invest his money as risk capital in industry and other services. Subsequently, it was extended to other priority employment generating activities, including tourism.  The tourist industry has a huge potential which is vital to this country.  We have very many major advantages as a tourist area.  It is only right that the Government should have given it a lot of consideration, and that it was so well documented in the <i>National Development Plan 1989-1993.</i></P>
    <P>I would like to comment on an area relevant to jobs and job creation &mdash; the <Col N="1733" /> insurance industry.  Certainly there have been recent signs of improvements in their operating environment with the passage of the Courts Bill, 1988, the Government's plans for further procedural law reform and the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Bill.  We have had a more rational approach to legal representation and negligence litigation.  We have had a reduction in the number of uninsured drivers.  These are welcome factors, which have led to increased competition among insurers. Again, I have to sound a note of caution, because I think where you have excessive competition leading to uneconomic rating it could have very serious implications for overall market stability.  In the motor insurance market, in particular, we have quite cut-throat competition at present.  To a lesser extent we have it in other classes of business also.  A basic underlying principle which is vital to the insurance industry is that premium reductions must be based on sound underwriting considerations, nothing more and nothing less.  The Irish insurance market would suffer a great setback if it were to be drawn into a price war which depressed the rates below economic levels, particularly now that we are on the run-up to the Single European Market of the nineties.</P>
    <P>I referred to the fact that confidence abounds.  This, in turn, will lead to jobs which is also a concern of Senator Bulbulia. If you do not have confidence you cannot have progress.  I will give three simple examples of what I mean by confidence on the part of business and industry today.  First, I was very interested to read recently the result of a post-budget survey on the small firms association of the CII.  It showed that 75 per cent of the small firms are now optimistic for the future.  That figure was as low as 17 per cent in 1987, in 1988 it had increased to 46 per cent.  It is now 75 per cent.  That is encouraging.</P>
    <P>I referred to my concern about spiralling house costs &mdash; a point that has been touched on by the Minister.  The second point is that the number of new homes being built in the first three months of <Col N="1734" /> the current year has increased by 50 per cent over the same period last year.  The third point to mention is that when the Custom House Docks Site Development was announced for Dublin in early 1987, not many people believed the idea would work.  The arguments ranged from those who believed and others who did not believe that Dublin could win an important share of the growth of the financial services industry in the run-up to the 21st century.  During the past two years the debate continued but as many elements of the financial services centre become a reality it is not the success or failure of the concept but the extent of its success that is now being debated.  To date 60 projects have been approved and I think with each additional project the credibility of Dublin as a major international financial centre increases and the pace of interest will gather momentum.</P>
    <P>The Economic and Social Research Institute produced their quarterly report last week.  It shows how far we have to go to shake off our abiding economic difficulties.  I am quite certain we have come a long way.  We have pulled ourselves back, as it were, from the edge of the abyss but the Minister will say, the Government will say and I will certainly say, that we still have a good way to go. There should be no respite and there should be no false optimism.  Essentially we are chipping away at a problem this Government inherited, a problem of massive proportions.  Until we solve our problems there can be very little room for complacency.  That is the Government's approach, and in my opinion it is the right approach.</P>
    <P>The Exchequer returns were announced some weeks back provided another ray of light and indicated a further pick-up in our economy.  It clearly indicated that there was an improvement in personal and industrial spending and is a further boost for this Government who are doing their best and succeeding in getting the finances under control. Despite all of this amid all the talk of Finance Bills and budgets and borrowing requirements and so on, it is often forgotten that economics is a science which <Col N="1735" /> reflects what people want to do with the money at their disposal.  The real importance of the Exchequer returns lies in the psychological motivation which produced them.  They show we are shedding the legacy of the years of doom and gloom, and that we are prepared to spend and to invest.  The confidence is there but we still have a long way to go, we still have big problems.  What is important is that we now seem to be less intimidated by those problems and, in my opinion, we are more prepared to work towards finding a solution to them.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Finance Bill.  It will be very important to the economy in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Bill.  I intend to speak in broad terms and not for very long because I hope to have an opportunity tomorrow or on a succeeding day to address in some detail some of the specific measures in the Bill and, in particular, some of the amendments that have been accepted by the Minister and by the Government.  I would like to say, first of all, that I regard as a very positive sign that a number of these amendments have been graciously accepted.  I heard the Minister on the radio at lunchtime and he indicated clearly that he was a practical person and that he wanted the best Bill possible, and that in the light of these sentiments it was his intention to accept amendments that in his view would strengthen the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I obviously have some particular interest in one of these amendments because over a period of two years I have had the opportunity to discuss the ideas contained in section 4 of the Finance Bill with the Minister's predecessor, Mr. MacSharry, the Minister himself and the officials of the Department of Finance.  I would like to pay tribute to the courtesy of both Ministers and the considerable patience and courtesy of the civil servants in the Department of Finance who engaged in long and detailed discussions of what is quite a complex area with somebody who is not an expert in the fields.  I learned a good deal from them <Col N="1736" /> and at the end of the day I believe they accepted at least some of my arguments. That is very welcome and it also indicates that even newcomers to this important Chamber can have some impact.  It also indicates that although this House cannot directly put in provisions that spend Exchequer money, suggestions can be made so that the Seanad has been able in this instance to indicate its clear relevance to the political life of this country.</P>
    <P>I would like to give a general welcome to section 4 because it is virtually the first time that anything substantial has been done in an area to which successive Governments have paid lip-service. I am glad there is a clear display of the fact that we have moved from a position where it was fashionable and popular to dismiss this aspect of our cultural heritage as being merely the province of irrelevancies, such as belted Earls.  This indicates a growing maturity on our part politically.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to repeat myself, therefore, I will confine myself to general remarks. I would like to extend a warm welcome for this measure.  I will wish to examine it in more detail tomorrow.  In particular, I would like some further information as to the role of the Office of Public Works which will be an important one in determining precisely which houses will qualify for this relief.</P>
    <P>I do not intend this to be taken negatively because we have, as the Minister remarked in the preface to his speech, very clear evidence of the capacity of the Office of Public Works, not only to recognise the importance of our heritage but, through the skill of their officials and craftsmen, to ensure that this heritage survives for future generations. However, I would be interested to learn, for example, what weight the various listings of local authorities, such as Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council, will have.  It seems reasonable to assume that the buildings or houses that are placed on list No. 1 would almost automatically be certain to qualify for this form of relief.  Again, I hope to deal with that in more detail later.</P>
    <P>The Minister seems to have accepted <Col N="1737" /> the value of most of the main branches of the arguments that were placed before him and his officials.  In fairness, as the Minister was generous enough to mention me in this regard, I would like also to mention that I had some considerable assistance from colleagues in the House and from a distinguished economic journalist, Mr. Paul Tansey.</P>
    <P>I would like also to welcome another section that has been of interest to me for some time, that is the writers' and artists' relief.  The Minister has been wise in making this rather broader than it was previously by allowing the inclusion of some measure of appeal.  This is, in fact, a rather delicate area and it sometimes is contentious to allow people in the Office of the Revenue Commissioners to decide what is or what is not a work of art.  I have been involved, not on my own behalf but on behalf of other writers, in attempting to tease out the criteria by which these judgments are made and sometimes, in my subjective judgment, they have been unfortunate and contentious.  Therefore, I welcome the inclusion of machinery for appeal.  It is wise and is in the spirit in which this provision for tax relief was originally framed I am sure the Minister will agree it has been good for the country and, not only nationally but internationally, it has given us a reputation as a country which still values the cultural inheritance we all have with regard to the arts.</P>
    <P>The section which deals with the business expansion scheme is extremely complex. I do not intend to inflict my ignorance in this area on the House but I am aware of the enormous amount of work that went into the attempt to ensure that public money generated from unfortunate taxpayers, like all the Members of this House, is not squandered on schemes that are simply intended to generate finance for individuals without any benefit for the country.  I congratulate the Minister and his officials on having made a very determined effort to solve this situation.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 28 which deals with corporate investment in films.  I am being unusually positive here.  I am usually <Col N="1738" /> more balanced and usually put a little vinegar in with the saccharin but the occasion is quite historic in terms of the restoration lobby, and perhaps I am &mdash; I will not say losing balance &mdash; but in a very good mood today and I thank the Minister for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the weather, I am sure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>That may have something to do with it.  It is certainly the cultural climate, if we can compromise on that phrase.  I am glad there is a substantial increase in the provisions of section 28 but I am not sure this completely meets the objections that many of us voiced during an adjournment debate that was taken by the late Senator Jackie Daly on the subject of the abolition of Bord Scannán na hÉireann.  I am not convinced that this additional tax relief, welcome as it is, will actually operate to allow us to recover the position that was eroded by what I regarded at the time, and have had no reason to alter my view, was an unfortunate and retrograde step.</P>
      <P>I will not rehearse that because we had a full debate on it at that time but as the economic climate improves &mdash; and it seems to be slowly improving &mdash; perhaps the Government will be in a position to examine this again because I do not believe that simple tax relief is sufficient. Bord Scannán na hÉireann was an expert marketing operation that allowed the financing of the research and development, the sketching out of ideas of a film, the production of a film and, finally, the international marketing of that film.  It is important that we exercise at least some control over the image we present to the outside world as a people.  Although I welcome the extension of the benefits accuring under section 28, I hope this will not be the end of the story.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice there is some welcome amendment in section 72 to stamp duty with regard to long-term leases and that the Minister acknowledges that this, again, is as a result of extensive lobbying from organisations such as Threshold.  I welcome this.  I wonder if the Minister has <Col N="1739" /> any views on a phenomenon that has recently emerged which is the part exchange of houses rather than the direct sale.  This, I understand, because of the spiralling rise in house prices, is becoming increasingly frequent.  People, particularly elderly retired people &mdash; I do not wish to draw this into the tax net but it is something that might be looked at to see if we can learn anything from it &mdash; trade down instead of wishing to trade up and the mechanism has been discovered by shrewd estate agents whereby it is possible to trigger stamp duty only on the difference between the two houses.  I regard this in certain circumstances as a positive thing, but perhaps it should be looked at to ensure that it does not become a method of avoiding taxation where it is paid by everybody else in the State.</P>
    <P>I would like to welcome very much indeed the section referred to by the Minister towards the end of his speech, section 92, which provides a revised scheme of VAT and excise remissions or refunds for disabled people as drivers and as passengers.  Once more, it would be quite tedious and unnecessary for me to rehearse the arguments.  The Minister has most ably made them and every Member of the House, I am sure, like myself, has received detailed briefing documents from the agencies operating on behalf of disabled people.  In a Bill which has such technical complexity and deals with the problems of the national economy, which are considerable &mdash; although I believe with the Minister that the economy is sound in a basic sense &mdash; it is important that we do not lose sight completely of the human, and indeed the humane touch.  Certainly in this section of the Bill we have indications that the Minister and his officials take a humane view and I very much welcome that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the comprehensive and wide-ranging statement of the Minister which amounts to a major statement on the economy.  As Senator Norris has said, the Finance Bill lends <Col N="1740" /> itself more to detailed discussion on Committee Stage rather than today so I, too, will confine myself to some broad observations on it.</P>
      <P>The Bill, which gives legislative effect to aspects of the budget, is a logical extension of earlier events.  Starting with the NESC consensus document, <i>A Strategy for Development, 1986-90</i> we then had the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> which gave practical expression to the NESC report.  Today's Bill is an extension of that in that it fits into the three year rolling plan of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  It is clear, of course, that the Government have a sense of direction, an overall strategy for economic and social development and this Finance Bill is an essential component of it and fits logically into a sequence of events.</P>
      <P>Objectively speaking, anybody would have to admit that the economy has been transformed over the past two years. Tough measures were necessary, harsh measures were necessary at times, to lay the basis for national recovery.  It took courage, it took determination, but it just had to be done.  The results, thankfully, are now appearing.  The pre-conditions for growth and, therefore, for jobs are already evident.  There is a low level of inflation, low interest rates, a surplus in the balance of payments and manufacturing and agricultural output are up and growing.  Investment, which is the key to growth and jobs, has stimulated the confidence which has brought about this investment.</P>
      <P>There is one theme, and this presents the opportunity to do it, that I want to pick up.  It has to do with the co-operative approach which pervades Government action to date on the economic front.  I want to refer specifically to the deliberate strategy based on co-operation as opposed to a strategy based on confrontation. I believe that the spirit of co-operation which pervaded the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and, therefore, contributed to the turnaround in the economy, has been an essential ingredient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government, indeed, have been <Col N="1741" /> helped by the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> which, as I have said, was based on co-operation.  The programme has harnessed and co-ordinated the efforts of all sides in the overall national interest and one piece of tangible evidence of this co-operative approach lies in the dramatic fall in the number of strikes last year.  Strike figures for 1988 represent the lowest number of strikes since 1963 and the lowest number of man-days lost since 1962.  In a small open economy like ours productively and quality are of vital importance.  The challenge is to develop new markets and to produce goods and services at the lowest possible cost.  The Minister highlighted the need to be cost effective in the context of competitiveness. This leads me back, of course, to the co-operation strategy, not alone at national level but at the level of the firm where the aim should be to improve relationships between employers and employees in order to supplement the co-operation levels at the national level.</P>
    <P>In Irish industrial relations there is a deep-seated tradition, borrowed from Britain, which views relations between the two sides of industry as confrontational and feeding on mistrusts. Several continental European countries, however &mdash; and they are more and more our competitors nowadays &mdash; are not burdened in the same way with the confrontational collective bargaining model. The co-operative model holds out a better prospect for productivity and for organisational harmony, and, therefore, for lower costs and competitiveness. Labour productivity can be improved by better industrial relations and a more co-operative model of collective bargaining as manifested at national level in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  The idea, therefore, is to shift away from the adversarial approach of the past with all its restrictive practices and the low levels of trust and to jointly recognise that both sides are in this thing together and, therefore, facing common problems in the enterprise with a view to becoming more competitive.  The way forward for Ireland <Col N="1742" /> is obviously to produce goods and services, emphasising higher productivity, better quality, more emphasis on customer service and above all, in giving value for money.  As I said, the pattern set at national level by the Government's involvment with the social partners and the co-operative approach should be brought down more and more often to the level of the firm.</P>
    <P>Turning briefly to the provisions of the Finance Bill, there is of course an air of confidence about and, as the Minister pointed out, the budget deficit of 5.3 per cent of GNP is adequate to maintain stability &mdash; the stability of the national debt and the GNP ratio.  Indeed, the present indications are that that target will be beaten and it will be below that.  Of course, discipline is required.  That means in the pay area in particular, keeping to what has been agreed in word and also to the spirit of it.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the special increases.  This, of course, highlights the continuing role of Government in the area of controlling pay.  The Government, through a consensus approach, have been highly influential in regard to pay levels not alone in the public sector but also in the private sector over the past two years.  The proposed solution on special increases in the public service, which I warmly welcome and which has just now emerged, is a further example of the consensus approach among the social partners.</P>
    <P>The talks leading to these proposed special pay arrangements were led by the Minister and, as he indicated in his statement today, there were no less than ten meetings between his officials and those of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  This orderly approach to special increases right now is in sharp contrast to the far from satisfactory special pay pattern that emerged due to unstable Governments in the early eighties.  The current proposals have emerged after co-operative, detailed discussions and they bring more order to the phased approach to the special increases in the years ahead.  Furthermore, they should lead to <Col N="1743" /> a continuation of the industrial relations stability in the public service.</P>
    <P>With regard to the budget itself, it provides an integrated package dealing with both social welfare and taxation systems. I listened with interest to what Senator Bulbulia said about the poverty category. We had an opportunity here when the Minister for Social Welfare was introducing his legislation to give effect to the social welfare provisions of the budget to discuss that issue in more detail.  Obviously it is entirely legitimate to discuss it in the context of the Finance Bill but it is fair to say that the budget, including what the Minister for Social Welfare introduced, underlines the recognition by the Government of the plight of the long term unemployed and those on low incomes.  The substantial increases for both categories demonstrated a practical response, with a considerable distance to go, by the Government at this time.</P>
    <P>There are still serious problems facing the country.  We need to do more about jobs and personal taxation.  We need to upgrade our transport, our communications, our education, training and so on but we should not sell ourselves short.  We need to keep our self-esteem. There is an element of practical realism in the Minister's speech which I welcome. We have to have a certain amount of confidence and it is justified now in the context of the progress we are making.</P>
    <P>There are very clear indications of growth which have been confirmed by industry surveys, quite independently of Government organs.  There is widespread support I believe for the general direction of Government policy.  The aim, obviously, should be to secure and consolidate the recovery we have made and not to relax our efforts in that regard. This will require even further unpalatable medicine from time to time but courage and determination, combined with sensitivity in relation to the less well off, to me seems to be the way forward.  I will reserve any further comments for detailed consideration on Committee Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief.  I will not duplicate a lot of what has been said. I have a particular concern in relation to one section and I would like to place it clearly on the record, that is the question of the minimum standards and section 23 lettings.  I do not mind saying this while the Minister is absent because he has two very good advisers present who will keep him well advised of what is being said.</P>
      <P>There is generous tax relief available under section 23 of the 1981 Finance Act which was amended by sections 27, 28 and 29 of the 1988 Finance Act, whereby the purchase of new apartments and houses for letting can offset the rental income from both the new premises and any other rental properties.  While the new rental houses and apartments have to meet minimum standards and are generally of a high quality no such conditions attach to the other rental properties to which relief is claimed.  For example, a landlord of slum properties could buy a new section 23 apartment or house and, as a result, he could enjoy the income from his slum properties effectively tax free.</P>
      <P>The tax relief is not linked to standard of good practice in the management either of the new or existing properties such as the use of written tenancy agreements, rentbooks or a minimum period of notice to quit.  In contrast, the corresponding UK legislation encouraging investment in rental property linked the tax reliefs to secure long term tenancies obeying certain conditions.  In Ireland the section 23 tax relief can be claimed, for example, by landlords whose tenants of long standing are still only on week-to-week leases.  The Minister should link the tax concessions with proper standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Figures given in a recent Dáil question showed the average tax relief granted under section 23 amounted to £10,000 per claimant.  We have had information that this is a very generous tax relief and, therefore, should be made conditional on standards of good practice in both the new and existing rental properties.  We believe the standards should include conformity with the by-laws where applicable and with basic standards similar to <Col N="1745" /> those enshrined in the Housing (Private Dwellings) Standard Regulations, 1984 which laid down the minimum standards for formerly rent controlled dwellings, the provision of rentbooks or similar proof of rent paid, written tenancy agreements, greater security of tenure, that is to say a minimum of one week's notice for every six months duration of the tenancy.</P>
    <P>We intended to put down some amendments which we believed would not be of any great cost, if at any cost, to the Exchequer but we understand it is not possible to amend something in the Finance Bill that will involve cost.  While we are not putting down an amendment we would like to put on the record of the House what we had in mind.</P>
    <P>Where income tax otherwise due on rented residential premises under section 81 of the Income Tax Act 1967, is reduced in whole or in part by the provisions of section 23 of the Finance Act of 1981 (as amended by sections 27, 28, and 29 of the Finance Act 1988) it shall be a condition of the granting of such income tax reduction that any such residential premises:</P>
    <P>(1)  (a) shall comply with any by-laws governing conditions of rented dwellings laid down by the local authority in whose area the premises is situate;</P>
    <P>(b)  shall conform to the standards laid down in the Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Standards Regulations, 1984 (S.I. No. 337 of 1981) as if those regulations governed the premises concerned.</P>
    <P>(2)  the letting agreement governing the lease of any such premises includes:</P>
    <P>(a)  that a written tenancy agreement is issued to the tenant giving the details of the landlord's name and address, the amount of the rent, the deposit paid, if any, and the terms of the tenancy;</P>
    <P>(b)  that a rent book or other form of receipt for rent (including verification of rent paid through a bank account), be issued to the tenant;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1746" /> (c)  that in respect of each complete period of six months since the commencement of the tenancy, the tenant shall be entitled to one week's notice to quit the premises and for any additional period, forming less than six months complete months, the tenant shall be entitled to an additonal week's notice to quit.</P>
    <P>Obviously there will be an argument here that there would be a substantial cost factor involved.  We do not want to get into unnecessary hassle but it is necessary to outline the type of amendment we had in mind with regard to this matter.  The purpose is to provoke some sort of reply from the Minister as to whether our fears are unnecessary or unjustified, whether we are exaggerating the situation or whether we are dealing with a factual situation that has some defects and needs some alteration.  We are very anxious to hear a reply from the Minister and to have it written into the record.</P>
    <P>There is one other very small but important point that is causing concern to many people and the Labour Party are certainly concerned about it.  It is the case where schools are promoting hurling, and juvenile hurleys that have to be purchased by the schools.  We feel that these people should get total relief from VAT because we believe they are doing an outstanding job.  It is the national game and they have to be given every opportunity to encourage school children to play it.  We would be very anxious for the Minister to reassure the people who are promoting hurling in schools that the Government have their interests at heart.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to cover ground that has been adequately covered.  I listened to the Minister's speech and have since read it.  It is a very long speech, 26 pages in fact.  It is more a progress report than a Finance Bill speech.  I will go through a few items in the Minister's speech on which I would like further clarification.  The Minister referred to the job creation programme of the present Government.  The Minister says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1747" /> This kind of progress bodes well for job prospects and for our ability to reduce unemployment, which are the priority goals of the Government and influence everything we are doing.  The initial evidence on jobs may not appear impressive &mdash; the increase of 6,000 in total employment which took place in the year to April, 1988, as disclosed by the latest Labour Force Survey.</P>
    <P>The Minister acknowledged that the record is not very impressive but he fails to point out that all the work experience schemes and all the people who lost their unemployment benefit due to the deliberate policy of harassment of people on unemployment benefit, have been a factor in arriving even at that very modest figure.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister about the present unemployment figure of 240,000. What are the Government doing about those unfortunate people?  What effort is being made by the Government to provide meaningful employment for those people on long-term and short-term unemployment?  Those are the issues with which we, as politicians, should be concerning ourselves.  We should be creating meaningful employment because that is one of the major problems facing this country.  What genuine efforts are being made in that regard?</P>
    <P>Another statistic the Minister forgot to mention was the 100,000 people who have emigrated.  I submit that the figure may be even much greater than that. They have been forced to emigrate. Every parish in rural Ireland and every street in urban Ireland is affected by the scourge of emigration.  Practically every family in Ireland is now affected by the scourge of emigration.  Ask anyone in any parish who is fielding teams in football, hurling, etc.  More than one-third of their players have been forced to emigrate to England, America or further afield.  Emigration of their children is the reality facing most parents today.  I am a parent of four schoolgoing children, some in their teens.  I see no future for them in this <Col N="1748" /> country if the present situation continues. That is the main concern of parents and it is a sad state of affairs.  The Government have failed to do anything to allay the fears of parents in this regard.  It is a sad situation in which we find ourselves.  Even 26 pages of a speech from the Minister cannot disguise this fact.  Let me warn the Minister that parents are concerned about this.  It does not matter when the election is called &mdash; speculation is continuing in that regard, it is not being allayed by anybody from the Government side, particularly the Taoiseach whose responsibility it is.  No matter when the general election is called, emigration will be a major issue, many politicians are out canvassing for the European elections. The question most often asked at the door is: &ldquo;what are the prospects of jobs for my children?&rdquo;  This is the issue about which parents are very concerned.</P>
    <P>I welcome back the Minister of State. it seems that any time I address the Seanad I meet the Minister of State, Deputy Connolly.  Maybe it is because he and I are here at the same times or maybe he comes here very often.  He is very welcome anyway.  I was saying that emigration will be a serious issue whenever the general election is called, because we as politicians are already meeting that at the doors when we canvass for the European elections.  I will illustrate this point.  Recently in County Galway &mdash; my own county and the county of the Acting Chairman &mdash; when Mrs. Power of Power's Cross won £1,250,000 in the national lottery, she was asked by the reporters what she would do with the money.  She did not say she would buy a new car; she did not say she would go on a holiday; she did not say she would buy a new house; she did not say she would add an extension to their farm or buy a new farm; the only thing she said was: &ldquo;Thanks be to God my three children will now be able to come back from England&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>A sensible Galway woman is right, or a sensible mother in <Col N="1749" /> any part of this country because that is the reality with parents and we all have to face that.</P>
      <P>In his report the Minister referred to the <i>National Development Plan</i> and said that it complements and builds on the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  He further stated that the EC provision of increased Structural Funds to help strengthen the economy is one of three vital elements.  I would like to ask the Minister what is the situation now of the EC money vis-á-vis the National Plan?  When will specific announcements be made as to the expenditure or possible expenditure of this money, and is there any possibility &mdash; I doubt it very much that those announcements will be made before 15 June irrespective of whether there is only the European elections on that date or whether they may be other elections?  It is essential that this be spelled out.</P>
      <P>Many communities, parish councils; community councils and others were misled earlier in the year with the hype about the National Plan and the EC Structural Funds, etc.  They spent a lot of time, energy and money developing fancy brochures and great plans for spending this money in their communities. I believe they were misled because I do not think this type of money is available to the community councils and parish councils for these types of plans.  If it is, I would very much welcome it.  I would also welcome it if it could be spelled out immediately and we should not keep people in suspense until certain events are over.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to tax concessions for disabled drivers.  He said that the present medical criterion, that a person must be &ldquo;wholly or almost wholly without the use of each of his legs,&rdquo; has included otherwise deserving cases.  That was the situation and the Minister intends to amend it.  He says:</P>
      <P>The general criterion of disability will be that a person must be &ldquo;severely and permanently&rdquo; disabled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme will also apply to disabled persons as passengers where a significant <Col N="1750" /> car adaptation is needed.  I welcome that very much.  I would like more clarification because:</P>
    <P>The Minister says:</P>
    <P>Finally, let me say to all those who are at present in receipt of a remission or refund of tax due under the existing scheme, that they will not have to undergo any further process of medical certification to retain eligibility for the particular form of tax refund they enjoy at present.</P>
    <P>A case was brought to my attention last night in my clinic of a person who is wholly disabled.  He is a person who is wholly without the use of his legs who has been in a wheelchair since birth.  He has never walked and is only fit to stand while he is getting into the car.  This is a person who for the past six or seven years, since he became the owner of a car which is essential for him to get around, had qualified for the tax concession.  I quote from a letter which he received from the office of the Revenue Commissioners dated 10 May 1989:</P>
    <P>I am directed by the Revenue Commissioners to refer to your application under the Disabled Drivers' Scheme for a repayment of excise duty paid in respect of the motor vehicle bearing registration No. 89 G 936.</P>
    <P>In this regard I am to inform you that section 43 (1) of the Finance Act, 1968 which contains the criteria on which the excise duty relief is based, describes disability in terms of persons who are wholly or almost wholly without the use of each of their legs.  As the medical evidence available is not to the effect that your disability comes within the scope of that description, it is regretted that the Commissioners are not in a position to authorise a repayment in this case.</P>
    <P>Yet the doctor's certificate in this person's case states that he has been all his life in a wheelchair and that he is unable to walk.  He is not in any other category. I know him personally all my life and I will vouch for the correctness of what I am saying.  Yet under the present law <Col N="1751" /> after being eligible for the refund for the past six or seven years, he is now excluded according to that letter even though there has been no improvement and, in fact, there has been a deterioration in his state of health and in his use of his limbs.  While welcoming the change the Minister is proposing here that the general criterion for disability will be that a person must be severely and permanently disabled with the result that he or she would be unable to drive a car unless it is specially constructed or adapted, I would question the interpretation of the present law which can go so far wrong as to deny a person who is absolutely qualified.  How are we to guard against that even with the amended section?</P>
    <P>The Minister has devoted 18 pages out of 26 to matters of tax, tax avoidance, business tax, personal tax, etc.  It would appear from that that he has a very high regard &mdash; an obsession if you like &mdash; with the collecting of tax.  That may or may not be a good thing but it is quite clear that our tax laws are entirely inadequate and out of date and they need a complete revision.  Our tax law needs a complete review because tax is crippling employment. It now costs an employer £2 or £3 for every extra £1 in wages he gives to an employee.  That should not be the case.</P>
    <P>Nowhere in the Minister's extensive speech could I find any reference to the funding of local authorities, etc.  This, again, is becoming a major problem throughout the country.  In County Galway our roads are in a state of disrepair. I have a particular concern about the roads in Connemara which are deteriorating to the point that they are being washed away altogether.  The capital grant to Galway County Council in 1987 was cut back by 14 per cent or £1.4 million. In 1988 it was cut back by £570,000 or 5.6 per cent on top of the cutback of £1.4 million in the previous year.  We are reaching the stage where it is now accepted by county engineers and everybody else that no work can be done on county roads and I presume the same applies in other counties.  I would think those matters should be referred to in <Col N="1752" /> the debate on the Finance Bill.  We as members of local authorities must explain to the people in the areas we represent that the state of the roads in our areas is not due to the activity or inactivity of the county council but is due to cutbacks in finance being provided for the carrying out of those works.</P>
    <P>Like every other county and town throughout this country we are affected by the lack of finance for local authority housing.  In Galway city we are now at a crisis as regards housing.  I saw a person at my clinic last night.  She and her husband and two children live in a house where there are 15 people altogether.  I was speaking to the housing officer of Galway Corporation today and I was told there is no possibility of that person being housed or getting a flat in the immediate future.  That is because of the cutback in the provision of money for local authority houses.</P>
    <P>In Galway borough area between 1983 and 1986 we were allocated by the Government of the day some £14 million for local authority housing.  Over 500 local authority houses were completed. Yet in 1987 and 1988 &mdash; and this is the clear and absolute record despite the fact that we in Galway Borough Council had provision for land and adequate plans with the Department for housing &mdash; not one local authority house was built in the Galway Borough area.  Not one local authority house will be built &mdash; and I will qualify that remark in a minute &mdash; in 1989, but 20 apartments &mdash; 15 one bedroom and 5 two bedroom &mdash; will be built at Whitehall, an infill scheme in the centre of the city mainly meant for old people, a very necessary category indeed.</P>
    <P>Those are the facts as regards the local authority housing programme in Galway city.  I will have to tell the person who called to my clinic last night that unfortunately she has no chance of a house or a corporation flat.  She is not looking for a house, she is looking for a corporation flat.  I will have to tell her she has no chance of a corporation flat in the present circumstances.  The only chance she has of a flat is if some unfortunate person in a corporation house in Castlepark, <Col N="1753" /> Newcastle or somewhere else is forced to emigrate and a house becomes vacant into which we will be moving some tenant from the local authority flats, and then a flat will become vacant.  That is the only way local authority housing is becoming available in the Galway urban borough area.</P>
    <P>It is a very sad reflection on the Government and the Government must be indicted on their cutbacks in the provision of capital for the building of local authority houses.  We now have waiting lists in the county areas, but more so in the borough area where, since 1986, not one local authority house has been completed. In 1987 only £220,000 was allocated and that was to complete a scheme started in 1986.  Not one new house was built in Galway Borough area in 1987 or 1988, and will not be built in 1989 with the exception of 15 one bedroom and five two bedroom apartments.  I could not let this opportunity pass without making reference to that.  I could go on and on about those problems.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I could mention the health services.  I do not intend to go into this matter as I think it has been covered already and will probably be covered more thoroughly by other speakers.  The health services are in a shambles and we hear desperate, harrowing cases of people being admitted to hospital.  I know of a man in Galway who was admitted to hospital last week.  He was told on Friday evening to come in fasting for an operation and he was sent home again fasting on Sunday.  The explanation was that the operation could not be carried out due to lack of beds and pressure of work.  That is not an isolated case.  What about all the people waiting for replacement of glasses, who need dental treatment and so on?  Nobody can now get their glasses replaced except old age pensioners, diabetics or people with eye related diseases. Other people are being told by our health board that they are being put on a waiting list.</P>
    <P>What about all the young people waiting for orthodontic treatment?  They have no chance of getting this treatment.  That is another issue about which I should <Col N="1754" /> warn the Minister of State and the Government.  It will become a live issue in the general election, irrespective of when that is held.  There is intense speculation in this House about the date for the next election.  Quite frankly, it does not matter when the next election comes because people will be ready to ask this Government to answer for the neglect of the services that they should be providing throughout the country.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on the Finance Bill.  It is difficult for an Opposition to be critical when their party failed to vote yesterday at Report Stage when the Bill was going through the other House.

There is not enough provision made for the health services, for building houses, for roads, etc., and it is really a terrible picture.  If I was saying that and I believed it I would have the courage of my convictions and I would stand up and oppose it.  I find it hard to take it seriously.  Nevertheless the Finance Bill gives all Members an opportunity to make some observations and to reflect on the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most important thing that has happened in the last two and a half years is that the ordinary people of Ireland have got back some self-confidence.  It may be at a price, and I think that price is rightly described as being very high for some sections, and I accept this, but I am yet waiting for alternatives, for real realistic alternatives.  Senators can make comments about the bad roads, potholes, emigration etc., but did it all start two and a half years ago?  It did not and I believe the only reason a minority <Col N="1755" /> Government is allowed to stay in office is because the vast majority of the Irish people would support the return of the same Government on their performance, and that is the platform on which we as a party stand.</P>

      <P>Definitely not, and I am not looking for an election.  I have no magic button or crystal ball, but I am speaking as an individual from rural Ireland.  The greatest achievement of the Government is the fact that they restored confidence in a large number of people who are prepared to get up and do something for themselves.  That was not the situation up to two and a half years ago. The ordinary businessmen, the farmers, every single section of the community were demoralised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Opposition at the time were not responsible for the collapse of the Government.  If my memory serves me the Government of the day was dissolved because of a disagreement between the two parties in Coalition.  I do not think they were voted out.  I do not think anything happened, that is if my memory serves me right.  I believe the present Government are doing a reasonable job.  They have the confidence of the people, they have the confidence of other countries and we are now looked upon as a healthy trading unit within Europe. That in itself is a major achievement and I believe most of the people realise that that has been achieved.  I admit that sections of this community here have been hardpressed as a result of measures that the Government have been forced <Col N="1756" /> to take.  It is useful therefore for all of us to have an opportunity to review the financial situation when the Finance Bill is going through the House.</P>
      <P>On the question of taxation, there is no simple solution to taxation.  Some sections want to pay no tax, some sections want a 25 per cent across the board tax, other sections believe that no matter what tax they are paying it is too much. Between direct tax and indirect taxation, the various forms of value added tax, the taxation on oil, petrol, cars, individuals, PRSI or whatever form of taxation, you find when you examine it that it is a very delicate balancing operation and the Minister for Finance and the Government have the difficulty of not being too hard on any particular section.  But it has to be recognised that the Government have done a reasonable job and are progressing at present to the point where vast improvements can be made, but there had to be foundations laid and confidences gained.  However, I believe that the Government are on the right road.</P>
      <P>It is right to recognise that wages and salaries here are certainly not behind anywhere in Europe.  If we look at a cross-section of wages and salaries and make comparisons between here and the UK and the North of Ireland, we find that in many cases &mdash; nurses and teachers, to name but two sections &mdash; the salaries and wages are higher here than they are in the North of Ireland.</P>

I am saying that this country at present has a well paid workforce in relation to our neighbours in Europe.  Take whatever section you like, the office administrator, the forestry worker, the road worker or go right across the board, we are abreast of anybody in Europe with our salary scales.  I believe that is very important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made to emigration. We have yet to examine some of the <Col N="1757" /> reasons for emigration.  It is a good slogan for Opposition Members and at election times to say &ldquo;Look at the number of people emigrating&rdquo;.  We are now Europeans and we are going to find more and more of our young people emigrating to Germany, France, Belgium, Holland and Britain.  The whole focus will be no longer be on Britain.  Languages, travel and participation in European countries will be the order of the day.  I believe that, whatever Government are in office, there will be vast numbers of our young, well-educated people leaving the country.  We may deplore it.  It might be nice to have them all building new bungalows and living four miles down the road.  That is sentimental and perhaps desirable, but the fact is that the young people of today want to see the world and to explore the possibilities of improving their lot within Europe.  That is here, it is going to stay and it is a major factor in the emigration statistics.  Despite all the changes in taxation and all the provision of jobs and incentives, that will not go away, no matter what you do.  Under-provision, over-provision or change in provision will not alter that.  That is the realistic situation we have now reached.  Our young people are now at the stage where they will look around for the best jobs; many of those who emigrated left very good jobs here in Ireland.</P>

      <P>I am pleased also to record another aspect of our success concerning the cost of goods here.  It nearly became an obsession with Gay Byrne. Every second morning in his programme he was interviewing people to show the price of a car in the North compared to the price down here and how much it meant for the individual&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry about that. I can refer to the fact that our radio and <Col N="1758" /> television programmes were constantly interviewing people who went to shop for goods in Belfast, Newry and outside the State.  They went over to Swansea and to England in boatloads on shopping sprees. That has substantially stopped.  I come from a border county.  I am pleased to say that, if you go up to a little store in Ballybofey on a Friday or a Saturday, more than 50 per cent of all the shopping people in Ballybofey come from across the Border.  If you go to two or three stores in Letterkenny you will see that the tide has been turned around completely. Ordinary household goods now, and food in particular, are cheaper in the Republic than in the North.</P>
      <P>That is a realistic figure.  Most of us were sick and tired of listening to the propaganda.  People were getting free time on our national media to advertise their wares, how attractive they were and their prices.  Even at the height of it, a businessman in the North said to me that he had been listening to a lot of propaganda about the price of a car.  He said he had two companies, one in the North and one in the South.  He told me that the manager of the company in the North had a Mazda 626 which was £4,000 or £5,000 cheaper than the price of the manager's Mazda in the South.  He said that we seemed to give ourselves a lot of bad publicity over the fact that cars are dearer in the South, but that nobody mentioned the fact that the rates on the building he owned in the North were £10,000 more than that of the similar building he had in the South.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the last speaker, it is depressing to listen to remarks of that kind which discourage our people, for whatever propaganda or political reason. The one thing we must not do is to tell our young people that they are inferior, that this country is no place to live in, that they should get out of it, that it is too dear to live in and that there is no future here.  That is not the message you should give, regardless of how anxious you might be to be in politics.  I venture to say that nobody will believe you.  The vast majority of the people are capable of assessing the situation on the ground. <Col N="1759" /> You do a disservice to yourself and a bigger disservice to your country by continuing to knock, to run down, to criticise and to spell out a message of no hope. That is deplorable and it is not acceptable. It does not help and will never help to put you back in office.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to see that the general trading position of this country has vastly improved to the point where we are now recognised as an equal trader in Europe. When you are watching a money programme or a business programme you find now that Ireland is no longer coming in at the bottom of the league.  Ireland is now quoted in major business countries such as Germany, Holland and France. We are up there in that league, thanks to the management of the Government who have been in office for the last two years. I believe totally in what I am saying.</P>
    <P>Recently we had much criticism of the <i>National Development Plan</i>.  We were told that we were not even entitled to describe it as a national plan.  We were told that it was a programme for development, that we could not call it a plan. This was said on behalf of people who were hellbent on criticising, hellbent on demonstrating nationally and internationally that our progress, our programme and presentation to Europe were inadequate, that we were not capable. They wanted more time, more details and more input on ground level. For me in particular that was hard to stomach because I had so much knowledge of what was happening on the ground.  When the <i>National Development Plan</i> was being introduced, I recalled that in 1983 the Economic and Social Committee of the European Communities submitted a plan for the Border regions to the then Minister, who is now Leader of the Opposition.  I wonder if that ever saw the light of day.  It would have cost £800 million to implement that report in our Border areas, to bring the Border counties up to the economic level of the rest of the country.  But not even one pound was spent on it.  Those are the very same people who now cry crocodile tears about the inadequacy of our presentation <Col N="1760" /> to Europe.  In 1983 they had all the documentation they needed; it was done for them by Brussels.  Brussels would have supported it financially.  But what did they do?  That document was never mentioned once by anybody.  How can they be sincere and criticise the national plan? People from my own county criticised the national plan, that they did not get enough opportunity.  Yet in 1987 we had a regional strategy for Donegal, Leitrim and Sligo, for which we paid £100,000 and which is incorporated in the national plan.</P>
    <P>Those people would not even bother to find out the facts on the ground.  It was easier and cheaper to be critical and to get on the bandwagon of not enough for the potholes and not enough for health or for anything else.  It is easy to be critical. Those who are critical and who do not check their facts must be challenged at every single opportunity.  That is what we will do, whether it is a European election or a general election and whether a general election comes in June, July or June of next year.  Whenever it comes the unchallenged propaganda that has been running rampant will be challenged.  The mass of ordinary voters and ordinary people will be there and they will decide; and I have no difficulty in assessing what they will do.</P>
    <P>It is a long time since we had the same commitment by business people &mdash; small business people in particular &mdash; who are now prepared to enter into business and to provide jobs.  That is the key.  However desirable it is to bring in somebody who will create 300 or 400 jobs in a centre, a vast number of additional jobs will be provided by people within our own jurisdiction. The confidence that is now prevailing is a major contribution and will encourage people to provide jobs.</P>
    <P>It is important that we have funding to develop our resources here.  We have now reached the stage where you cannot bring in a sheet of tin from Taiwan, bend it and send it out again.  We have to develop our natural resources within our country. Therein lies the only way to long term secure jobs.  We have vast potential for <Col N="1761" /> employing people within our own country.</P>
    <P>The fishing industry has not yet been fully developed.  The Government are very positive about the preservation and the financing of the fishing industry.  I believe that the future is very bright for that industry.</P>
    <P>I believe that the tourist industry is largely untapped in rural Ireland.  Apart from Dublin, Shannon and the south, tourism in the whole of the west of Ireland, including Donegal, is completely undeveloped.  There is a major potential here for providing jobs.  In future our plans will have to be geared towards getting the maximum benefit from the tourist industry.  We in the area I represent have continually complained that Bord Fáilte have not spent in our area any major part of the £18.5 million they have got nationally.  The money has been spent in areas where there already has been substantial success.  I would claim that the west of Ireland, particularly Donegal, has not had the input we would like to see from Bord Fáilte.  I urge the Minister for Finance to ask Bord Fáilte what part of the £18.5 million went towards the west of Ireland and to examine, region by region, county by county, where that £18.5 million went.  You will find out that, after you paid for the glasshouse at Baggot Street Bridge and paid for the salaries and the travelling expenses, there is not enough finance going towards the promotion of tourism in the west.</P>
    <P>I believe that much more could be done.  If I were to be asked where I could provide more jobs in my county I would have to say in the tourist industry, the fishing industry, the timber industry, agriculture, sheep, cattle and those areas. Many more jobs can be provided, but I would have to say that the tourist industry would be our prime area for development. I ask the Minister to examine the amount of money spent on development in the west by Bord Fáilte.  I believe that we have got funding for signposts, we have got personnel to attend festivals, a presence on the ground, brochures, plans and vocal support; but we have not had <Col N="1762" /> sufficient development support to provide jobs in the west.  I would ask the Minister for Finance to talk to Bord Fáilte and to get an indication of the amount of money and where the allocation of funds has been concentrated. That will show that my county in particular has fared very badly in the allocation of funds.</P>
    <P>I believe it is important also that we continue to examine the support for small farmers.  I dislike seeing young people emigrating and I have to recognise that some of the undesirable emigration takes place from small family holdings in rural Ireland.  We have not yet done enough to sustain the family farm.  The President of the EC recently visited this country and indicated his support for the retention of the small family farm.  We have got to do much more than we have.  The western package had a clause in it whereby assistance from the EC fund under the western package cannot be given to those who have off farm incomes.  A big number of people have been deprived of support for small family farm development schemes as a result of that clause.  That must be looked at.  I was pleased that today the Minister for Agriculture has announced that the off-farm income clause for suckler cows has now been dropped.  This will give the new premium of £53 per cow, which has been increased from £38, directly to small family farms without the off-farm income being taken into consideration.  This is only a start.  I would ask that we continue on this very important matter, because if we can support and retain the small farm in rural Ireland we are making a major contribution to the economy of this country.  I would encourage the Minister for Finance to provide funding to support and retain the small family farm in future years.</P>
    <P>The last speaker referred to bad roads. I think it is a bit of a slogan, because everybody has had to put up with bad roads in rural Ireland &mdash; but not in the city or on our trunk-roads.  I would remind the House and those who criticise the funding for roads that over the last two years the Minister for the Environment has <Col N="1763" /> increased funding and has a national roads programme, which was not in place and did not exist up to two and a half years ago.  That is very important.  The present Government recognise that the standard of our roads has to be brought up to the standard of the roads in Europe. It is well known that the provision for country roads in most local authorities in Ireland has trebled in the last two years. I welcome that increased contribution from the Department of the Environment. I believe that within this financial year we will get rid of the potholes in county roads and of most of the bad roads that we had to accept as a legacy of the previous administration.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter to which I would like to refer.  The Minister in his speech indicated an increase in the VAT rate on livestock from 1.4 per cent to 2 per cent.  That means that if I sell cattle to a meat factory or at a cattle mart the amount of VAT is now 2 per cent.  I would ask the Minister to make sure that the amount is shown separately and that it is not included in the invoice.  If I put in ten or 20 cattle to the meat factory, the invoice for my cattle is down and the VAT I receive in addition to the amount for the cattle is added and shown as a separate amount.  It is important, because I have seen the amount of VAT included in the price.  This information was only available when the farmer sold his cattle, went back to challenge the amount and then the meat factory told him that the VAT was included in the price.  That arrangement is unsatisfactory and I welcome the change from 1.4 per cent and 2 per cent.  However, I would strongly urge those dealing in cattle to record that amount of VAT under a separate heading so that the farmer will know what he is getting and know what VAT is included.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill has been a very successful presentation by the Minister.  I would like to compliment the Minister for Finance who is recognised as representing the backbone of this country.  No one has successfully challenged the present Minister in regard to where he was going wrong.  I would compliment <Col N="1764" /> him and encourage him.  He is on target; he is doing a major job of work for this country, and that is borne out by the fact that the Finance Bill went through the Dáil virtually unchallenged yesterday evening.  I welcome the Bill.  It gives this country and its people a lot of confidence in themselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must apologise to the House. My voice is a bit incoherent as I have a heavy cold.</P>
      <P>I am not entirely sure what I am listening to here.  I found a lot of what Senator McGowan had to say constructive and realistic.  He struck me as being an echo of what Fianna Fáil used to be stuck into, what Fianna Fáil has chosen to be at present, and trying his best to reconcile the two.  This is characteristic of a large section of people in this country who vote Fianna Fáil, because they are stuck in a different position, which some of us ought to do more to lead them out of. A lot of what he said was realistic and forthright.  He conceded that some people have suffered badly from the strategy of Government over the last two or three years but what he did not concede, and I am sure will not, is that it is the poorest, the most vulnerable and the least articulate who have suffered.  It is a fact that in virtually every health board in the country, where cutbacks have been made one of the major target areas has been psychiatric care.  One of the things about psychiatric patients, of course, is that they do not die as a result of their complaint and, therefore, there are no spectacular numbers to demonstrate the appalling nature of the health cuts.  These people can be allowed to rot in appalling conditions with limited nursing facilities and in some cases virtually none but nobody notices because they are rarely visited by their families.  This is the case particularly with long-term psychiatric patients.  Therefore it is not an accident that such groups are targeted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Bulbulia whom I admire for many of her positions, Senator McCormack and the entire Fine Gael Party have a damn cheek to start lecturing the nation <Col N="1765" /> about the consequences of Government policy on financial matters.  They are the ones who have been eager for cutbacks since 1981 and who claim credit when the cutbacks are popular.  They are somewhat disappointed at this stage that they are not getting more electoral support for what they believe to be their constructive role.  They are now, presumably because they sniff an election, trying to distance themselves from the unpleasant consequences of those cutbacks.  It is a very simple equation that needs to be straightened out.</P>
    <P>There is only one way to pay for public services in this country and that is by taxation.  The taxation can be deferred by borrowing but it cannot be avoided. Sooner or later you have to pay for public services.  If there is borrowing and it is used constructively, it stimulates growth which in turn generates revenue and that in turn becomes taxation to pay for the borrowing.  There is no way to pay for public services other than by taxation. Every demand for improved, extended or better public services is a demand for more extensive or higher taxation and I have no problems with that.</P>
    <P>A number of assumptions that have taken a hold on society over the past number of years are so profoundly untrue that even if what I say is noticed by nobody, it is important that it should go on the record.  I want to simply look back over the last number of years because a number of extremely important facts are not entered into in the discussion about the state of this country.  In the document <i>Strategy for Development 1986-1990</i> produced by the National Economic and Social Council, there are some very interesting statistics.  For instance, on page 56 they refer to the state of Government finances, net of the payment of national debt interest.  This document refers to 1981, and every year since then Government taxation revenue has more than exceeded total Government expenditure on all services if you exclude debt service. Since around 1980 we have not been giving ourselves an unpaid-for standard of living.  We have been endeavouring to maintain a constant level of services in <Col N="1766" /> the face of spiralling international interest rates.  The same document, on page 54, tabulates something very interesting which I think has not been adverted to by any of the economists, as most of them because of their own ideology, come to their conclusions before they begin to talk about their prescriptions for solutions, and that is that interest rates in this country changed dramatically between 1981 to 1985.  Real interest rates in this country were negative in 1981.  In other words, interest rates were below the rate of inflation.  Quite clearly a society in which interest rates are significantly less than the rate of inflation can keep borrowing indefinitely because inflation of itself will generate revenue which will be more than adequate to pay for any borrowing.  The interest on the borrowing will be accumulating at a lower rate than the appreciating revenue which results from inflation.</P>
    <P>Between 1981 and 1985 real interest rates increased in Ireland by 10.5 percentage points.  In West Germany real interest rates dropped over that period. In the United Kingdom real interest rates increased by only 3.4 per cent.  In the Netherlands, which had a budget deficit problem for a while, they also dropped. There is a plausible argument, that the problem in this country was not caused by an excessively high level of public services but by an unfortunate coincidence of international events.  The NESC document, <i>Strategy for Development 1986-1990,</i> also contains a speculative study on the impact of interest rates and currency fluctuations on Government expenditure and picks up figures of perhaps £500 million a year in terms of debt servicing costs that would have been avoided if these things had not gone wrong and changed unfavourably from our point of view in that period.</P>
    <P>I say that to supplement something that Senator McGowan said, which is that nothing has happened in this country over the last ten years to justify the sort of collective national self-mockery which has characterised a considerable part of <Col N="1767" /> media commentary on politicians, politics and Irish society generally.  We may have made mistakes but some of them were mistakes of development and some were mistakes of strategy but they were neither obvious nor self-evident in the way that certain economists suggested. The difficulty was, as has now become apparent, that international interest rates and the fluctuations in our currency were pushing up the cost of servicing our debt and Governments had the difficulty of either cutting back on barely adequate, and often totally inadequate, levels of public service provision or borrowing further. It was not a question of some glorious splurge of expenditure on luxury items, with massive social welfare increases, massive health expenditure or anything like that.</P>
    <P>The identified excesses like the increase in employment in the area of health services and so on are a minor part of the cost of the national debt.  An enormous part is the cost of servicing it from 1980 to 1989.  In that case we ought to address a lot of what we are talking about to whether that could have been avoided.  Of course, it could have been avoided because since 1973 we have had no death duties and since 1977 we have had no significant rates on domestic property and no agricultural rates.  Therefore, what we have done over those years &mdash; in many cases it has not been by Government policy although in some cases it was &mdash; is to squeeze more and more the section of our society which has to pay taxes and exclude greater and greater numbers of people to the extent that when the eminent British magazine, <i>The Economist,</i> did a survey in this country last year it felt moved to comment that we had produced the most extraordinary situation whereby we tax things like labour and goods that are mobile but do not tax those things in our society which are not mobile like property, capital, land etc.  The things that can move out from under a tax burden we try to tax and those things that cannot move we do not tax.</P>
    <P>In a country which was in a state of <Col N="1768" /> financial crisis up until two or three years ago, the issue of taxation was never addressed.  For instance, it was fashionable to suggest that Ireland was among the highest taxed nations in the world.  I do not have up-to-date figures; I am quoting from the 1988 edition of the OECD statistics of member countries. The total tax receipts as a percentage of gross domestic product in Ireland in 1985 was 39.1 per cent and, from the NESC report, I understand it stabilised around that and may have dropped slightly since. In some countries, for example, Australia, Greece and Italy tax revenue is less than that.  I will explain later why Italy has a low level of tax.  In other countries quite the opposite is the case. For example, total tax revenue in Austria is 42½ per cent of gross domestic product; in Denmark it is almost 50 per cent; in Sweden it is in excess of 50 per cent; in Norway it is 48 per cent; in the United Kingdom it is 38 per cent, almost the same as ours; in The Netherlands it is 45 per cent and in Luxembourg it is 43 per cent.  We are not a particularly highly taxed nation but we are taxed somewhat higher than our level of wealth might suggest.</P>
    <P>In the last 20 years we as a nation decided to give ourselves a good education system because we thought it was both good for our people and good for our industrial development and so we invested in education.  It is a demonstration of the basic ideological nature of a lot of what masquerades as independent economic advice that economists are allowed to get away with suggesting that investment in education is not a productive investment.  It is regarded as current expenditure which cannot produce any return.  There is probably no area of expenditure in our society which can and has produced a greater return to our society &mdash; notwithstanding emigration &mdash; than education. It is an indication of the depth of the ideological bias in much of the commentary that people have got away with, consistently saying that expenditure in education is current expenditure and <Col N="1769" /> non-productive expenditure.  Expenditure in education is productive expenditure. It expands the assets available in this country, as well as the wealth creation potential, apart altogether from the egalitarian objectives of giving people access to better jobs and better opportunities.</P>
    <P>We have to deal now with the symbols of this misrepresentation.  As I have said, and I want to keep saying, we are still being fed a line that it is necessary to cut taxes in order to create a climate for enterprise.  I understand that Fine Gael have proposals for a top rate of income tax of 40 per cent and a bottom rate of 25 per cent but I understand they have not yet made it clear whether this is to be brought about by a change in the tax structure or by a reduction in the overall level of taxation and I would like clarification on that.  At least the Progressive Democrats have said they will supplement taxation with a property tax &mdash; a proposal I would support.</P>
    <P>We cannot sustain a compassionate, cohesive community based on good public services and at the same time perpetually hammer away about the high levels of taxation.  That is inevitable given the large dependent population and given the fact that we have a very large level of non-participation in the workforce, by women in particular.  We have among the lowest levels of female participation in the workforce in the OECD and that is not all caused by unemployment.  There are cutural factors involved also, based on attitudes of people and especially on many women as to what they want to do with their lives.  I cannot speculate as to the degree to which one or other causes but that is a fact.  If a large proportion of our adult population is not involved in the workforce, obviously a smaller body of people will be involved in the creation of wealth and it is obviously inevitable, therefore, that the burden of taxation will bear more heavily on many of those.</P>
    <P>It is also true that if we have, as we have chosen to have a larger than average family size, that costs money in terms of the superb maternity care that at least we used to have, a maternity care that was <Col N="1770" /> best demonstrated by the most simple and most graphic of all indicators, the infant mortality rate.  The fact that, in terms of the rich countries of the world, this relatively poor country had an infant mortality rate which was dramatically less than that of the richest country in the world, demonstrates another of the myths that the economic ideologists have managed to foist upon this country, the favourite myth that our massive expenditure on health services did not do any good.  The index they use over and over again is that our life expectancy has not increased.  One of the improvements at one end of the scale is that there has been a dramatic drop, a credible and praiseworthy reduction, in infant mortality rates over the last ten years.  In a country which does not approve of the termination of pregnancy for reasons associated with perhaps the health of the foetus and where, therefore, unhealthy or handicapped infants are born and cherished, the achievement of superbly low levels of infant mortality is a first indicator that our health service and our health expenditure is achieving something worthwhile.</P>
    <P>Other areas where health expenditure has been extended are mental handicap and psychiatric services where there will not be an immediate improvement in life expectancy.  The favourite myth of the economic consensus that the increase in health expenditure produced no benefits is actual nonsense and, consequently, the idea that there is a massive amount of fat on the health services that could be cut back is also nonsense.  To have the party who forced the breakdown of a Government, because of their commitment to cutbacks in the health service, now march around the country criticising the condition of the health services is more than even I, as a politician with a reasonable capacity to stomach things, can stomach. I am not sure who upsets me most, Fianna Fáil because of their extraordinary promises before the election or Fine Gael with their long post-election conversion to the health services and the need for public expenditure in that area.  I will leave it to the two parties to resolve their problems <Col N="1771" /> between them but I cannot see any difference.</P>
    <P>I take exception to one reference in the Minister's speech, first, because it is not true and secondly, because there is a philosophical implication in it which deserves to be tackled head on, that is that high income tax rates are the enemy of personal incentive, motivation and job creation and lead to the emigration of many skilled young people.  I want to put on record something I said in Galway earlier this year.  Young people who have learned skills and everybody who has got a training or an education is heavily subsidised by the taxpayer. Outside of private primary education, there is no other area of self-financing education.  In every other area of education the taxpayer is a major investor.  These skilled young people whom people seem to feel sorry for, having benefited from other peoples' taxes, now take exception to having to pay taxes themselves and walk out of the country.  I want to say again for the record of this House, as I have said before, this country is better off without them.  If they cannot see the advantages of living in this country with a high taxation system which has provided an extraordinarily good service in education, which has a relatively low crime rate, an extraordinarily good environment in which to bring up children, in spite of everything, and if they are not prepared to recognise that in their time they were beneficiaries from Irish taxation, then I do not know if they have anything worthwhile to contribute to our society but I am convinced there are many others who do.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that a significant part of emigration results from the levels of taxation.  I know the vast majority of highly skilled young people towards whose education I contribute &mdash; and I am convinced at this stage that young people, in third level education at least, mostly educate themselves &mdash; never even think of taxation as a reason for emigration. They think of staying at home or of going abroad for a variety of reasons but taxation is the least of their concerns.  I <Col N="1772" /> would not worry if there are people leaving the country because of the high levels of taxation.  I think we are better off without them.</P>
    <P>As regards high income tax rates being the enemy of job creation, I will just quote a few figures.  In Finland &mdash; and I an quoting from the OECD figures again &mdash; in 1985 the percentage of disposable income of the average single production worker, the category that most of our economists target on as being particularly heavily taxed, was 65.8 per cent.  Unemployment in that country in 1987 was 5 per cent.  Just for the record, the figure for disposable income in Ireland is 64.8 per cent, which is not significantly different and unemployment is in or around 18 or 19 per cent. In Austria the percentage for disposable income was 73.4 per cent and the unemployment rate was 3.1 per cent; in Norway the percentage was 67.3 per cent and the unemployment rate was 2.1 per cent; in Sweden the percentage was 64.4 per cent and the unemployment rate was 1.9 per cent and in Denmark the percentage was 63.7 per cent and the unemployment rate was 8 per cent.</P>
    <P>I do not claim that proves anything positive but it demonstrates that it is idiotic nonsense to simply assume, because we feel like assuming, or because some people of a particular frame of mind feel like assuming, that there is some connection between levels of income tax an employment, unemployment or job creation.  There is manifest evidence that there are countries with high levels of taxation and very low levels of unemployment and there are countries with low levels of taxation and very low levels of unemployment, just as there are countries with high levels of taxation and high levels of unemployment.  There is no clear correlation.  It is not about simple mechanistic economics; it is about public policy and strategies based on job creation.</P>
    <P>While I am addressing the issue of taxation and job creation, I wish we could get away from the perpetual whinge about employers' PRSI. Employers' PRSI in this country is among the lowest by any index in the OECD.  For instance, <Col N="1773" /> as a percentage of total tax receipts, employers' PRSI in this country is 9.4 per cent.  There are only four or five countries in the OECD where employers' PRSI contributes a lesser proportion to total tax receipts.</P>
    <P>It is time we got away from the idea that there is a single remedy to this country's problems and that it is taxation. What we have actually done in this daft pursuit of one solution to our problems is, for instance, encouraged 15,000 public servants to become unemployed.  Many of them are paid fairly substantial pensions and are now taking up jobs in the private sector that would otherwise be taken by other people.  In some cases, according to their own estimates, we are paying them up to 80 per cent of what they were earning when they were in the public service, paying them to do nothing, or we are supplementing their income from somewhere else, We did that not to save the State an awful lot of money, because that did not happen, but we simply got involved in a clever accounting exercise which gave the impression that we were saving the State money and having given that impression, we ignored the consequences.  All those people are being paid by the State and the lump sums they got were financed by the State.  The fact that the Government borrowed from a Government agency and, therefore, it does not show up as Government borrowing does not get away from the fact that we have seriously depleted the reserves of the Central Bank and the potential contribution of Central Bank profits to Government revenue. The economists and bankers who comment on Government policy were not really concerned about that.  They were concerned about a perception that the public service should be reduced.</P>
    <P>As a society we are not excessively taxed.  We are heavily taxed because we believe in communal services, in communal mutual support, in a good education service and in the necessity to invest in order for our future to develop.  Because we believe that, we have chosen to have relatively high levels of taxation in some <Col N="1774" /> areas.  Of course, one of the great injustices of this country is that we have chosen not to have high taxes in some other areas and in those areas we have allowed people to get away with the most scandalous rip-offs in terms of capital acquisitions, manipulation of large amounts of property, ownership of property and ownership of capital.</P>
    <P>Of course, on the issue of a wealth tax, we have allowed the small scale of revenue to divert the entirety of society's attention away from the real reason for a wealth tax which is not just to generate revenue but to enable revenue-gathering authorities to reconcile the stated income of somebody for income tax with their accumulated wealth.  There is no quicker way of detecting tax avoidance and tax evasion on a grand scale than to force somebody to disclose the entirety of the value of what they own.  There are a considerable number of professional people in our society who would have to pay real levels of income tax if they had to disclose their assets, even if it was only for a 0.1 per cent level of wealth tax.  I believe in a wealth tax, not because I think it can generate enormous amounts of revenue but because I believe it can generate an awful lot of information which can be used to generate a lot of revenue from those who avoid paying income tax.</P>
    <P>On the same topic of Irish taxes, their alleged disincentive effect, the nonsensical nature of it and, indeed, the way large sections of our society have actually been ripped off by public policy over the past 16 or 17 years, it is worth referring to an article in the spring 1989 edition of the <i>Irish Banking Review</i>.  The article is about changes in productivity and living standards and gives an extremely lucid, legible and intelligible account of what has happened to industrial, agricultural, and services productivity in this country over the past 16 years.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann, bearing in mind that this Government since coming into office has reduced health spending from 7 per cent to 6 per cent of GNP, calls upon the Government as a matter of the gravest urgency to provide an extra £70 million immediately, as an emergency injection into the health services, to remedy situations such as the following:</P>
      <P>(a)  enormous waiting lists for hospital admissions,</P>
      <P>(b)  the totally inadequate level of community care services,</P>
      <P>(c)  the derisory level of services for the handicapped,</P>
      <P>(d)  the intolerable delays being encountered by out-patients even when they have hospital appointments,</P>
      <P>(e)  the low morale and stress that staff in the health areas are increasingly subject to,</P>
      <P>(f)  the decimation of the psychiatric services and the consequent social problems,</P>
      <P>(g)  the accelerating movement towards a two tiered health service where the ability to pay rather than need dictates who receives the service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party, in bringing this motion before the Seanad, is in no way suggesting that there is not a problem with the national finances.  What we are saying, and saying very emphatically, is that the measures taken by this Government in the health area go beyond what is acceptable. There is a worsening crisis in the <Col N="1776" /> health services that is nothing short of a national scandal, and which requires the immediate injection of emergency funds.</P>
    <P>Health expenditure in this country was, until 1986, higher than the OECD average but now it is substantially below that.  During Deputy Barry Desmond's term as Minister for Health, Exchequer expenditure on the health services was at 7 per cent of GNP.  It is now at 6 per cent. This motion is seeking an immediate injection of £70 million to deal with the present shambles that causes suffering and death.  Let me say that the £70 million is about ½ per cent of GNP.  We are not seeking in this motion to restore the spending to 7 per cent of GNP.  Rather we are looking for an immediate £70 million to deal with problems which I intend outlining later in my speech.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party salutes those who are employed in the health services.  They are working under deteriorating conditions and they have responded magnificently, but with the pressure they are encountering there is only so much that they can do.</P>
    <P>This Government and their Minister have sacked 6,000 health workers and closed 4,000 hospital beds.  They have also bankrupted the Voluntary Health Insurance Board.  The Blackrock Clinic and the Mater Private Hospital have drained funds from the VHI, which it was not meant to provide to them.  The Minister responded to this situation, but not before enormous damage was done. A two-tiered health service is evolving and this has been roundly condemned not alone by the Labour Party but by the Churches.  &ldquo;Love thy neighbour&rdquo; in terms of the health services has become a hollow phrase when we examine the services available to the poor.</P>
    <P>This occasion should not be allowed pass without putting on record the destructive and reckless approach Fianna Fáil public representatives at all levels, both in the Oireachtas and throughout the country, to the previous Minister for Health, Deputy Barry Desmond, when he retained and streamlined the service. The cynical U-turn which Fianna Fáil is guilty of since coming to office cannot <Col N="1777" /> be condemned or exposed often enough. They viciously attacked the marvellous achievement of Deputy Desmond in very difficult circumstances.  They promised the electorate an unattainable level of health services in a totally dishonourable and dishonest quest for power, and then on coming to power progressively destroyed those same services.  I believe that this dishonesty and deceit will never be forgiven.</P>
    <P>We must deal with the here and now, and Fianna Fáil have the opportunity of redeeming in part their credibility in the health services.  Admittedly, all of the blame is not Fianna Fáil's because the right wing consensus in Dáil Éireann was necessary to allow the Government to carry out the cruel decimation of the health services.  The horror stories regarding our hospitals grow and grow. Geriatric and acute and surgical medical in-patients are those most affected.  Waiting lists continue to rise at an alarming rate.  Health boards have been forced to close beds and wards in hospitals.  There is a chronic shortage of beds, and patients who are on in-patient waiting lists are being forced on to already excessively long out-patient waiting lists.  The system is choking itself and the casualties are overworked staff and neglected patients. This totally unacceptable situation is to be condemned but more importantly rectified as a matter of the gravest urgency.</P>
    <P>In the South Eastern Health Board region there are very long in-patient and out-patient waiting lists.  There have been appalling increases in the numbers on the waiting lists in the first three months of this year.  The in-patient waiting list has increased from 907 to 977 in that period. The out-patient list has increased from 2,797 to 3,055 during the same period. Let no one tell this House that this is not a gravely worsening crisis.  The total waiting lists in South Eastern Health Board hospitals for the first three months of this year showed that in-patient numbers on the waiting lists have increased from 2,655 to 2,754 and out-patient numbers have increased from 3,891 to 4,236. These are not just statistics but people, and in many cases they are in grave need. <Col N="1778" /> In addition, patients are being discharged from hospitals earlier to make way for acute admissions.  The effect of this is that an intolerable burden is being placed on GPs and on public health nurses in the community care area.</P>
    <P>Rationalisation of community nursing services is deepening the problem because of the non-replacement of posts and the curtailment of nurses' travelling expenses.  This was always an excellent service but now it is being progressively reduced to a shambles.  Again those at risk are the old, the sick and the handicapped. Out-patient waiting lists are a national scandal.  They are causing death and great suffering.  People are spending days in hospitals after being given appointments and go home without meeting a consultant.  The system is not reacting quickly enough to the needs of people who require urgent attention. When we talk of community care services we must look at how they relate to psychiatric patients.</P>
    <P>This Government's commitment to the Minister's Department's plan <i>Planning for the Future</i>, is as hollow as the posters that littered the country before the last general election stating that: &ldquo;Health cuts hurt the old, the sick and the handicapped.&rdquo; Patients are being sent out into the community &mdash; and I will deal with this more specifically later on &mdash; without adequate back-up services.  The whole rationale of <i>Planning the Future</i> was to get people out of institutional care, but it is a meaningless and may I say dangerous exercise to put psychiatric patients into the community without appropriate back-up.  In the south-eastern region, 570 beds were closed at the end of last year, 200 of which were in St. Otteran's Psychiatric Hospital, Waterford.  There is a chronic under-provision of medium-term care in the psychiatric services.</P>
    <P>Alarming rates of suicide among psychiatric patients have been reported in newspapers in my area.  Any society with pretensions to being called a caring society should be judged on how it cares for those who in the material and human sense are the least among us.  There is another national scandal relating to the <Col N="1779" /> handicapped which needs to be addressed and improved dramatically and urgently. There are 20,000 mentally handicapped adults and children who need speech therapy services.  Throughout this country we have the equivalent of 27 speech therapists attending them.  In my own area mentally handicapped children receive something between seven and nine minutes speech therapy per week. This service continues to worsen and is pathetically inadequate even as it stands.</P>
    <P>Indeed, I have personal experience of this problem.  I have a daughter with Down's Syndrome.  Thankfully, she has no real problem with her speech, but I encounter other children who understand speech but because of the lack of the professional assistance of speech therapists they cannot reproduce it.  It is a heart-rending experience to observe these children.  They understand what is being said to them.  There is a peculiar difficulty with regard to Down's Syndrome children because the tongue is a little large for the mouth cavity.  In many of these cases to progress towards adequate speech they need a great deal of attention from speech therapists in their early years.  When you observe them you know they understand speech.  In their minds they can reproduce it but the final act of sending the message from the brain to the tongue does not happen because they have not been guided on how to do it.</P>
    <P>Some of these children become bold and less adjusted.  As they move towards maturity they are less adjusted individuals because of the damage that is done at an early stage.  They become a greater problem for their parents.  Indeed, in many cases they become more of a burden on the State.  This could all be rectified if there was an injection of funds, if we got our act together in providing speech therapists nationally.  What is happening at present is shameful.  I know that a special interest group of speech therapists presented a report to the Minister recently and that the Minister has some dealings with them.  We <Col N="1780" /> need a solution.  These children are suffering from the lack of something which is vital.  As human beings we have, above all other forms of creation, our ability to communicate with one another.  If for no other reason the Minister should accept this motion and provide extra funds.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer again to the appalling situation in our hospitals.  I have given the number of people on our dramatically increasing in-patient and out-patient lists.  I should like to read a letter from Mr. Gordon Watson, a surgeon at Ardkeen Hospital, Waterford, which was published in <i>The Irish Times</i> last Saturday. He was referring to an RTE programme regarding the emergency and accident services in Dublin.  He said:</P>
    <P>Being in absolute agreement with Professor Thomas Hennessy and his associates regarding the recent failure of accident and emergency services in Dublin, I wish to emphasise that the problems they discussed on RTE recently may be a countrywide phenomenon.</P>
    <P>On the same day as St. James's Hospital, Dublin, reported to be one of the largest hospital complexes in Europe, ground to administrative chaos, having received 15 surgical admissions from a total of 38 emergency patients, the general surgical department at Waterford Regional Hospital (48 beds) received 10 acute admissions and over the past week 42 acute general surgical emergencies were admitted and treated on site. Unlike St. James's on &ldquo;supertake&rdquo; every third night, Waterford Regional Hospital is on call for 24 hours every day.  With such an emergency load resulting in a bed occupancy of 107 per cent last year, there is little chance that out-patients and elective surgical waiting lists can be managed effectively.</P>
    <P>Hence, if a commission is established to examine emergency hospital services in Dublin, as Professor Hennessy advised, might I recommended that its terms of reference be expanded to include the country nationwide.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1781" /> It gives me no pleasure to say to the Minister here tonight that, in my considered view from my experience as a public representative, the cutbacks which have been implemented by this Government have resulted in the most awful suffering and in some instances in deaths. Who is suffering?  We talk in terms of getting the country's finances in order. There is no one in this House who does not agree that the country's finances have to be put in order.  The real question is: who pays?  Unfortunately &mdash; and in a sense this is a terrible indictment against this Oireachtas &mdash; it is the very people on whose behalf this Government festooned the country with posters before the last election.  The Government has broken faith totally with them.  They are the ones who are suffering.</P>
    <P>I belong to the only real Opposition party in this House, the only party who are proud to speak for these people, who make no apologies for speaking on their behalf and who will continue to speak for them.  The geriatric patient who cannot get into a geriatric hospital; the child or adult who requires speech therapy services, the person who is referred by a GP and who, because of inordinate delays in seeing a consultant at the initial stages, may well have a terminal condition by the time he or she is dealt with and examined.</P>
    <P>Our society has become very mercenary in many ways.  The consensus in the Dáil leads to an accountancy mentality. We must get the finances of the country in order &mdash; but the caring attitude has been lost.  The whole ethos of that right wing consensus is that we will brush all these problems into the background somewhere, forget about them for the time being and, when everything comes right with our finances, the poor can be looked after.  We are seeking nothing less than the level of service Deputy Desmond provided during his term as Minister for Health.  At that time a reckless and power hungry Opposition came in here day after day and vilified the Minister. They pilloried him but when they came to power they reduced the funding of the health services by 1 per cent of GNP.  In effective terms they took <Col N="1782" /> between £140 million and £150 million out of the service.</P>

      <P>The hyprocrisy displayed by this Government is unbelievable.  I feel sick when I recall those posters with which the Minister's party festooned this country.  Once Fianna Fáil came to power, admittedly needing the help of a right wing consensus to keep them there, they kept on attacking the poor, the sick and the handicapped.  It is not too late to redeem something of the real Fianna Fáil, the Fianna Fáil of the thirties who were a caring party.  I believe that caring element is gone in this party today.  Whatever, the Minister and the people in those benches say the poor, the sick and the handicapped are suffering.  The services which are so necessary for them have been attacked viciously by this Government on a day to day basis.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to accept this motion or, failing that, to show some sensitivity for the terrible crisis which exists in the health services at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion on behalf of the Labour Party group in the Seanad.  As Senator O'Shea said, it gives us no joy whatsoever to have to return to this subject which we discussed in this House last year.  Last year we were looking for the re-opening of institutions and hospitals which were closed by this Government.  We received no support for our efforts to redress the damage caused to our health services by a loss of beds. We are forced to bring to the attention of the Minister, in response to requests from people throughout the country, that unless additional funding is made available by a minority Fianna Fáil Government the health services will collapse around us like a pack of cards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have travelled throughout the Munster region over the last three months campaigning door to door for the European election.  I found that people have a cardinal interest in the health services.  Once you knock on the door and try to discuss <Col N="1783" /> the importance of the European Parliament election, their first concern is for the health services.  This is repeated on doorsteps throughout Munster, the region I am contesting.</P>
    <P>I want to sound a word of warning to the Taoiseach through the Minister that if the Government decide to call a general election, they will find there is widespread anger because of the way the poor and the sick have been treated and the lack of health services.  This surpasses all other considerations: unemployment, emigration, social welfare, etc.  Everybody I have spoken to accepts that the Government have been trying to address the financial problems in this country but they have not made health care a priority. That is true in the Cathaoirleach's Clare constituency, I visited on Monday.  In Ennis County Hospital they are at sixes and sevens as to how long they can continue.</P>
    <P>Limerick is devastated following the closure of Barrington's Hospital, which was a politically inopportune thing to do at the time.  Now demands and pressures are on the Regional Hospital.  In North Tipperary the concept of an acute surgical hospital in Nenagh is under threat. If vacancies occur at consultant level, the likelihood of being able to employ anybody is slight.</P>
    <P>In my own constituency, South Tipperary, the record is dreadful.  We have closed acute hospital beds.  We have closed sub-acute hospitals like St. Vincent's in Tipperary town which preceded the foundation of this state and it took a Fianna Fáil Government to close it.  We have closed beds in Cashel County Hospital.  We have closed beds in St. Joseph's County Hospital and we have closed beds in St. Luke's Psychiatric Hospital after tremendous improvements had been carried out by previous Governments of all political hues.  They have shown complete disregard for the views of the professionals involved in the service and the views of public representatives.</P>
    <P>Irrespective of the fact that Deputy Desmond managed to commission a new <Col N="1784" /> psychiatric unit in St. Luke's, this Government closed the same number of beds in a different part of the hospital the following year.  That is not progress in my opinion because we would not have built a new unit if there was not a need for it.</P>
    <P>I have canvassed extensively throughout Cork and Kerry, the Southern Health Board area.  The sacking of a deputy CEO is not the answer to the acute financial problem of the Southern Health Board.  There has been a court decision requesting that Mallow Hospital should be restored to its former level as an acute hospital serving a vast rural region.  The closure of hospitals in Cork city have put an extraordinary demand on the services being provided at the Wilton Regional Hospital.  There have been bed losses in the new hospital in Tralee together with the loss of nurses.  No ENT service is available for anybody in Kerry and people and are now required to travel to Cork for treatment.  This has created crisis management and is a crisis for patients in need.</P>
    <P>We now have a new régime in the Southern Health Board area which requires that there will be no further admissions to geriatric hospitals, welfare homes, etc.  People are being discharged from hospital compulsorily at weekends even if they are not medically fit, to be brought back again on Monday morning. Did we ever think we would see the day when you could not be sick at the weekend, that your sickness would be confined to a five day week?  We have moved very far away from the comprehensive health service to which the people have contributed by way of their PRSI and the taxes.</P>
    <P>In Senator O'Shea's constituency look at the chaos following the closure of the Waterford City Infirmary in Ardkeen. They are in the process of constructing a new regional hospital on that site which was approved by Deputy Desmond. There is no hope of having a hip replacement operation even if you have VHI cover.  Consultants are now requesting special payments in addition to VHI fees. We have early discharges following surgery. One man aged 96 was threatened <Col N="1785" /> with early discharge from hospital following a hip operation and there was nobody to look after him at home.  The unemployed have been forced to go to the credit unions to borrow money for a pacemaker.  How far more are this Government prepared to go?  In most instances there is no transport available. People with one child may be able to thumb a lift but they would not get a lift if they had two children with them.</P>
    <P>The Minister said there will be no extra funding provided for health services.  He also accused a previous Minister and a previous Government of overspending. As Senator O'Shea said week after week they continued to request additional funding and health boards dominated by Fianna Fáil members refused to meet their statutory obligations to make changes in the management structure or to make efforts to make ends meet.  Now we have the sad fact that there is less money for the health services. Fianna Fáil dominate the health boards and a Fianna Fáil Minister is now refusing to meet the needs in the areas I mentioned in Munster.</P>
    <P>It is no joy for me to have to say this. The matter is now of extreme urgency before there is a major loss of life.  I do not think that is what the Minister wants. But that is inevitable if something is not done immediately.</P>

      <P>I have read this motion and I can understand why the Labour Party wanted to raise this matter.  It is a very emotive subject.  I am not questioning the sincerity of Senator O'Shea. I firmly believe he wishes the Government to carry out what he has embodied in the motion.  I might refer Senator O'Shea and the House to the fact that he says that health spending has dropped from 7 per cent to 6 per cent of GNP.  I wonder where he got those figures, because I did a little research on it.  We will take December 1986 against December 1988, because that was the last time we had Deputy Barry Desmond in power.  In 1986, the percentage of GNP spent on health was 7 per cent.  On 31 <Col N="1786" /> December 1988 the percentage of GNP spent on health was 7 per cent.  We should put that in proper perspective from the beginning.</P>
      <P>I would like to see an improvement in the health services but you have to put it in proper perspective.  More money does not necessarily mean better health.  I learned this a long time ago.  You just cannot allocate money and expect the health of the nation to improve because that will not happen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Britain spends 6.5 per cent on the health services and we spend 6 per cent.  Britain is a far wealthier country than Ireland, but they do not spend very much more on their health services.  What I see wrong is not that we do not spend enough money on the health services but that we do not use it wisely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a tremendous waste and inefficiency in the health services, and having worked in the health and hospital services for many years I saw tremendous waste.  The X-ray departments closed at 5 p.m. each day.  People would be taken into hospital on a Friday and tests would not commence until Monday or Tuesday.  That is inefficiency. In the United States, we would admit a patient at 5 p.m. and all the tests would be done and the patient discharged the next day at 10.30 a.m.  Inefficiency is the biggest problem in our health services. That is the first thing we have got to look at.  We must streamline our health services.  Many hospitals which have been <Col N="1788" /> closed recently should have been closed many years ago.  They were inefficient, they were not doing the job and in my view should have been closed long ago.</P>
    <P>The next problem I would like the House to consider is that in recent years we have had some major technological breakthroughs and advances in medicine which we never contemplated, and these are very costly operations.  The public have not come to terms with these costs. It is a new burden on the health services that we have got to look at.  We must consider this.  Hip operations, heart and kidney transplants, coronary by-pass surgery cost many thousands of pounds and we were not geared for that.  We are a small country and we do not have the finances for this, considering that we had to borrow £800 million this year to pay for our services and we are paying £2 billion a year in interest alone on the national debt.  That is a lot of money for a small country to have to pay.  I am not saying who caused it: we have this debt on our hands and we have got to pay it. The public must have a debate on this, on the costs, who is going to pay it, and what our priorities are, because I believe many of these breakthroughs are eroding the other services which are urgently needed &mdash; the geriatric and psychiatric services.  I believe the maldistribution of the funds across the spectrum of health care is causing the problem.  I would like to see this area improved.  More money will not necessarily mean better health.  I can understand the demands that are being made and there are a lot of pressures from different areas, such as hospitals, telling Senators what is happening and asking us to get things done. I honestly believe inefficiency is the root cause of our problem.</P>
    <P>We are told there are very long waiting lists.  I had occasion to study some of these waiting lists recently.  A woman told me she had to have fusion of the spine. That is a major operation and is not without great risk to the patient.  When I talked to her about her condition I advised her to please get off the waiting list because it would be very dangerous to have this operation.  I told her it was a <Col N="1789" /> hazardous operation and should not be done except in serious cases.  This woman's symptoms did not warrant it. We need to have a monthly review of these waiting lists to see what is wrong. Another woman had a hammer toe and she felt it needed treatment urgently. When I investigated I found it did not necessarily need an operation and a little chiropractic treatment or perhaps some other work would have been better.</P>
    <P>People complain that they are discharged from hospital early and others say they were discharged after two days. I say it is in their interests to get them home after two days.  Lying in bed is very dangerous for patients.  Sending patients home at weekends is a very good idea. That is not a callous approach.  It is a very humane approach.  I do not think hospital beds are the answer.  If I had my way I would want to see the prescribed relatives allowance being doubled or trebled so that elderly people could be kept at home.  It is wrong to send them to homes and geriatric places.  We must adopt a more humane attitude towards them.</P>
    <P>When I worked in out-patients and accident departments, I found many of these cases should not have been there. There is also a disorderly arrangement about appointments and so on.  I came back from America to work in the Mater Hospital as a registrar.  The out-patients department would start at 9 a.m. and it would not be finished until 3 p.m.  I got it finished at 11 a.m. with a little efficiency. That is what we need.  I am trying to highlight efficiency as the real solution to our problem.  Two Labour Ministers Brendan Corish and Deputy Barry Desmond &mdash; emphasised this over and over again.  The bible of the Labour Party at the time was Cooper's &ldquo;Rationing of Health Care.&rdquo; Brendan Corish said the answer was a proper efficient approach to the health services.  I did not complain when Deputy Barry Desmond as Minister for Health, cut back.  I said it was the right approach.  I believe if we should have a more efficient health service, but the one we have at the moment, I agree that there are problems but it all depends on the way it is handled.</P>

      <P>We have got to consider what is using up the total funds of the health services, and give priority to the areas to which Senator O'Shea referred.

      <P>Having listened to the two speakers before me I think the remedy to our problems lies somewhere between the two.  I do not necessarily think that it is a case of throwing more money into the health services, nor do I agree with the rationalisation that Senator O'Connell has engaged in.  I believe it is a question, perhaps of inefficiency, but at the end of the day it is a question of management, and the management of the health services is the responsibility of the Minister and the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This debate is taking place against the background of confusion, criticism and of disaffection about the health services as delivered to thousands of consumers here.  Our voices will join those of others here in the Oireachtas, in the local authorities, in the health boards and in the <Col N="1791" /> community, all saying the same thing. There is something desperately wrong with our health care, it is on the verge of crisis and it is the very vulnerable people, the old and the handicapped, who are its victims. I have no doubt that the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon, and his Minister of State, who is here with us, and Department officials mean well and have the best of intentions in the job they are doing, but this is not enough.  Good intent will not sort out the present dilemma. Accepting that there is an all-time crisis and setting out to take practical measures to rectify matters will work.</P>
    <P>We are talking about a Department with one of the biggest, if not the biggest, budget of all in the region of £1.3 billion. It is an awesome amount of money for health care and does not even include the £120 million that 34 per cent of the population pay for VHI for separate cover.  We spend £22.50 <i>per capita</i> whereas Britain spends £23 per head of the population.  The difference is that for 50p more the British health consumer gets much more than his Irish counterpart. They get free GP care, free hospital care, free consultant care and free drugs. That is for everyone in the UK, 100 per cent of the population.  Here, we give only 40 per cent of the population, those on medical cards, something remotely like the British give.</P>
    <P>It means that, indeed, if somebody like Margaret Thatcher, Neil Kinnock or anyone else in a high earning capacity wanted to avail of public health services, they could do so.  Of course, people like this who are at the top end of the income bracket prefer not to take up their national health entitlements, they have private insurance, but that is their option. The big question that should be addressed is, why is there such a lack of proportion, why is the Irish taxpayer getting such bad value and how soon can the system be reformed to make it responsive and satisfactory?</P>
    <P>It would take much longer time than I have here tonight to adequately address the problems being experienced at <Col N="1792" /> present.  To be done accurately and geographically it would take a day and sound like a journey of distress and hardship around the country.  Hospitals all over the country are hardpressed, under-funded and understaffed.  We saw the almost total breakdown of one system with the disgraceful events in the Southern Health Board region last month and the distress caused to the employees in Tralee General Hospital.  We witnessed the unseemly public row between the Minister and a Southern Health Board official.</P>
    <P>We can add a situation of one scapegoat after another being offered up on the alter of inefficiency, poor planning and bad communications, but at the end of the day the responsibility for the delivery of health care comes back to the Minister.  If the health boards are not fulfilling their obligations or by their structure are unable to fulfil their obligations as well now in the eighties and going into the nineties as they did when they were first set up let us admit it and propose a change.  Let us look at, maybe, the proposal from Fine Gael for a new structure, An Bord Slán.  Perhaps that is the direction in which we need to go.</P>
    <P>In reading the Minister's speeches in the Dáil and here and his answers to parliamentary questions, I was struck by the sort of new speak he indulges in.  It is a substitute vocabulary, we see words like &ldquo;rationalisation&rdquo; when what is meant is &ldquo;cutback&rdquo; or &ldquo;reduce&rdquo;, &ldquo;restructured&rdquo; or &ldquo;reorganised&rdquo; which really means &ldquo;the service is gone&rdquo; or as close to as makes no matter. It is an unhelpful way to deal with issues as is the current trend in the Department of Health of setting up committees, commissions and working parties. On one count recently, it was discovered that something like 50 working parties of one kind or another are operating.  These are all delaying tactics, delaying action and delaying decisions on action, as I well know.</P>
    <P>To deal with a few specifics, one group most severely pressed &mdash; there can be no dispute about this from anybody &mdash; are old age pensioners.  Although there is an excellent report on the Minister's desk, <Col N="1793" /><i>The Years Ahead: A Policy for the Elderly,</i> there are, as far as I am concerned, no plans being put forward to implement any of its excellent proposals, the most pressing being the need for geriatric hospital care and community support services. A phased programme of action over five years is badly needed and no group are more deserving.  The last speaker dealt with the joy of going home. I agree it can be a joy to go home at the weekend from hospital if you are going home to a well supported home and you have enough money to be able to look after yourself.  Of course, it is an ideal thing that our old people should spend their last years in their own homes or with their relatives, but this is an ideal, it is not the reality.  The reality is that many old people need some domiciliary care or residential home.  These are very scarce and very expensive, so you have a situation where thousands of old people are making second best arrangements.  That is not good enough.</P>
    <P>I am sure others will have mentioned the lack of facilities for bone marrow transplants.  Again, this is something that comes up.  It is a reality, not a myth. There are serious hold-ups here in making this procedure available in St. James's Hospital.  It is a remarkable treatment and a life saver for many, particularly children, with chronic blood disease.  When can we hope to cope with all the cases needing treatment here at home?</P>
    <P>On 15 March, when the Minister for Health was asked about the number of people awaiting hip replacements &mdash; this is something the last speaker dealt with &mdash; he gave the figure of 2,000 in a reply to a parliamentary question in the Dáil. You cannot rationalise away that figure. If one needs a hip replacement, one needs it badly.  It is not something that cures itself or that can be left for one year, two years or three years.  Among the waiting numbers are old people with arthritis, possibly in pain, as well as some people I know very closely who are young haemophiliacs, in early middle age, who are handicapped and have restricted mobility because of damage to joints through <Col N="1794" /> bleeding.  I believe there should be a special programme to reduce that number of 2,000.</P>
    <P>An area I have spoken about previously is that of health education.  Unfortunately, the health promotion unit continues to decline.  It plays a very poor role in preventative medicine or in promoting positive health and is limited by getting only 1.7 per cent of the Health Estimate.  Because of low morale and no true commitment to the work it needs to do, staff are leaving, people with experience and commitment to health education. This is very serious in view of the fact that there is unanimous agreement that there are long-term gains and benefits to proper health promotion and health education.</P>
    <P>I mention one group particularly who were involved in the health promotion unit, the Irish National Council on Alcoholism.  They did excellent work but they got into financial difficulties.  Their grant was either reduced or terminated. They could no longer continue and so were subsumed into the Department. With the serious problems we have in this country of alcohol abuse and the extent to which it affects family life, health and employment, there is a need for a meaningful body on alcohol prevention such as the Irish National Council on Alcoholism. Because of a lack of commitment there and official inaction, since then this organisation has died.  This is very regrettable. Now there is no planning, no public education, no monitoring group specifically committed to public education on alcoholism.  This is another sign of the way priorities are decided in the health services.  Regardless of long term gain there is no thought given to the needless ending of an organisation like this.</P>
    <P>There are many examples of what is happening but of which people generally may not be aware.  People like us hear of the chronic cases, those who are under great stress, people who phone you up or write to you.  There are a lot of areas we do not see.  Again, I come back to the mismanagement of the total budget and the lack of action where there are bad procedures or bad practices in health <Col N="1795" /> boards throughout the country.  It is a very fundamental problem.  I do not necessarily believe it needs the kind of funds that are being proposed in this motion.  For that reason we will be abstaining on this issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Leyden)</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion before the House tonight seems to come from a different world, as if the last few years never happened.  In fact, it seems, with respect to Senator Ferris, to be more related to a forthcoming election with the list of institutions in the Munster area particularly, than to the reality of the situation.  It also seems to ignore the factual situation where there was an overspending of £50 million by the former Labour Minister, Deputy Barry Desmond, who was then Minister for Health. Is this funding in addition to the £50 million that was overspent at the time?  It seems that the Labour philosophy seems to be to throw money at a problem, not to work out the situation.</P>
      <P>The motion ignores the lesson that we cannot resolve the problems of the health services by throwing more money at them, particularly when that money is untargeted and non-specific in purpose nor is it clear as to how it is quantified and calculated.  The motion also ignores the lessons of the last two years, when the Government pulled the country back from the brink of financial disaster and, in the process, set out on the transformation of the health services into the new, streamlined and efficient system that is now emerging.</P>
      <P>The general thrust of this Government's policy on the public finances enjoys overwhelming support throughout the country.  The benefits of this policy are beginning to be seen in the economy and there is a new air of national confidence. We have, however, made it clear that there is still a long way to go.  We will still be borrowing over £800 million this year to meet day to day spending. We will still be paying over £2 billion to meet the cost of servicing our accumulated national debt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1796" /> I should like to remind the House that from 1982 until 1987 our national debt rose by £12 billion under a Coalition Government which included the Labour Party.  The same amount was borrowed from the foundation of the State to 1982 as was borrowed from 1982 until 1987. Despite this, the Government have increased this year's provision for health, as a percentage of net non-capital supply services, to 19.7 per cent, as compared with last year's provision of 18.8 per cent.</P>
    <P>Against this background how can we talk about injecting an extra £70 million into the health services?  Where would the money come from?  What, precisely, would it set out to achieve?  What would be the consequences for the hard won turnaround in the public finances?  Would it entail increasing our tax, our PAYE contributions or other forms of taxation? No mention is made in the motion as to where this money will come from.</P>
    <P>I want to make it absolutely clear that I accept without question that there are areas in which the health services need improvement.  The demands on the health services are increasing all the time. New technology is constantly becoming available, often at very high cost.  Indeed, I must say that I appreciate the contribution made by Senator John O'Connell, a man who has the practical experience of the health services.  In fact, his constituency clinic is a real clinic, according to the information given to this House.  His experience in the service is very much appreciated here in this debate.</P>
    <P>At any time one can point to gaps in the service.  This is true of any country, no matter how affluent.  It is widely recognised that if one set out to meet every demand in the health services, no conceivable budget would ever be enough. The challenge, therefore, is to ensure that the service is constantly being streamlined and adapted to meet ever-changing needs as efficiently as possible. Priorities must be set and must constantly be updated as technology changes, as society changes and as our demands on the health services change.  This means that new developments and new servcies <Col N="1797" /> are constantly needed.  However, it also means that other facilities and services become outdated and have to give way to the new priorities.</P>
    <P>The problem we faced on coming to office was that this nettle had not been grasped.  Much had been promised about streamlining the health services and increasing their efficiency, but very little had been delivered.  The Government, on the other hand, did not shirk from the challenge and the necessary streamlining has been taking place.</P>
    <P>We have excellent health services and we should be proud of them.  The facilities available and the skills and commitment of our health care personnel are unparalleled in any country at our level of economic development and wealth.  That is not to say that there are no problems in the delivery of services, no unnecessary delays, no shortfalls in the provision of important services of certain types.  Of course there are.  They were there before we came into office and they cannot be removed overnight.  Throwing money at the health services willy-nilly is not the answer.  Not only is it a short-term measure but it worsens the long-term position by reinforcing the very inefficiencies we need to remove.</P>
    <P>The only way that services can be developed and improved to meet the acknowledged gaps and shortfalls is to identify and remove inefficiencies, outdated facilities and services which no longer merit the priority once attached to them.  The health services must constantly change and be renewed, but it is only since this Government came into office that this basic truth has been recognised, accepted and implemented.</P>
    <P>In the last two years we have closed facilities that were surplus to requirements. We have also seen many new developments in both institutional and community based care.  We have greatly increased the productivity of the services, thanks in particular to the efforts of our medical and nursing staff.  Indeed, I would like to pay tribute to the dedication and commitment of those working in the health services.  Their performance over the last two years is evidence of anything <Col N="1798" /> but the low morale suggested in the motion.</P>
    <P>It is worth while looking in detail at the progress we have made in relation to specific services in order to give the lie to the charge made in the text of tonight's motion.  Our rationalisation of the acute hospital system must be put in perspective. From the mid-sixties on there has been a very large measure of consensus among all political parties that this country should endeavour to maintain its position as one of the countries with an advanced modern health system.  In the hospital field that entailed a commitment to consultant medicine, with increasing specialisation and a very high level of diagnostic capacity.</P>
    <P>It was quite clear as early as the mid-sixties that the increased capacity for better patient care, brought about by the new technology, and the cost of supporting such technology meant, by definition, a reduction in the number of centres at which a first class acute diagnostic and treatment service could be maintained.</P>
    <P>In the intervening period a major building programme got under way.  New technology came on stream rapidly, medical practices changed so that fewer beds but more support facilities were required.  Expectations of successful diagnosis and treatment increased as new techniques and procedures became available. All of these developments have been reflected in the closure of hospitals which are to be replaced and are, therefore, surplus to requirement; the reduction in the number of beds; and the increasing reliance on the quicker throughput of patients through the development of short stay facilities.</P>
    <P>The commitment to maintaining a very high level of diagnostic capacity is reflected in, for example, the fact that there are now 12 &ldquo;cat scanners&rdquo; in the country and eight of these are in our public hospital service.  Radiological equipment today is extremely sophisticated. For example, the suite brought into operation recently at St. James's Hospital is among the best in the world. Priority will continue to be given to the <Col N="1799" /> replacement of high technology equipment in hospitals.</P>
    <P>Despite the restrictions on staffing and finance, we have maintained the number of consultants in the hospital system. That should be said loud and clear because that is the factual position.  We have maintained the number of consultants in our hospital system but this is ignored in the motion and by its movers.</P>
    <P>We now have a clear picture of what we want to achieve in the organisation of acute services.  The changes which have been made will result in a much more efficient health service which will be more responsive to the needs of our community over the coming years.</P>
    <P>There has been steady progress in equipping and opening new units.  This year alone, new facilities have come on stream at St. James's, the Mater, Cavan, Mullingar and Castlebar.  Each of these represents a significant improvement in the range and quality of services available to patients.  Each unit is part of a plan which will be the basis for further development right through the next decade.  A good start has been made in a number of hospitals, and new facilities will continue to come on stream in the coming years, including Ardkeen, Sligo and Wexford and, of course, the new hospital which is being planned for Tallaght.</P>
    <P>The motion refers to waiting lists for hospital admissions.  Waiting lists did not come into being with the arrival of this Government in office.  They have always existed here and elsewhere.  However, waiting list numbers are a very unreliable measure of the availability of hospital services.  Patients may be on more than one doctor's waiting list for the same treatment.  In some cases, patients are added to waiting lists when doctors expect that they will require treatment in the future but do not, at that point, need admission to hospital.  Also, crude waiting list statistics do not distinguish between patients presenting for first time treatment and those receiving continuing care.  The cruicial point to be understood in relation to waiting lists is that they <Col N="1800" /> must always be put in the context of the actual throughput of hospitals.  For example, there has been much uninformed comment in the media and elsewhere recently concerning the fact that there were over 22,000 patients awaiting admission to hospital in 1988.  However, that figure is set in proper context when one considers that over 500,000 patients are admitted every year to our acute public hospitals out of a population of 3,500,000 people.  Similarly, the number on the orthopaedic in-patient waiting list on 30 June 1988, was 5,170 &mdash; but a total of 31,542 orthopaedic patients were admitted in 1987.</P>
    <P>This point is even more strikingly made when one looks at figures for outpatient departments.  In December 1987 there were around 67,000 awaiting outpatient treatment, while over 1.5 million such patients were treated that year.  Again, the orthopaedic outpatient waiting list numbered 9,205 patients, while over 188,000 such patients were treated. These figures show the real achievements of the health service in meeting the demands placed upon it.  It has responded very quickly indeed to a rapid expansion in demand for certain elective procedures such as hip replacements, cataract operations and ENT surgery.</P>
    <P>We inherited a massive waiting list when we came into office in 1987.  It is our ambition to work to achieve a situation where people can get service on demand. It has not been achieved anywhere in the world but it is something to which we would aspire.  It has to be done in relation to the cost of the health services and our ability to pay.</P>
    <P>While some problems do exist in specific areas, we are addressing these situations with a view to having them resolved as soon as possible.  The Minister for Health is keeping waiting lists constantly monitored to ensure that no intractable situations develop.</P>
    <P>The motion also refers to outpatient delays in our public hospitals.  It is not widely realised just how significant the workload of our outpatient departments actually is.  During 1988 there were 1.5 <Col N="1801" /> million attendances at outpatient departments in general hospitals in this country. This is an indication of the excellence of the health service which responds effectively to the needs of the community. Some delays at outpatient departments are inevitable when such huge numbers call on the service.</P>
    <P>One must understand that patients must always get adequate consultation time even if it means that those waiting their turn must suffer a delay.  Diagnostic tests may have to be performed.  There may have to be close monitoring of a patient's condition.  In fact, hospitals are to be complimented for handling such large numbers with as little inconvenience to the patient as is humanly possible.</P>
    <P>I would now like to turn to our community care services.  The Government are committed to reorientating the focus of health care towards primary care in the community.  Even in the difficult financial climate of the last few years, there has been a steady and orderly shift to the provision of services in the community rather than in institutions.  This can be clearly seen across the range of services &mdash; psychiatric services, childcare, and services for the mentally and physically handicapped.</P>
    <P>A central element of primary health care is an emphasis on the promotion of good health, and the prevention of illness and handicap.  A significant amount of work has been carried out in establishing appropriate structures for health promotion at all levels.  The major issues are being tackled to ensure that our society is well informed and aware of the measures that each of us, as individuals, can take to combat ill health.</P>
    <P>A range of measures to tackle the new problem of AIDS in the community has been put in place and is being constantly monitored and refined.</P>
    <P>The measles, mumps and rubella immunisation programme introduced last year is another example of the ongoing development of measures to tackle illness before it arises rather than afterwards.</P>
    <P>The general practitioner must, of <Col N="1802" /> course, play the pivotal role in primary health care.  The successful negotiation of the new contract for the General Medical Service has been one of the major achievements of my colleague, Deputy Rory O'Hanlon.  I wish to take this opportunity to offer him my congratulations and to the Secretary of the Department, Mr. Flanagan, and all the staff involved, I am sure the Labour Members of this House will join with me in congratulating the Government, the Minister and the Department in concluding those very sensitive negotiations.  This contract establishes a sound basis for the development of general practice to meet the health needs of the population.</P>
    <P>I fully accept that it would be highly desirable to be in a position to apply increased resources, particularly to the further development of a primary health care system, but, as I said at the outset, we must operate within the realities of our current financial constraints.  There are priority areas in community care which need strengthening &mdash; particularly oral health, ophthalmic services and community nursing.  These services can, and will, be strengthened as part of our overall strategy of redirecting the available resources to the areas of greatest priority. The motion refers to the level of services for the handicapped as &ldquo;derisory&rdquo;, I cannot accept that.  The Government are committed to protecting services for the disadvantaged sectors, including the handicapped.  There has been a clear direction to health agencies that measures which are taken to live within their budgets must not be such as to cause hardship to these sectors.  My Department spend some £120 million on the care of people with a mental handicap.  This excludes further expenditure by the Department of Education on special schools and classes.  In my Department's allocation of funds, services for the mentally handicapped have received priority status since this Government took office. It is our intention that they will continue to be protected.  In every health board area, developments have been taking place steadily, particularly in regard to providing community based services for <Col N="1803" /> people who have, until now, been placed inappropriately in large residential centres.</P>
    <P>These developments are being achieved through redeployment, rationalisation and the investment of capital funding from the State.  For example, the Eastern Health Board has detailed plans for the provision of 200 community based residential places this year to be provided by the board itself and by the voluntary agencies involved in the provision of care in its area.  In fact, every health board, with the co-operation of voluntary agencies, is at present identifying the future need for all services for the mentally handicapped in their regions, so as to ensure that available resources are used to the best advantage.</P>
    <P>The Government have also supplemented the Exchequer funding by making £1.3 million available from the proceeds of the national lottery to enable some important new developments for the mentally handicapped to take place. The services for other categories of the handicapped are similarly under continuing review.  Indeed, I believe that contributors to the national lottery are pleased with the expenditure of funds in the health area.  They have been extremely well directed to people in need.</P>
    <P>Despite the financial constraints, over £5 million has been provided to enable the two deaf schools in Cabra to open new residential facilities.</P>
    <P>The Multiple Sclerosis Care Foundation has been given £250,000 to open a new short-term residential centre.  The launching of these new services attracts further funds from the State for their running costs.  For example, an additional £60,000 is being paid through the Eastern Health Board towards the running cost of the Multiple Sclerosis Centre.  A further allocation totalling £85,000 was paid from the national lottery to assist with the launch of this centre.  Special grants of £225,000 and £150,000, respectively, were also made from the national lottery to the Irish Wheelchair Association and the National Association for Cerebral <Col N="1804" /> Palsy to enable them to enhance their services.</P>
    <P>The motion refers to the &ldquo;decimation&rdquo; of the psychiatric services.  The psychiatric services are not being decimated. On the contrary, the Government are implementing the policy outlined in the report <i>Planning for the Future</i> which was published over four years ago and was accepted by the Government at that time and the then Minister, Deputy Desmond.</P>
    <P>This report provides a planning framework for the development of a comprehensive community oriented psychiatric service.  I might point out that it was first adopted as public policy by the previous Minister for Health and the Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>The main recommendations of <i>Planning for the Future</i> were that a service should be established which would be capable of dealing with all the psychiatric problems of the community in a caring and professional manner and, secondly, that every effort should be made to rehabilitate to a normal community environment, persons who are long-term residents in psychiatric hospitals.  We, on coming to office, adopted this policy and we should be complimented by the Opposition for the continuity of this policy decision.  This policy involves a major change from a centralised, hospital service to a community-based one.  The overall aim is to provide a better service. The motion which we are now discussing seems to imply that the policy being pursued in relation to the management of our psychiatric services has more to do with cutbacks than with service development.</P>
    <P>I would strongly refute this, and I would suggest that Senators might reflect on what has been happening in the practice of psychiatry over the past 30 years. I pointed earlier to the considerable advances which have been made in medicine. The same is true of the practice of psychiatry.  This has resulted in a reduced need for hospitalisation for the treatment of psychiatric disorders.  We should all be delighted with the progress in this particular area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1805" /> We can see this development reflected in the reduction in the number of in-patients in our psychiatric hospitals from a peak of 20,000 patients in 1958 to some 9,000 patients at the end of 1988.  For far too long, patients were being put into institutions when they should have been in the community.  We are now ensuring that this happens.  In recent years, and particularly since the publication of <i>Planning for the Future,</i> there has been a considerable expansion of community based facilities such as day hospitals, day centres, hostels and community residences. For example, at the end of 1988 there were 47 day centres and 32 day hospitals catering for some 7,500 attenders. There were also 272 hostels and community residences, with some 1,800 places.  I would recommend Senators to visit those patients in their new hostels and homes and they will see people who have been brought back to a new life within the community.</P>
    <P>These are examples of the alternative facilities being put in place so that patients no longer have to rely on outdated institutional facilities for treatment. We are all aware of the stigma attached to the psychiatric service which has not been helped by the concentration in the past on the institutional approach to the delivery of care.</P>
    <P>The main beneficiary of the developments which I have outlined has been the patient who can, in many instances, receive appropriate treatment, close to where he or she lives, and with the minimum of disruption to normal life.</P>
    <P>The Government are determined to pursue the policy outlined in <i>Planning for the Future</i> which has been widely accepted by all those associated with the psychiatric services as a realistic approach to the provision of a caring and professional service for people with psychiatric problems.</P>
    <P>It should be clear from the examples which I have given that all areas of the health services are at present experiencing development and change.  If one wishes to be negative, it is easy to point to shortfalls and gaps in services.  As needs and priorities constantly change, <Col N="1806" /> there will always be new gaps to be filled, new services to be developed.</P>
    <P>The Government, unlike their predecessor, are rationalising the health services so that the resources will be available to meet these needs and priorities. The result will be an efficient and equitable health service which enables our skilled and dedicated professionals to provide services of the highest quality in the most cost effective setting.  I do not accept the suggestion that we are moving towards a two-tiered system of health care.  We have always had a balanced mix of public and private services but medical need was, is and always will be the essential criterion for getting services.</P>
    <P>Even if the public finances did not present so great a constraint, the present process of planned development and renewal would surely be preferable to the old approach of indiscriminately channelling extra funding to each agency which demanded it, without regard to the country's ability to pay.  For two years, this country has experienced a new realism in relation to what we can afford and the careful husbandry of our available resources.</P>
    <P>Tonight's motion is a throwback to the earlier, carefree days for which so heavy a price eventually had to be paid.  When we came into office, I would remind the House again, we had to pick up the tab, we had to pick up the debt of the £50 million overspending on the health services, we had to take the action to resolve the issue, because if we did not we would not be in a position to pay our debts and the services would suffer as a result. We have taken the hard action, we have taken the responsibility and I believe the people of this country will respond in an appropriate way at an appropriate time, their first opportunity being on 15 June during the European elections.  I am confident they will endorse the policy which has been effected over the last two years.</P>
    <P>If we had surplus funds at our disposal, of course, things would be much easier. It is difficult being in Government and being in the Department when we had to take action.  Future Governments and future Ministers will look back to the end <Col N="1807" /> of the term of this present Government as one of the most enlightening periods in the Department of Health where realism came in, where we tackled the problems. At the end of the day I believe we are delivering a better health service than has been delivered heretofore.</P>
    <P>I reject the motion and I request Senators to reject it for the reasons I have outlined in the statement I have made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I had better remind the House that the Minister who is present is the one who coined the immortal phrase: &ldquo;We said there was a better way but we did not say that it would be any easier.&rdquo; I am still trying to work out what he meant by it, but it is definitely a phrase that deserves to go on the record.</P>
      <P>I visited an old lady in Saint James's Hospital recently who needs physiotherapy five times a week.  She can only get it once a week.  There is no residential child psychiatric service in the whole of Munster anymore.  They are now charging people for ambulances when they are moved from one hospital to another for necessary treatment.  They are ripping off old people's pensions in many hospitals now.</P>
      <P>My youngest son needed an ear operation. I have the good fortune to be able to afford to pay for private care.  We were told that if he had to do it through the public service he would have to wait for two to three years by which time his hearing would be permanently damaged. I have a family relation who has a very severely mentally handicapped child and who has just been told that the child, who is in residential care, will be sent home shortly.  Because of the cutbacks they cannot afford to keep the child in residential care anymore.  There are community nurses in the Munster region who get no travelling expenses for part of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say those things because they are the most eloquent refutation of what the Minister has said.  The health services are in chaos.  Community care is not a substitute for psychiatric services.  My wife is a psychiatrist and she knows the <Col N="1808" /> mess the psychiatric services are in. When she was working at the coal face, as far as I am concerned she was a far better authority on the quality of the psychiatric services than either the Department of Health or the Minister for Health.  We have had a mess.  The only thing I cannot stomach in this debate is the fact the Fine Gael Senators sit in front of me here and pretend that it is all somebody else's fault.  One would think that they resigned from Government in 1987 over cutbacks in the health services instead of the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Labour Party put down this motion.  It is time we put ourselves on the record.  The poor have been victimised; they have been ripped off to satisfy the needs of the bankers and the financial institutions.  The poor have been sacrificed to satisfy the greed of the rich and the powerful in our society.  The poor have suffered the pain, the agony, the health cuts, the poverty and so on and there is no way of getting around it.  The Minister can produce all the figures he likes but it is still a fact that the poor pay the price for his alleged economic success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said in summing up that he believes the policies of the Government will be endorsed in the Euro elections.  The Minister and his party are in for a rude awakening and the rather inappropriate comment to my colleague, Senator Ferris, that the list of hospitals which he mentioned in his speech was something to do with a Euro election campaign was uncalled for.  The Minister is missing the point of what is happening.  Senator Ferris is canvassing in an election, he is meeting people and getting their reaction.  The people know, for example, that seven hospitals have been closed by this Government in the South Eastern Health Board area of which three are in my constituency.  What are people saying to us at the doors?  They are talking to us about the very essence of this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to put on the record that my colleague, Senator Ferris, would be in dereliction of his duty as a Member of <Col N="1809" /> this House if he did not put on record exactly what he put on record when he was making his speech.  It was inappropriate for the Minister to say that.  It was trite but his party will learn when the votes are counted after the Euro elections that what the electorate have conveyed to Senator Ferris and what he in this House has conveyed to the Minister is where it is really at.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal with one specific area.  The Minister made great play and there was much rhetoric about mental handicap and service for people with mental handicap but the only area in the health services where staff has been increased between 1984 and 1987 is in the mentally handicapped area and all of that increase occurred between the years 1984 and 1986.  Between 1986 and 1987 there was a reduction in staffing in this vital area of 143 people nationally.  The Minister knows as well as I do that services that are provided for psychiatric patients and for mentally handicapped patients are labour intensive.  That is the essence of these services. The support service is in the community.  From the date this Government took office until the end of 1987 there has been a reduction of 143 staff in this area.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of high-falutin, rhetoric from the Government side tonight.  Those I deal with, whose problems I listen to and for whom I make representaitons where I can, are real people with real problems.  There has been talk about efficiencies and inefficiencies and so on since this Government came to power but &mdash; I am not going to go over the statistics I gave earlier &mdash; there is a chronic deterioration in the health services.  We are at, and may be beyond, crisis point.  The Minister asked me to specify where the money should go.  He knows that 6,000 people have been taken out of the health services by this Government.  He knows that health services are labour intensive.  We must put people back to work to provide the full services.  Also, in dealing with efficiency and utilisation of services, the area of in-patients for surgical procedures is suffering very badly because of the <Col N="1810" /> lack of beds and the under-utilisation of theatre staff.  The people who do not have their operations carried out because of the lack of beds are going onto out-patient lists which are already over-crowded. Therefore, the problem is compounded.</P>
    <P>I am sick and tired listening to meaningless rhetoric about efficiencies and inefficiencies.  This Government have used, and continue to use, a blunt instrument approach &mdash; you take out money and you let the health boards find their own level, you do the Pontius Pilate, you wash your hands and when a specific problem comes up you say it is a matter for the health board.  Seventy million pounds does not go anywhere near solving the critical urgent problems that are there now but it is badly needed to deal with all those problems.  Is the Minister trying to tell me that the community care area is properly serviced and that with those niggardly cutbacks on the travelling expenses of public health nurses, particularly in rural areas where some old person is discharged from hospital on the day after the public health nurse makes a visit to that area and may not be back there again for one week, that he can save money?  Where does it to and what is achieved by it?</P>
    <P>The Minister says he rejects the motion but at the same time he says that there is merit in what we say.  There have been meaningless proposals such as the one from Senator O'Connell who said that instead of having senior citizens in geriatric hospitals they should remain in an effective and comfortable family setting. I agree with that.  But then he said that he would like to see the prescribed relatives allowance increased two or threefold. Has he put that forward to his parliamentary party?  Has he made representations to the Minister about that? It is easy to make statements that are based on nothing more than justifying what is a strategy that is about correcting the country's finances.  I do not have to say once again that we in the Labour Party accept that there is a need to deal with them but as Senator Ryan has just said, not on the backs of the poor, of the sick, the old or the handicapped.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1811" /> The Minister slid beautifully away from the recklessness of his party in the Oireachtas, the recklessness of Fianna Fáil people on health boards throughout the country who helped run up the very debts he talked about by a deliberate reckless and destructive policy that was motivated by one thing and that was to return to power.  There was no care or concern about the people the Labour Party care for, the poor, the sick and the handicapped.  It was about what the soul of Fianna Fáil has become, a quest for power and a quest for holding on to that power.</P>
    <P>The Minister asked us to withdraw the motion we put down following his speech. I would like to say, respectfully, to the Minister that there was nothing in his speech.  It rambles around the place with sometimes a history, sometimes pulling out statistics that applied here and there. The statistics that matter are those that apply now at this very moment and far <Col N="1812" /> from withdrawing the motion, we are going to press it because the Labour Party &mdash; the only real Opposition party in this Oireachtas &mdash; are not going to stand idly by and see the hypocritical Fianna Fáil Party, who traded on the slogan that health cuts hurt the old, the sick and the handicapped, completely aboutface and then tell us they are working some kind of miracle.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I was about to make when we adjourned at 6.30 p.m. was that in the midst of this crisis that has developed in the country a number of other things have happened which have gone almost unrecorded.  One of those <Col N="1813" /> has been the extraordinary improvement in productivity in this country.  Productivity is the real measure of whether a country is developing economically, or at least it ought to be if there is any proper system of distribution.</P>
      <P>Let me give some figures.  It depends on how you compare things, whether you base them on official exchange rates or purchasing power parities.  We will take official exchange rates, because they are the official measures.  In 1971 agricultural productivity in this country was 46 per cent of that in Britain; in 1986 it was 94 per cent.  In 1971 industrial productivity here was 93 per cent of that in Britain; it is now 114 per cent.  The production per head of the average worker in Irish industry is now higher than that in Britain. In terms of services, there is a similar increase.  Even more impressive is the growth in productivity of the Irish workforce by comparison with the smaller countries of the EC, like Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, where industrial productivity has increased from 61 per cent to 77 per cent of industrial productivity in those countries.</P>
      <P>There are other interesting statistics about productivity that I do not propose to dwell too heavily on.  What is quite clear is that there has been a dramatic increase in the productivity of our agricultural workforce, of our industrial workforce and indeed of our workforce in services over that period from 1971 to 1986 while at the same time &mdash; and I am quoting from the same report that I referred to earlier &mdash;&ldquo;Living standards have remained entirely static&rdquo;. In other words, those who are at work in this country in agriculture, industry and services are producing in the various areas more and more, more efficiently, but the country as a whole is not seeing any benefit from that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a long and interesting discussion as to why it should be that our workforce in its various areas is vastly more productive than it used to be but our living standards have remained static.  It is easy to say that it is because of the state of the public finances.  In my view it is because <Col N="1814" /> of an inability related to our taxation system to capture the benefits of that increased productivity.  We have persisted with a low wage economy policy. We have persisted with a low corporate taxation policy.  Therefore, if you have a poorly paid workforce dramatically increasing its productivity and you have corporate profits increasing at an astronomical rate and you do not have any method of retaining any significant proportion of those, then the benefits of that vast and substantial increase in productivity will not be available within the country.  It is something close to a scandal that such dramatic increases in productivity have produced no significant improvement in living standards.  It is an appalling record of the inadequacy of our ability to grasp the benefits of dramatically increased productivity.</P>
    <P>Of course, one of the reasons why living standards have improved &mdash; not the only one &mdash; is that we have chosen in some cases to use taxation to distribute some of that benefit in terms of services. We are now liable to give away that in return for nothing, in return for no benefit in terms of employment, in terms of long-term damage to our employment creating possibilities because of the fact that our workforce will become increasingly poorly educated as the educational services fall apart; as our health service becomes a two-tiered service, with a good service available only to those who can afford to pay, and pay heavily, and an appalling service available to the vast majority.  It will become a less and less pleasant environment in which to live and in which to bring up children.  That will be the price in the long term that will be paid for a simplistic, in my view, strategy of economic development.</P>
    <P>I have a few concluding remarks to make on the Finance Bill.  There are a couple of very specific proposals that I regard as important but which are absent from Irish taxation legislation.  The first is something that operates in some of the Scandinavian countries.  It is a very simple way of ensuring a relatively honest payment of income tax, that is, that every <Col N="1815" /> citizen's income tax payment &mdash; not their allowances but the amount of tax that each citizen pays in any given year &mdash; be a matter of public record.  It is not something that should bother the vast majority of people on PAYE, because, if you know the value of their mortgage, it is possible to work out within a few pounds how much tax they would be paying but for a large sector of our society the simple disclosure of the amount of income tax they pay would be sufficient to create the sort of public uproar that would guarantee the political will to enforce a fair taxation system.</P>
    <P>It is the sort of thing, that is not fashionable in this country.  Given that all our financial institutions can advertise absolute confidentiality when they are trying to attract savings, one wonders confidentiality from whom.  They are hardly going to disclose it to competing institutions. They are hardly going to disclose it to other customers.  One presumes, therefore, it is confidentiality from the State but one wonders why it should be confidential from the State.  One can only imagine there is only one reason it should be confidential from the State and that is in order to enable people to avoid paying the tax they should be paying on that money.  This effectively means that all our allegedly law abiding financial institutions are involved in a conspiracy to defraud the State and should be prosecuted accordingly, because that is what they are doing.  They are involved in a conspiracy to defraud the State, they are providing facilities for people to avoid paying their lawful taxes and accordingly they are quite clearly, and have been for some time, a disgrace to the country.</P>
    <P>The other question is the question of section 23 lettings, indeed section 23 of the 1981 Finance Act as amended by sections 27, 28 and 29 of the 1988 Finance Act.  If one is prepared to be reasonable and not be too excessive, these are reasonable proposals to encourage people to purchase or develop new apartments or houses for letting.  The idea as presented to the public was that the <Col N="1816" /> construction cost of such new developments can be offset against the rental income.  The interesting thing is that the purchase cost may be offset not just against the rental income of the new development but against any income from any other rental properties.</P>
    <P>What this means is that, while the new rental houses and apartments have to meet minimum standards &mdash; and they are generally of a high quality &mdash; there is no such condition attached to the other rental properties on which relief is claimed, for instance, a landlord of slum properties &mdash; and there is a considerable number of what can only be described as slum properties in the private rental sector in this city.  I remember far too well from my own student days a considerable number of what could only be described as slum properties.  Such a landlord can buy a new section 23, as they are called inappropriately, an apartment or house, and as a result he could enjoy the income from his slum properties effectively tax free.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that we would have a tax provision which effectively subsidises slum landlords.  I cannot believe that it is an accident.  I have to believe it is part of this mythological enterprise culture based on a romanticised image of the entrepreneur.  It is one thing to try to create conditions for the development of decent private rental accommodation.  It is another thing to make provision in the Finance Acts for tax breaks for slum landlords simply because they take advantage of one small section of the Finance Act.  I will repeat again.  Somebody buys a section 23 apartment and the tax that would be due on all rental income from all other properties can be offset against the construction costs of the one section 23 property.  It is quite outrageous. It achieves no purpose that I can imagine other than to create an incentive to maintain slum dwellings.  I cannot see in any way how it can be justified other than a fear of the problems that might develop if these provisions were to be taken away &mdash; in other words, to a certain extent it is a rewarding of friends.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1817" /> Neither is the tax relief linked to standards of good practice in the management of either the new or existing properties, such as the use of written tenancy agreements, rent books or a minimum period of notice to quit.  It is quite extraordinary again that simple things like that, that would not cost a penny, are left out of an attempt to create a good market in private rented accommodation. It is in some ways a little puzzling that, at a time when a market ideology is extremely fashionable and at a time when there is quite a deliberate policy to try to encourage people to look to the private sector for housing rather than to the State sector, we are not prepared to create the conditions in terms of standards, tenants' rights and things like that which would encourage the other side of the equation, the demand for private rented accommodation to expand. We would concentrate it entirely on creating a supply of private rented accommodation via section 23.</P>
    <P>Of course, most people with families or with any long term future where they are living will not move into private rented accommodation without some sort of security of tenure, some sort of guarantee of standards, etc.  They do not have them and it is extraordinary that the section 23 provisions make no provision for it.  It is essential that tax concessions under sections 23, 27 or 28 should be linked to proper standards.  Standards should obviously involve conformity to by-laws where applicable.  It is an extraordinary thing that there is no obligation on somebody who is claiming a section 23 concession to satisfy the Revenue Commissioners that they have properly conformed to the by-laws of the local authority within whose jurisdiction the property has been constructed.  We do it for all sorts of other areas, but we do not do it for people developing property.</P>
    <P>Take, for instance, simple things like the provision of rent books.  It has been possible for the Minister for the Environment since 1982 to make rent books compulsory.  I am entitled by law to a receipt when I do my shopping in a supermarket. I am not entitled by law to a <Col N="1818" /> receipt from a landlord if I am in private rented accommodation.  Can somebody please explain to me why that is a difficulty? The only reason I can imagine is because of some delusion about the need to protect these frail, fragile creatures called entrepreneurs who are liable to be frightened off by the least inhibition of their activities.</P>
    <P>I believe in an enterprise culture, but if the image of the enterpreneur as vigorous, independent, resilent and self-sufficient is any way true when a few simple regulations, which would improve the quality of market demand for the property which he or she is attempting to let, far from destroying his or her market, would in fact improve the quality of the market within which he or she was operating.  I am not deluded enough to imagine that it is going to happen this year, but I would suggest to the Minister that the whole question of section 23 properties ought to be re-examined, not necessarily to get rid of section 23 at all, but to ensure that section 23 allowances only apply to section 23 properties and not to every property from which rental income is being derived; secondly, that section 23 allowances only apply to houses that meet appropriate standards in terms of letting; and, thirdly, that proper conditions for letting apply to section 23 properties.  It is an extremely important area.  I know there was an attempt to raise this issue by way of an amendment on Committee Stage in the other House but it failed on a matter of procedure and was ruled out of order.  I raise the matter here to invite the Minister to comment on it with a view to future action.</P>
    <P>I would be inclined to vote against the Finance Bill.  The whole taxation philosophy in this country is quite uneven and one-sided.  I can see that this Government have made some improvements but until the burden of taxation is taken away from work and goods and services and put on capital, property, land and wealth, the basic fundamental requirement of fairness in our society cannot be met. Without fairness in our society it is impossible to persuade our citizens that <Col N="1819" /> it is worth while paying taxation in order to provide decent services.</P>

      <P>I welcome very much the improvement in the economy that has been taking place in the past couple of years.  Indeed to bring this about has been a major task and a major achievement, especially in view of the fact that so many issues and problems are involved, including external ones.  This Bill is something that is vital to the lives of all of us and is of concern in our day-to-day livelihood and activities.  Apart from some of the more fundamental issues contained in the Bill, I am particularly glad to see and to note that there are other issues included. At first sight some of these might appear irrelevant in view of the important commercial and economic sections in the Bill but nevertheless, it is a tribute to the thoroughness and the wide-ranging effect of the Bill that these items are included. It is with these items &mdash; concerning what I might broadly call cultural issues &mdash; that I will concern myself in these brief comments.</P>
      <P>The first relates to relief for expenditure on certain buildings in designated areas.  For the first time since 1982, the Finance Bill this year provides for relief for the expenditure on the repair and maintenance of certain types of houses &mdash; principally what one might call heritage houses, rather notable and important buildings provided these houses are open to the public on a limited number of days each year.  I am now glad to see that an extension of this concept has taken place in this Finance Bill.  It is very helpful in the general revitalisation of so many of our towns and cities to see this particular provision which will allow income tax relief and so encourage people to come and live in inner city areas.  By doing so, houses that are historically or architecturally significant will be renovated. Indeed, part of the apparent run-down of so many of our towns and cities, or at least sections of them, is due to the general neglect, occasioned at least in some cases by monetary costs of so many houses and, consequently, street scapes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1820" /> I am not going to isolate examples but we all know one of the main arteries of communication in this city, and indeed one of its main exits and entries &mdash; Gardiner Street &mdash; has been so run down that it is now virtually a blitzed and, in part, a deserted area.  I trust that, with this quite innovative and adventurous approach, we will see before very long, coupled with urban renewal, a major improvement in our cities.  I wonder where this is going to stop.  I know these houses have got to be in designated areas but I hope the Minister could be a bit flexible in this and if it happens that there is one part of a street outside a designated area which is considered to be of sufficient architectural merit that, too, might be included.  I have no reason to doubt that that sort of flexibility will or does exist.  The advantage, as I have said, of all of this is certainly to improve the living quality in our towns and cities and to bring about a revitalisation which is so badly needed in so many of our towns.</P>
    <P>The second issue I would like to comment on is something which I think has been a great success over a number of years.  It may not appear very spectacular to people as such but I think it has been something of great value from the artistic and cultural point of view, and that is the relief to writers and artists.  We often pretend to think of ourselves as an island of saints and scholars and so on but it is rarely that something is done for these people.  Again, for any country the presence of creative work, whether it be in writing, painting, sculpture or other artistic activities, is something that is very valuable indeed.  It was the Taoiseach, as Minister for Finance, who initiated this scheme many years ago and it has worked quite well.  Certain additions or improvements have been made by way of appeals and so on.  One of the reasons it has worked reasonably well &mdash; and I understand it has &mdash; is that a certain amount of common sense has been used in its application, and indeed without common sense nothing is going to work.  Over the past 20 years or so, the measure has been used in this way and the people who <Col N="1821" /> applied for relief were not treated in a very bureaucratic fashion.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to mention the section dealing with value added tax, that is the amendment of the Sixth Schedule to the Principal Act.  It specifically deals with value added tax on works of art. Here again I am certainly full of praise for the fact that this sum has now been reduced from 25 per cent to 10 per cent. Again, this is going to help artists, and indeed the Irish cultural scene, quite considerably. At the moment because value added tax is so high, it is encouraging quite a number of works of art to leave the country.  Apart from that it is also difficult, not only for individuals but indeed for galleries and public institutions to acquire works of art.  Most of these institutions are working on a fixed budget.  Now that their expenditure, or at least their budget for purchasing works of art, will be reduced by a considerable amount &mdash; nearly 20 per cent &mdash; will, I believe, help with the public element of art just as much as the private element.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect to this which I would just like to comment on.  I hope this measure will contribute to the return of a number of works of art to this country.  Unfortunately, quite a lot of very valuable items have been leaving the country through the auction rooms, not only furniture and paintings but pieces of sculpture and so on.  I hope this amendment will keep a greater share of our works of art at home and, at the same time, help to repatriate Irish works abroad.</P>
    <P>I am also pleased with the extension of this provision to literary manuscripts of cultural and artistic importance.  Again, we have a very notable literary tradition but unfortunately a great deal of that material is leaving the country.  It is one of the sad facts that there are institutions in America which are drawing people there to work and study some of the literary material that has left this country. If we want to build up and develop the thrust of getting people to come to this country, the more we have here the better.  It would seem ridiculous that our Joyce manuscripts and so on have left <Col N="1822" /> the country; at least, thank Heavens, the Yeats material is largely still here.  It is very important that we are encouraged to maintain and to keep as much of this material here as possible but this is not the place to go into this in detail.</P>
    <P>The Bill lists a certain number of objects and also types of objects but I am not going to quibble about that.  In section 63 various objects are listed such as prints, drawings, lithographs and so on but there is an item which is also quite important and which is not listed here &mdash; I do not know whether it is necessary to have it listed in this way &mdash; and that is, the archaeological material which, of course, has been leaving the country in very considerable quantities and not coming back.  As I have said, I do not want to go into detail on this but it would seem strange, for instance, if one section of the National Museum could buy back some material at 10 per cent value-added tax whereas another section of the museum had to pay the full 25 per cent. If that is so it is something that might have to be looked at for the very good reason that it could cause certain anomalies between different sections of one institution.</P>
    <P>As I said at the beginning, I welcome this Bill and I congratulate the Minister on his achievements.</P>

      <P>The Minister commenced this debate today with what I would call a spiel of blatantly political ebullience although I could more accurately use the word &ldquo;nonsense&rdquo;.  He started by saying that the transformation which has taken place in the public finances has been effected in the last three budgets but this is a patent misrepresentation of the facts. The genesis of the modern economic problems of this State dates back to a decade ago when banana republic budget economics were applied here in the late seventies and were continued into the early eighties despite the alarm bells ringing.  No one can be blamed for that other than the converts from recklessness to rectitude who now sit in Government. The Minister was an office holder in the period 1977 to 1982 and he took part in <Col N="1823" /> the implementation of that madness.  The present Taoiseach, as is well known, spent the years 1977 to 1978 skulking and sometimes sulking in that Cabinet, often describing the economic Ministers who were implementing that policy as &ldquo;expletive deleted eejits.&rdquo;  He eventually got the long and much coveted reins of leadership in December 1980.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>It was raised by others who spoke on this issue today and I have no memory of your taking issue with them.  For the accurate record, let it be stated that in 1977 the Exchequer and public service borrowing requirement stood at £1.24 billion or 9.7 per cent of the value of the gross national product. By the time Fianna Fáil left office eventually in late 1982, the Exchequer and public service borrowing requirement had reached over £4 billion or a frightening 20.3 per cent of the value of the gross national product.  In 1987 when we left office, the borrowing requirement was 13 per cent of gross national product. A lot of rubbish has been talked about the national debt, its levels and all the other attendant arguments that go with it.  In 1977 the total national debt, a combination of external and internal debt, stood at £4.229 billion.  Again when Fianna Fáil eventually left office at the end of 1982 it was over £12 billion.  It had trebled in that period.  I am not stressing the damage the national debt caused to the economy because at least 65 per cent &mdash; or perhaps even more &mdash; of the national debt is generated from internal borrowings and that is not as damaging <Col N="1824" /> as many would say to the economic fabric of the country.  The national debt at the end of 1986 was £21.6 billion.  At the end of 1987, after Fianna Fáil's first year in office, it stood at £23.7 billion.  At the end of 1988, the last fiscal year for which we have figures, it stood at £24.6 billion which is 2½ percentage points higher than it was at the end of 1986.</P>
      <P>The Minister devoted quite an amount of his time to lower Exchequer borrowing, low inflation, low interest rates and better competitiveness.  He spoke too of the effect of good budgetary results on the business and financial community.  No doubt the business and financial community, or at least a majority of that small sector of the whole community, are very happy because of better returns and higher profits in recent years but, alas, these higher profits and better returns have hardly reached beyond that magic circle.  The 243,000 people who are unemployed have had no benefit bestowed on them as a result of low interest rates or better profits in the business and financial sector.  The 80,000 plus, mostly young people, who fled this country in the past two years find no meaning in the Minister's precocious quoting from the phraseology of political economy.</P>
      <P>I was amazed when listening to Senator Ryan talking about our emigrants.  I take issue with him.  He stated that he had no sympathy for young people who were educated in this country, as he put it, at the expense of the taxpayers and were then leaving the country.  That is to completely and totally misunderstand the nature of the problem.  About 95 per cent of these people, well educated or not, are leaving this country because there is no economic opportunity for them or, to put it more simply, they cannot find a job here.  That is why they are leaving.  I am amazed that Senator Ryan who, I understand, has socialist leanings, should make that quite extraordinary statement&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;about the hordes of <Col N="1825" /> young people who are leaving the country.  Going back to this phraseology of political economy, listening to the Minister here today and listening to his colleagues I was reminded very much of what Daniel O'Connell said to Robert Peel in a debate in the House of Commons in the 19th century.  It was a debate on economic distress and famine in Ireland.  The then Prime Minister, Robert Peel, met all O'Connell's pleas with a spiel of <i>laissez faire</i> economics. O'Connell very tellingly said: &ldquo;Prime Minister, you cannot respond to the cries of want with quotes about the political economy&rdquo;.  In today's Ireland the unemployed, those who are below or on the poverty line &mdash; and incidentally that is about one-third of the population &mdash; and the tens of thousands of emigrants who are leaving are having their arguments and grievances met with quotes like that by the Ministers in this Government.</P>
      <P>I will speak for a moment about agriculture which is my bailiwick in this House as spokesman for my party.  I will quote some figures from the <i>National Development Plan 1989-1993</i> published recently by the Government.  The national farm survey of 1987 showed that two-thirds of all family farms had an income of less than £5,000 per annum and only 10 per cent of all farm in the State had an income in excess of £15,000 per annum.  In the less favoured regions like the west where.  Members will know, I come from, three-quarters of all farms had incomes of less than £5,000 per annum.  Let us remember that in this country about 18 per cent of the workforce are still engaged in primary agriculture, that is, living and working down on the farm, as they say, with over 30 per cent of the total workforce employed in primary agriculture and the spin-off area of the food and drinks industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What has this Finance Bill done for this all-important sector in the national economy?  I would argue, absolutely nothing.  The horizon for the agricultural industry in 1989 is full of danger signals. Interest rate increases alone this year will add £20 million to farm costs.  The rise in inflation can depress farm incomes in the <Col N="1826" /> current year by about 3 per cent.  Let us remember that the rise in the general level of agricultural incomes in 1988 was purely due to external factors.  The US drought and the previous year's sales of grain to Russia gave an unexpected boost to world agricultural prices and trade which was well reflected here but that will not be repeated this year.</P>
    <P>There is a range of technical-market problems this year also to be reckoned with.  Sales of marketable cattle will be down by at least 8 per cent in 1989.  Average gross margins on livestock production, which is by far the largest component in Irish agriculture, will be about 5 per cent this year, down in real terms on 1987 and 1988.  The average margin per acre in this enterprise in 1989 will barely top £120 for each acre deployed.  Returns on cereal production in terms of yield per acre and the acreage deployed in cereals will fall significantly again this year &mdash; and I have this on the authority of Teagasc.</P>
    <P>On the structural side of the agricultural industry, is there any provision in this Finance Bill to remedy the problems which are well identified in the <i>National Development Plan, 1989-1993</i>?  I would argue, absolutely not.  I ask these relevant questions of the Minister and I hope when he is replying he will give answers.  What, in a meaningful way, is being done to draw down Structural Funds to provide income aids for small producers?  The income plight of these people has been well identified in the Government's national plans.  What structures are being put in place to implement them?  What organisation will be involved in implementing integrated rural development programmes?  Will increased headage payments, a cornerstone of the structural outreach to small, uneconomic farmers be paid this year?  Will the Government accept an extension of the Directive to the severely disadvantaged areas, so unjustly excluded from the benefits of the Structural Funds in 1989?  I hope the Minister has a reply to these all-important questions.</P>
    <P>There is another area on which I wish to take issue with Senator Ryan.  He <Col N="1827" /> spoke about the agricultural and industrial output in this country over the past 20 years or so.  I will not take issue with him on the industrial issue but I must take issue with him on the agricultural issue because he said that agricultural output increased quite significantly per head of workforce employed in the industry in the 18 years 1971 to 1988.  It is quite true, if you use that as your yardstick, that agricultural output per head increased but what he forgot to mention, of course, was that the number of people who were employed in agriculture in that period almost halved, so you are dividing the total value of your agricultural product by about half the figure you were dividing it 20 years ago.  Of course, those with the most elementary knowledge of simple arithmetic will know that by doing your sums that way, the output from agriculture has increased.  However, far more relevant to that debate, which Senator Ryan did not mention at all, is that the average real income of farmers in that period, in those 18 or 20 years, is barely half the average real income to industrial workers.</P>

      <P>I appreciate your interest, and indeed the interests of all of us in agriculture.  You can make passing references and repeat what Senator Brendan Ryan said but you cannot have a full debate on agriculture on the Finance Bill or ask the Minister for Finance to tell you what is the agricultural policy.  You can make as many references as you like but we are really dealing with taxation and that is the responsibility of this Minister. You would have to look to one of the other Ministers to find out what they will do about agriculture.</P>

      <P>I will finish my points of riposte to Senator Ryan in any event; I am coming to the end of my submission. The Land Commission has been abolished. What do the Government intend to put in its place?  Do they consider the need to give a chance to young or small farmers who badly need additional land to stay in or get into business in the first place?  What is being done to set aside a realistic reserve of milk within quota regulations to give an extra quota to young farmers who are setting up in the business with an adequate quota, or indeed no quota at all?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Connor, the Land Commission is not being abolished under this Bill.  You should deal with whatever Minister has abolished it and let Deputy Reynolds deal with finance. He will answer what he is responsible for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be arguing the point that if the Land Commission is abolished it should be replaced by another land agency which would have to be financed out of this budget.  That is the point I am making.  This Finance Bill does not address any of these headings.  What we are developing &mdash; it is Bills like this that are doing it and we are talking about Government policy here &mdash; is a two-speed agriculture industry with dairying and perhaps sheep production doing well while the other enterprises like livestock, pigs, cereals, etc. are doing badly.  A Chathaoirligh, you will be delighted to hear that is the end of my submission to the House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to make a brief comment.  As the Minister knows, generous tax relief is available under section 23 of the Finance Act, 1981, as amended by sections 27, 28 and 29 of the Finance Act, 1988.  Purchasers of new apartments and houses for letting can offset the construction cost against the rental income from both new premises and any other rental properties and it is really to these other rental properties that I want to address myself.  While the new rental houses and apartments have to meet minimum standards and are generally of a high quality, no such conditions attach to the other rental properties on which relief is claimed.  This is wrong.  For example, a landlord of slum properties could buy a new section 23 house or apartment and as a result he could enjoy the income from the slum properties effectively tax free.</P>
      <P>Neither is the tax relief linked to the standards of good practice in the management of either the new or existing properties, such as the use of written tenancy agreements, rentbooks, or a minimum period of notice to quit.  In contrast, the corresponding legislation in the UK which encourages investment in rental property, links the tax relief to secured, that is to say, long term tenancies obeying certain conditions.  Here in Ireland the section 23 tax relief, as I understand it, can be claimed from example by landlords whose tenants of long standing are still only on week to week leases.  I believe figures given recently in reply to a Dáil question showed that the average tax relief granted under section 23 amounts to about £10,000 per claimant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This generous tax relief should be made conditional on standards of good practice in both the new and the existing rental properties.  These standards should include, for example, (1) conformity with the by-laws, where applicable and with <Col N="1830" /> basic standards similar to those enshrined in the Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Standard Regulations, 1984, which lay down minimum standards for formally rent controlled dwellings; (2) the provision of rent books or similar proof of rent paid; and (3) written tenancy agreements.  This might in some way obviate what I would call the loophole of people offsetting too much against older buildings or slum dwellings that are not up to standard.</P>
    <P>That is the comment I wished to make. Perhaps the Minister would like to reply to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>It strikes me that we must be a highly efficient and effective House if we can hope to do in one or two nights what it took our less able and less energetic colleagues in the Lower House weeks if not months to do.  We should pat ourselves on the back for showing how to deal efficiently with legislation.  In welcoming the Minister for Finance on his first visit to the newly refurbished Seanad, I hope he will take back to the Lower House a number of hints on the quick, able and brief dispatch of business so that we can push through the business of legislation, which is our prime function.</P>
      <P>It is a very easy option when one does not have the responsibility of being in Government to take a Bill and to proceed to take on everything that is wrong with it, but I do not intend to do that tonight. It is too easy.  I am conscious that the second last speaker did a very able job on behalf of the Government against some of my own colleagues.  I feel in a kind of besieged position here tonight against, as it were, the grand coalition or everybody bar the Left.  We should leave nine chairs on this side of the House to give us a bit of space over here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Finance Bill reflects the close cooperation at the moment between the Government and the social partners. Those on the Left of politics will very often criticise the outcome of some of those deliberations, discussions and negotiations.  Perhaps they will criticise <Col N="1831" /> them behind closed doors more than anybody would do in a public forum such as this.</P>
    <P>The changes in taxation in the past two years do not satisfy me.  They certainly go further than the Government's commitment in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  Since I will be fairly critical of other things I would like to put those points on the record also.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KatherineBulbulia" hpid="Mrs. Bulbulia Mrs. Bulbulia">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>That, in effect, is a very pragmatic response to an issue.  My belief about the present economic climate is that it is one of those interesting moments in history when the Government, the trade union movement and those in industry have a common objective for once, that is, the common objective of wealth creation.  It is one of those times in this century when it is in all our interests to develop and expand wealth creation.  There are different reasons for it.  Wealth creation is attractive from all points of view, but for different reasons. Wealth creation is very important to the trade union movement and to those on the socialist side of Irish politics &mdash; I would put myself in that category &mdash; because we wish to see a fairer and more equitable division of wealth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There cannot be a fairer and more equitable division of wealth if more wealth is not created.  Therefore, from the point of view of the left wing of politics, it is essential that wealth is created so that we can share it more equitably. That is a very pragmatic response.  The Marxist approach would be to divide what we have now.  However, the pragmatic response is that we will not be able to do that this side of the revolution.  The only way we can improve the position of those who are less well off in society is to create more wealth and hope that the new wealth can be divided better than the old wealth, in other words, that those who survive on wages, those who aspire to be part of the working class might also share in the wealth which, at the moment, is the wealth of the oligarchy of Irish <Col N="1832" /> society.  That would be the principal objective of those on that side of the fence.</P>
    <P>There are people who pretend to be interested in creating employment but those of us, with our eyes wide awake, who were dragged up in a Kerry background and look very closely at things like that, know that what they are really doing is creating profit.  Those people on the way to creating profit, con the rest of the country into thinking they are really in the business of creating employment. They continue the con job even while they continue to sack workers in the interests of rationalisation or more efficiency.  Those people are also interested in wealth creation because it is a response to their greed need.  The greed need can be harnessed for the good of the country at this time.</P>
    <P>Of course, the Government also have, as a clear objective, the creation of wealth.  The Minister set out in this Finance Bill to clear the obstacles to wealth creation.  The Government's view is that wealth creation leads to greater income, greater flow of money and, therefore, greater income to the Government through taxation.  That suits the Government's pragmatic response because they are not prepared to take on the 10 per cent who hold the wealth.  They are not prepared to reallocate that.  Therefore it is in their interests as well.  So, in practical consideration of where we are at the moment, it is in all our interests to create more wealth, but we must insist that when that wealth is created it is divided in a fairer way.</P>
    <P>I disagree completely with these people, including Gay Byrne &mdash; he was at it again this morning on the &ldquo;Gay Byrne Hour&rdquo;&mdash; who say we should be paying less tax.  It is not less tax we need in this country but more tax &mdash; more tax of a different type perhaps, but more tax. I do not want the Minister to say: &ldquo;This is more of it; more tax from somebody else&rdquo;.  I am not saying that.  We should have an equitable form of taxation.</P>
    <P>I noted the Minister's views on employment and unemployment, the creation of one and the elimination of the other &mdash;<Col N="1833" /> take your pick.  It would be begrudging not to say that one welcomes any improvement in the employment figures. There certainly has been an improvement in the employment figures but they are minuscule and I want to put them in the context of emigration.  This has been referred to by a number of speakers, some of whom are very close to me but I would not agree with all of their comments about emigration.  I will say this much, and I want to state it very clearly, because this has serious implications for all aspects of the taxation system.  The birth rate in Ireland at the moment is in or around 55,000 souls per annum, the rate of emigration is in or around 40,000 bodies per annum, and when we add the death rate to that, we are very close to a falling population.</P>
    <P>A falling population has a negative impact on every part of national life. What is happening is that graduates are leaving the country.  In this month's publication by FÁS it gives a list of monthly trends but it refers to a survey of the 1987 graduates.  Forty-seven per cent of those surveyed were in some form of employment but of those in employment, one-third are in employment abroad.  The gap does not mean unemployment because many of them have gone on to postgraduate studies and similar types of further studies.  The actual figures are not as bad as I have said there but the main point I want to make is that one-third of the graduates in 1987 are working abroad.  What does that mean?  I would like the Minister to respond to me in terms of balancing the books.</P>
    <P>Those of us who survived and exploited the educational system to come through three levels of it have something to give to this country, and should be required to do so.  I never tire of making the point that when I first enrolled in a third level institution, before I was allowed begin my course of study I had to sign a very official legal form giving an undertaking to the Minister for Education that I would work in the State for five years before I dared consider emigration.  That is only 20 years ago.  In other words, the State said to me: &ldquo;We are investing a lot of <Col N="1834" /> money in putting you through third level and we need you in this country.  If you are going to leave this country you will have to buy your way out of it&rdquo;.  That was the precise position.  I did not leave and here I am today making a marvellous contribution and I could have been lost.</P>

      <P>It is important to keep that in mind.  The Minister said that the employment figures &ldquo;were not impressive&rdquo; which is an under-statement or the over-statement &mdash; I am not sure which, I must get my perspective right in this.  It does not meet the needs of those people who have left the country or those who are unemployed.  It is not just figures.  It is a matter of dignity, of contribution to the State and of participation, which are all aspects of unemployment which have to be looked at in a Finance Bill for the greater good of the State.</P>
      <P>The exports for last year improved by approximately 13.9 per cent.  I have looked at the figures for all of last year on a month-by-month basis and I have looked at the figures to date for this year. I am very worried about them because I see what is happening.  There is a coming together.  The balance is swinging the wrong way at the moment.  No matter what the Government do about it, it is inevitable because it is part of an economic development over which the Government have no control.  There is no point in looking for credit for it now and in a year's time trying to distance themselves from it and blame problems on the Deutsche Mark or whichever is the dominant currency at that time.  We can assume that it will be the Deutsche Mark.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like the Minister to have the honesty to say that we are no more than a &ldquo;green mark&rdquo; at the moment in European terms and that we will not aspire to be anything more than that for a long time to come.  I am not saying that is necessarily a bad thing but it is important to accept the realities of life.  There are a number of things we have failed to address.  The low inflation of the past <Col N="1835" /> number of years, coupled with the increase in exports over imports of 14 per cent last year, has meant that there is a larger amount of disposable income available at present.  Those people with money have more money than they used to have years ago.  Because inflation has gone up very little, 3 per cent, the standing cost per annum for commitments is basically the same.  That means that the people with money have more disposable income and such people in times of low inflation traditionally spend.  Similarly, in times of high inflation and very little disposable income people tend to save.  This has got to do with the psyche as opposed to any logical reason. That has always been the trend and always stands up to examination.</P>
    <P>When people have more disposable income, what do they do with it?  I am delighted the Minister has come back so that I can continue my economic lecture which should be very helpful in planning the future state of the country.  I can see he will listen with avid interest.</P>
    <P>To recap I was dealing with what we are doing about disposable income at the moment.  What do people do with it? They spend it.  People spend extra disposable income on two main things, houses and cars.  We sold more Mercedes last month than in any month since Mercedes started operating in this country. There are two ways of looking at it.  The Minister may stand up and say we are doing great and it might go down very well in a certain class and strata of society but it is not any indication.  It means we have created wealth but we are not redistributing it.</P>
    <P>The Minister would always say that his objective would be to a fairer distribution of wealth.  There are measures in this Bill which go some way towards improving the situation.  I know he would not claim to have sorted out the problem, but I am making the point that not only have we failed to redistribute but we have badly failed to redistribute wealth.  At a time when we are told we are in the worst shape we have ever been as a State, we sell the highest number of Mercedes that <Col N="1836" /> have been sold in any month.  That is only one indicator.  It is an indicator that will not be in the next issue of the statistics for the month or in the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> but I am interested in having it on the record of this House.</P>
    <P>We have a greater disposable income, and we start spending it on cars.  The Mercedes bit is only an aside.  It is not just the Mercedes.  The sale of cars has zoomed up.  The saddest part about that is that every single one of those cars contribute to a worsening of our balance of trade because they are all imported and every single penny of a disposable income spent on new cars is worsening the balance of trade.  At an earlier stage in this session I made a very strong recommendation and plea to Government that we would get our act together and get into line with the rest of Europe and stop driving on the wrong side of the road by having cars with steering wheels on the same side as the rest of Europe and driving on the same side of the road as the rest of Europe.  It would then be easier to shift assembly points from parts of the European mainland to this country.  It is time we got moving on that.</P>
    <P>That is just one thing.  People are spending too much money on cars and the balance of trade is worsening.  The Minister nods to the Central Bank; the Central Bank nods to the market; the short term lending rate goes up and suddenly money gets tighter.  Before that happens somebody pulls the plug on the property market and people who could not sell houses for £28,000 six months ago are now being offered £50,000 and people are pleading to give it to them. People are lining up at the door with £50,000.  Where did the money come from?  These people had not a shilling to buy property six months ago.  It is the greatest scam imaginable.  It is hype and I have to agree completely with the Minister for the Environment on the issue. Somebody is conning somebody.</P>
    <P>At the same time the punter will lose because the punter now says: &ldquo;Property is going up.  Invest in property&rdquo;.  In all of Europe no other population has a higher density of house ownership per 1,000 of <Col N="1837" /> population.  We have this great thing about owning our own houses.  Not only do we own our own houses but we go into debt to do it to the extent of whatever income we have available.  The person earning X thousand pounds a year will work out how expensive a house he can buy.  I have never understood that approach but that is the approach.  How expensive a house can I buy?  How expensive an address can I buy?  People say: &ldquo;This is what I can afford.  Take it to the limit&rdquo;.  Therefore, they commit all their disposable income to that property. They might have bought a new car, which has worsened our balance of trade figures, or they might have changed a car, or whatever, some time earlier.  Now the Central Bank are tightening up.  Now the interest rates go up.  Now the repayments go up and people who committed their disposable income have not got enough income to meet their commitments.  Then we are back on the downward spiral of the building societies taking over houses as we have seen over the past five years. What does that resolve?  The Finance Bill has to approach that spiral and intervene on it.</P>
    <P>I want to get back to the question of exports.  Basic planning has to be reflected here in a whole lot of ways. Recently I was looking at the changes in terms of where workers are placed.  In a set of figures given between 1984 and 1988, the numbers of workers employed in service industries increased; the numbers of workers employed in agriculture related industries reduced from 16 to 15 per cent; and the numbers of workers in manufacturing industry also decreased. It is not a good development that the numbers of workers in industry should decrease.  When I was going to primary and post-primary school you could have sliced the allocation of workers in thirds: one-third in agriculture-related, one-third in service-related, and one-third in industry.  That was not useful either because there was a preponderance in agriculture for a country like this.</P>
    <P>Certainly the present developments are worrying.  I want to put to the Minister some of the things I have reflected <Col N="1838" /> on.  It is important to recognise that the countries who spend the greatest proportion of their GDP on research and development are countries like France, Japan, Sweden, the USA and the UK.  If you take the European figure, only Spain spends a lower proportion on research and development than Ireland.  I raise that point for two reasons.  First the Finance Bill should not be directed at business expansion schemes only.  I welcome that move and I welcome the tightening up by the Minister in that area.  I welcome the tightening up on the abuse that was taking place under the business expansion schemes.</P>
    <P>There must be a more refined instrument here.  We must look at rewarding research and development in a very serious way.  Not only are we not improving that situation but we are worsening it.  I want to give an indication of how we are worsening it.  Because we do not have research and development, many of our industries are dependent on the use of products as basic raw materials, products whose patent has expired.  This is what allows Irish small industry to compete in Ireland with the multi-nationals.  I will give an example of what I am talking about.  A small chemical company in Ireland are working in agricultural chemicals or whatever.  They are using as their raw material chemicals that were patented at some stage and they can only use them when the patent has run out. At the moment &mdash; I know the Minister will be aware of this from his former ministry &mdash; that patent is 16 years.  Much of our industry is based on starting up in the 17th year and remember a lot of our industries are competing in the world market with countries who do not recognise the patent at all, the Third World, the unrestricted etc.  I know the Minister's former Department were considering bringing legislation which would extend the patent from 16 to 20 years.  I can cost that in jobs.</P>
    <P>In this Finance Bill we should actually be giving support to industry in all sorts of ways and we should be directing it in particular at research and development. The reason I am so hot on this particular <Col N="1839" /> one is that the Minister refers to 1992 and the changes that will take place.  I am conscious of European conventions on these things to which we are committed. European conventions which will put us, as we stand on the periphery of Europe, competing with the multinationals and the major industries of the rest of Europe on level terms.  Therefore, we should adopt as many protectionist policies as we possibly can in the intervening period in the hope of getting support when the plug is pulled on us in 1992.  It is far easier to make a case to show the devastating results that will take place at that point. Beyond that point are we going to stand on our own two feet?  How can we stand on our own two feet if we do not have the investment in research and development?</P>
    <P>At the beginning I referred to the Government's negotiations with the social partners and in particular to the trade union movement.  I want to refer to the present arrangements on public service pay which have been welcomed by many sides.  They certainly will help categories of workers in the public service. I would also like to hear words of praise for the public service from the Minister because, too often in discussions, Ministers said our objective is to cut back on the public service, cut back on public expenditure without explaining to the people that what they are really talking about is worsening the quality of education, worsening the quality of health care, etc. etc.</P>
    <P>The public service is that part of the State structure which looks after us from the womb to the tomb, or should, but quite certainly from the birth cert to the death cert.  Everything in between has to be dealt with through the public service. For that reason also, I was very pleased to hear as an aside the Fianna Fáil chairperson of one of our joint committees stating yesterday that privatisation is not the answer to everything in discussing Aer Lingus.  We are now beginning to see that.  The work done in this Chamber is an example of how work can be done efficiently and within time.  It must be <Col N="1840" /> recognised that implementing pay awards to the public service is an investment in the future of the State.</P>
    <P>There is one thing I do not understand which is relevant to the Finance Bill: I do not know if the Minister has been asked this question in the other House. Although they have had three months to wander their way through this Bill they do not seem to have made any major inroads to it.  As I said earlier, the efficient dispatch of business by this House in doing in two days what it takes the other House three months to do is certainly something which should be reflected upon by all concerned in terms of how best to deal with legislation.</P>
    <P>There has been no mention of the Gleeson award.  This goes back to the earlier point of investment in the State. Where are we going to if we are going to lose all the best people in the public service to private industry?  It is essential that we pay people to reflect their value and worth.  Therefore, I urge the Minister to give a commitment here that the outstanding parts of the Gleeson report will be implemented.  I am sure his advisers will support me in that.  I hope they write in supportive comments when they come back.  If I may be so bold, I would advise the advisers to write in on the last page of the script &ldquo;and, of course, I intend implementing in full the Gleeson award&rdquo; and the Minister is on his own from there on.  I ask people to consider that.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's commitment to increasing the level of self-assessment. I believe he would give credit to the previous Government who also worked closely in this regard.  I believe that all sides of the political spectrum would agree that the idea of putting responsibility on people to make a returns promptly and also making them responsible for what is wrong is very effective.  I am bothered about the penalties.  It is extremely odd that in the history of this State we have seen all sorts of fiddles and frauds in taxation but have we ever imprisoned anybody for defrauding us in relation to income tax or any other taxation?  Have the full rigours of the law ever been brought to bear on people who <Col N="1841" /> have defrauded us of millions of pounds over generations?  I am not asking the Minister to be defensive about that and I am not asking him to defend the Judiciary because I know how popular they are with the Government at the moment but I want a statistical response from him so that I can include it in my election address next week.</P>
    <P>The saddest part of the Bill is the issue of capital and corporation tax.  There should be a more equitable distribution of wealth and a fairer share-out of wealth. We have failed in that and I would like the Minister to say he agrees with me that they have failed to do this.  I will not play again the tax amnesty returns of last year except to say: &ldquo;I told you so for years&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris welcomed in glowing terms the Minister's response on the inner city dwellings.  I would also like to put on record that it is a reflection on the Minister that he was big enough and generous enough to give credit to Senator Norris but, in fairness, he has always been a big man in dealing with such issues. However, while it is impressive &mdash; I totally support it &mdash; to give specific tax relief to people in buying and renovating buildings which are historically and architecturally significant, it is important to also look at property tax and the lack of returns from it.  I am very tempted to relay one story the Minister told in private company about a few people in Dublin paying tax on their houses, which included the most senior Minister and the third most senior member of Government. That sums it up.  It is fair for the Minister to say: &ldquo;The postman would bring in more names and addresses of people who should be paying property tax than we have got in the last year&rdquo;. That is what I have always said.  Perhaps we need more people working in the Revenue Commissioners, hunting out extra money for the State.  I enjoyed the number of requests recorded over the weekend from people living in upper-class areas, such as Ailesbury Road and so on trying to have themselves redefined as living in Sallynoggin to avoid property tax that would accrue on their dwellings.</P>
    <P>I welcome the way the Minister <Col N="1842" /> addresses the business expansion scheme.  I know it is good because I was in the company of two accountants on the night he announced it and they were fuming.  Therefore, it had to be good.  I bought them both a drink.  Before reading it I was in a very receptive frame of mind about it.  It was disgraceful what was going on.  The development near the East Link bridge was sold out in six hours.  The people involved were laughing at us.  I was delighted that firm action was taken to hammer that one immediately.  I know that people got away with it beforehand but at least it has nipped, not quite in the bud but half-way up the stem, a desperate abuse of that scheme.</P>
    <P>In relation to the business expansion scheme, I noticed that none of the finance houses were advertising in the last week in March for people to invest before the end of the taxation year in business expansion schemes but they were giving all sorts of sweeteners.  They were saying that if we invested with them now they would guarantee 10 per cent on top of the premium.  I have never known a bank to take a risk.  I have often seen them make bad decisions but that was because they thought they were not taking a risk and it was just bad judgment if they lost money.  Neither have I ever seen a finance house take risks and I have certainly never seen a stockbroker take a risk and I have discussed that with my colleague stockbroker, Senator Ross, on a number of occasions.</P>
    <P>I thought I was clear on the scheme but as the months pass the BES gets cloudier and cloudier.  The Minister said the relief will only be granted to those who redeem after five years at market value.  If a number of people invest at the maximum of £25,000 &mdash; the maximum total amount in any scheme is £2.5 million &mdash;in a business expansion scheme in 1989 the commitment is that it has to remain there until 1994.  Of course, the total amount of the investment is offset against tax so for a person who is on a 50 per cent rate of income tax there is an immediate saving of £12,500.  The money which was going to the State is now diverted into this investor's pocket to encourage him <Col N="1843" /> or her to make the investment.  That is a 50 per cent return in income in the first year and that is hard to beat.  I cannot think of a better investment.  Shanahan's Stamps went to the wall looking for 15 per cent.</P>
    <P>This is a straightforward operation but then the Minister says they must get it back at market value after five years.  I take it that is the market value in five years time, in other words the quoted price, the market price, the exchange price, or the sale price in 1994.  That is fair enough as well.  If the banks or the finance houses invest with us and will give a 10 per cent or 5 per cent return on top of the initial investment at the end of five years, is that the £25,000 invested now which nets me £12,500 immediately, plus the capital appreciation over the five years &mdash; let us say it has gone up to £40,000 in five years time &mdash; that I will redeem £40,000 at market value?  Does it also mean that the bank can put 10 per cent on top of that?  I see the Minister shaking his head which, I presume means no.</P>
    <P>I would like to have that cleared up.  I have made it clear that it is a very good return on income.  Let me say immediately that I welcome that.  If it takes that to screw the money out of them, or at least to find out if they have the money, whatever it takes to expose it, let us get it on the record so that we have them in the system, have the names on the computer and deal with them for evermore. I hope the Minister is not asking too many of them at the moment where they got the money.  I would wait a year or two.  There is plenty of time to ask them when we have more in the scheme. I would not like to get rid of any of them at this point.  The only problem I have about the BES is that it might be more directional.  I like the idea in the Finance Bill of excluding certain areas like the city of Dublin, county of Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This scheme could be more specific.  I would like the Minister to be more specific. I know it is easy for me to say this now but perhaps it might be honed down a bit more and the Government could decide on directions for investment.  Let me give an example.  Let us say the Minister brought in an amendment saying the BES will continue but this year it will be applicable only to investment in the expansion of, say, tourism and fisheries. I am not for a moment suggesting the Minister should do this.  I am just using an example to indicate what I am talking about.  It allows the Minister to direct private investment because they will follow the sweetener, one way or another.  The reason I am conscious of that is that I was explaining to the Minister on one occasion recently the concept of additionality which arises from the European structural funds.</P>
      <P>The only way the Minister will ever get to the application of the concept of additionality is if he can direct private investment.  I do not think it will be directed this way because people will only invest in the least risky proposals.  The Minister should sweeten them up to get them into the risk business and then get direction and with the State contribution and the private contribution we might finally arrive at the concept of additionality. I hope to be around when that first cheque is handed over.  I will go over to Brussels at my own expense to see the receipt of that £9 billion when it first comes through.  I certainly will not hold my breath, not this side of an election, anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In going beyond the narrow area of investment in industry, in the development of the State, we have failed in the Finance Bill to direct investment in the areas which are most in need.  I mentioned research and development.  I could also mention other things I believe that, for instance, the fishing industry has been neglected.  I would like to know what kind of investment has been made in the <Col N="1845" /> fishing industry through the Business Expansion Scheme since it was initiated. That is the issue which for me has the greatest potential for growth.  I also want to raise one awkward question about investment in ships and boats etc.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister used language which was unnecessary.  Yacht is one word which would have been grand and I would have been saying: &ldquo;Well done&rdquo;.  A senior member of the Government put the boot into that one and somebody was afraid to take him on.  Where BES money is being used for the purchase of a ship, that ship must represent a beneficial addition to the Irish Shipping Register.  I know what the Minister means but other types must be considered as well.  It might well be said that it is the only transport to Inishvickillane and even that has to be protected and might be a necessary addition to the Irish Shipping Register.</P>
      <P>I want to know the difference between a ship and a boat.  It is important to know that.  I know my colleague, Senator Fitzgerald, who knows a little about Inishvickillane and who is also in the fishing industry and knows a bit about fishing, would be very upset and might have to move across to this side of the House if he felt that investment in any ship needed for fishing, in other words a fishing boat, might be ruled out.  I know the Minister has no intention in this legislation of ruling out investment in the fishing industry. I just want clarification on the point that it allows investment in a boat, for instance.  The Minister might clear that one up for me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You would not buy much of a fishing boat nowadays for £2.5 million but that is another business altogether.  The people who want to buy fishing boats have to get loans from Norwegian banks.  They will <Col N="1846" /> not get enough money at home to do it. That is part of the reason we have failed in the fishing industry.  I looked at the figures for employment based on the fishing industry.  I found that in European terms approximately eight people are working on processing or on-shore jobs for every person working at sea.  In other words, there are very few fishermen &mdash; sorry for the sexist term, but it is very hard to say fisherperson &mdash; working at sea.  There are eight people working in a dependant industry, mainly fish processing for every person working at sea. That is the European average.</P>
    <P>I do not know the latest Irish figure but I know the Irish figure for two years ago. It was just over .9 per cent.  In other words, we have gone only 10 per cent of the way.  We have one person working where the European average is nine.  That is disgraceful.  Where does the fault lie? We have failed to make investment in that direction.  We are afraid of Spanish trawlers coming into our fishing areas. Our fishing industry is older than the Spanish fishing industry.  Why should we be threatened by them?  Somebody should be put up against a wall on that one.  We have been trying to invest in that industry for years and years.  I saw how people were wrecked in it and how families were wrecked over the years, coming from a fishing town myself.  I believe that it should be direct investment. We have failed to do it.  I throw that out as one of the areas to which we might direct investment through the Business Expansion Scheme.</P>
    <P>On the whole question of imports and exports the Minister for Finance should also look at perks and investment down the line.  The Department of Finance should be prepared, for instance, to subsidise the teaching of modern European languages in Ireland at all levels, primary, post primary, third level and community. I looked at the recent report of Coras Tráchtála &mdash; leaving out Greece, Portugal and Spain &mdash; in relation to the European market and I discovered that the market where we were doing worse was Italy.  It is a huge market.  It is virgin <Col N="1847" /> territory for us in terms of ground unfurrowed for us.</P>
    <P>I also looked at another set of figures and statistics on the teaching of European languages in Irish schools.  Which of the European languages is the least taught of the main ones?  It is Italian.  If I want to do business with people I like to be able to talk to them myself.  I could not handle interpreters in a business situation.  We lack that investment.  It is something the Government should look at not as an investment in education but as an investment in industry.  There should be an investment in modern European languages. This is raised regularly by politicians who say we would have to take on the teachers' unions and teachers etc.  We would not have to take on the teachers' unions or anybody else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>They are decent people.  They are committed to improving the country and the education service. If the Minister decides to invest money in the teaching of modern European languages, there will be nobody quicker than the teachers' unions to tell him how to do it, and then it is finished and on to the next business.  I ask the Minister to keep that in mind.  It also boils down to the question of careers guidance and counsel. These are issues which are directly related.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have to listen to people from CII and those people who call themselves the Irish Management Industry.  Those people should carry a health warning for what they have done to industry in this country.  Many of them have left a trail of destruction behind them.  They tell us what we should be doing when they are the ones who are supposed to be doing it.  They can criticise everybody else as they go along the road.  If there are things wrong in the country let us all take our share of the blame for what we are responsible for.  Let us put the boot into everybody else.  This is an example of where we need an investment.  There has <Col N="1848" /> to be an investment made in infrastructure. It is not good enough to let it all happen on its own.</P>
    <P>It is almost cant to talk about the young Europeans.  We are the young Europeans. I have looked at all the predictions about the falling birth rate and I have also looked at another figure, the average number of births per 1,000 population in European terms and I have compared the Irish one.  We are very close to that figure at the moment.  There is certainly no reason to think that we fall below the European average in that area.  With a possible visit from the Pope coming up, we could do massive things for pupil numbers, teachers' jobs and population bulges in the near future.</P>
    <P>I believe we have a very real role to play in the new Europe.  We need languages; we need to invest in education; we need, most of all, to have the young people.  Somebody made a comment there &mdash; I think it was Senator McGowan &mdash; on the fact that we are part of Europe, that people working in Europe should be seen as part of the European Community and not seen as emigrants.  That is a bit trite.  I know the general direction in which he was going.  With easier connections and easier access between the mainland and Ireland we can participate in Europe in a great way.  I see no reason why in ten, 12 or 20 years time Irish people should not be at the head of all major European institutions.  I have no doubt that that will happen provided we produce the right people.  I always believe in having daoine sa chúirt because I know if they are there they will also do the chauvinistic thing and look after their home.</P>
    <P>I want to talk about the whole question of capital gains and share income.  I know it is a subject close to the Minister's heart but people are getting away with murder and I would put the boot into them. Income is income and if you make money you should pay taxes.  Let us call it all income and make it simple.  There are enough sweeteners in the different schemes.  Special capital gains just because the share prices goes up or whatever is just not on.  There is no way in the <Col N="1849" /> world to justify that.  If it is income, it is income.  If I get a cheque for £10 it does not matter what it is for.  I am £10 better off and I should be taxed as such.</P>
    <P>I see a lot of sense in protecting risk in the smaller companies where there is a genuine risk.  I will run with that but I do not see any reason for this special treatment in terms of the money gained through investment in shares.  It does not make any sense any more.  The new schemes have overtaken it.  It hits the small man.  The Minister is a racing man. I will take a perfect example of what I am talking about.  The week before last a well orchestrated PR effort was emanating from Senator Magner's county and it was Saratogen all over the place.  There was no other horse in the race.  I am referring to the Guineas.</P>

      <P>This was the week before.  Facts are the facts at the time and the facts at the time were it was all about Saratogen.  The unemployed, the income earners, the wage earners put their hard earned shillings on Saratogen in the bookie's shop.  Before they even got their betting slips back they paid their tax &mdash; the fools.  They had their tax taken from them before they actually got their betting slips back.  The State is entitled to do that.  If they were smart enough to walk around the corner to Davys they could have invested in classic throughbreds at 33 or 34 on the Monday before the race.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  There is investment in the stockbroker's shop by one set of people and in the bookie's shop by another set of people.  It is the difference between the tax up-front people in the bookie's shop or the people who get a £4,000 break, or whatever the amount is, who are entitled to earn up to £4,000 before they have to pay any tax on it. The real sickener is this.  Not only do they not have to pay tax but, having invested their money at 32 on the Monday, on Friday &mdash; who is interested in the race; it <Col N="1850" /> has been all over the papers all week &mdash; the shares are 39 and now they sell the shares and who cares who wins the race. You have won the race anyway.  You have not paid any taxes on it.  The small punter in the meantime is watching the television on the Saturday afternoon at 3.40 p.m. and Saratogen is still out there somewhere.  He was not in the frame or anywhere else.  The punter has paid the State tax due and has lost his or her money.  The person who invested in shares in the horse has collected at somebody else's expense.</P>
      <P>There is something wrong with the system.  I do not want to be too colourful about it.  I believe we should cushion risk but I do not believe we should reward Scrooges.  That is really what we are doing.  If somebody is going to let it ride on the horse's nose and risk rule 34 on the Monday, as happened to poor old Senator Fallon, there is some sympathy for that person.  He is a real player.  He will never be rich because rich people do not take risks.  This is how you get rich.</P>
      <P>There is so much in the Bill that I would go on much longer.  I know there is a matter for the Adjournment debate and I was warned not to go on too long. I would like to wind up by saying the Bill is like the curate's egg: good and bad, hard and soft.  It makes an effort to approach certain problems.  There are things in it to which I take grave exception and there are other things which are a step in the right direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I may make a comment on what happens in another place, I was impressed that the Minister was able, with facility, to take amendments from other people into and to accept, as he said, that not all wisdom is always vested entirely in the Department or Minister for Finance.  The Bill was the better for those changes that were made.  I would like to go into it in the long term but the sad part of it is that it will not address the problems of society.  It has tightened up certain aspects of taxation and various issues but I still have to ask how can we have the best sales month ever in Mercedes when, in the same month, we <Col N="1851" /> cannot supply health and education services. There is something wrong somewhere and we need to address the basics so we will begin to redistribute wealth in the future.  In the meantime, I welcome the Minister to the House.  I hope he enjoys his stay and that we will see more of him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is more to running the economy than just the sales of Mercedes in one particular month.  If you were talking to the same Mercedes dealers, they would tell you they did not sell too many for the last four or five years.  I do not think anybody is unaware of the very poor state of the motor industry over the last four or five years and that inevitably it comes to the time when you cannot run the car any longer and you decide to change it.  Having said that, I am quite conscious of the fact that cars are imported into the country but our exports are also increasing.  I have no reason at this stage of the year to change the forecasts I made at budget time that we will have as good a balance of payments surplus at the end of this year as we had last year despite the fact that inevitably consumer demand rises.  We import 57 per cent of our requirements in this economy which should not be as high as that or anything like it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because we are one of the most open economies in Europe, inevitably when consumer demand rises, as it is rising, and I know I forecast something around 3 per cent on budget day and it is probably pushing nearer to 4 per cent at this stage, inevitably you are going to have imports being sucked in.  What is important, in an open trading economy, is that our exports not alone keep pace but keep exceeding imports.  That is exactly what is going on. I am watching that trend very closely.  I did sound a note of warning on a few occasions that while international trends in inflation keep rising as they are rising, it is even more important still that we in this country make sure we keep our costs moderated and do not allow any unjustifiable increase that would add to <Col N="1852" /> inflation.  Inevitably because we import 57 per cent of our requirements, as international inflation rises so too will our inflation rate rise.  What is important is that we keep our relative position.  At the end of February our inflation rate stood at 3.3 per cent.  I know it will be higher than that at the end of the year, but when one looks at the market for most of our small to medium size industry, which is Britain to a fair degree, one sees an inflation rate there pushing 8 per cent and indeed forecast to go higher.</P>
    <P>I do not think we can judge the whole economy on the number of Mercedes cars bought in the last month.  If the Senator got the opportunity of reading my speech he would see that I said there was an increase in car purchases of 35 per cent in January.  I am not using the good statistics or the bad statistics.  I use the whole lot.  They are there to be read.</P>
    <P>Many other points were raised by the last speaker.  In relation to the BES, to put his mind at ease about these bankers who he says are not benevolent societies and I agree with him &mdash; they never have been benevolent societies &mdash; what happens in the BES scheme is you put in your money and you must leave it in for five years.  What was happening up to the time I brought this amendment in was that financial institutions were guaranteeing you your return plus 10 per cent in some instances.  What they really meant by that was that you got your £25,000 back plus 10 per cent on top of the £25,000.  If the shares in the company in which you invested your money had depreciated by 100 per cent you only got 10 per cent of that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>You did not get 110 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>No, because also in that calculation of course was the fact that you got income tax relief.  That is why they were able to show an investment return of 18 per cent to 19 per cent. That included the tax relief you had got. Really what they were looking at was not the £25,000 but if you were paying 56 per cent you were talking about maybe <Col N="1853" /> £12,000.  You were getting back £25,000 plus 10 per cent which was £27,500 and that was why they were giving you such a big return, over five years maybe 19 per cent a year.</P>
      <P>However, as I say, all shares that carry options, that carry that sort of guarantee, are gone from the date of the Finance Bill publication.  In other words, the funds that are available for the BES scheme are now being redirected back for the very purpose for which the BES scheme was brought in by Deputy John Bruton in his time.  They are gone back now to the original purpose and that is high risk investment allowing tax relief for it.  It does apply indeed to fishing trawlers.  What is a ship?  A ship is a real ship but because of that loose terminology it was possible to describe a good size yacht as a ship.  There was a number of loopholes in the BES scheme but many of these have been plugged in this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking about real ships that can get finance under the BES scheme.  As I say, the scheme was never intended to be more than part of the financial package of any business.  It should never have been seen as replacing traditional borrowing.  The Senator is quite right when he said that it was moving to the situation of replacing traditional borrowing with guarantees from the banks and all the risk gone out.  The whole purpose of the scheme has been undermined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator referred to a development in the docks and there was another one in Dublin 4 where there were fancy town houses being build, being called tourism villages, and consequently qualifying for BES relief.  All that is gone.  The reason I specified the borough's boundaries was clearly to get rid of that sort of abuse.  To <Col N="1854" /> do it any other way would be far too wide.  I was asked in the Dáil if I could not draw new maps and say: &ldquo;You can have your development in such and such a place&rdquo;.  You will find that the only boundaries available to me are those sort of boundaries.  I have not time to draw a map.  As I say, we do not get into that sort of area in the Finance Bill.  We do the best with the boundaries that are there to tie it down as tight as we can to make sure that we do not let the people who were manipulating the scheme continue to manipulate it.</P>
    <P>Many other areas of tax evasion and loopholes are being closed in this Bill. There was reversed annuities which had become a bit of a scam.  There was the question of the McGrath type loophole which was being sold clearly around town.  In addition there is the general anti-avoidance measure which I thought the last Senator and some of his colleagues might be only too glad to welcome.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the development of languages.  As far as I recall from reading something not all that long ago, French seems to be the language that is being taught more in our schools than any other language.  Why <Col N="1855" /> that is I do not know.  I would have thought that Spanish, Italian and German would be equally important for people thinking about 1992.  There are people in the private sector looking at language school projects at the moment.  Indeed my colleague, the Minister for Education, is making her own arrangements in relation to how she is going to attack the teaching of languages.  I remember reading somewhere that people who would have been counterparts of Senator O'Toole, when they became excess in Germany were retrained for word-processing and so on.  Perhaps some of the excess we have here could be retrained in language teaching.  I do not know whether that would accord with the Senator's union principles but it is certainly a practical suggestion in relation to some of the people he talks about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>It certainly would.  I made that suggestion a year ago.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>You could be right. To answer all the questions I asked here I would have to be Minister for Agriculture, Minister for Energy, Minister for Education and every other Minister in the place.  I am not going to wander into all those areas except to give as much information as I have available to me.</P>
      <P>I think there are enough measures on the Statute Book now to attack tax avoidance and it is there to be done.  Self-assessment is certainly going well.  The penalties are there.  I brought in an amendment to the Bill for somebody who would make a bona fide return for property tax, as mentioned by Senator O'Toole, who would find that the market had moved so much and that they might find themselves under penalty.  There is an appeal mechanism there for doing it but the penalty does not apply anyway unless one is 50 per cent wrong.  I mean you could be 50 per cent wrong and they still would not heed you.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last speaker mentioned tax relief and entrepreneurs.  I do not see anything wrong with tax relief for entrepreneurs. He might not agree with that.  I still do <Col N="1856" /> not see anything wrong in the small companies market in reintroducing the capital gains tax for a year.  Those are the companies that find it very hard to get finance out there and I think it is wrong to categorise them all just as thoroughbreds.  I think that is wrong.  How do I know that the same company will not produce a winner in three weeks time and you could be eating your words again?</P>

      <P>And investment decisions are a matter for the individual themselves.  If they want to make a good or a bad investment decision the Minister for Finance cannot take them by the hand and tell them: &ldquo;That is good one and that is a bad one.&rdquo;  That is entirely their own decision, their own risk.  If they win, they win and if they lose, they lose.</P>

The relief the Senator talks about, which is £2,000 for a single person and £4,000 for a married couple, if you make anything over that gain in one particular year, you pay 60 per cent capital gains <Col N="1857" /> tax on it.

If we have a country where there are no risk takers we will have no investment, no development, no jobs, and we will end up simply looking to the State to do everything.  I am not sure what the Senator was really advocating because if he is advocating that then I would certainly totally disagree with him.  I do not know what he was advocating.  As he said, it is easy to stand up when you are not in Government and talk about all the things that are wrong, but I have not heard any suggestions as to how I might tackle the things the Senator believes are wrong. When one is in Opposition it is easy to take that approach.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. J. O'Toole Mr. J. O'Toole">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I made it clear in the Dáil that if there were good sensible suggestions, as I proved in the Dáil, that could improve something, I would certainly take them on board irrespective of what quarter they came from.  I want the Seanad to think about it in the same light as well.  I am sorry Senator Connor is not in the House.  He must think I am the Minister for Agriculture.  He talked a lot about economists, economics and statistics but I would advise him in the nicest way possible to change from the French-park school of economics and go elsewhere to try to get a few facts right.  One of the first things he said was that there were 243,000 on the unemployment list. <Col N="1858" /> He is 10,000 out there for a start.  Sometimes I do not have great faith in economists.</P>
      <P>The Senator tried to turn on its head the Exchequer borrowing requirement as a percentage in GNP.  I could not follow that argument except that the official statistics are there.  It was about 13 per cent in 1986 when they went out of Government; it is down in this year's budget to 5.3 per cent and it will be better than that.  The fact is that the national debt was doubled in their four and a half years in Government.  If it had not been doubled, I would have £1,000 million of a surplus in this year's budget to do a lot of the things that people in the Seanad and elsewhere advocate that I should do. The fact is that happened.  It is costing £7,000 for every man, woman and child &mdash; that is the debt that is on every person in this country &mdash; and it is costing £40 a week for every person who is working in this country and paying tax.  That is why it is so important that the debt be stabilised. Not alone has it to be stabilised, it has to be reduced if we are serious about reducing taxation.</P>
      <P>Senator Connor went on to ask why we were not using the Structural Funds to pay headage payments, why we were not doing other things with the new Structural funds.  I will not waste the time of the Seanad on this.  All I will do is give him a little bit of information which he does not seem to have got and that is the Structural Funds in agriculture come into play on 1 January 1990.  They are not in place in 1989 and, consequently, all the things he talks about will come onstream after the new Structural Funds come into play in the Commission on 1 January 1990.  It is not the Government's fault they are not in operation in 1989.  The Commission had not their regulations in place and were not ready to implement the Structural Funds as they refer to agriculture in the FEOGA and guidance funds until 1 January 1989.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been carrying out surveys in a whole lot of other areas in agriculture. It is our commitment to increase the size of the disadvantaged areas, and indeed to increase headage payments as well. <Col N="1859" /> All that will be part of the new Structural Funds when the Commission in Brussels make up their minds and make their final decisions in relation to aspects of the plan that is with them.  The plan is in Brussels and the questions that the Senator addressed will be answered when they come into place.</P>
    <P>I would like to thank the Senators who contributed to the debate.  I appreciate their contributions and the general welcome for some parts of the Bill.  I know that you can never hope to please all of the people all the time but we try to do our best for most of the people most of the time.</P>
    <P>Senator Bulbulia took me to task on quite a number of counts.  She felt that my introductory speech indicated no philosophy, that there was no evidence of planning for economic growth and employment but merely a concern with the public finances as a one item agenda, that there was no concern with poverty and that what was being done about tax reform was minuscule.  I will take them one after the other.</P>
    <P>I would have thought at this stage that the Government had made their philosophy and overall approach clear to everybody.  Whatever doubts may exist in the Senator's mind, I think there is an understanding throughout the community of what the Government are trying to achieve.  Indeed, the clarity and consistency of Government policy is the single most important factor underpinning the economic recovery that is taking place.  The effort to represent the Government's concern with the public finances as a one item agenda approach to the country's problems is, in my view, rather outdated.  Every reputable commentator now accepts that the problems of the public finances and the problems of the economy, including the major issues of unemployment, poverty and emigration are all inextricably bound together.  One cannot deal with one problem on its own.  All these problems have to be tackled together in a consistent and coherent way.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1860" /> As I indicated in my opening statement, the Government's overall philosophy is fully set out in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> which was agreed with the social partners.  That programme laid out our agreed approach towards tackling the problems of the public finances and generally getting the right fiscal and monetary climate which would be conducive to economic growth, towards getting a low cost competitive environment to encourage more jobs, towards building up the various sectors of the economy, towards greater equity and fairness in the tax system and particularly to encourage wage moderation and secure a real increase in take-home pay for workers.  Last, but not least, the programme gave very specific undertakings in regard to helping the less well off sectors of the community and securing greater social security.</P>
    <P>This programme has produced a consensus in dealing with our economic problems to which Senator Hillery referred and which I believe has been so crucial to all the progress we have made as outlined by me in my opening address.  The programme has now been complemented by the <i>National Development Plan</i> which copperfastens the basic policy approach for the years ahead and sets out a major programme of investment designed to boost the economy to show that it can work effectively and produce more jobs. This approach is obviously working and while, as I acknowledged in my speech, there is still a long way to go we have made a breakthrough on jobs and employment is now increasing again for the first time for many years.</P>
    <P>The independent support for the official 1989 employment and unemployment forecasts has come from the Economic and Social Research Institute in its latest quarterly economic commentary. The institute is now forecasting an increase in employment and a fall in unemployment which are almost the same as in the official forecast.  Another encouraging feature of the ESRI's figures is the forecast of a doubling of the rate of employment growth in the year to <Col N="1861" /> April 1990 as compared with that in the year to last April.</P>
    <P>As regards emigration, I accept that the present rate of emigration is a most serious problem.  The only way to bring about a reduction in this rate is to continue to pursue the policies which have been so successful since we came into office in 1987.  According as the rate of employment growth increases and as unemployment continues to fall, we shall undoubtedly see a considerable fall in emigration.</P>
    <P>On the question of poverty the fact of the matter is that this year's budget introduced the biggest package of welfare measures in recent years.  As Senators Fallon and Hillery have already pointed out, most of this has already been legislated for in the Social Welfare Act which went through this House recently and that is why I did not dwell on the matter in my opening remarks.  Only one element of the package, the novel addition of £200 to the exemption limits in respect of each dependent child, is provided for in the Finance Bill and I did refer to this in my opening speech.  This innovation will be of major importance to low income families, whether they are on PAYE, in small businesses or trades, or even in agriculture, if their income is as low as Senator Connor says it is.  A married man with five children earning £7,000 a year, irrespective of his business, is now totally out of the tax net.</P>
    <P>Besides the taxation relief designed to help those on low incomes I introduced in the budget a whole range of proposals carefully selected to target priority areas of deprivation and poverty.  These will in general be implemented from next July. Before outlining some of the main improvements about to be implemented, it is essential to make the point that the value of social welfare payments has actually increased significantly in recent years both in purchasing power and relative to take-home pay.  This is something which is often lost sight of by commentators. Long-term unemployment assistance rates increased by some 24 per cent over the two years 1988 and 1989 with a 12 per cent or £5 a week increase in 1989 alone, <Col N="1862" /> that is from £42 to £47 a week.  Child dependant allowances were increased this year by up to £2 per week per child in respect of a third and subsequent child. These represent very valuable benefits for the most deprived sections of society. In addition, all welfare recipients had their payments fully protected against inflation by means of a general increase of 3 per cent.</P>
    <P>As I have said, those on the lowest rates of welfare receive substantially higher levels of additional support over and above the general increase.  The special needs of larger families were also catered for in the budget which provided for the payment from October next of the higher rate of monthly child benefit of £21.75 in respect of the fifth and subsequent children.  At present this higher rate is only available for the sixth child and upwards.</P>
    <P>Other improvements provided for in the 1989 budget include the introduction of a new social assistance scheme to provide for the needs of widowers and deserted husbands with dependent children. This scheme will be introduced from October along the lines of the current non-contributory schemes for widows and deserted wives.  Payment of child dependant allowances in respect of child dependants of long-term recipients up to 19 years of age instead of 18 years of age at present while in full-time education and provisions to allow pensioners to carry over unused free electricity units from one billing period to subsequent periods subject to an overall ceiling have been introduced.</P>
    <P>That is a fair package.  It is not as much as any of us would like to do but certainly within the existing financial constraints I think it has gone a fair distance.  To be accused of not mentioning poverty is way off the wall in my view.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I came in here with a Finance Bill.  I introduced social welfare provisions to be carried through by the</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1863" /> Minister for Social Welfare and I did not feel I should talk about social welfare or agriculture or industry but with the Finance Bill before me but now that the Senator has asked I have given her the response.</P>
    <P>Senator Bulbulia will forgive me if I say that I take with a grain of salt what she said about a consensus on tax reform across political parties.  In the case of one of the small reform items in this year's budget and Finance Bill, the restriction on mortgage interest relief which, to use her own phrase, is minuscule in relation to the package of reliefs we are providing, Fine Gael sought to amend that small provision and to water down that restriction. This Government have achieved much more in tax reform in the past two years than anybody thought likely or possible and our actions speak louder than words.  In only two years we have come from a situation where income tax relief was simply impossible to one where relief is not only possible but is happening on a scale far beyond what was envisaged in the national programme just 18 months age.  I do not think that Senator Bulbulia can really argue that £700 million in reliefs is, in her own words, minuscule.</P>
    <P>As regards the future, the Government are acutely conscious of the need to further reduce the income tax burden to facilitate increased employment and to help restore the reward for effort and enterprise.  We have begun this process and we will continue it.  We are firmly committed to further income tax relief as the <i>National Development Plan</i> clearly states.  We will proceed not by means of fancy tax reform plans but by real achievement.  The objective is straightforward. It is simply to reduce the tax that people have to pay.  We have pointed the direction in which we are going by the reduction in actual rates of tax this year and we will press ahead as quickly as possible.  I agree with Senator Bulbulia in this respect.  A reduction in the burden of personal taxation is an essential part of the restructuring of the economy.  It <Col N="1864" /> must go hand-in-hand and also be consistent with the continued reduction in Exchequer borrowing.</P>
    <P>I will now deal briefly with some specific points raised by Senators.  Senator Fallon expressed concern about the easy availability of credit and the influence this may have on spiralling house prices. I understand his concern in this regard. However, as I said earlier, it is the Government's and the Central Bank's expectation that following recent meetings with the main credit agencies, the banks and the building societies, those agencies will exercise the required prudence in their lending operations.  The Seanad can be assured that the Government and the Central Bank will continue to monitor the situation closely.</P>
    <P>Somebody asked where is all the money coming from.  Basically what is happening is because of the competition between the lending agencies, between the building societies and the banks and the insurance companies who are out there fighting for market share, what used to be the rule of thumb of two and a half or three times your wages has now been dumped up by some of the companies to three and a half and four times and this certainly has contributed in part to the spiralling of house prices.  I would issue this advice, and it was expressed here by Senator Fallon.  The farmers of this country made a mistake in the 1970s and I hope the people buying houses will not make the same mistake again.  I hope they will not go beyond what their earning capacity will allow them because we will continue to have fluctuations in interest rates because we are such an open economy and because international exchange rates and interest rates can be volatile and we cannot be immune from them for all time, although we have done extremely well over the last 18 months in relation to them.</P>
    <P>Senator Fallon mentioned restriction on life assurance relief to 80 per cent of the amount which previously qualified. There are a number of points I would like to make about this restriction.  The first is, of course, that life assurance relief is, as the Senator will be well aware, very <Col N="1865" /> expensive in terms of tax foregone by the Exchequer.  It was estimated to cost some £48 million in the current tax year if no restriction had been imposed.  The second is that the 20 per cent restriction contained in the Bill is intended to make a small contribution to the substantial cost of this year's package of income tax reliefs.  It will save some £9.6 million &mdash; £5.8 million in 1989.  Even taking this into account, however, the income tax reliefs contained in the Bill will cost over £200 million in the present year.</P>
    <P>Senator Fallon also alluded to the fact that the recent increase in house prices had not been reflected &mdash; indeed, some other Senators referred to it as well &mdash; in increased receipts in residential property tax.  The following facts are relevant in this regard.  Residential property tax is payable on 1 October each year by reference to the value of the property on 5 April of the same year.  This means that the tax payable in 1988 was based on house values in April 1988 &mdash; in other words, before the recent surge in property prices.  Tax due in October this year will be based on values in April this year and so should reflect the recent increases in property prices.  Many more houses should now undoubtedly come within the tax net.</P>
    <P>The final point is in relation to insurance.  The incentive to invest in life assurance may have diminished slightly in more recent times.  It should be noted that the overall impact of this year's income tax relief is overwhelmingly in favour of the taxpayer &mdash; in other words, despite the restriction, taxpayers will be in a stronger position to invest in life assurance if they so wish because of the very favourable income tax package provided for in the Bill.</P>
    <P>In regard to the future, I have taken note of course of what Senator Fallon had to say about this relief and I will bear it in mind.  But I would also make the point that life assurance for many years in this country was seen as a traditional method of saving.  The whole industry has changed.  It has now gone into unit funds, unit links, and so on, and it is changing business from what it used to be as a <Col N="1866" /> traditional saver.  However, I will bear the remarks of Senator Fallon in mind for the future.</P>
    <P>On the reliefs in the film industry, I would like to thank Senator Norris and the other Senators for their general welcome for various sections in the Bill.  He referred to the downgrading of the Film Board.  The main reason for the gradual running down of the Film Board since 1987 was that it had totally failed to meet the objective of development of the Irish film industry on a commercial basis. When the board was set up in 1981, it was agreed by the Oireachtas that this commercial orientation was fundamental. Between 1981 and 1986 the board issued almost £2 million in loans for film development but, by the end of 1986, only £54,000 of this loan finance had been repaid.  The board had also given grants during that period.  In the last two years financial and other assistance had been given to film makers by the National Development Corporation, the IDA and CTT.  This assistance is on a much more commercial and employment directed basis than was the case with the Film Board.  The Arts Council perform a similar function in regard to those films which fall into the artistic rather than the commercial category.  The council are a very suitable body for carrying out this role, especially in regard to the film script and pre-production stages.</P>
    <P>The new incentive I have introduced this year, along with the availability of BES funding for film making, should be of great assistance to film makers and is a response to the concerns and the shortcomings that were in the scheme up to now.  This type of incentive based scheme has certainly brought results in Canada and Australia and hopefully, by this time next year, we should see some response to what I believe is a fairly generous relief.</P>
    <P>In regard to section 23 relief, questions were raised by Senator Harte, Senator Ryan, Senator Lydon and others, so quite clearly this is a matter to be looked at very seriously.</P>
    <P>Senator Harte suggested the introduction of certain requirements in order <Col N="1867" /> that rented residential accommodation might qualify for section 23 relief.  The aim would appear to be to deny section 23 relief for the cost of new building if the other rented properties did not meet these requirements.  These proposals appear to be related to the protection of tenants' rights and are thus more appropriate perhaps to the Department of Justice rather than to tax law.  However, general law relating to landlord and tenant matters is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Justice, but for the standards area I will certainly undertake to the Seanad to talk to my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, who has under consideration certain aspects of the private rented housing sector, including physical standards and the question of the mandatory issue of rent books to all tenants.  Local authorities have wide powers under housing legislation to take action where there is also substandard accommodation.</P>
    <P>If I understood what the different Senators were saying to me, it was that section 23 relief is being used to take advantage of second hand accommodation, for want of a better description at this stage, which is in substandard condition and the income from which is being used to wash through a new section 23 relief in respect of a new house and that it is not the best way to use taxpayers' money.  I take full note of what Senators said, if that is the correct interpretation, and I will certainly have a look at it between now and this time next year.</P>
    <P>Senator Harte raised the problem of the refusal of an excise refund to a disabled driver.  This illustrates the difficulty with the existing scheme which motivated me to do away with the existing mandatory criteria and to introduce the new arrangements.  The existing criterion stipulates that an individual must be wholly or almost wholly without the use of each of his legs and the Revenue Commissioners are obliged to determine whether or not someone is eligible for an excise refund in the light of this restrictive criterion.  The subsection of the Finance Act, 1968, containing this wording will <Col N="1868" /> cease to have effect when the regulations provided for in section 92 are made by me.  It is, however, my intention that the new medical criterion that an individual must be severely and permanently disabled will be of much wider application than the present very restrictive criterion. The required regulations will be made by me in a matter of weeks.</P>
    <P>Senators will appreciate that I cannot comment on an individual case.  If, however, I receive full particulars in relation to Senator Harte's question, I will look into the matter and communicate directly with the Senator.</P>
    <P>Contrary to the suggestion made that the Government were forced into changing this scheme, we did in fact make an effort to change it last year but agreement could not be reached.  I made it quite clear in the Dáil, and in public some months ago, that I was anxious to find a resolution that was broadly acceptable to the very real concerns of this section of the severely handicapped and disadvantaged in our society, that I was not interested in having a very tight bureaucratic scheme, that I was more inclined to be liberal on the side of the people who were looking for his relief.  Consequently, in consultation with the Opposition speakers, we sat down and worked out what we believe is a full answer to these particular problems that were arising under the existing criteria.</P>
    <P>I look forward to this scheme being broadly acceptable, while at the same time making sure that the abuses that were there in that scheme are fully stamped out.  I am doing that by making sure that the engine involved in major changes to suit an invalid person is not more than 2,000 cc.  I am sure Senators will be aware, as I am, of a recent case in the High Court looking for £53,000, that Mercedes 280s were brought, that Porsches were bought and that the poor taxpayer was paying.  I am interested in a liberal scheme, but I am certainly not interested in seeing any abuse of it and I will ensure that that sort of abuse will not continue.</P>

      <P>Senator Bulbulia referred to Deputy Bruton bringing the abuses of the BES scheme to the notice of the Government.  I want to say that she is slightly off the track as well.  I myself made the first clear attack on the abuses of the BES scheme at the Institute of Taxation dinner.  Two weeks later we read about it in the papers by commentators and about a week later by Deputy John Bruton and others as well. We are very attentive.  We are not asleep in the Department of Finance, as people might suggest we are.  In fact, that is borne out by the fact that a very recent tax avoidance scam was advertised in the papers and you will find it is plugged here right in the Finance Bill as well.  There may be others I do not know about, but I certainly took all the action necessary in relation to all the tax avoidance schemes I could see that had no relation whatsoever to bona fide transactions.</P>
      <P>Senator Harte called for the removal of VAT on hurleys.  This request has been made to successive Ministers for Finance over the years but it has always been rejected on the grounds that to remove the tax would breach EC VAT law by which we are bound.  I am sorry to have to disappoint the Senator again, but this still remains the case.</P>
      <P>I thank all the Senators who contributed to the debate.  I look forward to discussing the provisions in more detail on Committee Stage.

    <Title>Adjournment Matter: Cork City River Crossing.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>A feasibility study was recommended by the Government in 1985 to investigate what type of crossing should be provided on the downstream river in Cork.  That was done at a cost of £340,000 to £350,000 and I understand a recommendation was made that a crossing should go there.  A bridge order was then given to the Department by Cork Corporation.  The amount of money that has been spent over the years &mdash; I know the Minister is well aware of this &mdash; particularly by the Department of the Environment regarding infrastructure, is enormous.  A south side ring road has been constructed at a cost of £25 million and a similar sum is to be expended on the north circular road.  That does not take into account the cost of constructing Glanmire bypass, which is to be ready for use in 1993.  Despite all this enormous cost on road infrastructure and after the expenditure of a third of £1 million on road studies, there is still no word from the Department about whether a crossing will be allowed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How long does it take to build a crossing? I emphasise the word &ldquo;crossing&rdquo; rather than a tunnel, even though Cork Corporation, Cork County Council, the harbour commissioners and everybody involved in the environment in the Cork region recommend a tunnel.  Even though a recommendation has been made that there should be a tunnel, arguments are still going on about what type of crossing. It is sad to think that we have put so much money into infrastructure and have not yet given the order for a crossing.  I understand that the design work on a tunnel would take from two to three years and that it would take another three years to <Col N="1871" /> build it.  You are talking about 1995 if you give the order now.  Both the north circular road and the south ring road end up nowhere.  Since the main road from Waterford leads into the centre of the city, you will only create traffic congestion if the crossing is not built.  I do not see the logic of that when the feasibility study has already recommended that a crossing must go there.</P>
    <P>I well recognise that the Government must have priorities.  At a meeting of municipal authorities in Westport two years ago, myself and a councillor colleague of the same party as the Minister had discussions with him about this crossing. Indeed, the Minister gave us a very fair hearing and I want to thank him for that.  However, that was over two years ago and nothing has happened about the provision of this crossing.</P>
    <P>What does this crossing mean for Cork?  Over £100 million has been spent on infrastructural work in the lower harbour area.  The deepwater berth takes ships of 75,000 tonnes, but we cannot get traffic down there.  There is no logic in that.  In addition, in the Ringaskiddy area we have over 1,000 acres available for development, yet we have the situation that when you leave the Ringaskiddy area you go nowhere.  It is not logical to have an ongoing argument about what type of crossing should go there where there appears to be no difference in cost between providing a tunnel and a high rise crossing.  From an environmental point of view I do not think a high rise crossing would look the thing.  If you had a low level bridge you would have delays of 15 minutes on average 12 times a day because of shipping traffic.  You could imagine the build up of traffic there.</P>
    <P>What would a tunnel mean?  It would mean the employment of 300 people over the three year period.  It would require 9,000 tonnes of steel from Irish Steel and 75,000 cubic metres of concrete.  Think of what this would mean for the Cork area.  I do not want to create an air of despondency, but there is a strong feeling in the Cork-Kerry region that the area has been downgraded.  That is not fair <Col N="1872" /> because successive Governments have provided excellent infrastructure.  Two bridge crossings were opened in 1985 and they have done excellent work for the city.  However, when you look at the situation, particularly on the southern side of the inner harbour area, the Minister will agree it is wrong that we should have an ongoing argument about what type of crossing should be provided.  The cost of a tunnel would be £39 million.</P>
    <P>The inquiry set up in 1985 believed that the delays that would be caused by a bridge crossing would be unacceptable. For the sake of the people who have invested in their businesses in Cork it is time this ongoing argument was brought to an end.  Every week we hear public representatives, particularly on the Government side, suggesting that the Minister will make the order in two weeks' time.  In 1986, the present Taoiseach, when in Opposition, said in the Neptune Stadium in Cork that the order should be granted then.</P>
    <P>Why not give the go-ahead and say we are considering this &mdash; we are talking about a crossing but we are not decided one way or the other.  Could we get clarification? If the crossing is not provided by 1995 there will be more congestion in the city area.  After all the good work that has been done we will be back to square one again.  We can put a high rise bridge over the traditional old village of Douglas, but when the people of Douglas look up at that in two or three years' time they will ask &ldquo;Where is it going?&rdquo; In fact, it is going nowhere except to the river.  I do not see the logic in that.  It is embarrassing to public representatives from all sides that we are building infrastructure but yet we cannot get from one side of the river to the other because no decision has been made by consultants.  I understand there is an ongoing argument between one consultant group and the group involved in the feasibility study.</P>
    <P>It is unfair to the Cork-Kerry region, Cork County Council, Cork City Council, the Harbour Commissioners and everybody involved.  It is unfair that, after all the recommendations that were made, and particularly by the Harbour</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1873" /> Commissioners, we should say there is no way we would consider a downstream crossing of a bridge, giving the impression that we should downgrade the upper harbour. There is over 10,000 feet of wharfing in the upper harbour; there is only 700 feet in Ringaskiddy.  Let us not kill Cork because a bridge should go there.  There is no way we can say that all shipping should go on in the lower harbour.  We would have to build more wharfing and more berthing there.  That involves more money, and that is not on.</P>
    <P>The difference between a high rise crossing and a tunnel would be, in my view, £2 million to £4 million.  We should not be saying that is not a priority.  It must be a priority for that region.  Look at all the money that has been put into Ringaskiddy by all Governments, including the present one, money spent on the environment, water structure, road structure and so on.  Yet the roads lead to nowhere.  I would appreciate if something constructive could be done and some logical argument made about what way we are going.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as the issue we are discussing on the Adjournment is concerned, the downstream crossing of the River Lee, I would like to make it clear that there has been no undue delay in <Col N="1874" /> dealing with the proposal of the crossing. Technically it is the most complex road proposal perhaps ever considered in the country and it might also work out at being the most expensive.  It has major implications for road traffic and harbour traffic requirements in the Cork area and as such must require the most careful consideration from the Minister's point of view and form technical aspects that are attached to this project.</P>
      <P>A local public inquiry into the application by Cork Corporation for a bridge order relating to the provision of the two-lane tunnel was held in October 1985 and the inspector's report was submitted to the then Minister in January 1987.  There is need for the crossing.  However, I decided that the question of the timing of the crossing should be considered in the broader context of the preparation by the Department of proposals for the medium to long term development of national roads.  In this context the operational programme for roads, which has been submitted to the EC Commission since 30 March this year, includes the proposal for the commencement of the downstream crossing during the programme period 1989-1993.  I see it as a priority.  It has been included in the operational programme as such and I think an early decision in the matter would be important.</P>
      <P>Because I have quasi-judicial functions in this matter it would not be appropriate for me to comment on other aspects of the downstream proposal at this stage.  I am sure the Senator will appreciate that. I have a very particular function in the decision on this project.  Senators can rest assured that there will be no avoidable delay in determining the bridge order application.  It is receiving my attention at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might however refer to the clear evidence that there has been considerable easing of traffic congestion in the greater Cork area in recent years, mainly as a result of the carrying out of major road improvements, including the de Valera, Collins and Christy Ring bridges.  The south city link road, the northern road and all those expensive but necessary <Col N="1875" /> capital works in the Cork area have improved the traffic situation quite dramatically. However, it does not relieve the situation that still exists in regard to the servicing of the Ringaskiddy area and the relief of certain congestion that exists there.  I am recognising that and saying that that was fully taken into account by me when I insisted on this project being included in our jobs programme as submitted in the operational programme for roads to Europe in March of this year.</P>
    <P>Senators familiar with Cork know that my Department are continuing to pump money into the proposed southern ring road and the Glanmire by-pass and that work started earlier this year on phase two of the Cork-Mallow road.  In some respects the progress made in coping with road traffic in the greater Cork area sets a headline for certain other parts of the country.  They are very envious of you, Senator.</P>

That is what is important. Other parts of the country are envious of the amount of money by way of capital allocation that Cork has been given at this time; and it is my intention to continue my support for that region because they are some deficiencies in the region.</P>
