      <P>I have notice from Senator Olga Bennett that on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>In view of the urgency of the recurring smog problem, the need for the Minister for the Environment to introduce further urgent measures to meet the problem and, in the meantime, the further need for better communicators to be made available for an early warning system to allow people to take precautionary measures to minimise the problem.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator David Norris of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health in the light of the recent resignation of the Chairman of the Health Research Board, due to unexpected arbitrary budgetary constraints imposed in the Estimates, to look urgently at the possibility of providing further and adequate funding so that this important body can carry out its work in the national interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Bennett and Norris as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and I have <Col N="1074" /> selected the matter raised by Senator Bennett.  It will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senator Norris may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

      <P>I am glad that the matter of smog will be brought up on the Adjournment.  I am not too sure whether I am a victim of it, or just a victim of the current flu.  I think the smog might be a contributory factor to it.</P>
      <P>It is intended that we will take item No. 2 from now until 12.30 p.m., and that the Minister will come in no later than 12.30 p.m. to reply to that debate. We will take item No. 1, at 2.30 p.m. to a conclusion, and we will start the Derelict Sites Bill immediately afterwards.</P>
      <P>Mar gheall ar an cheist a chuir an Seanadoír Ó Foighil inné i dtaobh an chórais aistriúcháin, bhí mé ag caint le &ldquo;daoine&rdquo;&mdash; ní amhaín &ldquo;aon duine&rdquo;&mdash; in a thaobh sin, agus beidh mé ag caint faoi gach lá go dtí go mbeidh sé san Seanad.  Ní hé an Seanadóir Ó Foighil an chéad duine ó Chonamara a nochtaigh an fhadhb sin. Bhí an t-iar Sheanadóir Níoclás Ó Conchubhair ina sheasamh gach lá i dtaobh na ceiste seo nuair a bhí sé in a Bhall den Seanad.  Tá sé imithe, agus níl an córas aistriúcháin anseo.

      <P>I would like to make a number of observations on the Order of Business.  Will the Leader of the House let us know if the report of the Committee of Selection will be available today &mdash; item No. 3 on the Order of Business?  I would also like to inform the House that item No. 2, which we are very glad to debate this morning, will be opposed by us.  I will be introducing three amendments to it.  They will be introduced by Senator Raftery but I will circulate them. For the information of the House &mdash; if I may at this stage &mdash; the Fine Gael amendments will be under three headings: (1) to fix the budgetary allocation <Col N="1075" /> for official development assistance in 1990 at 0.025 per cent of GNP, the level provided in 1986, thereby reversing the severe reductions imposed in each of the last three years; (2) to undertake that the level of official development assistance will thereafter be increased each year by the equivalent of at least 0.45 per cent of GNP until the total reaches the UN target of 0.7 per cent of GNP annually; (3) to urge the Government to provide that gifts given by firms and individuals to famine relief should enjoy the same charitable status as is enjoyed by gifts given to other charities here.  These three amendments will be proposed by the Fine Gael group to item No. 2.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House if he can give some indication as to when the Northern Ireland debate, as promised, will take place?  I would like also to propose an amendment to the Order of Business &mdash; that item No. 44 be taken first.  This is the item regarding the awarding of the Nobel Prize to the Dalai Lama.  Since this award will be made on Sunday, it seems to me it is very appropriate that it should happen, particularly since we have had the visit of His Holiness the Dalai Lama's personal representative, whom I and a number of other people met last Wednesday.</P>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That item No. 44 be taken before item No. 2.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to argue with the Leader of the House, but I would like to make the point that a two-hour debate on developments in the Third World and on hunger is an extraordinarily short period of time.  I ask the Leader of the House to confirm that the debate is just a two-hour debate.  It is very short, it is even shorter than Private Members' Time.  It would spoil what I know is the good intent of the Leader of the House, which is to enable Thursday to be used to discuss issues, if the debate is to be so constrained that only three or four speakers can speak on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1076" /> In order to extract a specific reply from the Leader of the House &mdash; and I admit to using a procedural device to do it and he can say what he likes about that &mdash; I propose that items Nos. 12, 13, 14 and 15 be taken first.  These are Private Members' Bills in the names of the Independent Members.  I want to make it clear that all I am proposing is that the House give permission for those Bills to be printed and also, as has been the practice, to allow an order for Second Stage to be made.  May I clarify the procedures of the House in case some people do not understand?  An order for Second Stage is not a guarantee that a matter can be discussed.  It is a date before which it cannot be discussed.</P>
    <P>I am not asking for Government time to discuss those Bills.  I am not asking for Government support for them.  I am simply asking that the normal procedures of this House, which I am used to operating under, would apply, which is that Private Members' Bills can be introduced and be discussed in Private Members' Time.  The Bills would take, at most, five minutes.  I want to get a specific response from the Leader of the House.  If he will accept my amendment, I will be extremely grateful and if he cannot accept it, then he should give an explanation. May I repeat to him something I said yesterday?  No matter how big the Government majority the only way this House can operate intelligently and successfully is by goodwill.  We should not sacrifice that goodwill.</P>
    <P>I move: &ldquo;That items Nos. 12, 13, 14 and 15 be taken before item No. 2.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I would like to support what Senator B. Ryan has said.  It seems to be a perfectly reasonable request.  It also underlines the fundamental democratic proposition that it is the Oireachtas which legislates and not the Government, as some people seem to think.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask why item No. 3 is on the Order Paper today? It was on the Order Paper yesterday and I understand there was a meeting of the <Col N="1077" /> Committee of Selection held.  I would also like to protest that a Minister was kept waiting here last night on a motion for the Adjournment.  The Senator who raised the matter did not turn up.  The Minister is entitled to an apology.  That Senator deprived some other Senator from raising a matter on the Adjournment and she should apologise for not being present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of what happened here last night at 8 p.m., the fault was on our side of the House.  We would like to convey to the Minister our regrets in that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the expression of regret has been forthcoming, but it should not happen that a Minister is brought in here for the Adjournment debate and then the Senator who proposed the motion does not turn up.  It is inexcusable that it should happen, because there were a number of Senators offering at the time.</P>
      <P>On the question asked by Senator Kiely on item No. 3, the reason it is on the Order Paper today is because we had a meeting of the Committee of Selection for 4 p.m. yesterday.  Every member of the Committee of Selection was notified of that meeting.  It appeared on the Order Paper and I notified the House that it would take place.  We could have gone ahead at the Committee of Selection and selected the committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had a major argument in this House about committees.  The people who purport to represent a certain group did not turn up at the Committee of Selection, but we did them the courtesy of leaving over until this morning the selection of committees, in order to offer them the opportunity to be present.  As it turns out, the Labour representation in this House is very close to the representation of Independents.  We could have given the Labour Party the opportunity to take the positions on a mathematical basis.  We could have given them <Col N="1078" /> the opportunity to take their places on the committee which the Independents are purporting to look for.</P>

    <Title>Famine Relief for Ethiopia: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann approves of the allocations made by the Government for emergency famine relief for Ethiopia and urges the Government to continue to assist the diplomatic efforts to ensure that supplies reach those in need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept the reservations made by the Leader of the Opposition to the wording of this motion, but the motion itself gives everybody an opportunity to address the <Col N="1080" /> problem.  We are not here to do anything else but to make certain that the beleaguered people in Ethiopia and in other places where there is famine should get the maximum relief in the shortest possible time, and that that relief goes to the people who urgently need it.</P>
    <P>There are major problems in regard to relief to countries such as Ethiopia, all Third World countries.  Unfortunately, cash from Governments is not always the proper method by which aid should be transmitted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary) Sean Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary)</NameTxt>
      <P>May I begin by saying that I appreciate the concern underlying the motion on the situation in Ethiopia and say that the Government share that concern.  As the House is aware, the Government have taken practical steps to assist in the major international efforts being undertaken to provide the necessary relief supplies and to ensure that they reach those in need. It will continue these efforts over the coming months.</P>
      <P>Before describing these in detail, I wish to outline some of the background to the food supply situation in Ethiopia.  It is a country with a structural food deficit.  It does not grow enough food to feed its population even in good years, and as it is one of the poorest countries in the world, with an estimated GNP <i>per capita</i> of $120 per annum, it has to rely on food aid supplies to meet the shortfall.  In addition, there are a number of internal and cross-border conflicts in the Horn of Africa where Ethiopia is situated, with the result that there are some 700,000 refugees from Sudan and Somalia who have sought refuge in Ethiopia.  These are being looked after by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) and other aid agencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation at present in Ethiopia is that the main 1989 harvest, which should now be available to feed the population and their livestock, has been poor in many areas in Northern Ethiopia and in some areas in the South.  It has failed almost completely in Eritrea and in eastern Tigre, which extends over the north <Col N="1081" /> and north-east of Ethiopia.  In both of these areas there are internal conflicts with rebel movements opposing Government forces.  These hamper delivery of relief supplies, particularly to Tigre which is entirely in rebel hands.  The main access roads into Tigre from the south and south-west are closed.</P>
    <P>Due to the conflict, it is difficult to be precise about requirements, but estimates of approximately four million people at risk and requiring some three-quarters of a million tonnes of food aid during 1990 appear likely to be realistic.  These are very large figures, but by late November about one-fifth of this had been pledged by the donor community and more has been offered since.  It will need a continued and concerted effort by everyone, but it is possible to provide the requisite supplies.  A Government of Ethiopia appeal in November 1987 for over one million tonnes of food aid was met with 50,000 tonnes delivered in 1987, over 900,000 tonnes in 1988 and 75,000 in 1989.  Ireland contributed £250,000 in November 1987 in the context of that appeal.</P>
    <P>The 1988 harvest was good and food aid requirements were low.  The 1989 harvest, as I have indicated, has been very poor in many areas and available supplies within Ethiopia are currently at dangerously low levels, although they are being built up as rapidly as possible as aid agencies obtain funds and send supplies. Progress cannot yet be reported on providing access by the most effective routes to the estimated two million people at risk in Tigre.  Some supplies are getting through via the Sudan and surplus grains in areas which had better harvests are being purchased for deficit areas.  Neither of these sources is capable of providing the quantities which will be needed from early 1990.</P>
    <P>So far, there are reports of only limited numbers of people migrating in search of food but I regret to say that these numbers appear to be increasing.  The disruption to normal livelihoods and to the fragile farming systems and commerce caused by migration, the dangers of disease in crowded conditions, the extra <Col N="1082" /> costs of relief operations where shelter, water supplies etc. have to be provided as well as food, all of these arise with the formation of large-scale camps.  I earnestly hope that these dangers can be avoided.</P>
    <P>I would like now to outline to the Seanad what has been done to date by the Government bilaterally and as part of the Community.  On 7 November last, I allocated the funds requested in response to an appeal from Trócaire on behalf of REST, the Relief Society of Tigre, for £50,000 for the purchase of food in parts of Tigre which had a good crop this year for distribution in deficit areas.  This type of relief operation is very useful in that it provides a market for surpluses where they occur and generally involves transportation over distances which can be measured at most in hundreds rather than thousands of miles. Unfortunately, such surpluses are limited. Within Tigre &mdash; which is about the size of Ireland &mdash; available supplies are estimated at about 50,000 tonnes and about one-sixth of requirements there.</P>
    <P>On Tuesday of this week, I allocated a further £250,000 for Ethiopian relief in the light of a series of applications made by agencies between 24 November and 4 December.  This amount includes £20,000 for the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) for a programme of assistance for 30,000 Sudanese children in Ethiopia.  The allocation also included £45,000 for the purchase of a truck, trailer and spares for Christian Aid on behalf of the Eritrean Relief Association which is running a major operation to bring supplies from Port Sudan to Eritrea.  A further £50,000 has been allocated to Oxfam in Ireland. As Senators are aware, Oxfam is involved in several parts of Ethiopia.  It is bringing in supplies by sea and also buying sorghum in western Sudan near to the Ethiopian border for distribution in Ethiopia.  I have allocated £60,000 to Concern towards a programme including the delivery of a supply ship to Ethiopia and the relief operation in Wallaita Province in Southern Ethiopia.  The Irish Red Cross has been allocated £35,000 in <Col N="1083" /> respect of the League of Red Cross in Red Crescent Societies' appeal for aid to help 300,000 people in Northern and Southern Ethiopia.  Finally, GOAL has been allocated £40,000 in respect of a consignment of high energy biscuits which it has purchased for delivery to Ethiopia.</P>
    <P>The amounts provided constitute a very substantial response from the Government, bringing total famine relief aid to Ethiopia to £300,000 for this year. This is in addition to £150,000 provided earlier in the year for medical supplies and logistics to help combat the meningitis epidemic which hit Ethiopia earlier this year.</P>
    <P>As a member of the European Community, Ireland has contributed its share of some £25 million worth of European Community emergency food aid for Ethiopia in 1989.  The Community has been among the first to respond to the needs arising from the failure of the 1989 harvest and Ireland will continue to support the allocation of further supplies as required.</P>
    <P>On the political side, as the scale of potential food shortages in Tigre and the consequent need for additional supply routes became apparent in November, the Community representatives, along with other donors in Addis Ababa, asked the Ethiopian Government to agree to the opening of supply routes along the main roads.  This has not as yet met with a favourable response.</P>
    <P>The situation has been discussed by Community Ministers on a number of occasions and a further effort to persuade the Ethiopian authorities to change their minds is currently being arranged.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs has conveyed a request to the Soviet Government seeking their assistance in relation to the appeal from aid agencies that the Ethiopian Government permit emergency and other supplies to get through to the areas threatened by famine.  Other European Governments have done likewise.</P>
    <P>At the OECD Development Assistance Committee high level meeting in <Col N="1084" /> Paris earlier this week Ireland, with other delegations, pressed the group to do everything they could to get supplies into Ethiopia.  It has to be said that the Ethiopian Government is not convinced that the situation in Tigre is as serious as international reports suggest.  It has stressed the military considerations involved for them in dealing with rebel forces, understood to be within 100 miles of Addis Ababa.</P>
    <P>The Government hope the Ethiopian authorities will change their minds and they will do all they can to help. However, it should be understood that in addition to public <i>démarches</i>, much patient, low-profile work by representatives on the ground is going on, and will be important in achieving results.</P>
    <P>I wish to conclude by making a brief comparison with the situation in 1984. The harvest failure in that year affected about seven million people in Ethiopia. It was the third successive year of crop failure and the population was already destitute.  The Ethiopian Government, donor agencies and NGOs had very limited structures for identifying needs and delivering aid as compared with the situation now.  The Government's Relief and Rehabilitation Commission has good information and delivery systems supplemented by those of donor agencies in areas where it has access.  The Eritreans and Tigreans have parallel structures in their own areas.</P>
    <P>Development work, to improve the capacity of the country to provide food for itself has made some impact since 1984.  However, it must be remembered that Ethiopia is a desperately poor and underdeveloped country, torn by internal conflict and that it will take many years for it to recover from the effects of land degradation and erosion and to develop a modern economy.</P>
    <P>In making these comparisons, I wish to make clear that I do not wish to minimise the present situation &mdash; it is very serious and potentially catastrophic &mdash; but I believe that if it is taken very seriously by everyone at this stage results <Col N="1085" /> can be achieved much more quickly than in 1984-85.</P>

      <P>As already indicated by Senator Manning, I will be introducing an amendment to this motion.  As a professor of agriculture and a former member of the council of Gorta I have a very deep interest in this whole problem of famine and the causes of famine.  Furthermore, my knowledge of the problem is continually updated by information I get from past students who come back on visits to Ireland.  Indeed, no later than August of this year I had a long meeting with the head of the African Animal Research Organisation, which is located in Addis Ababa, and Dr. Walsh is a past student and doing very excellent work there.  The green revolution of the late sixties and early seventies held out great hope that the problem of hunger would be solved and certainly it worked very well in India, Pakistan and, to a lesser extent, Bangladesh.  These countries, particularly India and Pakistan, who had been threatened with famine year in and year out are now in balance, and in some cases in surplus, as far as wheat and rice is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Africa is now the real black spot.  For approximately 900 million people the progress made in the seventies in the area of food security, literacy and health care has been reversed.  Average incomes throughout Africa and most of Latin America have fallen from 10 to 25 per cent in the 1980s.  Spending on food, health and education has been severely <Col N="1086" /> curtailed.  I quote from the 1989 UNICEF report:</P>
    <P>The state of the world's children, the slowing down of progress and the reversal of hard won gains is largely invisible to the industrialised world, yet it is spreading hardship and human misery on a scale and of a severity unprecedented in the post-war era.  For most of the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean almost every economic signal points to the fact that development has been derailed.  <i>Per capita</i> GNP has fallen.  Debt repayments have risen to a quarter or more of all export earnings.  Share of world market trade has dropped and the productivity of labour has declined by 1 or 2 percentage points each year throughout the 1980s.</P>
    <P>It is against this background of unprecedented need that the cutbacks in the Irish Overseas Development Agency must be viewed and judged.  The Irish people have spoken through their personal generosity and have expressed a wish that the Government would do likewise.</P>
    <P>I would regard peace as a number one essential for success.  It is the first essential for any progress towards success in these areas.  The Irish Government should increase their political lobbying at every level to promote the peaceful settlement of conflicts without which we can have only continued famine in these areas.</P>
    <P>The second essential for success I would regard as appropriate policies in relation to land use, food production and, of course, marketing of food also.  The adoption of the communist collectivised farm systems by so many African countries has proved a disaster for Africa, as indeed it has proved for eastern Europe. We need a reversal of these policies.  We need policies that are more realistic and that will stimulate local production and help to stimulate small farmers to produce the appropriate goods.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, the appropriate technology is <Col N="1087" /> vitally important.  Too often these backward countries opt for sophisticated production techniques more suited to well developed economies and giving them very unsatisfactory results.</P>
    <P>Number four, no attempt to overcome the problem can overlook the extraordinary population growth rate in the areas least able to support such population density. I refer specifically to countries like Bangladesh and, of course, other southeast Asian countries and all of Africa, where the population growth is of the order of about 3 per cent per year.  Any attempt to overcome the problem of these areas must tackle this problem of explosive population growth.  Failure to do so is to close one's eyes to one of the real causes of famine, poverty, misery and ignorance, thus allowing the problem to grow and spread unabated.</P>
    <P>A guaranteed and acceptable level of funding is a prerequisite for an effective, official development programme.  The UN target of 0.7 per cent of GNP per annum is a benchmark for levels of Government funding for ODA programmes. Ireland's official development aid programme was first established by a Fine Gael Government in 1974.  The ODA programme was developed in an effective and thoroughly professional manner.  Up to the severe cutbacks of 1986 we enjoyed a growing reputation worldwide in development areas.  Bilateral aid programmes were very successfully launched in Lesotho, Tanzania, Zambia and Sudan.  The pioneering work of young, well-trained Irish workers set a headline for other developed countries to follow.  NGOs also, such as Gorta, Trócaire and Concern, played and continue to play an important role in bringing about solutions to the famine threat.</P>
    <P>The severe cash cutbacks since 1986, however, have posed a real problem for the continuation of the good work.  I would urge the Seanad, therefore, to fix the budgetary allocation for official development assistance in 1990 at 0.25 per cent of GNP, the level provided in 1986, thereby reversing the severe reductions imposed in each of the last <Col N="1088" /> three years.  Secondly, I would urge them to undertake that the level of official development assistance will thereafter be increased each year by the equivalent of at least 0.45 per cent of GNP until the total reaches the UN target of 0.7 per cent of GNP annually.  Only by doing this can we get back to our former level of effectiveness in helping underdeveloped countries and in the process retrieve the good name and reputation we had so justly earned.</P>
    <P>Finally, in relation to the present pressing problem in Ethiopia, let me say that, of course, we have to do all in our power to get food there.  There is a simplistic idea abroad among people that all we have to do to help the peoples of the Third World is to throw our surplus food at them.  That is not the solution.  Our solution or our philosophy must be that of giving them a fishing rod rather than a fish.  Of course, when they are hungry we must give the fish; but we must also give them the fishing rod and teach them how to fish in order that they will be able to feed themselves in the years ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I spoke three or four years ago on the problem of overseas aid with what I certainly regarded as a caring and humane approach.  I spoke of the thousands of people, the thousands of children, who were daily dying of starvation in many parts of the Third World.  Parts of that particular speech appeared in my local paper, a paper that the Leas-Chathaoirleach knows and he will probably remember the incident.  Lo and behold, the following week a local Independent councillor got front page coverage for suggesting that the plight of the poor in Athlone and in Ireland was worse almost than in Ethiopia and other parts of the Third World.  That is a very sad mentality for any person in this country.  Thankfully, that applies to only a few people, but that attitude is there nonetheless.  While I accept that we have poor in Ireland, certainly there is no evidence at all, thank God, that children are dying of starvation, because of the fact that we have so many worth while organisations who are playing a very major <Col N="1089" /> role, Meals on Wheels, the St. Vincent de Paul, health boards and so on who are there to help.  It will not happen and in my opinion it could not happen in this country.  The St. Vincent de Paul Society in their recent report indicated that we have poor in this country as indeed we all know.  The report outlines a situation, most of which we knew already.  In particular, it confirmed the opinion that long-term unemployment was a major factor in creating poverty.</P>
      <P>Employment and economic growth are important elements in this debate and indeed in the debate as far as poverty in Ireland is concerned.  Economic growth is vital to prosperity and prosperity is vital if we are to have an improved situation for the people of Ireland and for the people of the world.  Therefore, we must look more closely at the exact relationship between economic growth and increased employment.  This is the aim of the Government and has been the aim of successive Governments over the years.</P>
      <P>Whether it is combating poverty or reducing emigration, the provision of well-paid employment is the key.  The resumption of strong economic growth in 1989 and in succeeding years should lead to a substantial increase in employment. We must all ensure that happens.  There is a relationship between economic growth and jobs &mdash; not a simple one.  Experience has shown us it is certain that sustainable jobs cannot be created without growth. The reverse is not as clear, that is, that economic growth will automatically increase employment.  As other countries have found, it is possible to have the right type of policies and sensible attitudes to improve employment.  We have to pay as much attention to this as strengthening growth itself as has been proved elsewhere, in England in particular.  The last link in the whole chain of economic growth is the creation of jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Economic growth for this nation decides what we can give in overseas aid. Of course, all of us would like to give much more and this Government would like to give much more than we are giving.  Nonetheless, I believe the <Col N="1090" /> Government are responding magnificently to the problems of the Third World.  We are all concerned about the situation.  We could not fail but be interested in the problems of Ethopia, Bangladesh, Sudan and so on.  We see the harrowing plight of the pot-bellied children on our screens every night of the week, children soon to die from malnutrition. While the various voluntary organisations, Gorta, GOAL, Trócaire and Concern, are continuously doing great work over a long number of years, the people also respond magnificently. It is a natural situation that the people respond much more strongly and willingly when real emergencies arise, such as famine, floods, and so on.</P>
    <P>Ethopia has always been a country with the problem of lack of food.  We know now that due to conflict it has not been possible to deliver food in sufficient quantities following the drought and harvest difficulties.  It has proved much more difficult and more severe than was previously anticipated.  Apart from actual financial aid, we should at the highest political level try to be involved in ensuring that the necessary relief supplies will be allowed through unhindered to the most affected famine areas.</P>
    <P>Many people have the idea that if food is shipped to Ethopia or Bangladesh or wherever the hungry children are feasting on it within 24 or 48 hours.  That, of course, is not the case.  Unfortunately, it takes months; and by the time it is properly shipped, got through customs and so on, the situation has worsened.  When millions of pounds were provided, as was the case in the Bob Geldof Band Aid effort, of which we were all very proud, the idea then was that the money should be sent immediately.  The problem is that there must be long rather than short-term spending.  The reality is that the poorer the people the less ability they have to absorb the help.  They are just too busy trying to survive from day to day to think about what might happen tomorrow or next week.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, much of the aid being sent to Ethiopia is not getting to its destination. It has been hijacked by a cruel <Col N="1091" /> and evil war.  Despite what is being said, the Government here have responded very well in the circumstances.  The Minister has indicated that the amount provided for total famine relief to Ethiopia is £300,000 for this year and this is in addition to £150,000 provided earlier in the year for Medical supplies to help deal with the meningitis epidemic which was there earlier in the year.</P>
    <P>There are very real problems in the Third World and in Ethiopia in particular. There are reports of officials using the aid for their own use while innocent children suffer and die.  It is a real problem. All Governments and all peoples have a moral duty to solve the famine problem in Ethiopia, whether it is by material means or by high powered international political influence, but I think the Irish people are magnificent in responding to these problems.  While we have poor here at home, it is nothing like the horrific problems in Ethiopia.  As long as these pictures of innocent children appear daily on our screens the heart of Ireland will go out to them and people will respond magnificently as in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset may I thank the Leader of the House for his very sensible suggestion that we limit the amount of time we give to this very important topic.  There are enormous problems in Ethiopia and in the Third World.  The solutions to these problems are long term and short term.  What is needed is a joint approach.  When people are starving provision has to be made to provide food.  Unfortunately, that does not provide a solution further down the road.  People have got in the longer term to be informed to the extent that they are able to look after themselves.  It is very important that when we provide aid for people in these situations we bear that in mind, which I am confident the Irish aid workers do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also confident that they bear in mind the necessity to use appropriate technologies or ideas, given the culture and attitude of many of these people.  It is quite improper that some of the western <Col N="1092" /> technologies should be utilised or that we should seek to introduce them into Africa.  They are just unsuitable.  My understanding of Irish aid work is that it keeps that reality in mind and is in contrast with the attitude of some of the bigger countries in relation to how they approach problems of aid in third World countries.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to say that our contribution as a country has declined very seriously in recent years.  The Minister uses 1984 as his base line but I am inclined to use 1986 and 1987 as my base line.  In 1986 this country was giving £40 million in Third World aid.  That has declined to the order of £33 million in 1989.  I understand there is some marginal increase in the actual amount of money, but the decline has not been arrested in terms of its proportion of the gross national product.  In 1986 we were spending 0.25 per cent of our GNP on overseas aid but that has declined to 0.16 per cent this year.  That is a very serious reduction, and it is something we should be ashamed of as a country.</P>
    <P>More specifically, when you divide up the aid into the two broad categories under which it is given, you have multilateral aid and bilateral aid.  We are in effect locked into multilateral aid because of international commitments and international agreements and our scope to change that is very limited. We do have scope to change the bilateral aid.  However, I am very sorry to say that what we have done is to reduce it quite significantly.  There has been a staggering 30 per cent reduction in 1987 &mdash; 30 per cent of the amount of money which, as it were, was at our discretion.  I find it appalling that there was a further 10 per cent reduction in 1988.  I accept that the cuts stopped at that stage and there has been a small increase in money terms this year.</P>
    <P>There have been a series of knock-on effects from that.  As I understand it, we have had to close our office in Sudan, one of the most appallingly poor countries in the world, a country which suffers from mind-bending levels of poverty and degradation when we look at it from the <Col N="1093" /> context of Ireland.  I understand the Department of Finance were the main instigators of this idea.  It seems to me to be a pity that they have not been resisted in their proposals.  They have got this 30 per cent down a further 10 per cent.  The idea from the Department of Finance, as I understand it, was to phase out bilateral aid fully.  That would be awful and a terrible commentary on this country. What about our moral position?  How can we, as it were, look the world in the eye, if that is the attitude we take?  How can we take ourselves off to the European Community and start making special pleading because of our own underprivileged situation?  We are certainly going to have taken away whatever credibility we have in relation to our attitude we have in relation to our attitude to the EC when that has been the background.</P>
    <P>There is a lack of morality in our attitude to Third World aid.  It is also extremely foolish if we are to look to any degree at the problems somewhat down the road.  A lot of the money which is spent in these Third World countries simply comes back to Ireland.  It comes back to us because of the fact that it is Irish people who are employed using that money to work in Third World countries. It comes back to Ireland because it is Irish products that are being purchased and used in those Third World countries. It comes back to Ireland because students from Third World countries come here to be educated.  It comes back double, treble and four times because of the goodwill that is generated through the experiences of those Third World country students who come here and go back home with a very worthwhile and positive attitude to this country.  It will come back further in as much as we are setting ourselves up in this country now as being a centre of excellence in education, a centre where people from Third World countries can come and be educated to a standard that is appropriate to their requirements.</P>
    <P>When we cut back on things like bilateral aid we are cutting down on the contacts which have served us very well. Our position in the United Nations has <Col N="1094" /> been greatly aided because of the missionary work which has been done by Irish missionaries over the years.  Certainly, our credibility with Third World countries on the world stage has been greatly enhanced because of that.  Some of our leading Irish industrialists, for example, are prepared to talk on television when they meet people like Robert Mugabe because of the fact that he, too, like them, had a Jesuit education &mdash; provided, of course, by the Irish.</P>
    <P>We were all justly proud, as Senator Fallon said, of the £7 million which was raised by Bob Geldof's Live Aid Concert. We were happy to congratulate ourselves on that and then, in a rather schizophrenic manner, we were prepared to slash the aid shortly afterwards.  In case I appear to be negative, I have to say that I welcome the extra aid which has been given.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, there are enormous problems in Third World countries.  It is very important that we here should try to generate some ideas as to how these problems will be solved in the long term. I do not think we are being very active in that area.  We have considerable scope to contribute to proposing ideas as to what the solutions might be in those areas. There are enormous problems in relation to the debts in those countries and that is something on which we should work.</P>
    <P>Anybody who doubts the enormity of the poverty should look at the figures.  In this country the <i>per capita</i> income is of the order of $6,000.  The corresponding figure in Ethiopia is $120 <i>per capita.</i>  I had a figure of somewhere around $200.  If you look at the figure for the total calorie intake of these countries, they are at malnutrition levels; the levels of protein in their diet are appallingly poor.  The amounts of animal protein which is available to them are disatrously low by comparison with our own country.</P>
    <P>May I conclude by saying that we will be supporting the Fine Gael amendment. It is very important that, as a country, we seek to raise our contribution.  We should do it on the basis of moral considerations. If those are not relevant to us, then we <Col N="1095" /> undoubtedly should do it on the basis of considerations that relate to self-interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Like my colleagues, I welcome an opportunity to contribute to this important debate.  I am heartened by the Minister's address.  It makes positive reading but also it makes crisis reading &mdash; four million people threatened by starvation in Tigre after the crop failures, more than the population of the Republic of Ireland and nearly as many as in this island as a whole.  The death toll could be higher than the 1984-85 famine, when one million people died.  Such is the enormity of the crisis facing the people of Ethiopia.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Government's response to the immediate problem facing the starving people in Ethiopia.  In the present economic climate, our contribution, while not yet achieving the United Nations ceiling of .07 per cent of GNP, is a positive indication of our concern.  I must take issue with those who believe that contributing more and more money will somehow solve the problem.  I direct my remarks particularly at many young people here who are rightly idealistic and impatient that something should be done and done quickly.  However, I believe many young people, as said in comments in the more radical media, believe the blame for the Ethiopian problem lies at the door of an uncaring and indifferent Government.  I was disappointed that, following the pickets placed on this House recently, there was not a similar picket placed on the Soviet Embassy.  The Soviets are central to the beginning of the end of the problem in Ethiopia.  At the very least, they can make a positive contribution to easing the problems of transportation in that country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the central role of the Soviets in this area and it is to Ireland's political contribution that I wish to address my remarks in this debate. First, I should put on record the current political situation in Ethiopia.  The Minister referred to the £50,000 allocated by the Irish Government to REST, the Relief Society of Tigre.  I welcome this <Col N="1096" /> contribution to the one organisation capable of directly helping the Ethiopian people, specifically those in the Tigre province.  This society works directly with self-elected village committees to determine who are most in need in each affected community.  There is no waste, no corruption and gifts from the international community are accounted for and monitored by independent experts.</P>
    <P>All this sounds ideal.  The problem is, however, that REST is made up entirely of Tigren volunteers and operates exclusively in the rebel-controlled areas.  Supplies for distribution by REST are taken by lorry not through Ethiopia but across the border from Sudan.  I believe the problem will remain as long as the developed countries in the West and other aid organisations such as World Food Programme, who are the main provider of food aid in famines, insist that relief assistance must only be given through official government channels. The notion of sending food illegally across an international border, in this instance Sudan, sits uncomfortably with some western Governments.  Therefore, the enlightened initiative of the Irish Government recently in contributing money to REST reflects well on this Administration and on Trócaire who alerted the Government to REST's role in Tigre.</P>
    <P>According to last weekend's <i>Sunday Correspondent</i> lack of formal knowledge of REST's activities has relegated it to virtual obscurity.  Also, this problem is compounded by the prejudice in some western countries which surprises me, that unless white people are on the scene to distribute food nothing really gets done.  I find this, in an otherwise enlightened age, an astonishing revelation by the journalist of the <i>Sunday Correspondent.</i>  I ask the Minister specifically to convey to the Government the increasing importance of REST as a food distribution agency and to impress upon our European partners the need to break through the bureaucracy and red tape or, as the <i>Sunday Correspondent</i> again puts it, to allow the constraints of diplomacy to take a back seat, surely an understatement, <Col N="1097" /> but carrying a powerful message.  I believe this could be the most positive contribution that Ireland can make in the present crisis.</P>
    <P>We assume the Presidency of the European Community in January for six months and Ireland will be centre stage with enormous influence among the member states.  I have, increasingly, come to the conclusion that the solution to the problem in Ethiopia is a political one.  This point of view was borne out by the comments of that fine Christian gentleman, John O'Shea of GOAL who last week urged the Government, amidst all of the brickbats being thrown at them, about their alleged lack of concern, to use their influence even more than their money.  Penny Jenden, who is administrator of Bob Geldof's Band Aid Fund concurs with that view and she says that this time around in this famine crisis the real effort has to be political.  She says that Band Aid is throwing itself wholeheartedly behind any pressure that can be exerted politically for some sort of safe passage agreement.</P>
    <P>It is appalling to learn that under present conditions food can take up to three months to reach Ethiopia.  This is an improvement on the last famine when some EC aid took up to nine months. Richard Miller of the Catholic Fund for Overseas Development last week gave an example of the difficulties.  He said that food pledged last September in the United Kingdom had to be brought, first, not to Ethiopia or to Sudan but to Belgium and only arrived this week in Tigre province to help the poor people there, some three months later.</P>
    <P>John Seaman of the Save the Children Fund said that the real delays are procedural, not mechanical.  When an EC grain order goes out to tender there is the problem of equity within Europe. Each country has to be seen to be getting its turn so that it takes time, often up to a month, for those tenders to be sorted out and agreed on and then they spend more time finding a ship.  In contrast, when the Save the Children Fund are buying grain they deal directly and they <Col N="1098" /> can get the food to Sudan in about three weeks.</P>
    <P>Bilateral aid directly to Ethiopia can also work quickly.  A sum of £2 million pledged last week by the British Overseas Development Minister is expected to buy new lorries but because Britain &mdash; and I assume the same applies to all EC countries &mdash; does not want to be seen to be undermining the sovereignity of the Ethiopian Government it is vague about the money's final destination.  Certain funds are channelled through charities partly so they are not seen to be directly funding rebel relief and partly because such agencies already have aid programmes so the money is processed quickly.</P>
    <P>At least 50,000 tonnes of wheat and maize for Ethiopia will be bought by the European Community within Europe which means shipping and import procedures may take up to three months.  This is despite attempts as far back as 1986 to reform European Community food aid and encourage purchase through food aid agencies.  If the Community bought grain in neighbouring Sudan, for example, rather than buying it within Europe the understanding is that the procedure of getting the food to Tigre and to the people most affected would be much faster.</P>
    <P>As one delves further and further into the famine problems in Ethiopia and in the African Continent generally it becomes abundantly clear that no amount of money in the short term will solve the problem.  Money, of course, is central but it is not the only essential. It is in that context that, once again, I reiterate that my main purpose in standing up in this House today is to convey as strongly as possible to the Minister to impress upon the Government in their deliberations with their EC partners, especially in the next six months of our Presidency, that we must get our act together as a Community, that we must get over the bureaucratic and red tape problems.  Our role, as a small country within Europe, with enormous influence despite our size, should be directed towards convincing our EC partners of the need to get our act together in the <Col N="1099" /> administrative and procedural area rather than in spending money at this stage in the serious problems that have arisen in Ethiopia.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I give a qualified approval to this motion because it states fairly bluntly that Seanad Éireann approves of the allocations made by the Government for emergency famine relief and urges the Government to continue to assist the diplomatic efforts to ensure the supplies reach those in need.  Of course, I endorse that but I can only give a qualified approval because it comes in a certain context.  It comes in the context of swingeing cuts in overseas development aid announced in the Government's Estimates.  This is very regrettable. Ireland is the 26th richest nation in the world.  That puts us in the top quarter of all the countries in the globe and yet the proportion of GNP that that Government have allocated to the Third World has actually fallen from 0.25 per cent in 1986 to a mere 0.16 per cent this year.  We have never, even in the period when our contribution was double that, come near achieving the target recommended by the United Nations of 0.7 per cent of GNP, which is a comparatively modest contribution. We are particularly sensitive in this matter because of our own tragic experience in the last century of the effects of famine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that an earlier speaker was incorrect when he spoke of schizophrenia in Government circles, in cutting back on aid in the immediate context of the Bob Geld of extravaganza.  That was not schizophrenia at all; that was simple meanness and cheese-paring and it is something that happens on the national as well as the international scale.  Anybody who is involved, as I have been over many years, in voluntary work knows that one of the dangers of voluntary work is that you relieve the pressure from Central Government and if government are sufficiently cheese-paring they will take account of this in making up their budget. I believe that this is precisely what has <Col N="1100" /> happened with regard to the very remarkable and characteristic generosity of the Irish people.  The Government have carpet-bagged on this generosity and taken it into account when calculating the figures for overseas development aid.  Of course, I have to deplore it.</P>
    <P>Attention has been drawn very widely in the media to this situation and placed it in the context of the Ethiopian famine. <i>The Irish Times</i> on the 30 November had a leading article headlined &ldquo;The Spectre of Ethiopia&rdquo; which I feel the Minister would do well to read.  However, in order to be truly independent and not to appear to be attacking the Government unreservedly, and in particular to pay a unique tribute from myself to the Minister for Foreign Affairs &mdash; because I have been critical of him in the past &mdash; it was an imaginative and appropriate gesture, and one to be welcomed, that the Minister for Foreign Affairs should have visited the Soviet Embassy to seek their assistance in allowing transport of food to make its way into the most settled parts of Ethiopia.  I feel that the Minister has the determined support of the Oireachtas and of the Irish people in making this gesture.  It was important, imaginative and it is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>I believe that the Soviet Government may well respond but we must be aware of the fact that President Gorbachev has a lot on his plate, not just Ethiopia, and that we are not quite as significant a player on the international stage as, perhaps, some of us would like us to be.</P>
    <P>I would like also to point out that transport, although it is an important element, is not an insurmountable one.  Here I have to disagree with what my distinguished colleague, Senator Mooney had to say about the dangers of throwing money at famines.  I honestly do not believe that we are really throwing money at them.  The amounts are really quite tiny compared with&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that it be made clear that what Senator Mooney indicated was that young people were <Col N="1101" /> being misled by radical papers and radical sections of the media into believing that the problem could be solved by throwing money at it.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Only.  I would like to point out that money is a very important ingredient even in allowing transport through and I quote Fr. Aengus Finucane, who is with one of the principal relief agencies.  He said only last week that if sufficient money was raised, aid can get through.  It is a question of money. He said that the tragic thing is that the cost, however, is vastly higher than if it was not a war.  Already about £100 could be added to the price of each tonne of food reaching people in areas controlled by the Ethiopian Government.  That gives the key to part of what is going on. It is not only a humane problem, it is a problem with a very clear political element and that political element is a desire of the Ethiopian Government, among other elements in that part of the world, to reduce people to submission by starvation.</P>
      <P>This is put in context even before the Mengistu regime came into power. Fintan O'Toole in a very powerful article in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 23 November, entitled &ldquo;The Hungry Man thinks only of Bread&rdquo;, tells how an official in the old Ethiopian Government of Emperor Haile Selassie explained this factor to a Polish journalist by saying:</P>
      <P>How then to confront this threatening creature that man seems to be, that we all are, how to tame him and daunt him, how to know that beast, how to master him.  There is only one way, my friend, by weakening him, yes, by depriving him of his vitality because without it, he will be incapable of wrong and to weaken is exactly what fasting does.  A man starved all his life will never rebel.  The usefulness of growing hungry is that a hungry man thinks only of bread.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a very sinister remark to make. Admittedly, it was made some years ago <Col N="1102" /> by a previous regime but this, I believe, is the thinking that still obtains in official circles in Ethiopia.  Famine is being deliberately, cynically and unscrupulously used as an instrument of warfare by certain regimes in the Horn of Africa against their own people.</P>
    <P>That imposes an obligation upon us, an obligation on us to increase our aid.  I welcome the increases the Minister has indicated, tiny though they are &mdash; and they are tiny, £45,000 for a truck, £50,000 for something else.  I wish to encourage the Minister to continue this process but it is not enough.  I remember people saying when I was learning history that Queen Victoria sent £5 for the famine. We know that myth has been exploded but it put in context how we felt about English hard-heartedness and Victorian <i>laissez faire</i> economic theory and so on. At that time, Ireland, particularly the parts affected by famine, were three days journey from London.  Nowadays, we see every single evening on television in our living-rooms the spectacle of fellow-citizens of this earth starving to death.  The figure is 500 million children globally imperiled by starvation.  It is, I believe, very much our responsibility.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to something the Minister said, for example, with regard to Sudan.  He mentioned that 700,000 refugees from Sudan and Somalia sought refuge in Ethiopia.  When the question of Sudan is raised, I have to point out that we can be quite cynical in our calculations too, and that Sudan is a country with which as a result of, among other things, our bilateral aid programme, we actually have a positive trade balance &mdash; about £6 million.</P>
    <P>We need to look into these kind of situations where, on the one hand, we dole out our pennies to those whom we regard as the unfortunate but deserving poor, and, at the same time, the macroeconomic structure puts us in a situation where, without the understanding or consent of our citizens, we are actually, even through our aid programmes, conspiring to extract further moneys from the weaker section of our community.</P>
    <P>I spoke on the NESC report about the <Col N="1103" /> dangers of distortions occuring globally as a result of the fact that in the European Community we were trying to rectify regional distortions of economy.  We were trying to bring areas like Ireland and Portugal up to the standard of the other countries but in so doing, I suggested and I reaffirm that today, that we stand in great danger of exacerbating the North-South divide.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>In May 1989 I initiated a debate in the Seanad here on the motion.</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann noting with concern, the obstacles facing the transportation and distribution of emergency food aid to the starving people of Ethiopia, appeals to all concerned to take the necessary action in order for food aid to be adequately distributed, and calls on the Government to use its good offices to effect a ceasefire between all the forces involved in the conflict in Ethiopia.</P>
      <P>At that time, it received all-party support and I was pleased with the Minister's response.  Now, we are here again, a year and a half later, and we are debating the same issue and what has changed.  The Minister referred to the areas of Eritrea and Tigre and said:</P>
      <P>In both of these areas, there are internal conflicts with the rebel movements opposing Government forces. These hamper delivery of relief supplies, particularly in Tigre, which is entirely in rebel hands.  The main access roads into Tigre from the south and the south west are closed.</P>
      <P>We all know that there are a number of problems in this area.  One of the principal problems is the Government and the way they control the aid that is provided. I would like to quote here from a statement by the British Horn of Africa Council dated 25 February 1988, which was kindly forwarded to me by Mr. Louis Dillon Fitzgibbon, the secretary of the organisation.  The statement reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most serious cause of trouble, <Col N="1104" /> not just in Ethiopia, but in the whole area, is the concentration of Ethiopian resources on military and paramilitary expenditure.  Ethiopia maintains, with some help from Cuba and the Soviet Union, the largest army in the African Continent, larger indeed than that of the two much richer countries, Nigeria and South Africa.</P>
    <P>I also have a statement which shows that Russian Mig fighters, owned by the Ethiopian Government bombed civilians in Hasmet in northern Eritrea.  This goes on all the time.</P>
    <P>The Rev. Dr. Parkins, the Methodist Minister in Birr, County Offaly, spent two weeks in the affected areas in northern Ethiopia on behalf of the disaster joint appeal committee, which comprises Christian Aid, Trócaire, Gorta, The Church of Ireland Bishops' Appeal and the Irish Missionary's Union.  In <i>The Irish Times</i> of 6 December he is reported as follows:</P>
    <P>There will be a major crisis at the end of January, which is really only a matter of weeks, if the supplies are not there to avert the crisis.</P>
    <P>Dr. Parkins said that people were dying of starvation.  He also said:</P>
    <P>Four million people would require food assistance in the coming 12 months until the next harvest in Tigre and Eritrea.  A total of 600,000 tonnes of food was needed to prevent starvation on a major scale.  He referred to this later when he said:</P>
    <P>Food distribution has to be organised at night because of the bombing raids by the Ethiopian Air Force.  The Ethiopian Government has withdrawn completely from Tigre.</P>
    <P>What are we doing about this in Ireland or in the European Community?  Last year, as I mentioned, under the Lomé Convention we gave 230 million ECUs to Ethiopia, and this huge handout of approximately US$300 million is based on what is said to be a reform of agricultural policies.  I said at the time I was not opposed to giving aid but that it must <Col N="1105" /> be monitored because we all know that this is a Marxist Government which last year was in the process of getting a US$4 billion loan from the Soviet Union. Again, as one Senator said, Mr. Gorbachev probably has enough on his plate but he has, nevertheless, got a responsibility here as well if this Stalinist regime &mdash; and he is against Stalinism at the moment &mdash; is bombing and killing people who are starving.  I am glad to see that the Minister for Foreign Affairs has made a request to the Soviet Union to intervene in this dispute.</P>
    <P>I see, too, in an article in last week's <i>Sunday Times</i> by Peter Godwin and Andrew Grice, that the Soviet Union and America are trying to create a peace corridor through the war zones of Ethiopia to carry food to the four million people threatened by famine.  I welcome that.  It is about time they did something because it is only the major powers who can really intervene and do something with Mengistu.</P>
    <P>I said before, and I say it again, that the 26 year old war to Ethiopia has claimed almost 500,000 lives and as long as it goes on the Ethiopian people will starve.  They starve not only because of the recurring drought but also because they are victims of a war between Eritrean and Tigrean separatists and the Marxist Government in Addis Ababa.  Some six million people are at risk at present.  What of the future? According to the World Bank, population growth is outstripping food production at such a rate that by the year 2000 some 14 million people will be at risk and it is extremely doubtful that the world's relief agencies could cope with a problem of this magnitude.  This need not happen.  We, and the other member states of the Economic Community can, should and must put pressure on all those involved in the conflict to effect a ceasefire.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision of aid provided by the Government at the present time.  I know they are providing what they can.  I ask them to continue to increase it as funds become available, but I would insist that all aid be carefully monitored. Concerted pressure in the monitoring of <Col N="1106" /> aid by outside impartial agencies may be our most effective weapon in combating this appalling crisis.</P>
    <P>Pressure seems to work.  If anybody has any doubt about what is going on in those beleagured areas I have obtained a video produced by the Tigrean Front.  I will make it available to any Senator, or indeed any Deputy, who wishes to see this.  I would be glad to show it to them. Their appalling conditions are the result of a Marxist regime which is using aid to further its cause to try and gain control over the entire country.  I appeal to the Minister to intervene at all possible levels, as our Minister for Foreign Affairs has done.</P>
    <P>I welcome aid, as everybody does.  I am sure we are doing what we can.  I would ask them to increase it if possible, but I welcome what has been done at the present time.  I ask the Government to keep up the pressure, to see that all aid that is provided is monitored carefully so that this man does not use any of the moneys provided, or indeed put his hand on any of the aids which should be going to the people who are dying and who are in need.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>For procedural reasons we cannot table amendments but Fine Gael will be opposing the motion on the grounds that we do not consider that the funding is sufficient in the 1990 budget, although I welcome the increase the Minister has suggested will be given, £300,000 for emergency relief.  Because of the restrictions of time I have to go very quickly through the many points I want to make.  It is very sad that it took the reports of an impending disaster of the famine reaching the scale of the 1984-85 famine, which we know ravished Ethiopia, to cause us to look again at our commitment to the developing world in terms of aid, both relief aid, emergency aid as it is called, and development aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1988 we responded with other donor countries by providing funds and supplies to Ethiopia and averting a further major famine in that year.  Did we learn a lesson from that catastrophe of 1984-85?  We retained our position among the <Col N="1107" /> wealthier nations of the world despite our own economic problems in the 1980s but, again, I refer to our commitment.  The United Nations target of 0.7 is a modest target in relation to our GNP and we have committed ourselves as a Government over the years to reaching that figure.  Looking at our contribution over the past four years, and just a few weeks ago when the Government announced another real cut in ODA, obviously we are not reaching that or even making an effort.  We are going far away from that promise of 0.7 per cent of GNP and the 500 million starving people of the world.</P>
    <P>At this moment we are being given a very positive picture of the Irish economy. We are told our economic crisis is passing, so there is no real excuse for not going back to the 1986 figure when our ODA was £40 million compared to the £35 million in the 1990 Estimates.  Since 1986 we have actually taken £22 million away from what we promised to developing countries.  That is the reason we are voting against the motion.  It is strange that we, as a nation, are top of the league for individual generosity but we are second last for what counts internationally as ODA.</P>
    <P>I am aware &mdash; Senator Lydon pointed this out in his contribution &mdash; of the staggering problems that Ethiopia, Sudan and other east African countries face. Time will only allow me to briefly look at those problems in relation to Ethiopia. History has not been kind to that country. There has been a long history of famine right back to the 1800s.  There was a famine in 1972-74, which is not so very long ago, when we should have been alerted to the problems of Ethiopia, when 200,000 people died.  In Ireland, we still speak of the Irish famine and the effects can still be seen in this country.  We should have learned some lessons from the famine in Ethiopia in 1972-74 to help that country to face its current problems. Of course, we must acknowledge the fact, as Senator Lydon said, that war is continuing to disrupt agriculture.  There was the invasion of Ethiopia by Italy and Somalia &mdash; obviously again the influence <Col N="1108" /> of the past &mdash; and the continuation of the Eritrean-Tigrean war.</P>
    <P>The facts regarding the cost of war in relation to Ethiopia are that $440 million is spent on the military &mdash; a staggering figure.  In black Africa Ethiopia has the largest army, over 300,000 people, as well as a very expensive navy and air force. Ethiopia buys arms abroad in Europe, the Soviet Union and, in the past, in the United States, and the war has actually helped Ethiopia create a debt to foreigners of £3 billion &mdash; a staggering amount.</P>
    <P>What is the result of this?  Moneys for roads, communications, transport etc. are needed.  How can you possibly have money for those items when you think in terms of what is spent in war?  We can understand why supplies cannot get through when we consider the staggering cost of war.  War causes grave disruption of agriculture.</P>
    <P>With regard to poverty, it is important when we talk about our GNP and our average <i>per capita</i> income, to realise that US$110 is the average annual <i>per capita,</i> amount for Ethiopia.  That is an average figure which means that of the 42 million people living in Ethiopia, some may not even reach that figure and they have to struggle even for their most basic needs. Obviously the Ethiopian Government have found it very hard to find money to pay for food and development.  The price of goods they need to import continues to rise while export prices continue to fall.  Poverty itself is another major cause of famine.  If we had time, we could argue that the policies of the Ethiopian Marxist Government have also made the situation worse by promoting collective ownership of farms and state farms rather than individually owned farms.</P>
    <P>We come to something that is very topical at the moment, the misuse of the earth's resources.  When the Ethiopians were farming they were able to farm successfully. It was when they were interfered with by European farming techniques that things began to be difficult. The Ethiopians were well able to <Col N="1109" /> manage their affairs before colonialisation. What has been the result of this environmental crisis?  It has brought about deforestation where trees are cut down to provide fuel.  In 1880, over 100 years ago, 44 per cent of Ethiopian land was woodland.  Today it is 4 per cent. This, of course, has repercussions for us when we talk about the need for oxygen and the destruction of rainforests and, of course, it means soil erosion for the Ethiopians.</P>
    <P>I want to make one point which was not touched on: what we actually get in return for what we spend.  It is not all giving; we get a tremendous amount back.  Our exports, in 1980 amounted to £405 million.  Our semi-State bodies alone earned 40 per cent more from service contracts in developing countries than the entire aid budget that year.  It is very important that we emphasise that. Our money is spent, as we know, through multinational aid, through bilateral aid, and also I mention the fact that the ESB have helped Ethiopia to run its power stations but we have got funding back in return.  Likewise with Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>It is a long-term problem and Senators in their contributions over the past few minutes have shown that it is an enormous problem.  We must look towards education where we help our students to develop skills, knowledge and attitudes which will lead them to respond and to be critical in today's interdependent world, give them a global dimension and help them to develop attitudes creating tolerance, empathy, openness, appreciation of other cultures and basic human rights. Because of the enormity of the problem, we could not possibly accept that the funding for the 1990 budget is anything near what it should be in relation to helping dependent people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a couple of things that need to be said on this issue. The first is, who could oppose the wording of the motion?  I am not arguing with Senator Jackman.  Of course I agree with her.  With regard to the wording of the motion, it is a bit like being asked to say you are in favour of sin.  I do not blame <Col N="1110" /> the Minister for that.  I blame that Minister perhaps more than he deserves to be blamed but he is not responsible for that.  Of course we all agree, we are glad the Government gave something.  It is a lot better than giving nothing.  Nobody disputes that.</P>
      <P>There is a tone to the discussion on Ethiopia that I have not heard often before, that is, the talk about all the outrageous things the Ethiopian Government have done.  We would want to be very careful.  Nobody has suggested for one second that Ethiopia is a democracy. There is no way in which we can delay, slow down or avoid taking the action that is necessary because of the outrageous things the Ethiopian Government have done.  If we are going to give lectures, and I do not disagree with it, to the Soviet Union about what it should do with a dependent or client state in Africa, then I hope our Minister will take off shortly to the American Embassy to talk about the murder of nuns and priests in El Salvador. We need to be very careful not to decide that one super-power is somehow more open to our criticism than another super-power.  The world has almost been destroyed by the competition of superpowers.</P>
      <P>I hope that there is not even a hint of an implication that aid to Ethiopia should in any way be tied to political change in Ethiopia.  I do not subscribe to that view where the aid can get through.  There are voluntary organisations and, without being in the least bit nationalistic, it is to their great credit that there are Irish Sisters who are the people who stayed with the victims of famine when everybody else felt obliged to leave.  Many people, including myself, who can be very critical of the Church and its institutions from time to time, mostly with justification, have a particular obligation to record the fact that it was Sisters, and it is Sisters, who stayed with these people and were the people who were able to provide the support to enable the world to be told about what had happened there.</P>
      <P>It is not enough, of course, to talk about Ethiopia and to give famine relief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1111" /> It is extremely important that we should do so but there is an important difference between charity and justice.  It is a distinction which is very well discussed in the Irish Bishop's pastoral letter on justice. The difference is that charity is what you give out of that which you are entitled to have but you can only give charity after you have given back that which you are not entitled to have.  It needs to be said that western society has a share of the world's resources that it is not entitled to have and, therefore, it is not a question of some high-named charity that dictates we should increase our level of aid to Third World countries; it is a moral imperative of justice that dictates we should increase our overseas development aid.</P>
    <P>It cannot be avoided that this Government and this Minister have presided over an extraordinary decline in our proportionate level of overseas development aid.  Because of the structure of ODA this decline has disproportionately impinged on our bilateral aid because we have to maintain our multilateral commitments. That has caused and will continue to cause enormous disruption of what were extraordinarily useful programmes, programmes that I had the good fortune to see myself.  Anybody who has seen the value of our overseas developments aid would have enormous difficulty in justifying the cutbacks.</P>
    <P>If we are going to give lectures to the authorities in Ethiopia about expenditure on armaments, then I would like to know how we can justify the expenditure of £10 million in recent years to buy new rifles for an already well equipped army.  To replace weapons that are acceptable to some countries in NATO by even more modern weapons at a cost of £10 million seems to me to tarnish slightly our capacity to give sanctimonious moral lectures about armaments.  We would want to be a little careful.</P>
    <P>There are three things involved in bringing justice to the world at present. There is trade, there is debt and there is aid.  One of the problems we have imposed on the entirety of the Third <Col N="1112" /> World is an increasing need for them to have access to so-called hard currency. That has given added impetus to the ecological devastation that is the cause of so much drought and the attendant human consequences of famine and so on.  Part of the reason for the demand for foreign currency is the overwhelming burden of debt.  Let it be said, that debt is not something that is held by big banks in other countries.  Our banks have a stake in Third World debt and when interest rates go up our banks get more money out of the Third World as part of their share of Third World lending.  There can be no justice in that situation where the western world is getting back more in interest payments from the Third World then its total aid contribution.  That is not justice; that is robbery and that is usury.</P>
    <P>The third thing is aid and that is where we are most shamefully betraying our own people.  OECD figures will show that in terms of charitable voluntary donations the Irish people contribute a greater proportion of their GNP to overseas development than any other OECD country.  Our people in their spontaneous voluntary donations are more generous than any others.  Our Government by contrast with the will, the wish and the generosity of its people are mean-minded, penny-pinching and miserly.  It is time the Government reflected the clear will of the people as demonstrated by their spontaneous giving out of their own pockets.  Let it be said, that aid given by Irish people not by choosing to give to Third World charities instead of to charities at home, our people give generously both at home and abroad.  They are prepared to see that continue.  The Government should not say there is a consensus to justify their decisions.  They should recognise that the consensus out there is to say that this is one area where they had to mandate to cut, where they have no mandate to cut and where they never will have a mandate to cut.</P>
    <P>If our Government are to have the credibility they ought to have to direct the EC over the next six months into areas of new thinking, to get the EC away from the increasing introspection that <Col N="1113" /> seems to have taken it over, then one of the things they need to do is to reassess their whole view of overseas development aid.  Even if it means a specific imposition of a specific tax, they should return to the path of morality by a process of bringing our overseas development aid up to the minimum moral value, which is, 0.7 per cent of our gross national product. Even if that means imposition of specific taxes, then it should be begun in the January budget.  I appeal to the Minister either to get that done or to do the thing which establishes credibility most with ordinary people, that is, to resign and not to allow the charade to continue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sometimes worried about myself when I consistently agree with what Senator Brendan Ryan says in his speeches.  I feel I ought to re-examine exactly what I have written down and my thoughts on the subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The feeling is entirely mutual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be even more worrying for Senator Ryan when I say I endorse every single thing he said in his speech.  It seems to me that this debate is about priorities and where our contribution to world development aid ranks in the priorities of the Government.  From all the figures I have seen, from all I have heard here today and from the Minister's opening statement, it seems it ranks very low in priority.  I wonder why the Government have not seen fit to set up again the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Development Co-operation.  The Government have seen fit to set up committees on all sorts of other things, joint committees of both Houses, which would seem to those of us who have contributed to this debate to be less important than a joint committee on development co-operation. But apparently, and it is symbolic of the importance which the Government attach to this subject, they have decided that development co-operation for Third World and overseas countries does not merit the sort of attention which internal <Col N="1114" /> matters do in this session of the Dáil and Seanad.</P>
      <P>I accept it is easy for those of us on the Opposition always to complain that enough money is not given to X, Y or Z but it is very difficult for us to propose where that money will come from.  I would have thought there is a very good case for saying that so critical is the situation in the Third World at the moment, so critical is the situation in Ethiopia and Sudan and in many other countries, that maybe all the money which we raise from the national lottery should go direct and immediately to ODA or in a bilateral sense straight to the Third World, to overseas countries.  I do not see why money should be raised for dubious schemes in particular constituencies in this country when other people are starving in Ethiopia and in Sudan.  I do not know exactly how much is being raised by the national lottery but I imagine there must be about £40 million per annum for distribution at this stage by the Government. If I am wildly out, the Minister will correct me.  That would be an enormous contribution to the Third World and would put us up into disproportionate generosity whereas the sacrifice which we would have to make at home would be to sacrifice what are in the main, and are certainly in Third World terms, luxuries to the individuals and the groups involved.</P>
      <P>It is not right for us to adopt a high moral tone on this issue here because it is not particularly convincing.  Between the balance of building golf courses and seeing people starve, there is absolutely no question of which should be a priority. I ask the Minister to consider the proposal that the whole of national lottery funds should go to the starving people of Ethiopia and other underdeveloped countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to endorse what Senator Ryan said so eloquently, that we are, indeed, a very generous people in terms of spontaneity and individual contributions to the Third World.  Yet, the Government seem unable to reflect the wishes of the people who have given so much money, <Col N="1115" /> as was so amply illustrated after the Live Aid Concert.</P>
    <P>It is no harm to read into the record the Irish contribution in 1987 to the ODA total as a percentage of GNP, compared with our EC and European partners. Norway gave 1.09 per cent, Holland, 0.98 per cent, Denmark, 0.88 per cent, Sweden, 0.88 per cent, France, 0.51 per cent, Finland, 0.50 per cent, Belgium, 0.49 per cent, Germany, 0.39 per cent, Italy, 0.35 per cent, Britain, 0.28 per cent and Ireland 0.20 per cent.  We were bottom of the league in that year for reasons which cannot be explained.</P>
    <P>I am not going to raise this particular hare today, but the Minister raised the matter of the EC in his speech.  When we get this apparently great prize of the EC Presidency in January, it will be very difficult for us to give a lead in aid to the Third World as President of the EC in that period if we are bottom of the league in that area.  In fact, in the 1990 Estimates we are giving even less than 0.2 per cent in ODA.  I would ask the Minister to consider it in the European context which he has brought out himself in his speech and to tell us how we can give a lead to our European colleagues during that six months if our own performance is so abysmal.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the congratulatory sort of tone in this motion.  Our contributions are dismal.  Neither do I accept the half-excuses given by the Government side about the sort of regimes that exist in the Third World, and in Ethiopia in particular. It is absolutely irrelevant whether the régime is a Stalinst, dictorial, Marxist one or whether it is a particularly tyrannical one of the right.  What matters is that the people there are starving and that we have an obligation as members of the human race to help them.</P>
    <P>I accept the excuses which are given by the Government side and by those administering these funds that it is difficult sometimes to deliver the food because of the particular civil war problem which exists there.  It is an absurd excuse to attack the regime and to say because it is a Marxist régime who have <Col N="1116" /> committed appalling atrocities, who are tyrannical, we should not give them any more money or any more food.  The people in those countries who are dictated to in this way, do not have much choice about the régimes who govern them.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like the Minister to tell us what are the plans of the Government for overseas aid and for ODA in the future.  In his final paragraph, he says, &ldquo;I wish to make clear that I do not wish to minimise the present situation.  It is very serious and potentially catastrophic&rdquo;. To my mind it is already catastrophic. It has gone beyond a serious stage.  Then he says: &ldquo;I believe that if it is taken very seriously by everyone at this stage results can be achieved much more quickly&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That is saying absolutely nothing.  It is declaring no intent.  It is saying that the Minister has no plans for the next five or six years for ODA except to take it very, very seriously.  As a first priority, I suggest that he should say that instead of being bottom of the league coming into the EC Presidency which we are now, Ireland will take the lead and will give a substantial proportion of national lottery funds to the ODA, so that we can take some sort of moral stance on this.  Otherwise, we will be talking in a vacuum, speaking to our partners in the EC without any credibility whatsoever and will have the worst record to lead with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a very brief contribution this morning to clarify a point I made on the Order of Business when I indicated that we would be opposing this motion today.  I said that at the time because it had been, I believe, the intention of all parties in the House that motions like this coming in on Thursdays, which, we hope will be a regular feature of the life of the Seanad, would have allparty agreement before they come in. Certainly, from our point of view, we would liked to have seen a motion which conveyed a much greater sense of urgency about the situation and which might have reflected a willingness to make a greater contribution, not just to <Col N="1117" /> Ethopia but to the whole question of overseas development aid.  However, I accept fully the bona fides of the Leader of the House in this matter, that as matters transpired there was not time to consult or to get an agreed motion.  I will not be pressing this motion to a vote today although I would like to put on record &mdash; and it has been done by Senator Jackman, Senator Raftery and other Senators &mdash; our sense that the motion does not convey the full sense of urgency or of scale which all Members and all parties in the House have in regard to this subject.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer very briefly to two matters of substance which have been raised in what has been a very wide-ranging and useful debate.  It is important at the outset to make the point that no party or group in this House have a monopoly of compassion on this issue.  As a people we all have a sense of concern and have shown our generosity in the past in various ways in the scale and extent of charities and the extent to which the work of the various relief agencies has penetrated the consciences especially of the young people throughout our society.</P>
      <P>There are two specific points I would like to make.  Strange as it may seem to him that I am actually supporting him in the matter I would like to support Senator Ross's plea on the question of the national lottery.  The national lottery has come into existence and has been a success. There are side effects and down effects which may well be deleterious but that is a matter to be seen.  If the Irish people were ballotted or surveyed on the question of whether they would be prepared to see a much greater amount of national lottery money over a fixed period go to development aid, famine relief and so forth, I suspect the answer would be a strong affirmation of a worked out, thought out proposal of this sort.  I would certainly like to support the case made by Senator Ross on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A second point relates to tax relief for institutions and individuals who contribute towards famine relief.  It is my understanding that donations by individuals or institutions to charitable causes <Col N="1118" />&mdash; and these can be university development, hospitals, hospices and so forth &mdash; enjoy a very favourable tax relief, that the amount of tax relief for the donor can be considerable and the person in receipt also benefits.  I would like to ask the Minister to raise this question with the Gover-ment and the Department of Finance to see if some type of tax exemption could be conferred on donations to famine relief and so forth.  Obviously, the Minister cannot answer that today but perhaps at some later stage he might come back on that point.</P>
    <P>This has been a very useful debate and, as I said at the outset, we will not be pressing this matter to a division.</P>

      <P>First, may I thank all the Senators who contributed to the debate and to assure them that I have taken on board quite a number of the things that have been suggested.  It has been a strange morning as has been suggested: Senator Manning, Senator Ryan and Senator Ross are in agreement. Christmas must be in the air.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">

    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I assure Senator Ryan that I have no intention of resigning? I have a job to do and I will try to do it to the best of my ability.  That would be the easy way out and as somebody who has come from Mayo, we do not generally take the easy way out.  I will certainly come back to the point raised by Senator Manning.  Unfortunately I cannot give him any answer now but I certainly will return to him with the answer.</P>
      <P>I am afraid I cannot give Senator Ross any idea why the committee have not been reformed.  However, I understand that there was some difficulty here yesterday morning about committees and I would hate to have more problems in the Seanad by adding more committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ryan and, indeed other Senators, raised the difficulty in providing humanitarian aid and the fear was <Col N="1119" /> expressed that humanitarian aid is only being provided to certain régimes.  I can reassure Senator Ryan that Irish humanitarian aid is provided without any political or other conditions whatsoever attached.  It is a point that was also raised by Senator Ross.  I can assure him that we have always supported that position in both the Community and the United Nations fora.</P>
    <P>I had the opportunity of having a very long conversation with Fr. Jack Finucane of Concern who has just returned from Ethiopia.  It might be of interest to the Seanad, particularly in view of all that has been said, that one of Fr. Finucane's observations in a very detailed report which he made to Concern which he made available to me and which I would like to thank him for publicly is that in the last two months up to 1,500 advisers from Russia and East Germany have left, including the Russian military attaché; and that in recent weeks Ethiopia has resumed diplomatic relations with Israel. Maybe there is something there.  As far as we are concerned, the Minister as referred to by Senator Norris, did ask the Russian Ambassador to use whatever influence he could and I accept that all that the Russians can do is to use whatever influence they can to make certain that the roads are open.  That is the only way we can get food into the areas where there is the most need.  Certainly, all the other routes are being used by the various NGOs to the best of their ability.  The reality is that unless we can get the roads open, particularly the ones from the north and the south a number of people will not be able to get the amount of food that is needed.</P>
    <P>Senator Raftery spoke about the work of the International Livestock Commission for Africa.  He also noted that it was headed by an Irishman, Dr. John Walsh.  What he did not say, and what I am very pleased to tell the Seanad, is that the bilateral aid programme of which so much has been said this morning is providing £200,000 a year towards the work of this institution which we, like him, believe is very important in finding long <Col N="1120" /> term solutions to the problem of food supply in Africa.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney spoke about the operation of agencies such as REST and how important it is that aid be given to such agencies.  I would like to reassure Senator Mooney that efforts are being made by us, and indeed by all official sources, to ensure the supplies get through.  We will use whatever agencies we can to make certain that supplies get through.  Senator Ross and Senator Ryan picked up that point later and again, I would like to reassure them that there are people in Government-held areas who are certainly in as much need as those in Tigre.  It is important that relations are maintained with the Government in Ethiopia, who, whether we like it or not, are a legitimate Government.</P>
    <P>I would like to inform the Seanad that today, the European Community, which is represented by Spain, Italy and France is making three points to the Ethiopian Government in Addis Ababa.  First, they are notifying the Government that the Community is very worried about the food situation.  Second, they are informing the Government of the anxiety of a number of states to help the people of Ethiopia.  Third, they are requesting them to allow access for humanitarian aid in all regions.  The co-ordination of aid can be carried out and organised under the aegis of the United Nations which, after all, has the capacity to arrange access, if this is agreed.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the motion will not be put to a vote.  If I had known that the discussion would take the direction it did on the amount of aid being provided, I could have come in with a completely different speech.  I can assure the House that the Government will continue to provide as much aid as they possibly can in the circumstances.  I accept that the percentage contribution has declined. However, it is important to say that the amount of money has gone up in the past two years.  As the Taoiseach said recently in reply to questions in the Dáil: we have an enormous burden of debt ourselves, a debt of £25 billion.</P>
    <P>I can accept what the Senators are <Col N="1121" /> saying but I am quite positive that the vast majority of Senators here have been in touch with various Ministers looking for various things for their constituencies. Not only that, but each Deputy has been in touch with various Ministers.  All of them have been refused.  While I accept Senator Ryan's suggestion that an extra tax should be levied, if it were put to the Irish people, maybe their response would not be as forthright as Senator Ryan seems to think it would be.</P>

      <P>I can also assure Senator Ross that if he made a suggestion, and I accept he made it in good faith, that all of the national lottery money should go to overseas aid development, he would be surprised by the outcry that might cause.  That is being political.  Those of us who are contacted every day by organisations that are looking for funds from the national lottery know how hard it is to get them.  A suggestion like that would not be well received at all.  The national lottery was set up under an Act of the Oireachtas and that Act would have to be changed to allow that suggestion to be taken up.  I accept it is a positive suggestion and I welcome it.  I am not saying that I agree with it, but I welcome it.</P>

      <P>I would like, again, to thank all the Senators.  I would like to reassure them that contrary to what Senator Ross has said, the Government are doing everything possible.  There is no way we can plan for six or seven years ahead.  I do not think it is possible.  There will always be arguments about aid: some people say there is not enough, while others say there is too much.  I assure Senators that it has been put to me very, very strongly by a number of people that we are actually giving too much aid.  I do not agree with that point, but there is a feeling abroad that in the present circumstances, we are contributing too much.  As I said, I do not agree with <Col N="1122" /> that, neither do the Government who still remain committed to achieving the 0.7 per cent target as soon as economic circumstances permit it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I have two very brief observations on that.  I am quite concerned that the distribution between parties in this House of members of the committees means that the Labour Party with four Members is represented on only one of the six committees.  There is a distortion which may well be explained by the system which is used to allocate the distribution of seats.  I am not being invidious.  I would like some more committees. It is strange that the Independent group with six Members are on five committees, Labour with four Members are on one committee.  There is a distortion.  I am not imputing blame or anything like that, but it is something to which the House should address itself as soon as possible.  I do not think it is right that the Labour group should be represented on only one committee &mdash; I am not saying that the Independents should have fewer members but some means should be found to increase proportionately the size of the Labour representation on the committees of the Oireachtas.  Second, I am sure Senator Ross will get a very warm welcome from the Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies, on which he had such extravagant and colourful things to say just a week or two ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to respond to that.  I do not intend to make a speech of a controversial nature.  The Labour Party should have more representation on these committees, but it is very difficult to find a formula which satisfies everybody without committees becoming very unwieldy and large.  I do not know if it is normal for the Leader of the House to be on a committee, but I welcome him very warmly to the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">

I hope he and the Coalition Whip, Senator McGowan, will be able to contribute to the reform of that particular committee during the next period.</P>
      <P>Finally, I would like to refer to the distribution of places on these committees. I would like to raise the proportionate allocation on the Anglo-Irish tier that would be included, if we are going to reform the ways&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I am responding to Senator Manning's remark about the way seats are distributed on committees.  If we are going to reform the proportionality of this, we should also presumably reform the proportionate way the seats on the Anglo-Irish tier are allocated, and why Independents are excluded.  I agree with him on the Labour Party being excluded from the committees.  This is a great pity. The Labour Party should be included on all of the committees because they have a great contribution to make.  If we are going to do that, then we should consider the Independents in both the Dáil and Seanad being accepted on to the Anglo-Irish tier.  This is something which has not been taken into consideration.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to give effect to the Borough of Clonmel (Alteration of Boundary) Provisional Order, 1989, which I made on 24 November last. The order provides for the extension of the Borough of Clonmel so as to take in an area of Tipperary South Riding comprising 1,537 acres approximately with a population of 3,058 based on the 1986 census.  The order is provisional only and is of no effect until confirmed by an Act of the Oireachtas; hence this Bill to confirm the order which is set out in the Schedule to the Bill.</P>
      <P>The procedure for the alteration of borough boundaries is governed by the Local Government (Application of Enactments) Order, 1899 and the Local Government Ireland Act, 1898.  Under the relevant provisions Clonmel Corporation made representation to the Minister to extend the boundary.  As required by law a local inquiry was held by the Minister at which both Clonmel Corporation and Tipperary South Riding County Council were represented and all other interested parties were afforded an opportunity to express their views on the proposal.  The proposed extension has been agreed between both local authorities. Having considered the report and recommendation of the inspector who held the inquiry, and the agreement between both authorities, I decided to approve the extension without modification and, accordingly, made the necessary provisional order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1129" /> It is hoped to have the present legislation enacted before the Christmas recess so that the boundary extension will come into force as from 1 January 1990 to coincide, for obvious administrative, accounting and practical reasons, with the start of the financial year and thereby to avoid inconvenience to all affected by the boundary change.</P>
    <P>The order which forms the Schedule to the Bill contains a number of provisions which are consequential on the extension. These are along the usual lines for boundary alteration and provide for the preparation of official maps of the extended borough area; the continuation in effect of bye-laws, resolutions and orders in relation to the transferred area; consequential adjustment of county electoral areas, polling districts and the continuation in office of borough councillors; adjustment of property, rights and liabilities and continuation of the development plan.</P>
    <P>Clonmel has a long history in local government terms.  From 1371 A.D. to 1608 A.D. Clonmel was governed by a &ldquo;Sovereign&rdquo;, which office was established at the behest of the Duke of Ormond. The Mayoralty was established by Royal Charter of 1608 A.D. and the Mayoral Roll is unbroken from that time to the present with the exception of the period 1650 to 1656 when it was under a Military Governor after the town's eventual surrender to Cromwell.</P>
    <P>Clonmel held its status as a municipal borough with the passing of the Municipal Corporation (Ireland) Act, 1840. Under that Act, Clonmel retained its corporate status with the title of the corporate body changing from the Mayor, free burgesses and commonalty of the Town of Clonmel to its present title of the Mayor, Aldermen and burgesses of Clonmel.  The Borough Council has a membership of 12 including the Mayor and four Aldermen.</P>
    <P>The boundaries of the Borough of Clonmel were last extended by the Clonmel Corporation Act, 1895 which in effect altered the county boundary of Waterford and Tipperary to bring that part of the Borough in County Waterford <Col N="1130" /> within the South Riding of Tipperary.  It will be apparent, therefore, that it is about 95 years since the boundary was last altered.  The current boundary extension, as well as taking in development that has overspilled the old boundary, will ensure that sufficient development land will be available to the borough for some time to come to cater for future expansion.  The Clonmel development plan, which was prepared jointly by both authorities, already includes the area proposed for transfer.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House and I would like to ask for the co-operation of Senators in ensuring that it will have a speedy passing so that the boundary extension can become effective on 1 January 1990.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and I hope it will get a speedy passage through the Seanad.  I can assure the Minister that as far as myself and my party are concerned, we will certainly co-operate in that endeavour.  These boundary changes, which were first proposed as far back as 1981 at a joint meeting of officials from Clonmel Urban District Council and Tipperary South Riding, and which were later adopted by Clonmel Urban District Council in 1984 should get a speedy passage through this House.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to confirm the Borough of Clonmel (Alteration of Boundaries) (Provisional order), 1989.  It arises from representation by Clonmel Corporation to extend the borough boundary and was made following the holding of a public inquiry.  The order to be confirmed provides for the extension of the boundary of the Borough of Clonmel to include an area in Tipperary South Riding.  The order is expected to come into operation on 1 January 1990.  I certainly hope it will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can appreciate the need for this order.  In a town growing as fast as Clonmel additional lands both for housing and industry are urgently required.  I note also that a number of recent housing schemes in Clonmel had to be built in the county area.  I can appreciate the difficulty this provides for the urban area of Clonmel <Col N="1131" /> with the corporation.  It is understandable that they would want to extend their boundaries.  The physical needs of the town dictate that.  Therefore, I think it is only fair and proper that we should try to facilitate the corporation and give a speedy passage to this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Clonmel Development Plan of 1982, which incorporates the municipal borough and its environs, was drawn up jointly by Tipperary South Riding and Clonmel Corporation.  It aimed at establishing reasonable location for altered boundaries.  Following the development plan, detailed consideration was being given to the proposals by both the county council and the corporation, and a line has been agreed.  When one is talking about this order, one must reflect on other areas throughout the country which would benefit from an extension of the urban boundaries.  Of course, one can appreciate that in an area such as Clonmel it is extending within its own county. Other areas, which need additional development lands, are forced very often to extend into other counties.  This, naturally, creates major problems from both the county council's and the urban boundaries point of view.  At the present time, there are 900 houses outside the urban boundary in Clonmel with a population of 3,500.  All of this area is covered by Clonmel drainage and water sewerage schemes.  It was only reasonable that it should be brought within the urban boundary.  The Minister stated that it was 95 years since there was a change in the boundary.  It is time that it was reviewed and extended.  I welcome the Bill before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanByrne" hpid="Mr. S. Byrne Mr. S. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome this Bill to the House and also to thank the Minister for the Environment for the interest he has in this problem and the speed with which he dealt with it.  I live approximately 15 miles from Clonmel.  It is a very prosperous town and even though it would be encroaching slightly on my own electoral area I gladly support the Bill because it is for the common good of the people of Clonmel and district.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1132" /> The population of Clonmel at present is about 11,730.  When the borough is extended, the population will be about 15,380.  That is an additional 3,580 people to the borough.  It is hoped to extend the borough area by 1,537 statute acres.  In my humble opinion, the extension of the boundary will take in the natural hinterland of Clonmel.  I believe it will be a great advantage for the further industrial development of Clonmel and also to streamline the services provided by Clonmel Corporation such as the water and sewerage and public lighting.  It is a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>I am very interested in the statement by the Minister in connection with the history of Clonmel.  Cromwell had a difficult job in trying to break the will of the people or break down walls there.  From there on the people of Clonmel are expanding.  I would like to thank the Clonmel Corporation, the Town Clerk and the County Manager, Séamus Hayes, for their interest in helping to bring the Bill to this stage.  They have done a good day's work.  It is something that the people of Clonmel and South Tipperary will benefit from in the years ahead.  I again thank the Minister.  When everything is in order, we will welcome him down to Clonmel if there is any official opening to be made.</P>

      <P>I would just like to thank the Senators who have contributed for their very constructive contribution on the Bill and indeed, for their great co-operation in expediting the passage of the Bill through the House so that it can take effect from 1 January next.  I would like to say, in support of Senator Naughten and Senator Byrne, that of course it will have great benefits for the corporation of Clonmel.  Over and above that, one has to appreciate the co-operation that existed between the two local authorities involved &mdash; Tipperary South Riding and Clonmel.  That kind of co-operation leads to expediting matters of this kind.  My thanks to all concerned.  I hope it will be to the mutual benefit of both authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to bring this Bill before Senators.  There has been a very useful and constructive debate on it in the Dáil, as a result of which a number of important amendments have been made. In order to reflect these changes fully, <Col N="1134" /> and so as to avoid possible confusion, I have had a revised Explanatory and Financial Memorandum circulated for the Seanad discussion of the Bill.</P>
      <P>One of the earliest and most enduring concerns of Irish local government has been to minimise and control, in the public interest, the impact of ruin and dilapidation on our cities, towns and villages. The various towns improvement Acts of the last century, and the public health provisions of this period also, all deal with various aspects of what we now know as urban decay and urban blight.</P>
      <P>The Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890 introduced a systematic approach to this question.  It provided for the identification of unhealthy areas and for improvement schemes to be undertaken by sanitary authorities in relation to them.  This approach was continued in the early housing legislation of the Irish State, and in a 1931 housing act we find specific reference for the first time to the concept of a derelict site.</P>
      <P>The concern of these earlier statutes was principally with the physical or health dangers to the public arising from neglected buildings.  This focus still survives in sanitary services legislation, which remains the competent code in relation to these non-amenity aspects of land dereliction.</P>
      <P>However, with the Acquisition of Derelict Sites Act, 1940 and its successor the Derelict Sites Act, 1961, legislative provisions were designed with a focus primarily on the amenity and visual aspects of land dereliction.  Derelict sites were to be cleared and rendered aesthetically acceptable not because of their immediate danger to health or safety, but because they detracted from our enjoyment, and that of tourists, of our cities, towns and villages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be wrong, of course, to give the impression that measures to deal with land dereliction are in Irish law, the sole, or even the principal, preserve of specialised derelict sites legislation.  Our physical planning system envisages, as one of its most important objectives, the preservation of amenities by planning authorities and the renewal of obsolete areas. <Col N="1135" /> It is mandatory on urban planning authorities to harness all possible effort and resources to achieve these ends.  The recently enacted urban renewal legislation is also designed to make more intensive provision for the renewal of certain urban areas, with rates and tax incentives available for this purpose.  A £2 million scheme for works of environmental upgrading in designated areas was provided in my Department's Estimate in 1989 and I am pleased to say that a further £2 million has been allocated for this purpose for 1990.</P>
    <P>In a sense, derelict sites legislation stands to the planning and urban renewal codes rather as does the Litter Act to more fundamental environmental controls on air, water and waste pollution. In theory, if development plans, planning enforcement and urban renewal incentives were doing their job, we would not have dereliction at all, just as if waste licensing and enforcement were operating perfectly, there might hardly be any need for certain provisions of the Litter Act.  Both are necessary fall-back systems to deal with imperfect situations which arise despite the existence of more ambitious legislative provisions.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, it would be wrong to build too much complexity into derelict sites or litter legislation.  Their basic purpose is to prevent and quickly remedy situations which are immediately and clearly offensive from an environmental point of view.  Longer-term measures and structures to secure amenity and development are, by and large, proper to planning, urban renewal and other environmental legislation.</P>
    <P>The Acquisition of Derelict Sites Act, 1940 enabled local authorities to secure the clearance of derelict sites but only by acquisition or the threat of acquisition. Apart from the absence of other mechanisms to tackle the problem, the definition of &ldquo;derelict site&rdquo; in that Act was also very restrictive.  The Derelict Sites Act, 1961 introduced a different approach by widening the scope of this definition and by attempting to facilitate voluntary <Col N="1136" /> clearance and improvement of objectionable lands and buildings by property owners.  This latter objective was never comprehensively fulfilled and although the 1961 Act provided also for statutory notices requiring the carrying out of works by owners, these were not availed of to any great extent.</P>
    <P>Another limitation of the 1961 Act was that it did not apply to dwellings and could only be used when the sites had actually become dangerous or injurious to health or to the amenities of the neighbourhood. In effect, the Act became relevant only when the site was totally derelict, and no mechanism existed for preventing the running down of many a fine neighbourhood.</P>
    <P>Before examining the details of the Bill, I wish very briefly to sketch the contemporary background of dereliction against which its main provisions should be viewed.</P>
    <P>Dereliction has, unfortunately, become a growing problem in many towns and cities of Ireland and is taking away from their attractiveness to the inhabitants, to tourists and to potential industrialists.  While decline and change of individual areas is an inevitable feature of the life of cities and towns, we must do all possible to mitigate its worst effects.  The problem in Dublin is extensive. A recent report prepared by Dublin Corporation in connection with the review of their development plan revealed that the total land area derelict within the canal ring was some 160 acres &mdash; or almost seven times the size of St. Stephen's Green &mdash; and that it numbered some 600 derelict sites in total.  While the urban renewal programme is now making considerable inroads into this problem, there is clearly much more work to be done.</P>
    <P>There is a need for positive and systematic action if the dereliction is to be overcome in the foreseeable future and a principal objective of the Bill will be to give local authorities a legislative framework within which to develop this. Neither is the Bill insensitive to the unfortunately substantial contribution to dereliction from publicly-owned lands. <Col N="1137" /> Accordingly, it will apply both to local authorities themselves and to all other property-owning public bodies.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to provide more effective arrangements against land dereliction.  The Bill also repeals the Derelict Sites Act, 1961, and restates its relevant provisions, thus consolidating the law on derelict sites, and providing for an annual levy on certain derelict sites in urban areas.</P>
    <P>The main new provisions of the Bill are: to require local authorities to maintain a register of all derelict sites; to place a general duty on owners and occupiers of land, including statutory bodies and State authorities, to prevent land from becoming, or from continuing to be, a derelict site; to provide improved enforcement and preventive powers for local authorities in relation to derelict sites; to give the Minister for the Environment reserve powers to direct a local authority to take enforcement action or to improve a derelict site in their own ownerships; to enable the Minister for the Environment, after consultation with the appropriate Minister, to direct any statutory body to dispose of derelict land in its possession which is not necessary for their functions; to improve the procedure for compulsory acquisition of derelict land by local authorities; to provide for an annual levy (based on market value) on certain derelict sites in urban areas; to increase penalties substantially.</P>
    <P>I now propose to comment in detail on some of the more important provisions of the new Bill.</P>
    <P>Part I contains mainly standard provisions related to the general implementation of the Bill.  I should point out that as a result of a Dáil amendment the Bill will now come into operation immediately upon its enactment.  Section 3 sets out a new and wider definition of &ldquo;derelict site&rdquo;.  This improves on the earlier definition in a number of ways.  It includes dwellings, which as I have said were excluded from previous derelict sites legislation, and it adds to the previous criteria for dereliction considerations, such as the neglected, unsightly or objectionable condition of structures.  Taken <Col N="1138" /> in conjunction with sections 10 and 11, the new definition of &ldquo;derelict site&rdquo; will also allow action to be taken against potential or incipient dereliction, as well as against actual dereliction.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill deals with the range of measures being provided to prevent and control derelict sites.  Under section 8, local authorities will be obliged, within a year of the commencement of the Act, to establish and maintain a register of all the derelict sites within their area.  This is a mandatory provision which will secure the active involvement of all local authorities in administering this Bill.  It is regrettable that only a minority of local authorities were active in administering previous derelict sites legislation.  Some 50 local authorities, in fact, took no action under the 1961 Derelict Sites Act. We cannot afford such an optional approach faced with the importance of the problem which I have earlier outlined.</P>
    <P>The register of derelict sites will clearly establish the scale of the problem of dereliction in each area.  It will facilitate suitable follow up action, and in the case of relevant urban land, it will provide a basis for applying the derelict sites levy.</P>
    <P>Section 9 establishes it as a general duty on every owner and occupier of land to ensure that their land does not become or continue to be a derelict site.  This obligation will rest not just on private landowners, but on statutory bodies and State Authorities also, that is, the full range of semi-State and public sector bodies and including Ministers of the Government, the Office of Public Works and of course local authorities themselves.</P>
    <P>Section 10 places a concurrent general duty on the local authority to use its powers so as to prevent land within its functional area from becoming or continuing to be a derelict site.</P>
    <P>Sections 11 and 12 provide for specific enforcement powers in relation to the general obligations established by sections 9 and 10.  The standard method of enforcement will be a notice from the local authority requiring specified remedial works to be undertaken.  Failure <Col N="1139" /> to carry these out will be an offence to which substantial penalties may apply.  If this notice is not complied with, then the local authority will also be empowered themselves to carry out the necessary measures and to recover the costs from the owner.  All remedial works of this kind will be exempted development for planning purposes.</P>
    <P>Section 12 gives back up powers to the Minister for the Environment to ensure proper enforcement of the Bill.  He will be able by direction to require a local authority to issue an enforcement notice in a particular case, to require them to act further on a notice already issued, or to make the local authority remedy a derelict site in their own ownership.</P>
    <P>Section 13 enables the Minister to require any statutory body to dispose of its interest in any derelict site where he is satisfied that the land is not necessary for the performance of its functions by the statutory body.  Before making any such requirement, the Minister would first consult with the appropriate Minister as regards that statutory body.  Apart from the blight issue, the holding of land by public bodies can affect the land market in urban areas by restricting the supply and encouraging overpricing of urban land.  In their report on urbanisation in Dublin &mdash; No. 55 of 1981 &mdash; the NESC commented on this aspect in the following terms: &ldquo;Local authority actions contribute to high values in that the absence of a development or sales policy for derelict sites acts to restrict supply and induce blight&rdquo;&mdash; paragraph 3.10. While urban local authorities have generally developed more active land policies since that report was written the Bill will contain a useful reserve power to ensure that land owned by public authorities is properly utilised and brought forward for development as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The definition of &ldquo;statutory body&rdquo; does not extend to Ministers of Government or the Office of Public Works.  It would be inappropriate, and inconsistent with the concept of the collective responsibility of the Government, that <Col N="1140" /> the Minister for the Environment should be in the position of issuing formal statutory directions to fellow Ministers regarding disposal of their land interests or any other matter.</P>
    <P>Sections 14 to 19 deal with the powers of local authorities to acquire derelict sites outright, whether by agreement or compulsorily.  The provisions involved differ mainly in respect of procedural detail from the 1961 Act and do not require comment at this stage.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill goes beyond previous derelict sites legislation by attempting to deal with the economics or urban dereliction.  Environmental economists point out that all pollution involves a degree of market failure, in that the polluter is encouraged to act anti-socially by the fact that he bears no financial responsibility for the external costs which he imposes, through his polluting activities, on others.</P>
    <P>This general principle finds ready application in the case of much urban dereliction.  Because for economic or other reasons, redevelopment of a site is not attractive to an owner in the short term, he has ready encouragement, reinforced by the fact that unoccupied property cannot be rated, to let his property run down.  The public rather than the individual is the loser.</P>
    <P>Various proposals have been mentioned over the past 15 or so years for some financial disincentive to be applied which would discourage owners from letting properties run down and so redress the market failure underlying much urban dereliction.  The Bill's provisions in this regard are fairly simple ones.  In all urban areas, or in such county council areas as the Minister may prescribe, an annual derelict sites levy will be imposed by local authorities on so-called urban land.  Urban land is defined in section 2 to mean any derelict site in an urban area which is not in the ownership of the State or the levying local authority, is not an occupied dwelling and is not affected by a CPO or a local authority planning reservation.</P>
    <P>All urban land will have a market value placed on it by the local authority, as <Col N="1141" /> soon as may be after it is placed in the register and at least once every five years thereafter.  A right of appeal to the Valuation Tribunal is provided.  The Minister for the Environment will prescribe a proportion of the market value of land for the purposes of the levy, which for the first year of the levy is fixed at 3 per cent.  The amount of the levy may be varied in subsequent years by the Minister either nationally or for a particular local authority area but in no case may it exceed 10 per cent.  Where the Minister proposes an increase greater than 2 per cent, the necessary regulations will have to be affirmatively approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I must emphasise that the primary purpose of the derelict sites levy is not to create additional revenues for local authorities, but to operate as an efficiency tax and secure better use of urban land. Consistently with this principle, if a site is rendered non-derelict within a particular year, the levy for that year will be refunded or waived.  A levy will become and remain until it is paid as a charge on the land.</P>
    <P>Special arrangements may also be operated, at the discretion of the local authority, for bona fide site assembly.  If the local authority agree, a developer will be able to tender a bond in the amount of the levy of up to five years instead of actually paying the levy.  Provided the full development is completed within the period involved, no levy would then be payable for that period.  Finally, provision is made for the waiver of the levy by local authorities in cases of hardship.</P>
    <P>Superficially, the structure of the new levy may appear to have much in common with site value rating, that is, a system of rating property on the basis of its optimum rather than its actual use. However, the new levy will not pressurise owners to realise the fullest economic development of derelict properties; it will only require them to make their lands aesthetically acceptable and consistent with other sound neighbouring properties. The interdepartmental committee on local finance and taxation rightly concluded in their report &mdash; PRL 89, page <Col N="1142" /> 83 &mdash; of some 20 years ago that &ldquo;ownership of land in our society does not carry with it the ability or the obligation to realise the full potential profit from that land&rdquo;.  The new levy respects this important principle.</P>
    <P>Part IV deals with prosecutions and offences.  These have in the main been designed to keep within the limits of District Court jurisdiction, given the desirability, which I mentioned earlier, of confining this Bill to fairly simple measures and procedures.  However, by virtue of a Dáil amendment, very substantial penalties are provided, on conviction on indictment for non-compliance with a notice issued by the local authority under section 11 (4).  Part V deals with miscellaneous and largely routine measures in support of the main provisions I have described.</P>
    <P>This Bill is about action on behalf of the community at large to enhance our cities and towns.  I am satisfied that it will provide a sound framework within which to advance this important work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill, particularly now that the Minister has explained it so fully in relation to the updating of the 1940 and 1961 Acts.  The Bill will be as effective as the local authorities are in carrying out their functions and as the Department will be in monitoring those functions.  It will be the duty of the Minister to introduce the regulations which will give effect to the provisions of the Bill in relation, first, to the drawing up of the register of dereliction to be completed in one year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present I would argue with the Minister that local authority environmental sections do not have the resources, the funding, the manpower or the woman-power to do this.  I will give you a microcosm as an example of county councils.  I will take Limerick County Council as an example perhaps of the 27 county councils. Within that you have one senior executive engineer, three environmental technicians &mdash; that is, a technical staff of four who really are the decision makers on the ground.  At present because of the <Col N="1143" /> emphasis on air pollution, which thankfully is not a problem in Limerick city&mdash; hopefully will not be, nor in Limerick county &mdash; monitoring needs to be carried on.  We have a tremendous emphasis on water pollution.  To take Limerick County Council as an example again, we have 11,000 farm units which have to be monitored for farm pollution.  My reason for emphasising that is that the staff, the meagre four I have talked about, have to go out and do onerous tasks already within the environmental section.  I am particularly worried as to where they are going to get the time.  Has the Minister any hope of improving resources in relation to personnel to take on the dereliction section which, with the new Bill, will mean a tremendous expenditure of time particularly in drawing up the register?</P>
    <P>The second point I would like to make is this.  I could give the other functions of that environmental section, which is waste disposal and the dispersal of dangerous wastes.  I will briefly give the administrative staff, five in all, who are to back up this &mdash; two clerk typists, a clerical officer and an assistant staff officer and a staff officer.  The housing engineers are called in to do the work of dereliction.  Taking that into account, I would hope that an excellent Bill such as this would not be looked upon as: &ldquo;Well, there is a Bill there, but at the end of the day it will not be enforced through lack of resources&rdquo;.  I will mention other things in a moment as regards increased powers to local authorities in other sections.</P>
    <P>One point I find difficult to come to terms with here is the lack of emphasis on dereliction in rural areas.  I know other speakers will particularly emphasise urban areas.  We can talk about Dublin city.  We have read and heard a lot about it.  As I said, other Senators will debate that inside out and outside in.  If we are to consider tourism as an option, I could bring the Minister to County Limerick and I can bring him through County Galway &mdash; I am sure he could bring me through it, right through the west of Ireland and give me a far better analysis <Col N="1144" /> of the area, an odyssey through it, and he might take me on a scenic route that would have no dereliction.  Perhaps the Minister could find one, but I have not been able to find one during my 26 county odyssey on the Seanad trail.  There is widespread dereliction in rural areas.  It is very difficult to pinpoint owners of houses who have emigrated a long time ago.  I would love to see those houses refurbished.  They are of fine stone and would certainly be an asset rather than the bungalow blight we have heard about in the last while.  I would ask the Minister therefore to tell us why he has not placed emphasis enough on rural dereliction.</P>
    <P>As regards the urban area, and taking Limerick as an example, I speak very much of the excellent developments that have taken place there under the urban renewal programme hand in glove with the Civic Trust.  As regards the rates and tax incentives, the Minister quoted figures in his speech.  Am I to take it that the budget next year will include funding for those developers who could not start immediately because it took them so long to actually get their hands on the sites etc or because the title deeds were lost or difficult to find or because of the slow unwieldy process of compulsory purchase order?  Is this an ongoing fund or were the tax incentives given within a particular number of years?</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to long-term road widening plans which cause great stretches to be left untended and derelict. I hope there will be a change of attitude on road planners' part and that they will not let their plans hang on for years and so add to that dereliction.</P>
    <P>There is another point I am not very clear on.  When the Minister spoke about levies was he speaking specifically about levies in urban areas?  For instance, would a town like Newcastlewest come under an urban authority where the derelict sites would be levied, because the whole thrust is towards levying derelict sites in cities like Dublin, Cork and Galway. That worries me.  It would have to be more explicitly dealt with in the Bill to ensure that small towns, large towns, etc. in our county council jurisdiction area <Col N="1145" /> would also get that levy.  I know the Minister said that the levy was more an efficiency tax and that it is not necessarily used to fund local authorities, but I hope there would be a certain amount of funding coming from those levies to local authorities in the absence of the funds they need to carry out the work that will be necessary if they are to implement this Bill.</P>
    <P>Another point I would like clarified relates to the fact that, because of lack of powers, local authorities could never successfully conclude the process of compulsory purchase orders.  I believe that in theory this Bill will speed up that process because of its legislative framework, but in practice will it take an unwieldy length of time to actually serve compulsory purchase orders and carry them through eventually?  In other words, I am looking for increased powers for local authorities in the acquisition of the derelict sites.  This is not specified in the Bill.  The Bill is grand; it is the implementation of it that concerns me.  I have to mention over and over again that it requires funding.</P>
    <P>There are a few other points I want to deal with.  The Fine Gael Party will be proposing amendments on this next week, To summarise, what I am looking for from the Minister is an answer to the fact that rural areas appear not to be taken into account when it comes to the promotion of tourism and the need for increased powers for local authorities to be able to implement this Bill.  I am pleased that the penalties proposed are included in the Bill.  I do not have the figures here but why was it necessary to increase penalties from £1,000 to £25,000?  Why did the Minister feel initially during the debate in the Dáil that small penalties would have been sufficient and then there was a big increase from £1,000 to £25,000?</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome the introduction of the Bill.  This Bill represents a very positive step towards tackling what is becoming an increasing problem in many of our cities and towns around the country.  The Minister has <Col N="1146" /> already mentioned the alarming extent of this environmental problem and the fact that Dublin alone has 160 acres of derelict sites.  This scenario is not, of course, peculiar to Dublin; it exists, unfortunately, in every city and town in the country.  Given the timely awareness of and sensitivity to environmental issues in this country and in the context of the Government's genuine commitment to improving controls and enforcing procedures in this vital area, this Bill is fully deserving of the support of this House in its spirit and its letter.</P>
      <P>The general thrust of the Bill is certainly progressive and will serve as an important vehicle in healing the gaping wounds in our environment.  Equally, it has the potential to improve the aesthetic quality of our cities.  The social and economic ramifications of such concrete measures need hardly be elaborated on; the result should be self-evident in the course of time.  I believe this Bill is a constructive initiative which will form an integral part of the overall long term progress to protect, conserve and enhance the natural and physical environment. Many of our streetscapes, particularly in Dublin's inner city, are spoiled by ugly ruins and scars.  These sites lend nothing but an impression of wanton neglect and destruction to a capital city and other cities and towns.  Dublin, as well as some of our other cities and many of our towns have extraordinary tourist potential. Corrective measures are now imperative. As the Minister said in the Dáil, the Bill will not do everything.  However, a strong economy, which we are now beginning to enjoy, along with the designated areas in many of our cities and towns, this Bill will go a long way to improving the overall situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have already signalled their objectives in terms of urban renewal programmes.  Such innovative programmes must be given full encouragement and impetus at every level.  We must all embrace the whole concept of combating decay and we must redouble our commitment to resuscitating and rejuvenating life and vigour within our areas, particularly our city areas, which <Col N="1147" /> appear to have been the victim of abject neglect.  In other words, inner city renewal, which I sincerely hope is a high political priority, will represent a great chance in enhancing and augmenting the overall quality of life for our cities.</P>
    <P>I am extremely pleased to note that this Bill addresses the despicable ruination and character of our streetscapes while specifically broadening the definition of what actually constitutes a derelict site.  It includes various structures, derelict dwellings which are invariably in an advanced state of decay.  This is one of the most positive things in the Bill. Unfortunately, many of these dwellings are deliberately allowed to deteriorate and fall into the most appalling disrepair. Frequently they are beyond redemption. One could give examples from every city and town in the country where this has happened in the past.  This is particularly insidious where we have buildings which are listed, both themselves and their interiors, which have been allowed fall into such a state that they are beyond repair.  This has happened widely in the past in Dublin and in other cities.  Unfortunately, we have to put it in the past; but, hopefully, we can save what is left of many fine buildings around Dublin and some of our other cities.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the proposal to place an onus on local authorities to compile a specific register of all derelict sites within their areas and to obligate them to take all practical steps to ensure that land is prevented from becoming derelict or, if it is already derelict, that it will be dealt with.  The vesting of enforcement powers and the introduction of severe sanctions is also a welcome departure in enabling local authorities to execute their functions in this regard.  I am happy to say that Dublin Corporation have already warned various developers and people, the worst offenders, that if and when this Bill becomes law they will be using it against them.</P>
    <P>As chairman of the Planning Committee of Dublin Corporation, I am happy to say that we have pre-empted this proposed legislation.  I am aware that <Col N="1148" /> Dublin Corporation have already begun to compile a register of derelict sites within their area.</P>
    <P>Owing to a marked buoyancy and upturn in the construction industry, combined with the attractive tax incentives as part of the urban renewal programme, there has been intense redevelopment and refurbishing in many parts of the inner city.  In the past two years Dublin Corporation have disposed of approximately 36 acres in sites and about 12 acres of such sites were located in the designated areas.  Undoubtedly, the redevelopment of these sites will greatly advance the process of urban renewal.</P>
    <P>The corporation have adopted a positive policy of disposing of sites for redevelopment in a determined effort to expedite this process.  To date this attitude has proved to be immensely successful and many prominent sites are now being utilised for high class quality developments particularly in the residential sector.  In fact apart from the Custom House Docks site there are schemes costing £140 million.  Some of these have begun, other are about to begin and some have been completed.</P>
    <P>The increased powers vested in local authorities in respect of derelict sites are to be commended, particularly the capacity to take measures to ensure that land does not become, or does not continue to be, derelict.  This provision will be a singularly powerful and effective weapon in deterring prospective developers from hatching sites, which unfortunately is an all to frequent occurence.</P>
    <P>In the main I support the broad thrust of this Bill and I welcome the amendments which the Minister has made recently.  There is, however, one aspect of the Bill which I am somewhat nervous about.  As a local authority member it is my certain knowledge that it is incredibly difficult to actually identify the owner of numerous derelict sites.  This is a particular problem in Dublin, because you do not have to register as a land owner. I would be fearful that this difficulty may pose obstacles for the implementation and efficiency of this legislation.  If this proves to be an impediment and if it <Col N="1149" /> transpires that some aspect of the legislation may become inoperable, I would suggest to the Minister that he consider the introduction of mandatory registration for landowners.  Currently registration is not compulsory.  This is highly unsatisfactory and should be regularised in due course.</P>
    <P>Once again I reiterate my unreserved support for the Minister's initiative.  It should make an outstanding contribution towards the overall improvement of our environment.  Let us hope it is one of many such proposals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>I, like the other speakers, welcome this Bill and the attempt which it is making to clean up the very many derlict sites not only here in the capital city but indeed all around the country in towns and villages and indeed in rural areas.  As a member of Dublin Corporation of 15 or 16 years standing, I am only too painfully aware of the squalid dereliction of this once fine capital city.  I became more aware during this year when I toured around every county in Ireland in connection with the Tidy Towns competition, which I headed up with Bord Fáilte.  I became aware very intimately of the problems of dereliction in the towns and villages of Ireland and of the frustration and the incapacity, of tidy towns committees particularly who are doing a magnificent job to try to clean up and tidy up, to improve the environment, plant trees, paint buildings and so on.  Invariably, you find a couple of derelict buildings dragging down a whole town or village.  That is most demoralising. The extent of the dereliction, therefore, is fairly widespread.  I hope that the Bill, with its levies and fines, will stimulate owners to get rid of these derelict sites.  I am a little doubtful but I do welcome the Minister's initiative and the thrust of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that the problem to a large extent is that this Bill is trying to deal with the results on the ground and that we have not really addressed the causes of dereliction.  Just in relation to Dublin, may I give what I consider a very brief outline, because I think it is important if <Col N="1150" /> we really are going to lick this problem once and for all.  It probably started here in the city with the slum clearance programme carried out by the corporation after the war when the slums of Dublin were among the most infamous in Europe and a very worthy policy of slum clearance was initiated.  It involved clearing out large numbers of people from the centre of the city into the suburban areas. But I believe, sadly, that that clearance programme has continued for far too long and when we should have been starting to improve conditions for people living in the city we continued moving them out to green pastures, eating up valuable agricultural areas in the county, resulting in the very heart going out of the city. This policy of giving tax incentives for new factories, new houses but never for refurbishment or for anything in the city was supported by successive Governments.</P>
    <P>There was also the problem of rent control restrictions which exacerbated the problem.  We had also a lot of official thinking and official policy.  We had it most recently with the findings of the recent URDO report.  Once again they were recommending expansion out into the peripheral areas and with very little regard for what was happening in the heart of the city and to what extent some of the 160 acres which the Minister referred to could be used to bring people back into the city.  There has been a consistent lack of tax incentives until fairly recently when some of the urban renewal schemes were introduced.  I greatly welcome them and hope they will have a real impact in improving the situation.</P>
    <P>If this problem is to be tackled fundamentally, we need to have a policy of encouraging people to come to live in the city.  We should cherish and protect in every possible way inner city communities. If we have people living in the city they will be the best insurance against dereliction and derelict sites.  They simply will not tolerate it and the general standards in the city will go up.</P>
    <P>We need to look at the city positively, to make it attractive.  We need to look at all the problems for people living in the <Col N="1151" /> city, traffic, noise, smog, etc.  Where else in Europe would we find a situation where a magnificent 18th Century square like Mountjoy Square is derelict?  There would be people paying over the odds in any other European capital to come and to live in those areas.  Why not in Dublin? It has been official policy and Government policy over the years that these areas have been allowed to become run down.</P>
    <P>The intention of the Bill is good but, as was said earlier on by one of the previous speakers, it will to a very large extent depend on the will and the enthusiasm of the local authority to implement it.  It is a fairly massive problem if we think of 160 acres of dereliction.  The manager told us recently they reckon there are about 600 derelict sites.  I ask the Minister to give the local authorities extra resources to cope with this problem.  It is no good dumping a whole extra burden on to a local authority and expecting them to do it when there is a lack of staff, lack of finance.  The Dublin City Manager in a reply on 12 June 1989 said: &ldquo;Even the carrying out of the survey will depend on the availability of the necessary staff to implement it.&rdquo;  There seems to be a suggestion there that the resources will not be available and even to get the survey completed may be a problem. What extra resources will the Minister give to the already hard-pressed local authorities to implement the provisions of this Bill?</P>
    <P>My greatest concern, however, with regard to the Bill is that the levies which may encourage the owners of private lands to do something with them and not to leave them derelict will not have any effect on the local authorities.  In the case of Dublin I have no hesitation in saying that Dublin Corporation are the major contributors to the decay and dereliction of the city.  It is for one reason only, because of the monstrous road proposals which Dublin Corporation have had in their various development plans and long before there were development plans going back 40 and 50 years.  At that time they simply drew magnificent lines on a <Col N="1152" /> map, an engineer's dream, &ldquo;this is where we want the roads to go&rdquo; and nobody shouted &ldquo;stop.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Most of these road plans have not been implemented.  They have a policy where they allow the areas to go &ldquo;soft&rdquo;.  I never quite know what soft means but it is a great word with planners and engineers. Clanbrassil Street is a classic example. Road lines were put there, 20, 30, 40 years ago; the area goes soft and when it is in such a decayed, derelict condition they come at that stage to the members of the local authority and ask &ldquo;Will we go ahead and implement the road plan?&rdquo; If there is any hesitation by the local authority members to agree, they take them out on a tour so they can see with their own eyes the decay, the rats, the dereliction and of course, they say &ldquo;what is the point of holding on to this&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>The communities of Dublin have been decimated by these road proposals.  The saddest thing of all is that it is Dublin Corporation, who are entrusted with the care of the city, whose job it should be to look after and conserve the city, who have been the greatest offenders.  I say it as a member of a local authority for 16 years, and I say it with great regret and very much with a red face.  I have done my best during my period there to get them to change their policies.</P>
    <P>The worst thing of all is that there is no streetscape.  This, Minister, is the nub of the problem.  There is no streetscape put back, there is no streetscape reinstated, so when they widen a road the gables of buildings and the sides of buildings that were never supposed to be seen are left bare.  The actual streetscape has gone and there is no land reservation to provide a streetscape.  That is the nub of the problem with regard to the city of Dublin.</P>
    <P>There are, of course many derelict sites still in private hands but they are on the line of long-term road proposals and, therefore, there is no incentive for the owner of these buildings or sites to do anything with them.  They know that in the long run if the corporation go ahead with their plans these sites or buildings <Col N="1153" /> will be purchased.  There may be a Compulsory Purchase Order issued by the local authority.  What incentive is there for a private owner of such a building or land to do anything with it?  The local authority are the cause of the dereliction but the building may still be privately owned.  Is that private owner expected to pay the levy?  Is he expected to put good money into what is quite uneconomic because he knows that one day it will probably be the subject of a Compulsory Purchase Order.</P>
    <P>There were in the 1980 development plan no fewer than 61 roads in the city of Dublin to be widened during the five years of the plan, that would be 1980 to 1985.  Now, of course, we are nearly ten years from that.  There were no less than 106 roads to be widened under the long-term plan.  This is a massive number of roads in the context of the city of Dublin. It is true that many of these may be dropped.  They are being dropped in the draft plan, they may be dropped in the development plan but basically the damage is done.</P>
    <P>One has only got to look at a place like the Liffey Quays to see what we are talking about.  I begged the corporation in 1980, the night they were adopting the development plan, to drop the 18 long-term road proposals for the Liffey Quays. I was told by the engineer, &ldquo;Alderman Hederman is misleading the council&rdquo; which, of course, meant &ldquo;Alderman Hederman is telling lies&rdquo;&mdash; it is nice way of saying it.  They said, &ldquo;We have no proposals to widen the quays&rdquo;.  They had long-term proposals.  Their attitude was: &ldquo;We will not go out and initiate it but we will not let anybody else do anything.  We will wait until perhaps there is a fire in a building or until a developer comes in wanting to develop and then we will tell him that he has to wait&rdquo;.  At least if Dublin Corporation go out and do the work and implement the road proposals something happens but in the long-term proposals it simply ends up in dereliction. The quays are a classic example of this.</P>
    <P>When the Bill was before the Dáil Deputy Alan Shatter moved an amendment. I know this is not the day to discuss <Col N="1154" /> details but this is the main thrust of my contribution to date.  This amendment was:</P>
    <P>to direct the local authority to take such steps as may be necessary so as to ensure that a development objective or objectives for the purpose of reserving land for roads or parking places or for any of the purposes of reserving or preserving lands indicated in Part IV of the Third Schedule of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, does not result in any land subject to any such development objective becoming or continuing to be a derelict site.</P>
    <P>Unless something along those lines is implemented this Bill will be virtually useless as far as Dublin is concerned.  The Minister, in response, replied:</P>
    <P>An interesting remark was made about grandiose road plans and the possibility of those plans creating der-election. I would always have regarded reservations for road development as a normal procedure necessary for proper planning and future infrastructural development.</P>
    <P>If that is the Minister's view, that is really saying that he considers that the dereliction of this city, which has been brought about by the roads is perfectly legitimate.  I simply cannot accept that.</P>
    <P>The Minister is a representative for the Mayo area.  I am sure there is not a bog or boreen in Mayo that he does not know like the back of his hand.  I am sure there is not a pothole in a road there that he is not familiar with.  It is quite unreasonable to expect the Minister to be that familiar with the city of Dublin.  The Minister for the Environment has an important responsibility.  I would like to ask him, if he can spare 35 or 40 minutes one day, to allow me to take him on a tour of the city.  I am afraid we will have to call it a tour of the dereliction of the city.  We will not travel in the Minister's state car or on my bicycle; we will go on the top of the Bus Éireann open bus because it is really from that vantage point that the <Col N="1155" /> Minister would have a bird's eye view of what I am talking about.</P>
    <P>Perhaps we could start at the corner of Lower Leeson Street, a magnificent street scape which has been untouched by the depredations of roads engineers, there has been no road widening.  We could proceed along St. Stephen's Green as far as Cuffe Street.  There the Minister will see the beginning of the dereliction on the very corner of Cuffe Street and Harcourt Street which is a prime area in the city where tourists arrive to shop.  The Minister will see where road widening was implemented in Cuffe Street, with the result that there are exposed fireplaces, corrugated iron shacks at the back, and so on.  It is an unbelievable sight and it gets worse and worse as one proceeds.  On the other side, the back of the flats can be seen where the Winter Garden Palace once stood.  There are unsightly backs of buildings which were never supposed to be viewed by the public.  We come to the next corner where the Good Times Bar was only recently demolished.  There is simply no corner left, it is just a squalid, visually unattractive area.  The pub on the other corner is still there.</P>
    <P>We then proceed to Charlemont Street and see what has been done to the entire Charlemont Street, Charlotte Street and Harcourt Street area.  It is 40 years since those plans have been implemented.  If the Harcourt Street line, where there was very good public transport, had not been closed we would never have to do to the Charlemont Street area what we are proposing to do now.  For the whole of the Camden Street, Redmonds Hill, Aungier Street area there is another long-term road proposal which the corporation now say they may drop.  Here, again, we see the blight of the roads on the city.</P>
    <P>We probably would not have time to go to Clanbrassil Street.  We continue into Kevin Street, turn right into Patrick Street, and into High Street.  We could show the Minister before and after photographs so that he could get some idea of how magnificant that area was before all the road widening took place.  We would <Col N="1156" /> then proceed down into the wastelands of Bridge Street which is unbelievable. In that area the Brazen Head used to have a lovely entrance but the whole area is now unbelievably squalid.  We approach the Quays and the Minister would see at first hand what I am talking about.  The problem is when one drives quickly through the city these things are not noticed.  I am proposing that we start at the beginning at the massive dereliction caused by the roads and go through until we arrive at Senator Norris's area in the north side, to Summerhill, to see the environment the people are living in there after the four lane dual carriageway.  That is causing the derelection of the city.  If the Minister thinks that is normal procedure and that that is what is correct and proper, I do not give this Derelict Sites Bill much hope of solving the problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister says the local authority can prevent land becoming or continuing to be a derelict site but can we compel them to develop?  Unless we can compel them to develop, unless we can compel them to reinstate a streetscape I do not think we will achieve very much.  That is what is important and that is the problem. On the roads there is no provision left for the reinstatement of the streetscapes.</P>
    <P>I am glad sections have been introduced with regard to directing statutory bodies to dispose of the derelict sites. The corporation are aware of many of the statutory bodies behaving outrageously in this regard.  My colleague, Senator Norris, referred a week ago to the conduct of the VEC and what they have done in Parnell Square, North Great George's Street and in other places.  It is simply unbelievable and I would like to think that it is something over which we will have more clout.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention the Office of Public Works.  In this morning's paper there was a letter about the properties in Upper Merrion Street.  They are owned by the Office of Public Works and are being allowed to fall into decay and dereliction. I really want to know, will we be able to compel an owner to restore a building or will we simply be able to <Col N="1157" /> tell him to go in and clean it up?  Is the Minister saying we will continue to have derelict sites but they will be clean derelict sites instead of dirty derelict sites? That seems to be the thrust of this Bill.</P>
    <P>There is one other aspect in section 12 (6) on exempted development I am worried about.  It is at the moment possible for the owner of a listed building to allow it to deteriorate and fall into dereliction.  We, as a local authority, have no power to force that owner to restore the building.  The owner can go to the local authority and if the building gets bad enough under the Dangerous Buildings Act he can seek to get the corporation to compel him to do something. That means by the back door he gets permission to knock it down.  I want to know, in view of the fact that any works carried out under this Bill are exempted development, will the same thing happen?  Will it facilitate some unscrupulous owners to be able to knock down buildings, perhaps listed buildings or early 18th century buildings?  Can the local authority go in and carry out restoration work on a building and charge that against the property?  I see the Minister nodding his head but I would like to have a more positive reply.  I will leave the rest of my remarks until the next stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to congratulate the Minister for this excellent and comperhensive Derelict Sites Bill.  It is long overdue.  This is a Bill to prevent land becoming a derelict site, to enable local authorities to require owners or occupiers of derelict sites to take measures, to acquire derelict sites by compulsory order, to establish a register of derelict sites and to enable the Minister to give directions in relation to derelict sites. This Bill will be welcomed by all local authorities and, in particular, Bord Fáilte.  As one who has been involved in tourism for many years especially in Kerry I am aware of the problem of derelict sites throughout the county.  While the local authority have made various efforts over the years they have failed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Had this legislation been in the Statute <Col N="1158" /> Book before now we would have far fewer shabby buildings, many of which have been lying derelict for years.  Many of our excellent Tidy Town Committees have made very serious efforts over a long period of time to rid their towns of these eyesores but their efforts in many cases failed.  However, with this legislation they will now have the support they have been seeking and in all cases the full backing of the local authority.  There is no doubt that one of our greatest potentials for job creation is tourism as our countryside is the envy of many nations. Our urban and rural environment, lakes and landscapes and beautiful, pollution free beaches encourage many visitors to our country.  These visitors are the best ambassadors we have to boost our tourist trade.</P>
    <P>The Bill gives much needed power to local authorities.  These provisions will enable them to deal with offenders immediately.  Hopefully, the Bill will help to eliminate the many black spots in our cities, towns and villages and throughout the country.  A minority of unscrupulous developers have in the past not co-operated but, thankfully, under this legislation they have no choice.  We have seen where roofs were removed in the guise of public safety, and if it were a commercial property to have it relisted for a reduced valuation.  This also has the effect of reducing property values in the area.  This has subtly spread to other property within that particular area.</P>
    <P>Local authorities now have the power to eliminate this problem.  Under section 8 every local authority shall, within one year after the commencement of this Act, establish and thereafter maintain a register to be known as &ldquo;the derelict sites register.&rdquo;  The Minister has not indicated how that list should be compiled.  That is very important.  Subsection (2) states the local authority must give notice to any owner and occupier of their intention to include a site on the register and may consider any representations any owner or occupier may make in writing before deciding to include the site.  Efforts to put a stay on this, should not be entertained by the local authorities because if any <Col N="1159" /> effort is made to stall this particular register, the whole purpose of the Bill will have failed.</P>
    <P>The local authority must also send a copy of the register to the Minister on request.  Here again, I hope the Minister will insist on getting this register on a yearly basis.  There is a duty placed on the local authority to take all reasonable steps to ensure that any land does not become or continue to be derelict.  It would mean that a particular individual, especially within the planning section, should be assigned to this work with the co-operation of the engineers throughout the various districts.</P>
    <P>In section 1 the local authority have the power to prevent land becoming or continuing to be a derelict site by serving notice on the owner, specifying steps to be taken by the owner to prevent the site being derelict.  These steps should be set out in detail, without fear of criticism. Here again there will be political interference &mdash; possibly we are all responsible for that &mdash; but there should be no deviation from that principle.  The local authority may take steps to effect the terms of the notice to prevent the site being derelict.  There is a period of time mentioned, and that should be the minimum time.</P>
    <P>Under section 14 a local authority may acquire by agreement or compulsory order any derelict sites in their area.  The Bills sets out the procedure to follow in acquiring the land and, where this has been followed, may make a vesting order to acquire the site.  Then there is the question of the value of the property or interest held on it.  How is it proposed to decide on the actual value or the market value?  Will it be by arbitration?</P>
    <P>Under section 20 the local authority may use a site acquired for any purpose connected with their functions.  If they do not want the site, they may dispose of it and let it.  Will this be a managerial function or will the members of the local authority have an input?  Section 22 states that the local authority shall determine the market value of urban land, enter it in the register and update its value every <Col N="1160" /> five years.  The owner of the property shall be served with a notice informing him of the decided valuation and he may appeal to the valuation tribunal within 28 days of the notice.</P>
    <P>Section 31 states that every sum the local authority receive for the sale or the lease of a derelict site acquired by them shall be used by them with the Minister's consent in such manner as they think proper.  I hope the Minister will decide that the many local bodies who have shown an interest over the years, especially the various tidy town committees who are starved for funding, will qualify for some of this.</P>
    <P>The Minister may direct a local authority to serve a notice under section 11 in relation to a derelict site which is included in the register or direct a local authority to take such steps as he considers reasonable to give effect to the terms of the notice served under section 11.  I certainly welcome this because the statutory bodies and local authorities hold sites.  I will say here without fear of contradiction, that this does not apply to Kerry.  During my recent Seanad campaign I saw a number of sites throughout the country, and when I inquired I was told that such a site was owned by a local authority.  This is an absolute disgrace and I hope the Minister will take this up.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to consider creating an incentive for the development of derelict sites by way of special tax concessions, and further, ten year remission on rates.  This would be complementary to the present Bill and would also lead to much needed job creation. In the past many people who had decided to develop derelict sites which had a nominal value found that no sooner had they developed them &mdash; or even before they were fully developed &mdash; than they were listed by the local authority and valued for the coming year.  I appeal to the Minister to take steps to rectify this situation because at the moment &mdash; and this applies to all local authorities &mdash; in County Kerry only 12 per cent of the people pay rates, and every chance the local authority get, as soon as any <Col N="1161" /> improvements are carried out on a property &mdash; they have them listed by 15 December each year.  Something has to be done about this.  Certainly where there has been a development of a derelict site, some incentive should be given.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the recently enacted urban renewal legislation and the extension of same to many urban areas. I have seen the benefits of this scheme, especially in my home town of Tralee where, as a result of this Bill, we now have a very modern conference centre, which opened in August 1988.  Already we have had close on 50 top conferences, something we would not have had but for the urban renewal scheme.  I thank the Minister for this.  Would the Minister consider extending the provisions under the urban renewal legislation to derelict site development?  This would be an added incentive.</P>
    <P>I wish to congratulate the Minister. Only good will come from the Bill.  At this time, world attention is focused on the quality of our environment and it is timely that such a Bill should come onto our Statute Book.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to contribute to the Second Stage on this measure.  I notice that practically all the previous speakers warmly welcomed the measure.  Mine is a welcome with conditions.  I am conscious of the fact that the Minister we have with us this evening has the capacity for assuring and reassuring legislators who might be doubtful about certain aspects of legislation, that their fears are unfounded.  If that is possible at the end of the Second Stage, then I will welcome that.</P>
      <P>I accept the objectives of the Bill.  I accept the necessity of dealing with the problems that exist, but my reservations - I will stick with these &mdash; are that the Bill applies throughout rural Ireland as well as the towns and cities.  There are powers within that Bill that have not been discussed as much as they should, because they may cause problems.  They might be problems of interpretation, but if they are problems of enforcement, then we could have difficulties in rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1162" /> There are enough of my colleagues here to deal adequately with the Dublin situation and both here and in the other House it largely monopolised the discussion on this measure.  I am sure there is justification for that.  I do not represent the city, I do not represent any of the other cities.  I could say, though, that I represent a large town in the south west of Ireland.  Those who have firsthand knowledge are the people best equipped to deal with the problems that exist in the towns and cities.</P>
    <P>As somebody who travels to this city and, indeed, to other cities.  I am conscious there is dereliction there.  I am also conscious of the fact that much of it is the result of inadequate powers to deal with it.  I am also conscious that a certain amount of it is the outcome of the activities of speculators and so forth.  Many of the problems have been created by these people and it is necessary that powers exist to deal with that position as it affects Dublin and other large centres of population. The powers intended to be given to local authorities are very substantial powers: the power to prepare a register of derelict sites; the power to serve notice on the owners and occupiers; in particular, the power to charge a levy.  Some of my colleagues express reservations as to whether there will be the financial wherewithal for local authorities to operate the powers under this legislation. They will have the necessary funding because of the power to levy charges on derelict property.  This will generate its own income and will in part go to financing the operation of the Act when it is on the Statute Book.  There is also the additional power, very necessary in the centres of population, to acquire property when everything else has failed, to remove the dereliction from the site so that it will be acceptable in the locality concerned.  All that is necessary in centres of population is to clean up the mess and to improve their appearance and image.</P>
    <P>Briefly, I want to refer to a provision in the Bill which extends the power of local authorities to deal more effectively <Col N="1163" /> with the litter problem.  I was here in 1981 when the Litter Bill was enacted and we were reassured at the time that there was adequate power to deal with the litter problem in the countryside and in towns and so on.  Events have proved that that has not been the case.  In my local authority area I have been informed by the manager that there is a grey area where proof is concerned in relation to the implementation of that legislation.  I welcome the fact that in this measure the Minister is attempting to resolve the problems.  At least there will be greater powers to deal with them.</P>
    <P>I understood the Minister to say that the levy would have application in urban areas only.  He is neither nodding nor responding otherwise to that.  I assume that at the conclusion of the debate he will do so.  I was not sure as to whether the levy would apply in rural areas.  I understand from the Minister's speech that that may not be the case.</P>
    <P>One final point in relation to urban decay: a very useful job has been done in many of our town by Tidy Towns committees. It has been a great community operation.  It has lifted the appearance, the image and the atmosphere in many towns.  In many others, unfortunately, the worth-while community effort has been set at nought by the presence of derelict sites and neglected areas.  What will emerge from this legislation will assist many of these community-based organisations who have done so much to improve the visual aspect of their local town or community.</P>
    <P>I want to turn now to those parts of the measure that are causing me some concern.  I refer first to what I would describe as rural decay.  This is a very serious matter for which there are many reasons.  Perhaps some of the responsibility rests with many of us in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Much of the rural decay consists of the remains of what were once family homesteads.  They are widespread in many parts of the countryside. It has to be accepted that there is an emotional attachment to them by their former owners.  It is undying ambition on <Col N="1164" /> the part of those who have emigrated to return and to reconstruct and to live once again in their original homestead.  It is in that connection that we could have difficulties in relation to the power that local authorities are being given in the Bill, that is, the power when all else has failed, when contact is impossible to establish and so on, compulsorily to acquire the site, to move in and eliminate these remains.  That is a negative approach.  I would prefer that consideration be given to a positive approach.  There were positive measures not so many years ago where grants were available in relation to the restoration of pre-1940 houses.  That is the positive way to approach this difficulty in many areas.</P>
    <P>That is not the sum total of my reservations. This is probably a Committee Stage point but, nonetheless as the Minister has referred to it, I want to raise it here also.  Section 3 defines a derelict site as meaning any land which detracts, or is likely to detract, to a material degree from the amenity, character or appearance of land in the neighbourhood of the land in question.  Unquestionably that refers not to derelict sites but to the fields of rural Ireland.  Land is land and you cannot depart from that.</P>
    <P>In the Minister's own constituency just as in my own, when we refer to rural homesteads we are on familiar ground, we know what is involved and what we are talking about.  We also know that attached to the remains of these homesteads are fields or areas of land.  Who defines the measure of neglect that constitutes dereliction in these fields?  Some of the people I am now about to refer to do a very worthwhile job in regard to the environment, clean air and a clean countryside but some of them even with the best intentions in the world, are inclined to go a little bit over the top. Their interpretation of neglected land becoming derelict might be slightly different from the Minister's or mine.  Nonetheless, if they could convince a bureaucrat in the local authority that their interpretation was correct, let us visualise for a moment the difficulties that could be created.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1165" /> I said at the beginning I had reservations and I wish to point them out. The Minister &mdash; and I am tying this in with the observations I am making &mdash; spoke about potential or incipient dereliction. That is a very widespread, very general provision.  In my view, it is too widespread and too dangerous to allow it to stand without further interpretation.  I said earlier, as indeed did other Senators, that some of the dereliction in towns and cities is the result of speculators &mdash; and this is a term I dislike using &mdash; acquiring property with the sure expectation of realising a windfall profit a few years later.  That does not happen in rural areas.  Therefore, if there is neglect or dereliction in rural areas, the likelihood is that it has been caused through social and economic circumstances.  Those circumstances should be a factor that is measured by the appropriate authority, be it the elected members, as Senator Foley suggested, or the executive of the local authority.  The conditions that caused the dereliction or neglect should be taken into account when dealing with the problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his reply to the Second Stage debate in the Dáil, left nobody in any doubt about the application of this Bill to empty rural homesteads if I might put it that way.  He said &mdash; and I quote from his Second Stage Dáil speech: &ldquo;I will highlight the need in my instructions to local authorities.&rdquo;  There will be the difficulties which I have referred to and I accept the need to deal with them.  I am not for a moment advocating that rural Ireland should be derelict or neglected or that unsightly ruins should remain on the landscape but I am putting to the Minister of State who is present now, that there is a positive way of dealing with derelict rural homesteads.</P>
    <P>I spoke of the pre-1940 house reconstruction grants.  That is a more suitable way to go about it, a way that will get a far better response than compulsion, which to me is negative.  Involuntary emigration is at the root of some of the rural <Col N="1166" /> dereliction I am talking about.  Something similar to the pre-1940 grant scheme should be considered as an incentive to restore and maintain these homesteads. That would be a positive road to take.  I know one townland where the key has been turned on four bungalows that are practically new, where entire families have left and are in the UK, the USA and maybe Australia.  They are not derelict at present but in ten or 15 years they will deteriorate.  The families concerned, because of economic circumstances &mdash; maybe the very fact of incurring the cost of these new bungalows &mdash; had to leave the country.  Unless we are aware of the problem I am referring to, I can visualise a situation where these bungalows could in somebody's interpretation, become derelict sites ten years in the future.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect to the measure that I am a little bit uncertain about that is, the application of the measure to the property of statutory bodies, local authorities and so on.  My reading of the Bill is that it does have application here.  The Minister, on the other hand, says that it would be entirely inappropriate that he should direct his colleagues in Cabinet as to what they should do.  I am sure that there is a way of reconciling that and clearing the air and a response to the following four questions would clear the air as far as I am concerned.</P>
    <P>Will the Bill have application to CIE property?  Some of the eyesores of the countryside are abandoned tracks and station-houses.  For example, will the Bill have application to the wrecks of abandoned boats in many of the most scenic inlets around our coasts?  Will the Bill have application to what remains of mines from which was extracted some of the finest wealth of this country with little or no benefit to the people of this island and which have been left as unacceptable eyesores?  Again, in relation to mining, what are the Ministers' thoughts about resolving that situation.  My fourth point is, will the Bill have application to Bord na Móna because, again, some of the <Col N="1167" /> activities of Bord na Móna have not been conducive to leaving the countryside in an acceptable state?</P>
    <P>I dwelt on the reservations and worries I had in relation to the Bill.  I do not wish for a moment to suggest that there is no value in the measure to the areas to which it applies.  I am interested in the appearance of the countryside including our towns and villages, and I accept that there has been deterioration there but I am making the point that the deterioration in many cases is due to social and economic circumstances.  I accept the need to eliminate what is, in many cases, a depressing aspect.  There is another query but I think I will leave it until Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The final point I want to make is in relation to land owned and acquired by local authorities for road widening purposes and left in a most neglected state over the years.  I hope and expect that the application of this Bill will eliminate these eyesores which in many cases have been created by local authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EddieBohan" hpid="Mr. Bohan Mr. Bohan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bohan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is easy to be simplistic about the reasons for dereliction as they are many and complex.  A site may become derelict because of legal problems on the death of the owner.  A building may become ruinous because of its age and the effect of matters such as dry rot.  The cost of putting the defects right, if they can be put right, may be beyond the capacity of the owner.  A site may be derelict but this may be because it is part of a larger site which is being developed, perhaps a desirable development, or it may be that a site is vacant because funding is not available to develop it.  It may simply be that the owner is holding on to the site until market conditions improve.  This is not an exhaustive list of all the reasons properties are unused, but I do want to make the point that the fact that lands lie unused or derelict can arise from a complex set of different circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The best thing that can be done to <Col N="1168" /> reduce the number of derelict sites is to get these developed by creating economic circumstances which generate confidence among investors.  Similarly, there is a good case to give advantage by way of tax incentives <i>et cetera</i> to developments in the more difficult or unattractive areas. The raising of the level of the surrounding environment is a great stimulant.</P>
    <P>Those of us living in Dublin have seen over the past few years how these factors have operated and on the environmental side there has been a tremendous improvement in the inner city area to main shopping streets, the mushrooming of pieces of sculpture and trees and the investment by businessmen in improving and floodlighting their premises.  All of these have contributed markedly towards making everybody who lives or works in Dublin more proud of the city.  Is there a more attractive street in Europe than Grafton Street?  The effects of the favourable economic conditions, the improvements I have mentioned and the tax incentives can be seen in the number of new developments which are springing up in Dublin's inner city.  I went to the trouble of asking the corporation if they had any development sites along the Liffey.  Their answer was that virtually all the properties which they own have been disposed of for development and the remaining small area is under negotiation.</P>
    <P>I have noticed a recent report that the capital value of the developments taking place, or planned for sites in the designated areas of Dublin, is well in excess of £300 million.  This is probably the most practical example of the effects of the factors I have mentioned on sites heretofore derelict, as most of them were.  In addition to being a tribute to the corporation, this is also a tribute to the economic circumstances which have brought about this massive investment.</P>
    <P>Having said all that, it seems that there are cases where people are in possession of sites which are eyesores and which they seem to be prepared to do nothing <Col N="1169" /> about.  Perhaps they intend to hold them and hope that their nuisance value, or demands for development of adjoining properties, will eventually lead to a better price.  In cases like that, I hope local authorities and the Minister in exercising his powers of direction under the Bill, will pay particular attention to them when the Bill is enacted.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very welcome Bill, although I have some hesitations of a technical nature about it.  I have no doubt about the intention of the Bill. Generally speaking I have some reservations about the intentions as I may interpret them in a slightly sinister fashion but I am sure the Minister will be able to reassure me on this.</P>
      <P>I would like to say what a pleasure it is to take part in a debate in which the Minister, Deputy Flynn, and the Minister of State, Deputy Connolly, are involved, because they are two people who are usually so much in command of the brief that they are able to go outside the drafted script and answer &mdash; with the assistance, of course, of their colleagues &mdash; some of the questions that are put at this stage of a Bill.  I sincerely hope that this will be the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to make some general prefatory remarks referring to the general connotation of the Bill and to some of the previous speeches, and then to look in succession at three documents I have before me.  First, the Minister's speech itself, then the explanatory memorandum to the Bill and then apply what I understand from these two documents to the third, which is the Bill itself.  I speak, not from a position of authority &mdash; because I am not a parliamentary draftsman, I am not an architect, I am not a surveyor &mdash; but in a sense I am, I hope, a gifted amateur.  I may have isolated problems from my direct practical experience of rehabilitation within the inner city, and I speak particularly of derelict sites and buildings within the <Col N="1170" /> inner city rather than land, which was a subject extensively explored by one of the previous speakers.  Perhaps my direct experience may have unearthed some problems which I hope the Minister, or Ministers, will be able to address when the Bill comes before the House.</P>
    <P>This is a welcome and innovative step. The intention is clearly to give some kind of teeth to existing legislation, which is notoriously weak and under which it is quite impossible to do anything to discourage the increasing dereliction of our cities, and, as the Minister I am sure is aware, even the limited powers that existed up until about 1963 for the corporation to go in and do remedial works, were removed in or about 1963 by amendments to Local Government Acts.  That is something that may be addressed by the Bill.</P>
    <P>Having paid a certain tribute to the two Ministers involved, I would like, to say on this occasion, without I hope being patronising &mdash; because I am sure it is possible to patronise a distinguished Member of this House who is a former Lord Mayor of Dublin &mdash; how very impressed indeed I was by the speech of my colleague, Alderman Carmencita Hederman, who also speaks from direct experience of restoration work, in this instance on the south inner city.  It was a very carefully thought out, very concise and very direct contribution to the debate, one I think that is valuable and with most of what she said I heartily agreed and I will want to amplify some of those points.</P>
    <P>However, with regard to the Minister, I endorse very much the suggestion that the Minister may like to come on a brief tour &mdash; and I will certainly take up Senator Hederman's invitation myself to participate in this and perhaps we can share the city between south and north of the Liffey.  However, I am aware of the Minister's good intentions in this regard.  I remember very early in his appointment to the Department of the <Col N="1171" /> Environment under a previous Administration he made it perfectly clear that he intended to be a Minister for the Environment not just for, or indeed from, the rural areas, from the country, but also very much a Minister for Dublin, and he underlined at that time the fact that he, as a public representative, had lived for nearly ten years in the area of Dublin between the two canals and frequently walked around the city to have a look at what was going on there in terms of dereliction.  So, he may, in fact, know quite a considerable amount about it.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the absence of tax breaks which are important.  They are not directly dealt with in this Bill and there is no reason they should be but since they were referred to, perhaps I might refer to them myself because I like to be positive even about Fianna Fáil, and say that some small move was made in this direction in the last budget.  A beginning was made there where three and a half pages of amendments were written into the budget, giving for the first time tax incentives to those who renew, rehabilitate or refurbish houses of artistic, historical or cultural importance which also happen to fall within the designated areas.  That is a welcome indication, as is this Bill, that the Government have decided it is time something should be done about this problem.  It was done in response to popular demand.  It is not something that originated instinctually with politicians.</P>
    <P>Senator Hederman referred to the ERDO report.  There is no question of doubt that the Government were fully committed to the ERDO report; in fact, several Governments were, and what actually derailed it was the Dublin crisis conference that was held, the second mass meeting of which was cunningly timed to coincide with an election.  On that occasion we had both the Taoiseach and the Leader of the Opposition in attendance to hear the outrage of the risen people of Dublin at this appalling <Col N="1172" /> example of reactive planning without any direct intervention by the State to stem the flow from the inner city, to plan for ribbon development all along the coast and so on.  The response to the ERDO report and its subsequent dropping is an important indicator of change, but of change that comes from the bottom up, as I think the sensitivity towards the problems of the city of Dublin in particular have also come.</P>
    <P>Turning directly to the Minister's speech I note in his introduction that he refers to the debate in the Dáil, although he has not shown any real willingness to take on board amendments that were proposed in the Dáil, and I hope that perhaps if these are substantially reinforced in the Seanad, he will perhaps think again.</P>
    <P>There are a number of points that worry me with regard to the limitations of the Bill as I understand them but I could possibly be wrong on this.  First, and this is not really directly adverted to in the Minister's speech, I see from learned comment in the newspapers that, for example, the proliferation of car parks within the city is not brought under the control of the civic authorities by this Bill.  In other words, where an area has been cleared, levelled, tarmac surfaced and fenced for use as a public car park, this Bill will in fact not have any legal effect.  I wonder if this is the case, because car parks are not an adornment to the city.  In my opinion there are far too many privately operated car parks which can be a very considerable eyesore, as well as being a major collecting point for rubbish during the day and an assembly point for drunkards and undesirables at night.  The kind of fencing that is placed around them does not inhibit their use either as assembly points or, not to put too fine an edge on it, as public lavatories late at night.  Often these places are not just unpleasant and unseemly to look at but they actually constitute a considerable health risk.</P>
    <P>In the section where the Minister deals <Col N="1173" /> with the history of the derelict sites code he cites the Acquisition of Derelict Sites Act, 1940, which enabled local authorities to secure the clearance of derelict sites by acquisition or by the threat of acquisition.  This is an interesting beginning, but if one looks at the situation in Dublin throughout the 1940s when there was a major period of slum clearance, one is struck by the fact that this instrument was directed against the 18th century core of the city.  I remember, for example, in particular, the way in which an enormous swathe was cut, beginning in about 1949 with Dominick Street through some of the finest aspects of our architectural heritage.</P>
    <P>I have to agree with Senator Hederman when she says that one of the problems with this Bill is that there can be no question of doubt that the principal culprit in the city of Dublin is the local authority itself.  Dublin Corporation has under a number of headings, created the vast preponderance of urban blight in this city.  I say this, not intending to cause any bitterness, but simply to place on record what is the fact.  First, as happened in Dominick Street where a very important street was levelled and a totally unsympathetic acontextual local authority development of housing was set in place instead of the 18th century buildings, Gardiner Street, and Sean MacDermott Street, were all areas which were blighted and destroyed by clumsy and ill-advised attempts to destroy the core of the city and replace it by the very necessary development of local authority housing. I have to say that although I am critical of Dublin Corporation, I accept absolutely that if an opposition is raised between buildings on the one hand and people on the other, in the mind of the ordinary citizen of this country there is no question of doubt that the rights of people to have a decent environment, a decent place to live, will always be upheld and that is quite proper.  Both Ministers and their advisers are subtle enough to understand <Col N="1174" /> that in other countries these two objectives have not been found to be in conflict and they can be resolved within the scope of public policy.</P>
    <P>I also have to join with other Senators who pointed to the devastation caused by what is known as motorway blight. Again, we isolate the motor car as a principal enemy of the city.  What a pity we do not learn from the experience of other cities.  Urban planning and inner city redevelopment is one area in which I am profoundly glad that in some aspects at least we are ten years behind most of the continental cities because we at least had the opportunity to learn from them but we show no sign of doing so at all.  I could list 20 major cities in Europe who wish they had the opportunity to undo their road development of the 1960s and yet here we are in Dublin refusing to learn from their mistakes.</P>
    <P>I remember, as will the Minister who is involved with the environment, I am sure, that a number of us were issuing warnings in the 1970s when the back boiler grants were being introduced we predicted that there was going to be a problem.  Other cities had found this and yet they went helter-skelter and created the situation that we have got with regard to smog, despite the warnings that were given.  Now, of course, everybody is falling over backwards to try and do something and all are being super-virtuous about the situation.</P>
    <P>I would like to put it to the Minister that with regard to motorway blight, and this kind of dereliction which was detailed by Senator Hederman, we still have some opportunity to do something.  It is for this reason that I, and Senator Hederman, are concerned at section 2 (1) where there is the specific exclusion of local authorities from the operation of this Bill:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;urban land&rdquo; means a derelict site in an urban area which has been entered on the register but does not include any occupied dwelling or land owned by a State authority or by the local authority <Col N="1175" /> in whose functional area the land is situated or land in relation to which ...(b) a development objective exists for the purpose of reserving the land for roads or parking places or for any of the purposes of reserving or preserving land indicated in Part IV of the Third Schedule to the Local Government Planning and Development Act, 1963.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that this clause is contained because it simply allows irresponsible local authorities to continue with the process of blighting which has been a notable feature of this city.</P>
    <P>Again, reference was made to the absence, for example, of things that any ordinary person can notice, the absence of corners, the absence of streetscapes, simply because these have been obliterated in the pursuit of road development. On this subject I am not going to be tedious because I am sure the Minister is well aware of the very valuable work done in a series of intensively researched articles by <i>The Irish Times</i> environmental correspondent, Frank McDonald.</P>
    <P>The Minister continued by referring to the Derelict Sites Act, 1961, which widened the scope of original definitions by attempting to facilitate voluntary clearance and improvement of objectionable lands and buildings by property owners.  I am not sure that it actually succeeded in doing anything like that, nor am I convinced, for some technical reason that I will come to later, that this Bill actually manages to go very much further.  One of the reasons is that although &mdash; and I will come back to this if I may &mdash; the Explanatory Memorandum suggests that the intention is to extend the definition of derelict site to include certain buildings, I am not convinced, and perhaps the Minister can convince me, that it actually succeeds in doing so. There is another technical point which perhaps I will have an opportunity to say a little bit about when I look at the section of the Bill, I am not sure that sufficient understanding exists in the mind of the <Col N="1176" /> framers of the Bill of the facts on the ground with regard to property ownership, because several sections speak, for example, about action being taken against the owner of the land, in many situations, particularly within the inner city, the ownership of the land is quite different from the ownership of the building that is placed upon it.  I could instance a large number of inner city areas where there is very considerable blight and dereliction of buildings visible from the street, where the ground rent is held by somebody quite separate from the person who is the owner or the proprietor or the occupant of the building. There is a difference between the owner of the building and the owner of the ground rent.  In fact, owners of ground rents can in some instances be extremely difficult to trace.  They very often have extra territorial residence.  I am not sure how this Bill addresses that point because it appears to direct itself principally to the owner of the land.  For this reason the question of the relationship between land and buildings upon that land has not been sufficiently worked out.  The Minister, of course, makes the point that he sees it as an improvement, because previously Acts that were enforced only became relevant when the site was totally derelict and no mechanism existed for preventing the running down of many a fine neighbourhood.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Minister's remarks about urban dereliction generally, I heartily applaud the context within which he places this because he indicates that he is aware &mdash; as the Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, has also shown himself to be aware &mdash; that the decline in the attractiveness of our inner cities and urban areas is a major problem with regard to the capacity that organisations like Bord Fáilte have to market Ireland as a tourist resort.  I have said many times, repeating the words of the Taoiseach, that it has come to the attention of most people in this industry that tourism is one of the most significant income generators in the <Col N="1177" /> country, that it has shown a capacity to expand, although proportionately Ireland's share of the tourist market is declining globally.  Nevertheless that is the section within the tourism section that has the maximum capacity for development and has shown the greater capacity for growth in what is known as cultural tourism.  That means writers like James Joyce, Jonathan Swift, Sean O'Casey <i>et al</i>, on the one hand and architecture, either the medieval architecture of the great ruined abbeys and so on, the cathedrals, the beehive oratories at Gallarus and so on, or on the other hand, principally the great 18th century streetscapes and squares of the cities, like Dublin, Limerick or Waterford.  It is important that this should be recognised and I am pleased that the Minister has done so.</P>
    <P>The Minister also refers to the extensive dereliction that has been allowed within what he calls the canal ring, 160 acres, seven times the size of St. Stephen's Green.  Who is responsible?  The local authorities.  Does the Bill do anything about the local authorities?  No.  It goes out of its way to exempt them in terms of road development.  It makes it perfectly clear that the local authority are the people vested with the responsibility for taking prosecutions or initiating actions under this Bill.  Does the Minister seriously suppose the local authorities are going to place themselves in the dock?</P>
    <P>I wish that there was a mechanism in this Bill which allowed the individual citizen recourse to some legal agency so that they could bring a defaulting land proprietor before a tribunal of some kind rather than leaving it to the local authority. I say this with some passion because I happen to live next door to a house in decay.  It is one of a series of several hundred houses assembled by an absentee property owner in this city.  The house is falling down, the back wall is held up by rack shores.  Do I, as somebody who has to live next door to this, despite the fact that I have, spent considerable sums <Col N="1178" /> of money restoring my own house, have any recourse to the law?  Can I drag these people before some kind of agency?  Has it all got to be left to a local authority, that may be reluctant to do so for one reason or another &mdash; one reason I have no doubt would be a kind of a gap in finances.</P>
    <P>If remedial works are carried out by local authorities, even if they recoup this expense later from the defaulting proprietor of the land or building, there will certainly be a gap in the time before they are able to do this.  I would like to ask the Minister a very specific question on this: has he given any consideration to the institution of a new officer of central government, who could be known as a &ldquo;receiver of derelict buildings&rdquo;?  This is an idea I understand was mooted.  I would like to hear if there is any intention to contemplate this, because this would be effective, this would give teeth to this kind of legislation with regard to buildings.  The intention behind the establishment of such an office, the &ldquo;receiver of derelict buildings,&rdquo; would be that an individual like myself, for example, or many other people who are placed in this situation, could apply to have a building brought into receivership through the appointment of the receiver of derelict buildings, so that he or she could come in, take over a building that was either derelict or in the process of going derelict, refurbish that building and then offer it back to the original owner for the cost of the remedial works, and if this was not acceptable, place it on the market with a reserve price set at the cost of the rehabilitation.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister will consider this since it is clear that one intention at least is to suggest to the public that this Bill addresses that problem.  Unfortunately, in my opinion it does not.  The fact that it does not is underlined by the existence of quite considerable confusion between &ldquo;land&rdquo; on the one hand, which is referred to occasionally and &ldquo;sites&rdquo; on the other.  To me, reading it as a layman, the <Col N="1179" /> Bill and Explanatory Memorandum, and the Minister's speech, all seem to use these terms, almost as if they were interchangeable. There is a kind of a haphazard quality about the choice of the occasion on which the words &ldquo;land&rdquo; or &ldquo;site&rdquo; are used.  Perhaps there is some specific legal intention behind the choice of those occasions on which the word &ldquo;land&rdquo; is used and the occasion on which the word &ldquo;site&rdquo; is used.  I would like some clarification from the Minister on this.</P>
    <P>I welcome the section which will give to the Minister for the Environment reserve powers to direct a local authority to take enforcement action or to improve a derelict site in their own ownership.  This goes perhaps some small way towards rectifying the situation I have pointed out, but I do not believe that it is, in any sense, strong enough.</P>
    <P>The paragraph that follows that says it is intended to enable the Minister for the Environment, after consultation with the appropriate Minister, to direct any statutory body to dispose of derelict land in their possession which is not necessary for their functions.  Again, I wonder why on this occasion the Minister in his speech chooses the word &ldquo;land&rdquo;.  Although land is important, so are the buildings and I would have to say that some statutory bodies in the city of Dublin, and I am sure within other cities, are notoriously neglectful.</P>
    <P>I have to reinforce once more what Senator Hederman said about the Dublin Vocational Education Committee.  They are a public disgrace.  I could instance a number of cases in which they have contributed, if not deliberately, by monstrous neglect to the destruction of our architectural heritage.  I could mention, for example, Nos. 18 and 19 Parnell Square, which they appeared deliberately to neglect, despite the warnings that were given by public figures, that were offered by An Taisce and by individuals concerned with the preservation of this section of our heritage which is vested in <Col N="1180" /> those statutory bodies as a public trust. The committee allowed the roofs to be interfered with, lead taken away and valuable 18th century fireplaces were stolen.  The fireplaces were subsequently found on a lorry that was stopped as it crossed the Border.  Those two houses were devastated.</P>
    <P>There is also No. 20, North Great George's Street, the home of Sir Samuel Ferguson who wrote the &ldquo;Lark in the Clear Air&rdquo;, a house with some of the finest ceilings on the north side of Dublin in the classical Adam manner.  The Dublin City Vocational Education Committee are refusing to give that house to an agency such as Dublin Tourism, who intended to refurbish it as an 18th century townhouse complete with furniture and apparel of the period &mdash; an exercise which I may remind the Minister was extraordinarily successful in tourism terms just across the square here, thanks to the ESB.  The VEC refused to allow this process to occur because they wanted to flatten the last remaining 18th century garden on the north side of the city, flatten a very fine range of Gothic outbuildings, devastate the lower section of the building, interfere with the plasterwork, and so on, all in the interest of providing a car park for their officials in Parnell Square, for the bureaucrats.  The building is continuing to decline.  Missiles are fired at people from the top windows and it is almost dangerous to pass it.  There is the nuisance of noise, dirt, squalor and dereliction.</P>
    <P>I hope that the word &ldquo;land&rdquo; in this section is also extended to buildings.  I urge the Minister to bear in mind what I have had to say about the Dublin Vocational Education Committee, particularly with regard to Parnell Square and North Great George's Street.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn to the Minister's script where he notes the comment in the NESC report, that local authority action contributes to high values in that the absence of a development or sales policy for derelict sites acts to restrict supply <Col N="1181" /> and induce blight.  I have no doubt that this is true.  It is also true that they contribute to low values in certain instances by blight; the high values only occur when there is a kind of an accumulation of land that restricts land supply, but they can also affect the situation in a markedly different way, although I have to be reasonable and fair-minded, and say that the policy of the corporation at present and of the Government in encouraging the development of special incentive areas, particularly in the north inner city of Dublin, is a welcome development and is beginning to be successful.  I trust it will be continued.</P>
    <P>I have some concerns when the Minister says that the definition of &ldquo;statutory body&rdquo; does not extend to Ministers of Government or the Office of Public Works because he says it would be inappropriate and inconsistent with the concept of the collective responsibility of Government that the Minister for the Environment should be in the position of issuing formal statutory directions to fellow Ministers regarding disposal of their land interest or any other matter. Why be so lily-livered?  I am sure Ministers frequently bully their colleagues and I wish him to have the opportunity so to do in this matter.  I accept, of course, the concept of Cabinet responsibility, collective responsibility and all the rest of it but I would like to ask the Minister if the collective responsibility of the Government, which is after all a political consideration, really comes before the public good.  If there is a scandal with regard to the abuse of buildings held in trust by one section of Government, why should the Minister who is charged with responsibility for the Environment not issue an order against the other Minister concerned?  I realise it might not be all that popular but people who are prepared to be a little unpopular with their colleagues are frequently very popular with their voters.  I recommend the Minister to consider the appropriateness of this attitude as expressed in his speech.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1182" /> I accept absolutely what the Minister says with regard to the levy.  I very much welcome the imposition of a levy on derelict sites.  I accept that it is not the intention to create additional revenue for local authorities in this way but to have the levy act as an efficiency tax and to secure better use for urban land.  I believe this will be its operation.  However, I regret the Minister appears to leave it very much at the discretion of functionaries, including himself, as to the purposes to which the money may be applied.  I wish there was greater care because nothing disillusions people more than the feeling that money is exacted by levy in one area and then applied to something totally different.  There should be a kind of correspondence. If money is levied from people who are in flagrant abuse of their responsibilities in terms of the environment that money should be applied to the amelioration of the problem in the area concerned.</P>
    <P>I would like in my final comment on the Minister's speech to say I greatly regret the sentence, that &ldquo;special arrangements may also be operated at the discretion of the local authorities for bona fide site assembly&rdquo;.  What is bona fide site assembly?  Who decides that? There are many instances in this city of where sites have been assembled quite unscrupulously and the decay of buildings encouraged and facilitated by the owners in order to ensure the clearance of the site and its availability for redevelopment, despite the existence on the site of listed buildings.  I am horrified that exemption should be considered precisely in the area where the greatest damage is being done.</P>
    <P>This is why, although I welcome the general intention and scope of the Bill, I feel that it is flawed.  I am not saying that this is a direct illustration of it, but I would like to point out to the Minister the situation along the quays and a particular problem that has been emerging over the past few months; I speak about Nos. 5, 6 and 7 Bachelors Walk.  Up to about 18 <Col N="1183" /> months ago those three houses were perfectly sound.  They were assembled as a site by a bona fide speculator.  Within a short time No. 5 was vandalised to such a degree &mdash; it was set on fire &mdash; that it had to be demolished.  That was on foot of a northside planning permission on the basis of the provision that where a building is acquired, a listed building, but is allowed to go derelict, a Dangerous Buildings Order can be sought so that it can be demolished on foot of that order. That was done with regard to No. 5.</P>
    <P>The demolition of No. 5 destabilised No. 6 and now there is apparently a problem with regard to the finest building, No. 7, which has a uniquely rich panelled interior and staircase.</P>
    <P>As I understand the operation of this provision of the Minister's, this is precisely the kind of thing that would be excluded from the operation of the Bill. It seems to me, on reading the Minister's speech, let alone the Explanatory Memorandum or the Bill, that the intentions of the Bill are frustrated by its content. I think that is greatly to be deplored although, as I say, in general terms I welcome the Bill.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Matter. - Dublin City Smog Levels.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="OlgaBennett" hpid="Mrs. Bennett Mrs. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>The current smog problem is having at least one good effect.  It is focusing the minds of Dubliners on their environment and the quality of life that can be expected during the coming winter months as long as bituminous coal <Col N="1184" /> continues to be the principal coal heating fuel.</P>
      <P>Smog levels in at least three heavily populated areas of Dublin at the weekend reached four times the safety limits set by the European Communities.  It is not necessary for me to point out that for the many people suffering from respiratory ailments, particularly the elderly, smog levels prevailing are approaching lethal levels.  There is no doubt that there is a serious smog problem in our city.  There is no doubt in my mind that the answer must be to regulate safely the amount of noxious smoke in the atmosphere which stems from burning coal in open fires.</P>
      <P>It will be recalled that the Air Pollution Act, which gave power to the local authorities to make special control areas, came into force in September 1987.  Six months later, in March 1988, Dublin Corporation was the first local authority to take steps to address the problem by declaring control zone A in Ballyfermot as the first smog control designated area. Ballyfermot is in the west of Dublin and was chosen because of the level of smoke prevailing in the area.  The smoke levels there were higher than in any other area in Ireland at the time and this still prevails at present.</P>
      <P>I have a particular interest in the Air Pollution Act as Ballyfermot is my local authority area.  I have been aware for many years of the problems endured by the residents because of the lack of a clean air environment.  While we all welcome the Bill, which was passed unanimously in the Dáil, there is no doubt that the oral hearing instigated by the Minister after the designation of control area A, while taking cognisance of the objections by a number of the residents has slowed down the implementation of Dublin Corporation's plan.  Now that these views and objectives have been heard no further delay should be allowed in implementing the plan because I believe the delays are causing undue hardship to the majority of the residents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1185" /> It is known from the residents and from their reactions to the environmental health officers who conducted a door to door survey, that they want clean air.  It is our duty as public representatives to present the plan properly to our constituents, and to comfort and advise those who have serious objections in order to ensure the speedy implementation of the plan.  I would ask the Minister for the Environment to ensure that sufficient information is made available and distributed to the residents.</P>
    <P>I would also ask the Minister to consider earnestly the people who have already installed units before the grants were in place.  Some consideration should be made towards the costs they have already undertaken.  Furthermore, there are many residents in Dublin who wish to live in a clean air environment and who would be willing to convert if properly advised on the programme.  Such people would convert without any grant aid. Consequently, a proper and informative advertising campaign would go a long way to help Dublin air to be cleansed again.</P>
    <P>The Minister has shown great courage in tackling a very difficult problem.  While some commercial interests are willing to throw their lot behind her, those who drag their heels should be called to task. If needs be, alternative sources of supply of smokeless fuel should be sought if those at present controlling the supply are not willing to fall in line.  For the Minister's plan to mature and flourish, we all need to give a long-term commitment to the plan and to clearly define the areas where grants would be given. We must ensure that our efforts will continue without interruption in these areas until the problem is solved.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, a significant number of people did not wait for grant aid but proceeded to convert at their own expense.  While it is everybody's wish that the 160,000 houses using open coal fireplaces in Dublin could be converted without delay, one must take a realistic <Col N="1186" /> approach, having regard to the financial constraints prevailing.  The corporation's plan for the new control areas which started in Ballyfermot and is being extended into Crumlin and Drimnagh, later to Cabra and Mountjoy Square, is to have all the problem and densely populated areas covered by 1992.  It is important that as much backing as possible be given by all parties and that no further delays be allowed in implementing the plan.  If this calls for minor adjustments to the Act, such amendments should be introduced.  No commercial interests should be allowed to delay the implementation of the plan by orchestrating objections which are not in the best interests of the community at large.  While the plan places an imposition to some extent on people, the majority will see that it is for the good of the community.  This has been borne out previously by the reactions of the canvassers on the door to door survey.  Today it is the problem in Ballyfermot, tomorrow it will be a Dublin problem and soon it will be an Irish problem. I appeal to all to act in unison for the general good of our environment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Miss Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank Senator Bennett for raising this issue on the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>The smog problem is very serious.  I have never sought to minimise its effects on health, the environment, or on our international reputation.  It is a problem that has been around for a long time, for at least the last decade.  I am concerned and the Government are concerned to ensure that whatever measures are taken will eliminate the problem once and for all.  Since I took office four months ago I have said that it will take until the April 1993 deadline &mdash; which is imposed on us by the EC Directive &mdash; to have Dublin, effectively, a smoke free area and to ensure that we have clean air to breathe in the cities and in the country's capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Bennett referred to the problem. She is right in saying that in Dublin <Col N="1187" /> city and county 177,000 householders use solid fuel; about 160,000 of them burn coal.  In those circumstances, it is very difficult to try to put in place a system that will quickly displace the burning of bituminous coal in Dublin city and county.  As I said in the Dáil the other evening, at the moment the Gas Company can only convert 14,000 houses per year.  Urgent measures to meet the current problem have been called for.  These include calls for the ban on bituminous coals and the reduction in the price of smokeless solid fuels, whether by way of a subsidy or a Government order.  I can ban bituminous coal in the morning in order to prevent or limit air pollution; I have the necessary powers to do so under the Air Pollution Act, 1987, but this would not, however, necessarily bring any immediate improvement in the situation during the current air inversion.  The fact is that people are burning smoky coals. No doubt many of them have a supply of that coal for their use for the remainder of this winter.</P>
    <P>A ban would not prevent people using smoky coal.  I am not certain how, in the short term, we could police such a ban. If we banned smoky coal in the morning, we would have to ensure that there was a sufficient supply of smokeless or low smoke fuels available so that all needs could be met, including the need of the weakest members of our society &mdash; the elderly and the sick.  The need for heating and the demand for fuels is higher for these people during cold winter periods.</P>
    <P>We could reduce the price of smokeless fuels by way of subsidy but this would be very costly.  A full subsidy to bring the price per kilo of Coalite down to the price of coal would cost about £18 million a year in the Dublin area.  That would be equivalent to 26,000 permanent conversions. Senators will agree that any money available should be used to deal with the problem on a permanent basis and not simply on a temporary basis, and merely deferring it to another year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1188" /> There is no guarantee that if the price of smokeless fuels was reduced people would use them.  Unleaded petrol is now for sale at prices considerably less than those for the leaded petrol &mdash; it is 5p a gallon cheaper than top grade leaded petrol.  The experience there is very disappointing, accounting as it does for only 11 per cent of petrol sales.</P>
    <P>There are two low smoke fuels on sale in Dublin which are suitable for burning in open fires, namely, Union briquettes and Bord na Móna peat briquettes.  These are available at prices comparable to that of the bituminous coal.  There is no real price differential, but the dominant position of smoky coals in the domestic market remains.  There is a 50 per cent increase this year in the sales of peat briquettes in the Dublin area.  This increase is from a very low base.  People are not buying them even when they are available at comparable prices.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that the Government are not looking urgently at the situation. Of course, the Government are taking the situation seriously.  All options, including the banning of coal, eventually taxing coal, the substitution of low smoke fuels, the VAT on Coalite, and so on, are being examined by the Government as a matter of urgency.  We want to ensure that the problem is dealt with across the city on a permanent basis.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer briefly to some of the medium-to long-term measures that have already been taken.  Orders for three areas in Ballyfermot have been confirmed. Five thousand houses are covered by these orders.  I have today made arrangements for an oral hearing to be held in relation to Ballyfermot Area D. That will go ahead shortly after Christmas.  The corporation are making good progress and are making orders for areas in Crumlin.  An order covering 3,000 houses has already been made and two further orders covering over 16,000 houses will be made early in the New Year.  A sum of £3 million has been provided to fund grants in special control <Col N="1189" /> areas in 1990 on top of the £1 million already provided this year.</P>
    <P>I am currently making regulations to guarantee the wide availability of smokeless and low smoke fuels.  The price structure of Coalite as compared to coal is being considered.  The increase of 27 per cent over the 12 month period 1988-89 is currently being examined by the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade. Short of an examination of this kind, it would not be possible for the Government to make an order directing CDL to reduce the price of Coalite.  Such an order, if it were made, would obviously be set aside in the High Court.  Until such time as the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade reports in relation to the price structure of Coalite as against coal, that would not be possible.</P>
    <P>The Air Pollution Act, which poses problems and delays in the making of special control area orders, is currently being reviewed.  We will be bringing forward amending legislation to that Act after Christmas.</P>
    <P>Further measures to deal with short-and long-term aspects of the problem are being considered.  A working group has been established, and will report in February, on policy options on fuels in the Dublin area.  The public utilities would not be able to cope if we were to have an outright ban on coal at present.  The Gas Company can at the moment only convert 14,000 houses per year.  This committee, which consists of representatives of Dublin Gas, ESB, Eolas and several Government Departments, is being chaired by the Department of the Environment. It is currently examining the feasibility of extending the gas mains throughout the city.  It is also examining what steps need to be taken to maximise the domestic use of natural gas and also the greater use of electricity, LPG, peat and other smokeless and low smoke fuels.</P>
    <P>This committee, which was established about a month ago, will report in February next.  All practical options which can help towards a permanent solution to <Col N="1190" /> the problem within the shortest possible time will be explored.  Nothing is being ruled out in the overall consideration of measures which need to be taken.</P>
    <P>The Senator referred to the smog alert system.  The present system of smog alert forecast is still at an experimental stage and is being developed.  The system is operated by the Meteorological Office in conjunction with the corporation.  It is based on daily results from the corporation's air quality monitoring stations. These results are allied with weather forecasts in a computer programme which then predicts whether a smog warning is necessary.  The warning is carried on all weather forecasts.  The prediction, however, can only encompass a period of up to 48 hours ahead at the most.  The system is working quite well at present.  Everyone in the House must be aware of the constant level of smog warnings which have been broadcast in recent weeks.  The Meteorological Office is continuing development efforts to improve the accuracy of the forecasts this season.  I welcome this.  It is not a question of giving an alert.  Unfortunately, the householders of Dublin are not responding to that alert as much as I would wish. I would again urge householders throughout the city and county, who do not have to burn bituminous coal to switch to the alternatives, at least during the smog alert periods.  We have all an obligation to play our part in sorting out this difficult issue.  It is not simply a matter for Government action alone.  Householders have the alternative in their own hands. I wish more of them would respond to the dangers and to the alerts by burning low smoke fuels or switching to alternative sources of heating.</P>
    <P>The Senator referred to the need for information and communication.  Following discussions recently with representatives of the community in Ballyfermot, I have asked officials of my Department to contact Dublin Corporation with a view to ensuring that the corporation provide an information service on the ground <Col N="1191" /> in Ballyfermot.  My Department are talking to the corporation with a view to seeing if that is possible.  I agree that there is a need to have the most accurate information available to the public in the area.  Many of the public representatives in that area have brought this to my attention. I hope we will be able to do something to alleviate that particular problem.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the issue was raised this evening, but I do not want anybody to be in any doubt about the difficulties in tackling the smog issue.  It has taken 40 years in Britain &mdash; and it is still not sorted out &mdash; to have smoke control areas <Col N="1192" /> introduced.  In Belfast, they have been trying to deal with the problem for 20 years.  It is a problem that does not lend itself easily to a solution.  In so far as I and the Government can, we are determined to ensure that by the April deadline of 1993 the air in this city and county will be clean, and that the citizens of Dublin will not have to endure the health and environmental hazards that have been experienced now over the past decade.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 5.20 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 13 December 1989.</P>
