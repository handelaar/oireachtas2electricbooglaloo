      <P>I have notice from Senator Thomas Hussey that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to sanction the Dunmore/ Glenamaddy Regional Water Supply, Stage 2, to Dunmore.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Joe Costello of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to fulfil her commitment to the development of a new school in north Clondalkin for the students of St. Kevin's Community College who are in temporary accommodation.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator David Norris of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health, in the light of the recent resignation of the Chairman of the Health Research Board due to unexpected arbitrary Budgetary constraints imposed in the Estimates, to look urgently at the possibility of providing future and adequate funding so that this important body can carry out its work in the national interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1346" /> I also received notice from Senator Liam Cosgrave of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The delay in publishing the report on Pay and Conditions in the Defence Forces with the continuing hardship for members and their dependants.</P>
    <P>Tá fógra agam ón Seanadóir Pól Ó Foighil:</P>
    <P>An gá atá ann go méadóidh an tAire Comhshaoil an t-olldeontas bóithre do Ghaillimh ag féachaint do dhrochstaid na mbóithre i gConamara.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Hussey, Costello, Norris, Cosgrave and Ó Foighil as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Hussey's matter and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Costello, Norris, Cosgrave and Ó Foighil may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>It is intended that we take Item No. 14 first.  We will then take half an hour, as agreed, on statements in regard to the boat people in Hong Kong. Item No. 1 will be discussed to 1.30 p.m. and after that we will take the Derelict Sites Bill, 1989, from 2.30 p.m. to 5 o'clock.  I will not order anything after 5 o'clock at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like on behalf of the House to apologise to <i>The Irish Times</i> that our proceedings yesterday were so dismal.  On two occasions today it is said in report upon the work of the House yesterday that we were forlorn and dismal.  This is an important point. The work of Parliament is not to entertain. Yesterday was an extremely busy and productive day in the House.  There was a very detailed discussion on Committee Stage of the Trustee Savings Banks Bill, with very good contributions from Senators Fallon, Doyle, O'Toole and others.  The work was done and done well.  Then there was a debate on the new Marine Institute Bill, 1989.  I want to <Col N="1347" /> draw particular attention to an account of the reporting here.  Senator Pól Ó Foighil spoke for well over an hour.  He spoke, as is his right and entitlement, in the first official language.  It was an excellent contribution, dealing in detail with the various aspects of the Bill under question. The report in <i>The Irish Times</i> simply says that &ldquo;Fine Gael's Mr. Pól Ó Foighil was on his feet for almost an hour speaking in Irish on the new Bill&rdquo;.  For Heaven's sake, there was not a single account of whether he was for or against what the Senator said.  The Senator spoke in Irish. Reporting of this sort is a disgrace to the Irish language and to this House.</P>
      <P>There was then an excellent debate on reform of both Houses, which I think brought forth a very strong sense of commitment on all sides towards reform. Many detailed ideas and analyses were put forward.  Then there was a debate at the end of the day on the flu vaccine.  All in all, it was an extremely useful day, a day spent in the interest of the public service.  The idea that we should be here as entertainers, which seems to come across from this report yesterday, is unworthy of <i>The Irish Times</i>, which, in fairness, gives the best and most comprehensive coverage of the proceedings of this House.  It and <i>The Cork Examiner</i> are the only two papers that take their duty seriously in this regard.  I would like to put that on the record.  If we are trying to do our job seriously, it is totally unfair that we are reported in this way, saying that we were forlorn and dismal.  I want to place on record my great sadness that this should have happened yesterday.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of information, I was Acting Chairman yesterday during Senator Ó Foighil's contribution. In fact, Senator Ó Foighil spoke for two hours and 20 minutes on the Second Stage, not just an hour, which compounds the difficulty even more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rarely in agreement with Senator Manning, but on this occasion I am.  I had intended to do precisely the same as he did, which is to <Col N="1348" /> apologise on behalf of this House for the fact that we are not providing entertainment apparently of the kind that <i>The Irish Times</i> believed its readership expect.  Look at the sort of business we have &mdash; boring things like a marine institute and a trustee savings bank.  They obviously do not provide entertainment. It is outrageous.</P>
      <P>Ba náireach an méid a dúradh faoin Seanadóir Pól Ó Foighil as ucht gur labhair sé Gaeilge sa Teach.  Tá sé scannalach go n-úsáidfí a leithéid d'fhocla i dtaobh dhuine a bhí sásta Gaeilge a labhairt, Gaeilge bhreá líofa.  Duine de na cainteoirí Gaeilge is fearr a chuala mé sa Teach seo is ea é, agus ocht mbliana caite agam anseo anois.  Bí mór dóibh leithscéal a ghabháil leis an Teach faoin chineál sin cur síos ar ghnó an Tí.</P>
      <P>I have been a frequent vigorous critic of many things in this House and I hope to be again.  But I have no time for cheapskate reporting which pulls cheap shots. If people do not understand the way Parliament functions then they should go and report something else.  There is nothing more boring, more unexciting and less entertaining than the Committee Stage of a Bill.  The Committee Stage of a Bill is where this House contributes its most important work to the development of any legislation.  I have seen Bills &mdash; and I heard Senator Honan talk about this &mdash; with 100 or 50 or 200 amendments accepted in this House and not a single word of it reported, because, I presume, it was boring and unentertaining.  We rewrote masses of legislation in this House. We rewrote it dramatically over the eight years I have been here.  Hardly a word of that rewriting was ever reported, presumably because it was not entertaining in somebody's eyes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to get involved in denouncing people.  <i>The Irish Times</i> and <i>The Cork Examiner</i> do a remarkable job &mdash; a fair job most of the time.  If they are free to be critical of us, as they are &mdash; and I would defend that right &mdash; we are free to be equally critical when they do not do their job.  That is what democracy is about.  It is not about a free press, free to scattergun everybody and the rest of <Col N="1349" /> us having to be quiet about that.  It is about all of us being free to criticise each other when they are wrong.</P>
    <P>Mar a dúirt mé, ba náireach an méid a dúradh faoin Seanadóir Ó Foighil toisc gur labhair sé as Gaeilge ar feadh uair nó dhó.  Tá an cead agus an ceart aige é sin a dhéanamh agus bá chóir go n-úsáidfimis go léir i bhfad níos mó Gaeilge sa Teach seo.  Ní chabhraíonn a leithéid sin de chur síos linne chun Gaeilge a úsáid anseo.</P>

      <P>Is pointe eolais é seo. Fágfaidh mé cad tá déanta faoi na páipéir. Ní raibh me ag súil lena mhalairt. Ach ní shin é leigheas an scéil.  Mar a dúirt an Seanadóir, labhair mé anseo aréir i nGaeilge, de réir mo chearta ní raibh duine ar bith a chuir in m'aghaidh ar aon bhealach.  Fuair mé cúnamh agus éisteacht ó gach Comhalta anseo.</P>
      <P>An rud is mó a chuireann imní orm ná cé go bhfuil an Ghaeilge ar chomhchéim leis an mBéarla de réir an Bhunreachta, nach bhfuilimid fós sa Teach seo in ann an ceart seo a bhaint amach.  Tá a fhíos agam &mdash; agus tá mé ag cur mo chuid eolais anseo go dtí an Ceannaire ar an dtaobh eile &mdash; go bhfuil iarrachtaí á ndéanamh le go mbeadh córas aistriúcháin sa Teach seo.  Tuigim go rabhthas ag iarraidh é sin a dhéanamh sa seisiún deireannach.</P>
      <P>Tá mé ag tabhairt fógra anseo inniu &mdash; páipéar nó gan pháipéar, preas nó gan phreas &mdash; mura dtabharfaí domsa mo chearta sa Teach seo go luath trí chóras aistriúcháin go mbeidh orm rud éigin eile a dhéanamh.  Ní bagairt é sin ach iarratas don Cheannaire a chinntiú go mbeidh córas aistriúcháin sa Seanad nuair a thosnóimid anseo tar éis na Nollag.  Mura mbeidh, caithfidh mise gníomhú ar bhealach éigin eile le mo chearta a bhaint amach.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is mór an trua nuair a labhraíonn Seanadóirí beagáinín Gaeilge nach féidir leis na páipéir é a scríobh síos. Sin an fáth go bhfuil an Ghaeilge an-lag sa tír seo.  Everybody can speak a fair bit of Irish.  We know, however, that if we speak in Irish or attempt to speak in Irish we are going to get no publicity <Col N="1350" /> whatsoever.  Yet those are the same people who pontificate and tell us how we should hold on to our traditions, our heritage and our culture.  What is more of our heritage and our culture than our Irish language?  It is sad to see it being discredited in this way by the media.  We hear a lot about the rights of the media. I have no objection to the media being in the House.  My crib is that, they are in a selective situation, because they will only print what they like.  If we denied them the right to come into this House they would soon tell us we are afraid to be heard.  But, when they do come in to the House, they only print the tit-bits or some throwaway phrase that may be passed, linking two sentences or something else, but which has no real meaning.  That is the headline they will latch on to.  They are just looking for headlines.  It is a pity that those are the people who are moulding society into an attitude of &ldquo;negative thinking&rdquo; in regard to Parliament and politics.</P>
      <P>I would warn that they should think again.  But for the politicians of this country over the last 20 years &mdash; we are very solid, sensible people &mdash; they would have us down the road that East Germany is today.  They would have democracy abolished in this country.  I am sad that that is the attitude of the Press.  They should be more considerate and realise that they have a serious job to do.  They should do it in a serious manner and give to the politicians the credit to which they are entitled.  We do not want more, but certainly we do not want less.  It is rather sad that there is not a Press Council in this country.  There should be a Press Council so that we would have some place to go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Something has bugged me for a long time.  This happens when there is a serious accident or something of that kind.  I saw it in my own town of Sligo, when there was a rather serious tragedy. Photographers were out on an elevated area with telephoto lens trying to photograph people in their beds.  The curtains had to be pulled.  That is scandalous and degrading.  It is a sad situation that when people are in grief or in mourning, the <Col N="1351" /> media should be there trying to catch those sad moments that people want to forget.  I would call for a Press Council so that we could take these people before some body.</P>

      <P>Thank you. Senators have a very serious obligation &mdash; and they are taking it this morning &mdash; to express views that are very relevant to the functions of the House.  That is why I am allowing a certain amount of latitude in this debate.  I would ask Members not to depart from the press interest in so far as it impacts upon the Order of Business and the Business of the House for the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>In the same vein, I take particular exception to a comment in the same newspaper as well, which speaks about and I quote:</P>
      <P>One possible reason for the dearth of Senators earlier was clear if one listened to the list of Christmas &ldquo;do's&rdquo; that were on hand around teatime.</P>
      <P>That seems to be the clearest implication that, because there might have been parties on in the evenings, this was a reflection on the work of the Seanad and that Members were not turning up to business because of this.  It is an outrageous comment. It is bringing this House into disrepute if these comments are not nailed as we are nailing them this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Bhí mé ag éisteacht leis an Seanadóir Ó Foighil agus creidim go raibh an ceart ag an Seanadóir nuair a bhí sé ag lorg seirbhís aistriúcháin sa Teach seo.</P>
      <P>I believe that nothing could illustrate better the repeated demands of Senator Ó Foighil for a translation service in this House than the situation that occurred here yesterday when he spoke very well and very feelingly about the Marine Institute Bill, a situation with which he is familiar because of the geographical location of his constituency.  It is a pity that this service does not exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1352" /> With regard to the newspaper reporting, I think it is an important issue.  We ought not to be too po-faced about it.  The reporting in the newspapers, particularly <i>The Irish Times</i> and <i>The Cork Examiner</i>, which is quite excellent in its reporting, is normally of a good standard.  They do not report everything.  It is extremely irritating.  When there is a row on the Order of Business that gets the headline because of some snappy phrase.  Some of us stay in the House for the rest of the day and talk on a series of amendments but none of the substance gets reported. I am all in favour of a certain lightening of the proceedings by humour.  It is a valuable instrument of debate.  I have no objection to this being taken up in the media.  But there is an obligation to retain a balance by dealing with the substance of debate.  It is sometimes unfortunate when this does not occur.</P>
    <P>I wish that some of the other newspapers, notably <i>The Irish Press</i>, would take some notice of the existence of this House.  I deprecate attacks on Seanad Éireann by newspapers which never attempt to explore the realities of this House.  This is true sometimes, even of <i>The Irish Times.</i>  There was an article some months ago in a prominent position.  The writer of that article had to go back over 40 years to provide examples of the bad behaviour of this House and of the stupidities that occurred in it.  I felt at that time that that illustrated that we were, generally speaking, on the right course.</P>
    <P>I would like, finally, to draw attention to the fact that it is not just the newspapers. We get a reasonable deal from most of the newspapers.  It is quite outrageous that RTE, although they give us reasonable coverage on radio &mdash; and I hope they will do so soon on television &mdash; published what purported to be a report of the general election.  There is not a mention in that report, which is sent to all Members of the House, of the fact that the Seanad exists at all &mdash; they do not even mention it.  I know it is produced because of timing, but I think it is lamentable that this should happen.</P>
    <P>There are one or two other things I <Col N="1353" /> wish to raise with regard to the Order of Business.  I do not think I will be testing your latitude, a Chathaoirligh, too much by referring to an item that I mentioned&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>We will see.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I will restrain myself from any pert comments out of respect for the dignity of your office and of the House. Yesterday, I referred to the fact that I believed an item was missing from the Order Paper.  It is missing again today, but I wish to apologise to the staff of the House for apparently having cast a slur on them.  The reason it is missing is entirely my own fault.  I wish this to be placed on the record.  It was an item I had written out and signed myself.  I understood that several of my collegues had signed it as well.  This was not the case.  I would like to take this opportunity of withdrawing any slur that might have attached to the members of the professional staff of this House, who are indeed fully professional, courteous and quite excellent in carrying out their work. I apologise to them for that situation.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask if the Leader of the House can give us an indication &mdash; I asked this yesterday and I did not receive a reply &mdash; with regard to the timing of the debate on the North of Ireland, the urgency of which has been underlined by the tragic events of yesterday afternoon, which place clearly in perspective the operations of the so-called Peace Bus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Aontaím leis na Seanadóirí eile mar gheall ar an teanga sa Teach seo.  Bhíos in éineacht le daoine eile ón Teach eile agus ón Teach seo ar feadh dhá bhliain mar Chathaoirleach Chomhchoiste an Oireachtais don Ghaeilge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am going to say it in English to make sure that it sinks in.  I was for two years in the last Seanad chairman of the Oireachtas Committee on the Irish language with Senator Brendan Ryan and other Senators and Deputies.  The biggest complaint we had at all times &mdash; and I fully agree with Senators Pól Ó Foighil <Col N="1354" /> and Maurice Manning in what they have brought up here this morning &mdash; was that every time anybody put a question down in the Dáil or spoke in Irish here it was referred to the next day in the papers as &ldquo;speaking in Irish&rdquo;.  It is time that you, a Chathaoirligh, took a hand in it.  I would ask you to write a letter to the editors of these supposed Irish papers and tell them once and for all to recognise that the Irish language is our first language and that we have a right to be reported.  Whether I agree or disagree with what Pól Ó Foighil said here yesterday is a different matter. I congratulate him on his speech of over an hour and a half in the Irish language.</P>
    <P>The other thing is that we have been paying lip service to Irish in the Seanad. Since 1987 we have been promised instantaneous translation equipment.  We were given all kinds of lame excuses.  It would only take up a small corner in the House and it is about time we had the equipment in.  We were promised the equipment when the House was being renovated.  It is very important.  I would ask you, a Chathoirligh, as a special favour to this House to take up these two points.  I ask you as well to contact the editors of the papers to help us have our Irish language where it should be, which is ar bharr an pháipéir.  Sin é an áit cheart dó.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make one or two comments in response to the comments about the Press.  I am one of the people who has not read the papers this morning. I have a feeling that we are being rather too sensitive about this type of comment. A lot of what is said in papers is like last winter's snow &mdash; it is gone in the equivalent of a quarter of a second, politically. The other thing to remember is that what goes into papers is there because it is meant to amuse the public.  The Press have different objectives than what we have.  I think that, as society has developed in this country, we are simply getting too hot and bothered about media coverage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I, like Senator Upton, did not read the papers either this morning, because I had other matters to attend to. <Col N="1355" /> I do not know why some of us are going around wearing a crown of thorns or having an agonised expression on our faces because the media say something that is not very nice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Fair enough, but the fact is that we have got very reasonable and good coverage from the media throughout the years, particularly <i>The Irish Times</i> and <i>The Cork Examiner.</i>  We are a public body.  We are entitled to be exposed if we are not doing our business correctly.  We are entitled to be neglected if we do not do it correctly.  I do not know why we are all going around being so uptight about the media.  It is up to us.  If somebody wants to get into the papers they can submit something and they know how to do that.  I do not know what all the worry is about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the points that have been raised in regard to the coverage of the Seanad yesterday.  I have been a consistent critic here of the performance of <i>The Irish Press.</i>  Every time I criticised it, they ignored it further, if that were possible.  Possibly one of the reasons <i>The Irish Press</i> is not doing so well is that they do not cover the workings of the Seanad.  They should take on board the performance, circulation wise, of <i>The Irish Times</i> in the past few years.  If they start covering the proceedings here, their circulation might start rising.</P>
      <P>I do not think we should take what happened yesterday on board as an attempt to get a &ldquo;córas aistriúcháin&rdquo; into the House.  There are two separate issues. What happened yesterday in connection with the report of Senator Pól Ó Foighil's speech should be taken as a separate item.  The development of the cause of the córas aistriúcháin should be taken as another item.  We will continue to try to get the córas aistriúcháin into the House. I will take it up again.  We are coming up with officialdom reasons for not putting in the particular system here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1356" /> The suggestion made by Senator Fitzgerald of a meeting with the editors could be taken on board and the Cathaoirleach and possibly leaders of the groups could take that on board.  There is no point in criticising the Press reporters who attend the House, because I know that on many occasions they send in their copy very assiduously and sub-editors and editors edit out what they have put in.  They spend long hours here, long hours of unamusing and sometimes boring work. They sit here day after day.  I do not think that it is the reporters fault that what happens here is not reported; I would blame the sub-editors and editors.  A meeting with the editors would not be a bad idea.</P>
    <P>I did answer the point raised by Senator Norris yesterday in connection with the Anglo-Irish debate.  That will take place after Christmas.  That was the only item that was actually raised on the Order of Business.</P>
    <P>Order of Business agreed to.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this motion is to ensure that there will be adequate representation for the people of Galway city, by allowing the Western Health Board to be able to have as part of its membership members from Galway Corporation.  This is the result of a change which took place in 1986 when the administrative area of Galway was extended to include a borough council.  A large part of the area under the former jurisdiction of Galway County Council was transferred to the control of Galway Corporation. It included a large residential area and a very large industrial zone.  In order to ensure that there would be a <i>pro rata</i> representation for the people of the county of Galway and the people of the city of Galway this motion is before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consultation is taking place between <Col N="1358" /> Galway County Council, Galway Corporation and the Western Health Board and consultation through these bodies is also taking place with the Department of the Environment and the Minister for the Environment.  As a result of agreement being reached on this matter &mdash; because it was expected at one stage that a new Bill may be drafted by the Department of the Environment to take into account some local authority changes &mdash; it was necessary to have further consultation. Those consultations have now been concluded and as a result the motion is before this House.</P>
    <P>I believe it is important that the House would agree this motion to ensure that the people of the city of Galway have full statutory representation on the Western Health Board, which covers the administrative areas of the counties Galway, Mayo and Roscommon.  I know that the Western Health Board through its large membership and through its excellent staff, are making a great contribution to the administration of health affairs in the west of Ireland.  We are very confident that the addition of the representation of Galway Corporation, which comprises an area with three excellent hospitals and very large community out-patient services, will be reflected in the views, workings and operations of the Western Health Board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was agreed this morning that short statements would be made in connection with the repatriation, if one could call it that, of people from Hong Kong to Vietnam.  This is as a result of a decision made in the British House of Parliament that these people should be sent back to Hanoi.  It could be said that we should not be interfering in the business of other countries.  Nevertheless, on humanitarian grounds we should express our concern that people who fled from a country which had been torn by war for many years, who left because they were not satisfied that the new regime in that country would be a regime that they would like to live with, who fled to what they considered the relative safety of places like Hong Kong, should be forced back again, to live in a country which they do not want to live in.  It is important to state that &mdash; it is a country that they do not want to go back to.</P>
      <P>We have seen in the past the British Government take steps to repatriate people after the Second World War to countries in Eastern Europe and, it has to be said with horrific consequences for the people who were so repatriated.  Even though a court case in Britain recently disagreed with people who had stated that actions taken by senior British army officers were reprehensible and the case was lost, nevertheless the people who were sent back were in actual fact killed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think we should allow the Vietnamese to be sent back against their wishes to a country without adequate safeguards.  If the international community would have some means of monitoring what happens these people when they go back there just might be some justification.  However, it is stated that they will go back, that they will be kept for a few days in Hanoi, that they will be issued with identification papers and will be repatriated to the places from which they had come originally.  There is no international safeguard involved in the transfer of these people.  If they are to be <Col N="1360" /> sent back at least the United Nations, the Red Cross or some other body should monitor what happens to them.  I would prefer that they would not be sent back.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the British Government and the British people to ensure that regard will be had to the safety of these people rather than the reverse which, I think, is happening.  After any conflict there are people who wish to leave the country of conflict and if they do that and look for asylum in some other place that asylum should be sacred.  It would seem Hong Kong is bearing the brunt of the numbers because of its situation geographically, but there are places in the world which could accommodate these boat people. Every effort should be made to place these unfortunate people around the world in countries which can afford to take them rather than repatriate them to a land to which they do not want to go.</P>
    <P>All we can do here is express opinions as to what should happen.  We are expressing them, with feeling, on humanitarian grounds because we are very worried as to what will happen to these people once they get back to the country from which they came.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to thank the Leader of the House for having so readily facilitated the House in allowing this debate to be taken today.  It does in one sense point to the absence of a foreign affairs committee which all sides now agree would be in a position to readily accept and debate at greater length motions of this kind.  Nonetheless, I want to place on record my thanks to the Leader of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not an anti-British motion.  We <Col N="1361" /> are faced with a complex, difficult problem on a scale which, happily, we in this country have never had to face.  It is very clear that the British Government have adopted a solution which is morally indefensible, which has shocked the world and which raises the nightmare of so many of the shameful incidents which have scarred the 20th Century.  The most recent one, as the Leader of the House pointed out, was the fate of the Cossacks sent back in large numbers to certain death at the end of the Second World War.  I am not saying there is any suggestion that those who are going back in this case will face death or imprisonment but there is something wrong and indefensible about a situation where people are being forcibly repatriated on such a major scale.</P>
    <P>On this issue I do not think any of the countries involved can claim the high moral ground.  There is a great deal of shared responsibility all round.  The Government of Vietnam itself have succeeded in creating a climate in which many people felt their lives were endangered, in which very many people felt that the risk of dangers on the open sea, of pillage, rape, murder, robbery was preferable to continuing to live in Vietnam. There has not been sufficient evidence of a desire on the part of the Government of Vietnam to rebuild and to try to heal the wounds of that country's terrible war memories.</P>
    <P>Likewise, the Government of the USA must shoulder a great deal of responsibility because of their vindictive policies of ensuring that Vietnam remains isolated.  The efforts to rebuild the economy and the country have been greatly damaged by the policies of the USA.  I certainly hope that in that country there will now begin an appraisal of their attitude to Vietnam.  Certainly, the Americans cannot walk away from this issue. They are responsible for much of what happened and must share the responsibility. There are others who are responsible, the Government of China especially, in view of the recent activities there, the massacre in Tiananmen Square and the general policy of repression on <Col N="1362" /> which that country's Government have now embarked.  That Government have also succeeded in creating in Hong Kong itself a climate of fear and uncertainty about the future of Hong Kong once it become part of mainland China after 1997.  That, in turn, has made more difficult the possibility of the boat people being assimilated into the economy and society of Hong Kong.  In this matter the Government of Great Britain have behaved in a way which reflect no credit on them.  The attempt to get away with the implementation of this policy was carried out in a sneaky, mean and hamfisted way.  It is to the great credit of the politicians in all parties in Great Britain that the reaction in the House of Commons was so spontaneous, immediate and so comprehensive that I now believe there is a major policy reappraisal underway.</P>
    <P>Even here we must ask ourselves whether even in a time of high emigration we could not provide some haven or sanctuary or place for people who would bring very different skills.  For some small group, at least, we could do our share in trying to provide a home for people who clearly do not want to go back to Vietnam. We could show our sincerity in this regard by seeking if there are ways in which we could bring some of these people here and help to integrate them into this country.</P>
    <P>All of us do share a certain responsibility in this.  When I asked for this motion to be taken I did so because I know there are strong feelings in this country on the matter.  I know that the position of our Government is the view which we would all express here today.  I know our Government through its Presidency of the European Council and other ways will be exerting pressure that this problem be tackled in a way fundamentally different from what has gone before.  The position of any Government is strengthened if it has the backing of all parties in Parliament.</P>
    <P>That is my reason for asking that the motion be taken and I am sure the message will go to the Government as to the views of all parties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I want to thank the Leader of the House for facilitating this acceptable brief but very necessary statement. I do not want to say much about the British Government because the issue is one which would be difficult for any government.  I want to a certain extent to speak in defence of Vietnam, not because I agree with the government that is there but it is important to put on the record that the people of Vietnam suffered almost 40 years of continual war by a succession of foreign powers, and that has put an enormous burden on Vietnam. It has produced thousands of orphans, to whom have been given the best that country can provide within its enormously limited resources.  As any international aid agency will tell you, they have struggled desperately to provide for their orphans, to provide for the thousands of severely handicapped people that are a consequence of war, to provide for the thousands of acres of sterile agricultural land that has been bequeathed to them, where there are still huge numbers of unexploded bombs and which land has to be excluded from use for generations.</P>
      <P>All of that is part of the story of Vietnam. There are very peculiar double standards obtaining.  I am not accusing anybody in this House because it has not arisen here.  People become refugees in one breath when they are walking out of east Germany but they become economic refugees when they are leaving Vietnam. We did not have this nicety of distinction about the people who were leaving east Germany.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The real tragedy here is that we claim to be part, and we are part, of the western democracy and democracy is not a stick one uses to beat other people.  It is a standard by which one invites others to measure one's behaviour: to suggest that, on the one hand Vietnam is such an appalling country as to justify the economic warfare that is being conducted against it since the end of the war, that it is such an appalling country that it is virtually a pariah in terms of international <Col N="1364" /> aid, of any sort of contact with its neighbours, and in so many ways and, on the other hand, to say to the people in Hong Kong that they should go back to Vietnam because they are not really going to do them any harm because we did not mean what we were saying about them for the last 20 years or so since the war ended.  That is at the core of the issue.</P>
    <P>If the western Governments were prepared to allow reasonable amounts of aid, relative to the degree of need in Vietnam to reach that country, if there was international solidarity on the scale that is beginning to emerge towards eastern Europe in order to help a tragic country to rebuild itself after 40 years of war and if in that context we were then to say to people who are Vietnamese after all that we now believe their country is developing, growing and that it needs them then, perhaps, some of these people would go back voluntarily.</P>
    <P>The other side is that the three powers, Britain, France and the United States, have meddled in that country's affairs in a most unpleasant and warlike way over the last half century and they all have a particular obligation to those citizens of Vietnam who, for one reason or another, identify too closely with the various forces of occupation and are now unacceptable or feel they are unacceptable and that they have no future.  Colonial powers, such as France, Britain and the United States cannot simply walk away and look over their shoulders and say goodbye.  They created problems and they manipulated people.  I believe that the obligation still rests firmly on France, Britain and the United States to restore some sort of economic vigour to Vietnam and to provide refuge for those who are in many cases the direct and most tragic victims of their quite unjustifiable interference in another country's affairs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="Mr. J. Ryan Mr. J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to compliment Senator Manning and thank the Leader of the House for allowing this limited debate on a matter I consider to be a blemish on all democratic countries. I have seen in the media unfortunate young children and young mothers being <Col N="1365" /> forcibly put on planes against their will at the demand of countries who were responsible for the original carnage that struck Vietnam 20 years ago.  Children and widows had to suffer the napalm bombs, as well as remember so well.  Now nobody wants them and, as Senator Brendan Ryan indicated, the countries that are responsible are turning their backs: America, France and Great Britain are greatly responsible for what is going on.</P>
      <P>I watched the debate on television in the House of Commons during the week and I was amazed and appalled at the insensitivity of the British premier.  One would think we were talking about a bingo game by the way she described how so many were being transferred from A to B, not taking into account the sufferings and the anxieties of those unfortunate people.  I would appeal to America, France, England and to the United Nations, of which organisation we are proud to be a member to consider the matter urgently.  I would remind the House that 100 years ago when we suffered as a small country, we were happy that thousands of our people were taken into other countries as refugees.  If the small countries like Ireland are not seen to support the plight of these unfortunate people I do not know what countries such as America or England will do.</P>
      <P>I support the motion.  I hope that from our Ambassador at the United Nations, our people in Brussels and wherever we can influence the powers that be in the matter, Ireland, as a small country, should be seen to support the people of another small country in their dreadful plight.</P>

      <P>I think the amendment is fairly self-explanatory. It relates to the main substance of the debate yesterday in dealing with any amending of this Bill by way of regulation.  I am suggesting that the three years that are being given to the Minister to amend, I presume, any technical difficulties that may appear &mdash; that is my understanding, it may not be so &mdash; should be limited to one year rather than three years.</P>
      <P>Given the outcome of the vote we have just had, I think this makes my proposal even more important.  I have a deep distrust of regulations laid before the House that must be annulled within 21 days, passive regulations, if you would like to put a name on it.  I would like to limit the Minister's powers &mdash; not just this Minister but any Minister of any Government &mdash; to amend legislation in this fashion.  In this case I want to limit his powers to within one year of the passage of the Act rather than three years as suggested in the section.</P>

      <P>We are opposed to this section.  The reason we are opposed to it is quite simply that we believe the people <Col N="1369" /> who formulate these types of Bills should have the capacity to understand the problems as they exist rather than trying to have to cope with stuff which emerges somewhat down the road.  We have a very competent Civil Service in this country and I certainly believe it is within their scope to anticipate the problems, provide means through which those problems can be dealt with rather than to set the thing up and figure it out as it goes along.  It is for that reason that we are opposed to this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Very briefly, I want to add to what Senator Upton has said.  From the way these sections are set out I am a little bit puzzled as to whether the Central Bank is the real authority or the Minister. The only way we can look at it is that whoever has control is the owner.  It would seem as though the Minister for Finance has the control, and yet throughout the Bill it seems to be that when any modification is called for it means that the Minister considers it expedient that they function in the same way as other banks and become compatible with them. The whole essence of that is that it is the means to achieving privatisation, even if it is not privatisation in itself.  This is a major concern to us.  Once the Trustee Savings Banks become compatible with other banks, because the Minister, or the Central Bank, can make regulations, it means we are into the area of bank charges, the hidden charges; it is not a question of what can we do for you, it will be a question of what can we do to you, just as it is with the other banks at the moment with all the hidden charges.  Certainly, there are concessions for the &ldquo;Golden Years&rdquo; people.  While it is not actually privatisation, it is the means to achieving privatisation.  As soon as the value of Trustee Savings Banks are assessed, and having regard to the regulations that will be made to facilitate them in the marketplace, the fact is that they will be open for a takeover by the giants in a few years' time.  In other words, the State is making the way clear for the privatisation of these banks.  For that reason we are opposed to the section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>In this amendment Senator Doyle wants the three year limit changed to one year.  I note the Labour Senators are opposing the section. I think at the outset we must accept and understand that the whole thrust of this Bill is to create a level playing field situation for our financial institutions. For far too long the Trustee Savings Banks have been in a very difficult situation, with serious impediments imposed on them, whereby their lending ratio is only 20 per cent of their investments and deposits.  We cannot in modern commercial life expect any society or any institution to serve the nation in a proper financial environment with these outdated, outmoded impediments imposed on them.</P>
      <P>The provisions that we are requesting here are already in the recent Building Societies legislation, which at that time gave rise to some adverse reactions in its passage through the House.  For that reason it is important for Senators to be quite clear on the purpose and intention of this section.  The section provides that if any difficulty arises in bringing any provision of this Act into effect then the Minister is empowered to remove that difficulty by way of regulation, which may also modify the legislation to such an extent as may be necessary to facilitate its enforcement.  The existing Trustee Savings Banks legislation is both antiquated and labyrinthine and the present Bill is the first major reform of that legislation in this State.</P>
      <P>There is a strong possibility of unforeseen technical difficulties arising in giving effect to the provisions of the present Bill.  This provision which we seek here is to enable the Minister to deal with them.  Advice is that this power can be effectively exercised only within the context and intentions of the present Bill. There is no possibility of the provision being used to subvert the intention of the legislation and there are precedents for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Attention should be drawn to the time limit of three years in this section and to the fact that it is provided in section 4 of <Col N="1371" /> the Bill that any regulation made under this section would be placed before both Houses of the Oireachtas, who have the power to annul the regulation within 21 days if they so wished.  Precedents for a provision of this type are to be found in the 1952 Social Welfare Act, the 1985 Farm Tax Act, the 1986 Canals Act and the 1988 Valuation Act.  The Building Societies Act of 1989 has a three year limit and a similar limit is appropriate in this case.  Limits and other precednets cited varied: Social Welfare Act, one year; Farm Tax and Valuation Acts, two years; and the Canals Act a limit of three years.</P>
    <P>Regarding the scope of any amendments, all the precedent legislation referred to limited the scope of amendments under this section to the Act in question except for the Canals Act, which allowed for the possibility of amendment to any other enactment.  I trust this helps to clarify the situation and I trust that the Senators can accept this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I do not intend to drag this out, to start nit picking or anything else like that; but, with all due respects to the Minister, the fact is that when you quote these other Acts you are not comparing like with like.  Examination of those other Acts would reveal that the State is still in control.  There is confusion here now as to where control has gone.  That is the confusion I have in my mind &mdash; perhaps it is because I left school early.  There is confusion in my mind as to where the actual control lies; and, if you control, you own.  In my opinion, from the way sections 5 and 6 are framed, it may modify any provision. You go into the whole question of modification again and the question of, if you like, driving them in the direction of modifications of the law so that they will come into line with the building societies, etc. Because it is tied in with the Central Bank, the Central Bank are going to break down a lot of the policies.  The fact is that we will be in and out of this place making regulations that the Central Bank will suggest from time to time.  This <Col N="1372" /> exposes the Trustee Savings Banks to the whole question of mergers or takeovers from the giants eventually.  I think we are actually facilitating this by the way these sections are worded.</P>
      <P>I can understand that in this day and age you cannot have the Trustee Savings Banks operating on the basis it is operating on at the moment, with a very tight knit sort of family structure rather than a large business.  I do not mind it going into the open field, but it is a question of who has the control.  Quite frankly, the way the sections read to me &mdash; the Bill as a whole, in fact, but the sections give emphasis to it &mdash; is that the door is open now for the Trustee Savings Banks to embark on a series of developments that will, in fact, increase its valuation.  Once it increases its valuation people will know where they stand, what its assets are valued at, etc. This is the road we are leading them down.  When you lead them down that road you are actually saying to the other giants in the banking business: &ldquo;Here is a lovely thing that the State has set up for you.  It is working in the right direction, it is compatible and I think you should move in and take it over.&rdquo;  That is the way I see it in about four or five years' time, that we are giving the Trustee Savings Banks to the other banking giants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think what we have to remember every moment of this Bill is that we are talking in a world of changing and challenging financial services.  The whole scene will change in the years ahead, that everybody knows.  Over the past year we have had the Building Societies Bill, the Central Bank Bill, the ACC Bill &mdash; all preparing us for the years ahead.  This is a natural follow-on to what has been developing in the other areas. We are putting the Trustee Savings Banks under the proper umbrella, the supervisory role of the Central Bank, as is proper and correct.  We are trying to put them on the same playing field as the other banks, the Bank of Ireland, Allied Irish and the rest of them.  That is what the Bill is basically about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>None of us has a crystal ball.  In my opinion, what would happen first in <Col N="1373" /> regard to the Trustee Savings Banks is that you would have the Dublin, Limerick and Cork Savings Banks coming together, merging, amalgamating, call it what you like &mdash; again a natural part of what is happening in business, whether it is the business of co-ops, finance or whatever. It is going on; it is happening daily.</P>
    <P>In regard to talking about privatisation now, as I said, neither the Minister nor any of us in this building has a crystal ball.  It may well happen in ten years' time, or in 20 years' time.  But at the moment what we are saying in the Bill is that we are trying to give them, no more or no less, the same playing field, the same playing area as the other banks, and to give them the same opportunities of getting the type of business that the other banks are procuring every day, whipping it away from under their noses.  We are helping them to stay in business for the future.  That is what this Bill is about. Privatisation might well be a reality, as I said, in 20 years' time.  Who knows? However, at the moment this Bill is purely about the matters I have discussed and I think that is all we can discuss at this time.  We cannot be talking about something that might never happen or, if it does happen, it is a long, long way away.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Regardless of the overall merits of what this Bill is trying to achieve, I think there are many sections within it that some of us disagree with profoundly and we do not need lecturing at all as to how the financial world is changing or the new challenges ahead, because there is no argument; we are not debating that.  We want to stick to specifics without the lectures, if we can at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an amendment down in my name that purports to reduce from three to one year the length of time the Minister can have effective <i>carte blanche</i> to do what he likes with this Bill.  The more we talk ourselves around this amendment the more I am inclined to support what the Labour Party are trying to achieve, because I am seriously concerned that in any democratic system we should hand <Col N="1374" /> to any Minister, regardless of his political leanings, the powers to do what he likes with a Bill.  You only have to read the language in this section, and I quote:</P>
    <P>If, in any respect, any difficulty arises in bringing any provision of this Act into operation or in relation to the operation of any such provision, the Minister may by regulations do anything which appears to him to be necessary or expedient for removing that difficulty....</P>
    <P>And he may have these powers for three years.  That is an incredible latitude and an incredible power to give to any Minister. It is amazing stuff when you even read the language that is written into it. Here we are trying to justify quoting the Central Bank, the ACC at the other end, the Companies Bill and something else. Just because there may be precedent does not always mean it is right.  What it may mean in giving the Minister this &mdash; we are only giving it to him for three years; that is what is being asked.  If it was so good that a Minister needed these powers for the expeditious enactment of legislation such as this, why restrict him to three years?  Why not leave it an openended provision, if it was that good, as is trying to be justified here by the Minister, with respect, and his colleagues?  If it is as the Minister says, then remove any three year restriction and give the Minister these powers.  But I am saying he should have none or limited to one year, as I am saying now, for the very reasons that have been said on this side of the House.</P>
    <P>The Minister's argument defeats itself, if you really follow it through.  If what the Minister is saying is so essential, do not restrict the Minister or any subsequent Minister to a three year time limit on this provision.  But the Minister's argument does not stand up at all in any democratic society.  What we are doing under section 5 is extremely dangerous &mdash; to let any Minister have <i>carte blanche</i> to do what he likes with this Act or the Companies <Col N="1375" /> Act or the Central Bank Act or all the rest that will be thrown into the pot.  If he needs the three years to see where the problems will be, why was the groundwork not done in advance?  Why did we not co-ordinate this type of provision or co-ordinate better the enactment of legislation, to ensure that, if difficulties are thrown up with some of the other Acts, they will not appear in this Act and that we can sort out the problems before they arise?</P>
    <P>As I understand this section, because the Ministerial advisers, the parliamentary draftsman and those who put a piece of legislation like this together are not quite sure where the difficulties will lie, be they technical, legal or of any other nature, they need a provision to allow the Minister, by regulation, to sort out these problems as they arise, regardless of the implication of the particular changes.  It certainly is not a very democratic way of behaviour.  We have four or five sections in this Bill whereby the Minister is acting by way of regulation and in only one section is an affirmative motion required later on in the Bill.  The whole point of our vote this morning was that what we wanted was that any change by way of regulation should be by way of affirmative motion.  I accept democratically we were defeated on that; but the defeat of section 4 makes what we are saying here all the more important if we are to respect democratic procedure at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened on the monitor to what Senator Farrell and Senator Harte had to say and I have just heard what Senator Doyle had to say.  I have a general concern about the very wide-ranging nature of these powers and the capacity given to the Minister to deal with what may be legislative matters through regulation.  I am not sufficiently versed to go into the technicalities of this, but it seemed to me from what many of the Senators said, that there was concern, as was expressed very clearly and very forcibly in the Dáil, that this machinery, bland as it may appear on paper, is a preparatory stage in the process towards <Col N="1376" /> privatisation.  It seemed to me from what Senator Fallon said that this simply was not being ruled out by the Government side.</P>
      <P>I would be concerned if this is the case, because one is morally bound to consider the origins of these funds.  The resources and the funds of the Trustee Savings Banks have a clear origin in the mutuality concept, in the idea of trust and trusteeship.  It seems that it would be regrettable if these regulations were a kind of Trojan horse intended to allow, not that far down the line, for the privatisation &mdash; in other words, for the acquisition by the powers of greed, of capitalism and of self-interest of a resource that was built up by the small people of this island.  For that reason I feel that the arguments advanced by Senators Harte and Doyle are quite persuasive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest to what the Senators had to say.  In response to Senator Harte, I have to say that it is not true to say that what you control you own.  The Houses of the Oireachtas have given various controls to various Ministers, by law and by statute, and those Ministers do not own what they control.  A very simple example is the building societies, which are owned by the shareholders; but yet control was with the Minister for the Enviornment and now the supervisory authority has gone to the Central Bank.</P>
      <P>I want to clarify exactly what we are talking about here.  Basically, we are handing over the present supervisory function, which is carried out by the Minister, but the Minister will, however, retain the right to determine the rate of interest he pays on Trustee Savings Banks moneys lodged with them.  He will be consulted by the Central Bank on the proportion of depositors' funds to be lodged with them.  At present the Minister determines this proportion, but it has always been subject to review in the light of the prudent opportunities open to the Trustee Savings Banks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, these opportunities have been limited to a large extent by the <Col N="1377" /> legislative framework under which the Trustee Savings Banks have been operating up to now.  The status of the Trustee Savings Banks regarding ownership and the vesting of the property in the trustees is not changed by this legislation.  It is very important that we recognise that. However, if and when an order is made under section 57, which we will come to later, ownership will change in one way or another.  The Trustee Savings Banks will then be owned either by the Minister or by an individual or body other than the Minister.</P>
    <P>I find it hard to reconcile Senator Doyle's contribution.  I may be incorrect, but I think that, when she was Minister of State at the Office of Public Works, she put through the Canals Bill.  At that time we included in that a similar provision giving a three year right to the Minister to make decisions pertaining to the canals.  This is exactly the same.  The Farm Tax Bill was put through when her party, with the Labour Party, were in the Coalition Government and again a provision was put in there on the farm tax situation.</P>
    <P>We are consistent.  We must recognise that we are moving into a totally new financial regime.  We are not here to lecture; we are only here to inform one another and to ensure that we pass the best legislation possible.  We are asking here for a three year provision for the Minister.  We must recognise that that three years will conclude in 1992.  We must recognise that we will then have the single market.  We must recognise that we must now create an environment for the Trustee Savings Banks to be able to expand their range of services to remove the impediments and to give them much more flexibility in the financial field and in the market place, something they have not got now.  If we do not do that and give this flexibility to the Minister and to the Trustee Savings Banks over the next three years, then we will be putting them in a very difficult and restrictive environment. This Bill is here to remove that situation and create an open environment for the Trustee Savings Banks.</P>
    <P>It is vitally important that, as the new <Col N="1378" /> legislation is passed, as to the new environment is created for the Trustee Savings Banks as they do their day-to-day business and change their options under the new ratios which will be agreed between the Minister and the Central Bank, that during the three years the matter can be reviewed.  The Minister has the flexibility to ensure that in the interests of the Trustee Savings Banks, of depositors and in the interests of the nation, the Trustee Savings Banks have the same quality of opportunity and financial environment as have the Associated Banks and the other international banks, who will locate in this country after 1992.  I see no reason why we could not be consistent and allow this provision which is in other legislation.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 9, subsection (4) (b), line 41, after &ldquo;information&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;but, in any case, the Bank shall, not later than 12 months after the receipt of an application for a licence, either grant the licence or give a notification under subsection (3) (a) to the persons who made the application.</P>
      <P>I have been concerned for some time that in the very competitive business world that, hopefully, our various interest groups of different sectors are now performing no official difficulty or delay should be put in the way of them proceeding with their business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have in mind the fact that at the moment if you are looking for planning permission you go through your local authority, the matter is appealed to An Bord Pleanála and there is no statutory <Col N="1379" /> time limit within which An Bord Pleanála must consider third party appeals and various other appeals before them.  I accept, if the Minister would consider what I am trying to achieve, that he may prefer to re-word it to achieve the objective.</P>
    <P>I would like a finite time limit on this section, for obvious reasons.  I make the comparison with the An Bord Pleanála situation.  I would like the Minister to take that on board and to consider it. What I am trying to achieve now in this section has rationale and logic on its side and I do not see technical difficulties in putting in the finite time I have requested. If the Minister feels that I am being unreasonable in the length of time I am suggesting, I would prefer if it were possible to tighten it; but, if that cannot be done, I will accept any case he can make so long as there is a finite time limit on the issue.  It is only a matter of time before An Bord Pleanála is statutorily restricted in the length of time it may consider. Indeed, there may be other examples in officialdom at the moment in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with what Senator Doyle has said, that she wishes a provision for an outside limit of 12 months from the date of application on the granting or refusing of a licence on the basis that this limit applies in the case of banks seeking a licence under the Central Bank Acts.  The existing Trustee Savings Banks would be granted a licence straightaway under subsection (7).  Given the unique structure of the Trustee Savings Banks, it is very hard to see how a new Trustee Savings Bank would be set up or why anyone would want to do so, even though the Act would not preclude it.  New banks wishing to set up here would do so as companies and so would come under the Central Bank Act rather than burdening themselves with the Trustee Savings Banks structure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to assure the House, and give this personal assurance to Senator Doyle and her colleagues in this House, that if such an occasion should arise a 12-month overall limit would be strictly observed <Col N="1380" /> because strictly the Trustee Savings Bank would come under the control of the Central Bank.  The Central Bank has its own Acts to operate.  It also has international agreements and international law, particularly Community law, to operate under. Taking all those into account, I want to assure the House that in regard to the totality of legislation, both national and international, under which the Central Bank operates the 12 months limit will be strictly adhered to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for a positive response to the objective of my amendment.  Would it not be possible very simply either by using the words I have suggested or alternative wording if the Minister or his advisers see fit, to incorporate the point I am making and, if I understand the Minister correctly, a point he subscribes to as well?  I accept there will not be a clamour for people to open new Trustee Savings Banks <i>et al.</i>  I fully accept the point the Minister makes, but it makes for far tidier legislation, particularly if we are going to restrict by time the length any official body may have to sit on decisions such as this and other similar type of decisions in the future.</P>

      <P>The advice available to me is that the commitment has been given for an overall limit of 12 months and it will be on the record and must be honoured.  Taking into account the Central Bank Acts and the other international financial rules, regulations and directives under which the Central Bank, as a supervisory financial authority in this country, must act it would be unnecessary to include this provision in the Bill.  Once we give the assurance that it will be operated on the 12 months limit, once the other laws, rules and regulations are there it would be automatic and, therefore, it is unnecessary to have it enshrined in the Bill.</P>

      <P>No.  In order to ensure the best legislation possible is available for the Trustee Savings Bank and taking into account that the three year limit, which we have now agreed to, is enshrined at this stage, that puts the Trustee Savings Bank into a particular category for the next three years.  If we are to delay that, it means we are pushing them further down the road and we believe that would be detrimental.</P>

However, he said something that concerns me dreadfully.  Are we wasting our time here today until 1.30 p.m., and next week also if we do not get through all the amendments today in trying to achieve any amendments to this Bill?  Some of us have put a lot of time, effort and work into studying the Bill and proposing amendments that we think would improve it.  The Minister may not agree and we may have to agree to disagree ultimately but if the Seanad is to make any sense in terms of scrutining legislation that has come to this House from the Dáil, we must at least feel that what we are saying will be taken at face value, debated on merit and that, if necessary, the Bill can go back to the Dáil and be amended.

He has given an assurance that a 12 month overall limit will be strictly observed and adhered to.  If the amendment was not down, then that categoric assurance would not be given.  This was not given in the Dáil.  Of course, the <Col N="1383" /> Seanad has a clear effect on this legislation. The opinions expressed here in a very positive manner, and in a very sincere and dedicated way, are being incorporated so far as is possible.  Taking into account the totality of legislation which affects the Central Bank, both internationally and nationally, and the rules and regulations under which it must operate, I am saying that it is unnecessary to enshrine the amendment by way of legislation because the other laws are already there.  We give the assurance that the 12 month limit will be observed so the effect of the amendment will be operable.</P>

It augurs for goodwill between the Government and the Opposition if we feel we can get some of our amendments taken on board.

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 10, subsection (8), line 5, to delete &ldquo;not&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The position is that as you look through the Bill a tremendous amount of power is given to the Central Bank with regard to the question of laying down policy on how the Trustee Savings Banks should function.  The Minister will be involved in a substantial amount of consultation with the Central Bank with regard to the behaviour and policies of the Trustee Savings Banks.  The Minister will be taking the advice of the Central Bank.  There is a tremendous amount of power being handed over to the Central Bank in the Bill.  Without raising that as a major objection, the logic of it seems to be that, if you give somebody power and authority, if after long and detailed consideration they embark on certain policies and if something goes wrong with those policies, they then shall not be held responsible for what went wrong with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 8 states that the grant for the licence shall not constitute a warranty as to the solvency of the institution concerned and the Central Bank shall not be liable in respect of any losses incurred through the insolvency or default of a person to whom a licence was granted or the Trustee Savings Banks in respect of which it is granted.  We have had some <Col N="1385" /> very bad experiences in the past, such as the problem with the AIB, etc.  The Central Bank laid down their policies on how they behaved, but it all fell back on the State in the final analysis.</P>
    <P>We are saying here is that the word &ldquo;not&rdquo; is an out for the Central Bank. They are allowed, in a very extensive way, to lay down the policy that the Trustee Savings Banks will have to make themselves compatible with the other financial institutions.  They have all that power.  They have all that authority delegated to them.  By and large, the type of consultation they have with the Minister is a lot better than the type of consultation a worker will get with his employer.  It will be consultation and agreement.  The worker gets consultation but not necessarily agreement.  They have a lot going for them in the Bill; yet we want to take them off the hook.  If, as a result of their policies and of putting pressure on the Trustee Savings Banks, this exposes the Trustee Savings Banks to the others, then they should be responsible. I cannot see the need for the wording &ldquo;shall not constitute a warranty&rdquo; and &ldquo;shall not be liable in respect of any losses incurred through the insolvency or default of a person to whom a licence is granted&rdquo;.  You can control how a business develops, expose it to the market place and to the EC.  Somebody may decide to go into another area because of the pressure put on him to be competitive. Policy is laid down by the Central Bank and yet the Central Bank is not to take any responsibility for it.  I cannot see the value of the word &ldquo;not&rdquo; in the subsection I have very strong objections to it.</P>

      <P>Of course.  The proposed amendment would effectively make the Central Bank liable for the solvency of a Trustee Savings Bank and for any losses it incurred.  This would not be acceptable.  The law, as it stands, does <Col N="1386" /> not put this position on the Central Bank. The Central Bank would be responsible for the prudent supervision of the Trustee Savings Banks, but it is going much further and beyond the bounds of acceptability to expect that the Central Bank should be legally liable for Trustee Savings Banks losses.</P>
      <P>In that event the bank will effectively have to run the Trustee Savings Bank on a day to day basis and this would not be on.  The present position is that there is no formal legal State guarantee of deposits to depositors.  As 80 per cent of deposits are lodged with the Minister for Finance, these are in effect guaranteed to the Trustee Savings Banks against default.  The remaining 20 per cent of the resources of the banks are invested prudently and profitably, and it will be the function of the Central Bank to ensure that this continues.  When this legislation is put into effect the proportion of deposits lodged with the Exchequer will only be reduced to the extent that there are opportunities for prudent and profitable expansion of Trustee Savings Banks business.</P>
      <P>This is not a new situation.  It is based on the existing section 1 of the 1891 Savings Banks Act which states that a Trustee Savings Bank may not be designated or described in any manner which imports that the Government is responsible or liable to depositors for any money placed in the safe keeping of the bank. Going back to 1891, the law is clear.  It does not in any way designate, describe or import that the Government or the Minister for Finance would be responsible or is responsible or liable for depositors' money or for its safe keeping.</P>
      <P>Reference was made to assurances given in the past by the Minister for Finance in 1984, when there was an exceptional level of withdrawals of deposits from the Dublin Trustee Savings Bank. In 1984 the then Minister for Finance was satisfied that the Trustee Savings Banks were entirely solvent and were in a position to repay all their depositors in full.  I am happy to state that this continues to be the case today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the proportion of Trustee Savings <Col N="1387" /> Banks funds invested with the State gradually reduced, the Trustee Savings Banks will be brought under the deposit protection scheme provided for in the recent Central Bank Act.  We can be absolutely certain that, due to the prudent and professional management which has been exercised so well for so long by the Trustee Savings Banks and which we now hope will be expanded and enlarged in the new financial environment, there will be no risk as such to depositors' money.</P>
    <P>Reference was made by Senator Harte to the situation pertaining to AIB and a subsidiary of it, the ICI.  That was a different situation in that ICI, due to its own risk taking, found itself in financial difficulty.  The AIB, acting on the direction of the Government and under the supervision of the Central Bank were able to provide resources and the State acted as a catalyst which protected the ICI situation.  There is no real comparison in that situation.  We can be absolutely certain, on the performance of the Trustee Savings Banks in the past, of their solvency, of their professionalism and of their expertise.  In the future, when this legislation is passed, they will only expand and confirm the great work they have already done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not pressing the amendment.  When the AIB and the other institution got into trouble, sorting themselves out was not of immediate concern. The public were to be held responsible. It was because of a lot of screaming and rejection of the attitude of the AIB and other institutions, that finally they got around to taking the responsibility.</P>

      <P>I want to briefly comment on the amendment.  As we know, the proper supervisory role for the future of Trustee Savings Banks will be the Central Bank.  When you have such a wide range of financial institutions, including the banks and the building societies, they all should come under the one supervisory authority.  It would be unfair and unreal to expect the Central Bank to be liable in respect of any losses incurred through <Col N="1388" /> the insolvency or the default of a person to whom a licence is granted or the Trustee Savings Banks in respect of which it is granted.  The logic of Senator Harte's amendment is that they would have to be liable to every building society and to all of the other commercial banks that come under their control in a supervisory role. I am not disputing for one moment, the Senator's right to put down the amendment, but I honestly feel it is something that could not be taken on board for the reasons I have given.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 11, between lines 14 and 15, to insert a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the provision of this section a person who holds a licence or to whom a licence is intended to be granted may appeal in writing to the Minister against any decision by the Central Bank to impose a condition in relation to that licence or to amend or add to the conditions of that licence and the Minister before deciding on the appeal shall consider any representations duly made to him and his decision thereon shall be final and conclusive.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This deals with the whole area of the granting of a licence by the Central Bank. We are not talking about a bit of business that is likely to be done too often, if ever, in the future, but we must have our legislation tidy and correct.  If we are providing for it at all, the provisions should be sufficiently detailed to satisfy everyone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two points here.  One is in <Col N="1389" /> relation to the appeal procedure.  What the Minister is providing for is an appeal to the Central Bank against conditions on licences.  I am requesting that that appeal should be to the Minister and not to the Central Bank.  There is an anomaly here, too, because the conditions we are referring to in relation to the licences, and which may be attached to licences issued by the Central Bank, are not provided for in this Bill.  We do not know what conditions &mdash; the reference is only to &ldquo;a licence shall be subject to such conditions, if any, as the Central Bank may impose...&rdquo;.  Perhaps the Minister could indicate to us why we will not be privy to what is in the Minister's mind or the Government's mind in relation to these conditions.  It is possible that we are buying a pig in a poke here.  If we transmit powers to the Central Bank which have not been spelled out in this Bill, we are again removing from the Houses of Parliament any right to question this aspect of the Bill in future.  Thankfully, the Central Bank is effectively independent.  Any powers we transmit to the Central Bank should be detailed in this House and in the Dáil so that we know in a democracy exactly what powers were transmitted. To allow the Central Bank to apply any conditions that may be necessary whenever is far too broad a statement and too broad a power to transmit.  I do not object to the principle of the Central Bank attaching conditions, providing we debate in this House and in the Dáil what those conditions are and on what basis they may be imposed.  We respect the independence of the Central Bank but we do not transmit powers without detailing them in this House before we transmit them.</P>
    <P>There are two points &mdash; one of relinquishing power from the Houses of Parliament to the Central Bank without detailing what those powers are and why they are being relinquished, and secondly I would like the appeal procedure to be to the Minister and not to the Central Bank, as is the case in the Central Bank Act.  The Minister has quoted the precedents and the need to have different bits of financial legislation behaving in <Col N="1390" /> the same way.  We talked about the Companies Act, the ACC Act, the Building Societies' Act and all of these other things.  By having the appeal procedure to the Central Bank in this Bill we are doing something that is not done in the Central Bank Act.  Under the Central Bank Act the appeal procedure is to the Minister.  I would like to ask the Minister to consider my amendment very carefully. To appeal to the very body that has just imposed such conditions on you against those conditions makes very little sense.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>Who would the Minister consult?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is another point.  The Minister would have the final say in the appeal.  I accept the Minister will negotiate and consult with the body.  We can go back to the planning appeals procedures.  When one appeals to An Bord Pleanála, An Bord Pleanála go back to the local authority that granted or refused.  They have to do so to find out what went on.  If that did not happen they would be very foolhardy.  I do not think the ultimate decision in relation to the appeals should rest with the Minister rather than the Central Bank.  There is a precedent for that.  So taking the Minister's words, I am asking first that we detail any conditions which we are now going to allow the Central Bank to attach to licences &mdash; if we are relinquishing the power we want to know what power we are relinquishing.  In any parliamentary democracy, that is only fair.  Secondly, I would like the appeal procedure to be to the Minister rather than to the Central Bank who will, after all be the body issuing the conditions originally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I want to assure Senator Doyle that I am, and have, and will give the maximum consideration to all amendments put down by her or any other Member.  The Central Bank will have broadly the same supervisory powers as in the case of the Building Societies and the licensed banks in this country in relation to the Trustee <Col N="1391" /> Savings Banks' situation.  This provides for conditions in this section 12 which we are debating, to be attached to licences at the discretion of the Central Bank. Senator Doyle wants an appeal procedure to the Minister for Finance incorporated into this section.  The consent of and appeal to the Minister is included in the sections 10 and 13, where a refusal to grant a licence or a revocation of an existing licence arises.  This follows the exact same procedure as the Central Bank Acts, section 9 of the 1971 Act and sections 32 and 34 of the 1989 Act.  The question of conditions attaching to licences is essentially a supervisory matter and as such is appropriate to the Central Bank without the involvement of the Minister.  The provision in this Bill reflects the position in the existing Central Bank Act, section 10 of the 1971 Act as amended by section 33 of the 1989 Act.  Among the areas which could be covered in the conditions attaching to licences are a requirement to get Central Bank approval for branch expansion, limits on lending to particular sectors, an upper limit on the amount of individual loans, the extent of a bank's exposure on any particular area, conditions on loans to trustees, and so on.  I stress that in all of this the Central Bank are guided by what is prudent for the institution under their supervision.  They must retain discretion here.  This is exercised in the interest of the prudent and orderly regulation of all the banks under their control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I still feel very strongly that if this House cannot examine the type of conditions that may be attached to any such licences, we should be loath to relinquish any democratic power in relation to them.  Once this matter is handed over entirely to the Central Bank we will not be in a position, in this House or the Dáil, to question any matters.  In the Dáil they have the parliamentary question procedure and the response will be &ldquo;Sorry, it is not a matter for the Minister for Finance.  It is a matter for the Central Bank.&rdquo;  There can be no discussion in relation to the matter if we <Col N="1392" /> agree with what the Minister is proposing.  I ask him to reconsider and include in the legislation an expanded version of his reply to me just now, when he gave an indication of the type of conditions that might attach to the licences. He still has not explained why it is not possible to be more specific in relation to the conditions involved.  Perhaps he could respond to me on that.</P>
      <P>In relation to my second point covered by my amendment, I still cannot see how an appeal to the Central Bank against conditions imposed on a licence makes any sense from the appellants' point of view.  The Central Bank will be the body that will have initially imposed those conditions.  They are not going to make liars of themselves by rejecting any conditions they have initially imposed and say: &ldquo;sorry, we were wrong, you were right, all right, here goes.&rdquo;  You need an arbitrator.  You need a third person in relation to appeals like this.  I am suggesting, as there is provision for another section in this Bill &mdash; and the Minister pointed that out &mdash; that we allow the appeals in this section to go to the Minister for Finance, rather than back to the Central Bank, the body that issued those conditions originally.  That makes common sense.  It is fair and it is equitable.  You do not appeal to the body which originally imposed those conditions.  You need a fair third party appeal and the Minister would provide that function in this case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to Senator Doyle, I would have to say we must, as a Legislature, be consistent in the type of laws we pass, particularly in relation to financial matters.  In all the other situations pertaining to banking licences and building society law, we have given supervisory powers to the Central Bank.  We have been consistent in the Trustee Savings Banks Bill.  It is important that the right of appeal is there.  This is enshrined in sections 10 and 13.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While one can appreciate Senator Doyle's idea and motives to have a third party appeal, it is important in any democratic situation that, if a person puts <Col N="1393" /> forward a proposal and makes an application for a licence, the Central Bank would not be in a position to give a robotic answer, whether it is yes or no.  If they refuse, the applicant should have the right to appeal, to make their case and to expand on the proposal.  They should be in a position to show that they are people of repute, that they have the necessary expertise and resources and, perhaps, are in a position to be able to persuade the Central Bank to give them this licence and to give them the opportunity necessary to operate in a financial environment.  The fact that we have done this gives the right to a body, a group or an individual applying under this section for a licence to appeal and to have an opportunity to make their case in a broad open, oral manner.</P>
    <P>In most cases I would accept that the bona fides, resources and expertise of the applicant would ensure that they are not going to make an application for the sale of making it to the supervisory financial authority in our country.  In most cases if an application is put forward they would know themselves that they had the competence, expertise and the resources to be able to operate.  We have here given this appeal system.  We have been consistent with the Central Bank Acts and with the supervisory position pertaining to other financial institutions.  I regret that I will not be able to accept this section.  I hope the fact that we have the appeal mechanism will allay the fears of the Senator.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I just say, finally, that the Minister's need to be consistent in defence of his argument perhaps should be questioned.  If by being consistent the Minister is, in fact, compounding irrational behaviour, irrational decisions or illogical decisions taken previously, we need to examine it very carefully.  If I were applying for a licence and conditions were attached to it under this section by the Central Bank, I would not like to have to appeal to the very body that attached those conditions against some of the points I considered unsatisfactory.  If what the Minister says makes <Col N="1394" /> sense, why is it that we do not allow planning applicants appeal against decisions of local authorities back to that local authority itself?  There is a very good reason why we do not.  For the very same reason and with the same logic I am asking the Minister to allow the appeal be to the Minister.  There may be only one or two such applications in our lifetimes, if any at all.  But there should be an outside third party.  The Minister could barely be considered a third party.  It is more like the Minister for the Environment when he used to decide on planning appeals before we instituted An Bord Pleanála to remove it altogether from the political system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>It was, although we need to tidy up a lot of areas.  At this stage the Minister has referred to the need for consistency, but there is a precedent in other areas for going to the Minister.  The Minister has told us that in other areas there is a type of self-determination on appeals, but in this case I am appealing to the Minister to allow the decision on an appeal to be made by the Minister. After all, the Minister will consult with the Central Bank.  At least we should remove the final decision on appeal from the body that imposes the conditions initially.  It makes no sense, Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I just respond briefly to Senator Doyle on that?  It is important that we are consistent.  We are dealing here with a financial institution. If we are to give it the same level playing field and create equality of opportunity for it as for other institutions, we must be consistent.  We must ensure that we have the same supervisory authority and the same type of appeal mechanism.  We cannot compare a planning situation to a financial situation.  Planning situations are very individualistic.  They are very local and are totally different.  They have an environmental impact.  We are talking here about finance.  The rules of finance are controlled by solvency, security, <Col N="1395" /> supply and demand and the rules of commerce.  The financial environment operates in that totality.  If the Central Bank is the supervisory authority for other licensed banks and for other financial institutions, with the same rules and regulations broadly across the board, then it is important that consistency is enshrined here and that we have the same rules, regulations and controlling mechanism for the Trustee Savings Banks as we have for other financial institutions.</P>

      <P>In page 13, subsection (1), line 17, after &ldquo;determine&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;The Central Bank shall take account of the rates of interest charged and paid by other licensed banks and building societies in fixing these rates.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am not suggesting that my attempt at parliamentary drafting could not be vastly improved on, but there is a point which I want to make here which I believe is very important.  We have been quoting the need for introducing a level playing field in relation to the handling of the different financial institutions and in the financial area generally.  That has been used as a defence and as a reason for a lot of the sections we have discussed and will be discussing here today.</P>
      <P>Section 15 details certain controls and requirements of Trustee Savings Banks. This is not the case with the other financial institutions in their legislation.  I would like an explanation as to why we are treating Trustee Savings Banks differently to the other financial institutions and at the same time insisting that there is a level playing field generally in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1396" /> This section requires Central Bank consent for the fixing of interest rates, maximum liabilities and a number of other matters in relation to Trustee Savings Banks generally.  It could be suggested that these requirements draw on the special position of the Minister for Finance in guaranteeing the debts of Trustee Savings Banks.  The Minister made an interesting point on this aspect in his concluding statement on Second Stage yesterday.  Perhaps he could expand on that today as we deal with this section.</P>
    <P>This section refers to consents.  It is the view of many that these are not helpful in achieving the level playing field position which we all state we aspire to for all financial institutions.  Perhaps the Minister could state again where the Government stands in relation to the guarantee, notwithstanding what he said yesterday and expand on what he said yesterday. Was it ever there?  With the powers we are now transmitting to the Central Bank they will never be answerable again to the Houses of Parliament unless this legislation is amended.  Could the Minister deal with this entire section while responding to my amendment and say why we are treating the Trustee Savings Banks differently in terms of the specifications that are laid out under this section? There are informal arrangements with other banks.  There are monthly and quarterly returns and so on, but there are no explicit requirements of the other financial institutions such as we are now requiring under this section of the Trustee Savings Banks Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Going back to the 1871 Saving Bank Act, that Act ensured that nothing could be described, included or imported that would make the Government or the Minister for Finance liable <Col N="1397" /> for the security or the solvency of funds in the Trustee Savings Banks situation. It was for the Trustee Savings Banks, in consultation with the Minister for Finance, to decide on various matters and, through their professionalism and man-agrement and careful, prudent operation of their business, ensure that they had a solvent operation.  They have proved that conclusively over many years.  What the amendment is providing for is that the Central Bank should have control over the rates of interest on loans and deposits.</P>
      <P>Senator Doyle proposes that, in determining how Trustee Savings Banks interest rates should be fixed, the Central Bank should take account of the rates charged and paid by other licensed banks and building societies.  It would not be possible for the Central Bank to fulfil its role or to implement regulations or supervisory powers over any institution if it did not take into account the day to day financial markets, the day to day interest rates, and all the criteria that affects the whole money market situation.  This will be done in any event. Therefore, it would be inappropriate to provide for it in legislation.  The Central Bank will have to take account of, and does take account at all times, the general market rates in settling the Trustee Savings Banks rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because the Trustee Savings Banks is a unique structure, totally different from other financial institutions, this section is enshrined here.  The Central Bank has an agreed mechanism with the other Associated Banks <i>vis-à-vis</i> how interest rates are arrived at and when they have to be increased.  Of course, the Central Bank itself at times, due to international and other pressures, has to push their rate up. The other banks, in a normal trading commercial pattern, have no option but to allow their rates to be increased also. Consequently, for some reason, be it good management of our national finances or whatever, interest rates may drop. The Central Bank rate may go down and obviously the other banks would follow suit.  The same situation would prevail here with the Trustee Savings Banks. <Col N="1398" /> Consequently, it is unnecessary and inappropriate to enshrine it in the legislation.</P>

The fact that the Central Bank will have this supervisory role and will have this consultancy situation in controlling performance, will ensure that the playing field is level and that equality of opportunity will prevail right across the board.</P>

      <P>In page 15, lines 5 and 6, to delete subsection (1) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  There shall be not less than five and not more than ten ordinary trustees of a Trustee Savings Bank and in addition there shall be two worker trustees.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 14 provides that there shall be two workers directors or trustees of the Trustee Savings Banks.  The other amendments are basically knock-on effects from that.  Amendment No. 15 provides that these worker directors shall be elected as soon as is practicable after the passage of the Bill.  Amendment No. 17 provides that the trustees of the Trustee Savings Banks shall be appointed by the Minister with the consent of the Central Bank.  That is simply a safeguard to a second safety net to ensure that whoever is appointed should be appropriate <Col N="1400" /> for the position.  They should have, as well as the consent of the Minister, also the consent of the Central Bank.  The burden, of course, of this amendment is that the people who work in the Trustee Savings Banks should have a say at the top table.  They should have a say as to how decisions are made.</P>
    <P>The Trustee Savings Banks, despite the fact that they were not working on a level playing field, to use the Minister's term, have been a considerable success.  They have certainly been a great success in relation to how they have responded to the customers' needs in regard to customer facilities, etc.  They have provided long opening hours.  All of these facilities for the people who deal with those banks could not have been provided were it not for the help and co-operation of the people who work in the Trustee Savings Banks.  Were it not for the commitment of the workers right across the board at all levels in the Trustee Savings Banks, they would not have been &mdash; to use a computer term &mdash; as consumer friendly or as user friendly as they have turned out to be.</P>
    <P>If the Minister would accede to these amendments it would be a recognition of the tremendous contribution that the workers at all levels in the Trustee Savings Banks have made to the development of the banks to their present state. Of course, there are other reasons why this amendment should be accepted. They relate to the fact that in enlightened industrial relations now it is widely accepted that workers need to be involved right up to the very highest levels in the management of the company.  It is important that their views should be taken into consideration if we are to avoid industrial conflict.  Those who look at the history of industrial relations in the banking world over the last 20 years or so are only two well aware of the industrial relations difficulties which have arisen in banks other than the Trustee Savings Banks over that period. People are still familiar with companies which have gone to the wall &mdash; and indeed, dare I say it, organisations that the Minister would be familiar with from <Col N="1401" /> his farming background.  Cattle marts went &ldquo;bang&rdquo; during one of those bank strikes arising from difficulties in relation to cheques.</P>
    <P>It is absolutely fundamental that industrial relations harmony is preserved in the Trustee Savings Banks.  It is a time of turmoil for them.  They are bound to be worried and concerned.  The workforce must be concerned as to the impact of the changes which are taking place.  It is very important that reassurance be provided for them that their interests will be defended and spoken for at the top table where the crucial decisions will be made.</P>
    <P>There are people who have suggested to me that when this Bill is enacted there may be possibilities of redundancies. There certainly were redundancies in the Trustee Savings Banks in Great Britain when they were privatised.</P>
    <P>I want to say very clearly that we are opposed to any notion of privatisation and are also opposed to the provisions in this Bill for privatisation.  I do think that, one way or the other, it is very important that the workers' views &mdash; and that is all the worker's views &mdash; should be expressed in what I think is a relatively modest proposal; simply that there should be two of the ten directors elected by the workers.  There are worker directors, as we are all aware, in a whole series of semi-State companies &mdash; CIE, ESB, Bord na Móna, the Sugar Company, to name but a few.  The place has not caved in since they took over.  People suggested that there would be all sorts of problems. There have not been.  The experience has been a useful one.  I have absolutely no doubt that their contribution has been very worthwhile indeed.  I certainly think that the contribution they have made in relation to the development of those companies has been very worthwhile.  We have seen a period of industrial relations harmony in these companies since worker directors came in.  They have improved the whole industrial relations situation in those companies.  It would be an example for the other banking institutions if <Col N="1402" /> worker directors were appointed or a provision was made for their appointment in the Trustee Savings Bank.</P>
    <P>Having said all of that, I hope the Minister will be able to accede to these amendments and will be able to accept them because as I believe strongly, they would improve the industrial relations climate in the Trustee Savings Banks and would enhance the opportunity for development in the Trustee Savings Banks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to comment on this briefly and ask the Minister a query or two.  Before dealing with the specific amendment, we would probably all agree that for varying reasons, amalgamations and so on, there has been a tendency to increase the number of trustees over the last years to a point where they have become excessive at times.  The right balance is being struck in having a maximum of ten.  As the previous speaker has said, the contribution by many trustees over the period that the building societies have being operating in bringing the trustees to the level that they are today is a matter for congratulations.</P>
      <P>Going on to the amendment, in the knowledge that the Trustee Savings Banks are not corporate bodies, are not companies within the Companies Act, and mindful of what is contained in section 57 of this Bill, that an order may authorise the reorganisation of one or more Trustee Savings Banks into a company referred to in subparagraph (i) or (iii) of paragraph (c), would the Minister comment on this aspect, if it is feasible for this amendment to be taken on board or must they go fully into the company situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 17 relates to the number of trustees.  The main requirement is that for the future the number will be between five and ten and the consent of the Central Bank should be required for the appointment of trustees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Upton and his colleagues have tabled amendments to provide for the election of worker trustees.  This is a variation of the worker directors and I concur <Col N="1403" /> with what Senator Upton has said about the contribution of worker directors on various boards and bodies.  They have made a vast and wonderful contribution and we look forward to further contributions.</P>
    <P>The Senator has also proposed that these trustee directors, who are not elected, should be appointed by the Minister for Finance with the consent of the Central Bank.  Under the existing legislation the trustees are in effect a self appointing body as existing numbers coopt new members and it proposed to continue this arrangement.  It is not an ideal arrangement.  It may have been in the past when trustees were well-known local people who served in a voluntary capacity in the interests of the community.  This is now changing, especially as they can be paid for their work on these boards.</P>
    <P>In defence of the existing system it must be said that the record of trustees over very, very many years is excellent indeed.  The Central Bank will be exercising a supervisory function over the trustees and the Central Bank's consent would be required for the appointment of new trustees.</P>
    <P>In response to Senator Fallon, I should say that if the Trustee Savings Banks convert to company status in the future under section 57 then the normal company procedures regarding directors will apply.</P>
    <P>On the question of worker appointees, this is really a matter for the trustees to consider in consultation with the Central Bank, and the Minister for Finance should not be involved.  The Trustee Savings Banks are not State bodies; they are a unique structure set up under specific legislation with specific, clear guidelines.  If we are to create a level playing field environment for all financial institutions the supervision must be uniform and standard.  It is only reasonable to expect that that supervision be given by the authority which already controls and supervises the other institutions.</P>
    <P>Therefore, in this situation it would not be possible to accept these amendments. I regret that this cannot be done.  If, <Col N="1404" /> however, the Trustee Savings Banks do convert in the future under section 57 to company status then, of course, the director situation would be what the Senators aspire to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to repeat what I have said already.  I am suggesting that the worker directors be appointed because of the fact that we believe it would improve the situation.  We are putting the amendment forward as a way of improving the Bill and we are also suggesting that the trustees should be appointed by the Minister rather than that you should have a situation where the lads, as it were, go on co-opting more people.  That is not desirable.  It is a question of control.  Who is responsible?  In the last analysis, if the Minister appoints the trustees, then it is the Minister who will be answerable.  If the trustees go on co-opting one another, what is the story? It seems to me to be much more important that somebody should be pinpointed as holding the responsibility, in the form of the Minister, rather than that people should go on co-opting one another indefinitely.  That is the main burden of these amendments &mdash; this concern that there should be worker directors.  I am happy to see the Minister agree with me in relation to the general principle of the value of worker directors.  There is no doubt that they have made an immense contribution in the organisations that they have been elected to.  This is a useful situation in which we can continue to exploit the developments which have taken place and provide for their election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>On the section generally, I welcome the fact that the Minister did make some attempt at detailing the procedure for the appointment of trustees.  If I interpret him correctly, they will continue to self-appoint, full stop. Perhaps he could expand on that because this was a glaring omission from the section, that no details were given in relation to the procedure for appointing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the next section there is provision for an upper age limit, which I will have <Col N="1405" /> something to say about shortly.  What is the lower age limit, if any?  We need to clarify that for the record.  Does one assume that, providing they behave themselves and do not act fraudulently or anything else, they will have tenure for life?  Can I assume that these trustees when self-appointed by the board of trustees will, in fact, have tenure for life if they do not behave fraudulently?  That is my question.  Do they come in at 18, 21 or any age in theory, and sit it out until they are 70, regardless of their competence? Apparently we do not question competence as a requirement at any stage.  This is important, for two reasons mainly because we are limiting the number of trustees to ten.  If you have a majority &mdash; I will not call them incompetent &mdash; of people lacking in forward vision and unable perhaps to face into the nineties and the next century that we are talking about now, there is no procedure for removing them unless they behave fraudulently.  I am subject to correction on that.  As far as I can read in the Bill, I do not think there is any procedure. They may sit it out until they are 70; and with the upper limit of ten you cannot, either through the Minister or by self-appointing or whatever is the procedure, add to that board the breadth of experience that may be necessary.</P>
    <P>The second point is that in relation to amalgamation, where temporarily there may be more than ten trustees, they may be allowed to wither naturally down to the ten that is suggested here rather than having a broad section representing community workers, perhaps, a doctor, a businessman or an accountant or two. You could end up with a total board of accountants, for example, and you would not be able to bring in outside experience even if the particular Trustee Savings Banks happened to need that experience. There could be logistical problems in providing the right experience and the breadth of experience that any board of trustees will need with the restriction to ten and the fact that we are now saying that at 70 you go.  You come in at some bottom age limit and can sit it out.  Maybe the odd blast might struggle in there <Col N="1406" /> somewhere but knowing Irish society there will not be too many of them.  You can sit it out until you are 70 and if you do not act fraudulently you will be tolerated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, will the Minister tell me where in this Bill there is a method of getting rid of people who are not contributing to the extent that the board needs contributions?  If there is a lack of experience and you are tied to ten, how can you bring in the experience you need from other fields?  You cannot.  The tenure for life in the absence of doing something strange is effectively what we are talking about.  I understand that the UK and Northern Ireland Trustee Savings Banks behave differently in this area.  Perhaps we could learn from their experience.  Perhaps there is something there we could piggyback on and borrow from.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>We must recognise the fact that Trustee Savings Banks have served the country and the banking system well over the years.  They have operated in a very restrictive environment, with a 20 per cent lending ration, which is virtually impossible.  I cannot understand how they survived and did so well in that very restrictive operation that they had.  I am sure they have their own mechanism as to how they can promote <Col N="1407" /> people upwards or sideways and eventually give them a bequest or a presentation or going away document that will indicate that their time has come to move on and give opportunity to new blood.</P>
      <P>This Bill is putting a lot of control over the Trustee Savings Banks.  It is giving supervisory authority to the Central Bank.  There will be consultation between the Minister for Finance, his Department and the Central Bank pertaining to their operations over the years ahead.  Up to now there was no control over the trustees.  Senator Doyle is right &mdash; I do not want to deny that fact &mdash; that trustees once appointed may remain there unless the trustees themselves decide to replace them.  We are providing an upper age limit.  There is no lower age limit but I am sure the age of majority would have to operate at the very least.  I think they would be well into the summer of their career before being appointed to a board of this type.  Basically, the situation is that the trustees would remain there if they so wished or if the trustees themselves decided to remove people or unless something went wrong, that the Central Bank itself had to intervene and give a directive to the board through the trustees that a certain person or persons for some reason or other were not suitable or not reputable to be a member of the board of a Trustee Savings Bank.</P>
      <P>As I said earlier, under section 57, if the Trustee Savings Banks did convert to corporate status, then the rules of directorships would apply to that situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the basis of the Minister's last statement that the Minister concerned has and will continue to have consultation with the Central Bank, which is a Government bank, would the Minister not accept that the Minister should have some responsibility in the appointment of worker directors? Senator Fallon suggested that we must await the company aspect.  In view of the fact that the Minister has a responsibility to one of the bodies which will be the main body following the Trustee Savings <Col N="1408" /> Banks being incorporated, surely the Minister should have some responsibility or some say in whether or not there should be worker directors in the revised bank if he is responsible for the Central Bank?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that it would be appropriate for the Minister to intervene in the appointment of trustees. The law, as it stands at the moment, gives special status to the trustees and to the Trustee Savings Banks.  We are changing that law now but we do not propose to change the status of trustees.  We are giving supervisory powers to the Central Bank.  Taking into account the role they play with other financial institutions, it is really a matter for the trustees in this case to decide what is best unless the Central Bank otherwise decides.  It would be an unnecessary incursion by the Minister for Finance if he were to be in a situation where he was to be appointing trustees to a financial institution when it is not his function to appoint other people in other areas, apart from the Central Bank.  The fact that he would be appointing directors to the Central Bank, the fact that there would be consultation, is significant and the fact that we are at least putting new controls over the Trustee Savings Banks in line with the other banks.</P>
      <P>I will take the wishes expressed here to the Minister for Finance and to his officials and, hopefully, to the Central Bank from there, so that these wishes can be expressed and maybe eventually incorporated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to take up some of the points I was referring to on the last day we took this Bill.  I did in my introductory remarks compliment both Ministers involved on their capacity to deal with the problems raised, because they are people I know from past experience who are in full possession and full control of their brief.  I made some, I will not say flattering but some positive comments on the Bill and on the performance of the Ministers.  However, I also indicated that <Col N="1411" /> I had grave reservations, and I do. Having had the opportunity to re-read the Bill, my reservations are confirmed. Although I accept absolutely the intention of the Minister in proposing this legislation, I have to say that that intention seems to me to be so seriously subverted and contradicted by the Bill as drafted that, were I not convinced of the good intention of the Minister, I would have to regard it as a piece of fraudulent legislation, because it seems to me that, rather than deal with the problems outlined from all sides of the House, it actually operates to confirm a very dangerous situation.</P>
      <P>I gave a couple of instances.  If I may encapsulate briefly, the principle sources of decay and blight within the cities of our country, and I speak with particular feeling about the city of Dublin, are twofold.  One, there are the local authorities &mdash; Dublin Corporation, for example. Senator Hederman spoke with great passion and vigour of her position inside Dublin Corporation on this point.  That is the first one, and the most serious.  The second is like unto it, and the second is property speculation.  For that reason I am exceedingly concerned that it appears as if there is a specific intention &mdash; and this occurs both in the Bill and in what the Minister has said &mdash; to exempt from the operations and scope of this Bill the activities of property speculators in assembling sites within the city of Dublin. This must give pause to anybody who wants to speak on this Bill.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer briefly to a very important book by Frank McDonald in which he says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The very people who are destroying the city within through their plans to reshape it for cars, at the cost of demolishing literally hundreds of buildings, are Dublin Corporation.  Indeed, Dublin Corporation and the Government's principal contribution to the city in its Millennium Year was to transform once bustling Parnell Street into a major dual carriageway with instant trees and cobble on pavements <Col N="1412" /> replacing pubs, shops and guesthouses in terraces of three- and four-storey Georgian buildings.</P>
    <P>As Deirdre Kelly of the Living City group observed, &ldquo;Recently the engineers discovered trees.  Maybe in time they will also discover that it is buildings which make a streetscape.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is highly dangerous to exempt local authorities or even to place them in the situation of being judge, jury and executioner under the terms of this Bill in disputed questions of dereliction.  I am not convinced that they will act against what they perceive to be their own interest.  With regard to planning for transport, particularly for the private car, we ought to learn from the experience of other major European cities; and nothing in this Bill that convinces me that we have in fact so learned.</P>
    <P>I have a couple of examples to give and I would like the Minister to explain a little bit to me how this Bill will work in order to assuage the concerns of people like myself and the vast majority of the citizens of this city, how it will work to prevent or to halt the kind of situation we are confronting every single day.</P>
    <P>The first one is a situation that is currently ongoing in Bachelors Walk &mdash; Nos. 5, 6 and 7 listed buildings.  No. 7 is on list one.  It is being placed on list one; and not only is the exterior listed but the interior is listed.  It is a very remarkable panelled interior.  What has been happening is this.  A couple of years ago Arlington Securities started assembling its sites there.  The buildings were allowed to go vacant first and then derelict.  Lead was stolen off the roofs.  Vagrants got in, cider parties were held, one building went on fire and an application was made to demolish that.  The demolition process disturbed the adjoining building so it had to be brought down to ground floor level leaving only one building.  What is the fate of that last surviving building going to be?</P>
    <P>Can the Minister assure me that under this legislation that list one building with a listed interior will be protected?  If so, <Col N="1413" /> why is a clear signal being given to property speculation &mdash; and I might point out to the Republican Party that the interest involved in this is none other than British Aerospace who recently bought Arlington Securities?  &ldquo;Aerospace&rdquo; is a very fitting word for it, because they have succeeded in creating one of the biggest aerospaces in the city of Dublin by the assembly of this site.  I would like to feel &mdash; but I am not at all reassured by this Bill &mdash; that they would be subject to the most stringent of its provisions.  Otherwise, we have no feeling for the heritage of this city.  I do not have to remind either Minister that one of the principal axis of this city is along the river with the quays. Every capital city that is placed on a river respects the vital importance of the quay side as a spine of the city.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Vocational Education Committee and Nos. 18 and 19 Parnell Square, this is an ongoing scandal.  The VEC are a statutory body.  They are controlled by Dublin Corporation, as I understand it.  Would I have any undertaking that the appalling dereliction of duty they have shown in their utter disregard for the preservation of property publicly vested in them as the guardians of State property would be properly monitored? We are dealing with some of the most important 18th century buildings in the city centre in the charge currently of a statutory body.  They have deliberately ignored appeal after appeal to do something about it.  Three years ago Ian Lumley from An Taisce wrote to them reminding them of their obligations, advised them that there was a problem of vandalism and that the buildings were deteriorating.  His letter was not even answered.</P>
    <P>In an article that appeared in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 20 November this year Frank McDonald &mdash; I again refer to him and we should be grateful for the service of this courageous journalist in drawing our attention to these problems &mdash; telephoned the chief executive of the VEC because it had become clear that five very important Adam-style classical marble fireplaces had been removed, an entire <Col N="1414" /> staircase was removed and a painted ceiling with panels reputedly by Angelica Kaufmann were taken out.  Five fireplaces, a ceiling and a central staircase, which in a house of that size is absolutely massive, were removed and the response of the chief executive of the VEC was that he did not respond to business matters outside office hours and without an appointment.  In other words, exactly what happened with Ian Lumley &mdash; a blunt discourteous refusal to accept responsibility.  Does the Minister consider that this is good enough on the part of somebody charged with responsibility?</P>
    <P>I may point out that the effect of the policy of various Governments and of the Corporation of Dublin in depopulating the area between the two canals means that this can go on in our principal squares.  I would like to tell the Minister a cautionary tale.  During the week a similar attack by these vandals was carried out in North Great Georges Street, a couple of doors down from my house, and two important but not so important marble fireplaces were dismantled.  But because there were people on the QV all the time, this was noticed, the removal of the fireplaces was halted, the door was secured of a vacant house and the fireplaces were stored in property belonging to other members of the society.  As individuals we were acting as watchdogs.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister convince me that the VEC will be prosecuted under this proposed legislation?  I understand that legal action is pending by a concerned citizen against the Vocational Education Committee and I would like a clear undertaking from the Minister that this kind of situation will not be tolerated.</P>
    <P>I have two other examples I will deal with quickly.  One is in Eccles Street where over the last few years a situation developed where the Mater Hospital and the Mercy Order of nuns, who do very good work, I must say, in the hospital, extended their empire all the way down Eccles Street and they have now succeeded in demolishing one entire side.</P>
    <P>They also commenced operations on the side opposite the hospital and gaps started to open up.  A number of us, in <Col N="1415" /> particular the Students Against the Destruction of Dublin, got involved.  I got involved in it, too.  They took action as individuals in the High Court against the Mater Hospital and the directors and the order of nuns.  The interesting thing that emerged was this, and I would like to quote from <i>Saving The City</i> by Frank McDonald:</P>
    <P>From the affidavit sworn by Mr. McGowan for the High Court case it emerged that the Mater had realised in May 1986 that the roofs of the houses were in need of major repair but no work was carried out.  A year later a report by the hospital's consulting engineers pointed to the inevitable consequences of this lack of maintenance, referring to continuous water penetration which considerably weakened the roof structure, top floor and second floor.  By January 1988, not surprisingly, another inspection by the consulting engineers found that further substantial deterioration had occurred to such a degree that the roofs and floors had become structurally unsound.  It was at this point that the Mater invited the Corporation's Dangerous Building Section to inspect the three houses, again with inevitable consequences; and though a local firm of architects, Breen and Kelly, who had restored a Georgian house on the street argued that it would have been a perfectly practical proposition to renovate rather than demolish the Mater's three houses, it was the opinion of the Dangerous Buildings Section which prevailed, even though none of the eight area inspectors were qualified architects or structural engineers.  Indeed, in 1967 the Supreme Court judgment declared that in the case of appeals to the District Court against dangerous buildings orders, a court may in no way alter or modify the work directed to be carried out or the conditions under which they are to be carried out or review the opinions of the sanitary authority as to the appropriateness of the works required <Col N="1416" /> to be carried out or enter into the question of whether the structure is or is not a dangerous structure.</P>
    <P>In other words, we have another classic example of a defaulting bad landlord deliberately causing the dereliction of buildings which they wish to demolish. May I remind the House that not far from here on the south side, just to even things off and make sure it is not all happening on the north side, No. 29 Clare Street was acquired by a property speculator, although it was a list one building, and was substantially demolished on foot of a dangerous buildings order.</P>
    <P>I have one further case I would like to draw to the Minister's attention.  I did mention briefly the last day that I felt there was a problem, that there was no opportunity for a private citizen to have recourse to some judicial review regarding the dereliction of buildings.  I speak with some feeling on this issue because I live next door to a house which is part of a portfolio of about 300 18th Century properties owned by an absentee landlord.  In that property there were a couple of sweatshops and there is now what I can only assume to be a brothel.  It is a house that specialises in what I am told is &ldquo;relief massage&rdquo;.  It does not matter to me.  People presumably need to be relieved.  I am not particularly pushed one way or the other.  But what I do object to is the increasing dereliction of the house, coupled with the annoyance caused to my basement tenants by people who seem to think that the service is generally available all over North Great George's Street.  I do not see any possibility in this legislation for me to bring this person to court and force either a refurbishment or a sale.</P>
    <P>For this reason I appealed to the Minister to contemplate something that is not perhaps directly involved in this Bill but I think is an important point I hope he will review, and that is the establishment of an officer, a receiver of derelict buildings, who will have the authority to go in to apply to the court to be appointed receiver of a building like that, to go in without even the consent of the owner, <Col N="1417" /> complete all the necessary refurbishment work and offer the building, first, back to the defaulting owner at the price of the renovations and then, if that is not agreed, place it on the open market and give the difference back.</P>
    <P>I have since been speaking to people and I am informed &mdash; perhaps the Minister could tell me, perhaps not &mdash; that some such appointment was part of the discussions leading to the formation of the present Government, that this was something that the Progressive Democrats in particular had in mind as part of their little shopping list.  I was told they understood that this was agreed.  I would like the Minister to confirm this and to tell me if there is a date when legislation will be produced to give some teeth to the situation, because this Bill as it stands now simply does not do it.  I would like to amplify this by pointing to the fact that we wash our hands and wirrasthru all the time about the destruction of Dublin.</P>
    <P>We think that by listing buildings this has some effect.  It has absolutely no effect whatever in law.  The Minister is aware of this, because his attention was drawn to it last year by Michael Keating in the Dáil when he asked the then Minister for the Environment, Deputy Pádraig Flynn, who is once again in this position, in February 1988 if the Minister had any plans to strengthen the flimsy legislative protection for listed buildings. The Minister suggested that the existing powers were adequate and that he had no proposals at present to change the situation.  That is worrying.  I am sure that the Minister of State, Deputy Connolly, must be aware that I have listed a catalogue.  It would be most wrong and greedy of me to spend the whole time this afternoon reading out a list.  I have given three or four examples and they are all different.  I could spend several days giving the Minister instance after instance of list one buildings that are being pulled down, so that the listing has no real compelling effect, it has no substance in law, it is merely a gesture.  I would like to ask if something really serious is not going to be done about this matter, which I think is really the nub of the question.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1418" /> The Minister will be aware that I have placed a number of amendments to the legislation and I hope that he will consider them.  Some of them may be capable of a satisfactory answer.  I know that both Ministers Flynn and Connolly are in charge of their briefs.  They know what they are talking about and they may be able to explain the circumstances so convincingly that I will be able to withdraw them.  I am not going to deal with the substance of them now.  I would like to say one thing on the principle of amendments, because it has been said to me on a number of occasions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the main principles of the Bill is that it should be seen to be effective and the process of review in this Chamber is rendered totally ineffective if, for reasons of the practical management of political business, there is no intention whatever of accepting any amendments.  It may be possible, and it has been suggested to me, that there is not a hope in blazes of getting amendments through in this Bill because it would have to go back down to the Dáil. I am sure that this very relevant point will be addressed by the Minister and that he will indicate that there is a chance of reasoned amendments going through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are also one or two other small points that I would like to make.  One is that section 32 provides that moneys received from sale or lease of land acquired under the Act should be applied by the local authority for the purpose of their functions in such a manner as, with the consent of the Minister, they shall think proper.  This is a most inappropriate element in the Bill.  This is precisely what has vitiated the question, for example, of the Road Traffic Act and the motor car tax.  People bitterly resent paying tax because they see it disappearing for all kinds of other unspecified functions.  I believe that in order to be a proper, complete and logically consistent Bill, the moneys gathered from this should go <Col N="1419" /> directly to the restoration of the inner cities, in this case of Dublin.  I say this with some force because the answer that we so often get with regard to the restoration of our architectural heritage, however now, thank God, we are all prepared to realise is vitally important economically as well as culturally, usually is &ldquo;We would live to do it but there is no money&rdquo;.  There is not going to be much money if we apply moneys attracted in taxes and levies from derelict sites to building sewage outfall works.  Why should this provision be there?  Why should the tax not be tied back in to the damage?  Make the penalty fit the crime and apply the penalty to the amelioration of the criminal act.  I could be tempted to speak at enormous length, because it is something I feel very strongly about but it would be quite wrong.  I hope to have the opportunity to present some amendments later.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>During the period of four and a half years that I have been a member of Dublin City Council I have become very much aware of the inadequacies in the legislation dealing with derelict sites contained in Derelict Sites Act, 1961.  I have examined the new Bill in detail and I have discussed its provisions with the relevant senior officials of Dublin Corporation.  In general, both the councillors and officials are pleased with the Bill, in particular with the much stronger penalties which can be imposed on property owners who do not maintain their property to a reasonable standard and also the levy which can be imposed on owners of derelict land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very pleased that the new definition of a derelict site will include ruinous or unsightly buildings which detract or are likely to detract from the amenity or <Col N="1420" /> appearance of the neighbourhood.  This should enable the local authorities to be much more effective in removing such objectionable eyesores.</P>
    <P>When this Bill was discussed at the General Purposes Committee of the council a technical defect in the definition of an owner was drawn to our attention. The definition of an owner excludes a mortagee not in possession.  It is considered that this may cause difficulty in some cases and the definition should be amended to include a mortagee not in possession.</P>
    <P>The Bill also places an obligation on all public bodies, Departments of State, local authorities, health boards, vocational educational committees and semi-State bodies to maintain their properties in such a way as to prevent them from becoming derelict.  This is a welcome provision as bodies of this kind should give a lead to private property owners in the maintenance and management of their property.  All public authorities should be determined to give a lead to the general public in the matter of care and maintenance of public property.  In Dublin we have found that, where the local authorities embark on improvements and the provision of amenities, this encourages all the local residents and firms to upgrade their properties.</P>
    <P>This is a very useful piece of environmental legislation and I hope it receives the support of all the Members here.  I would like the Minister to have a look at that point I made in relation to mortgagees, and perhaps he would come back on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I wish to welcome this Bill.  All of us who are members of local authorities recognise the difficulties and problems that derelict sites have created right across the country throughout our towns and cities.  This Bill contains basically ten main provisions which will give to local authorities additional powers they need.  There are certain reservations I have about some sections in the Bill and on Committee Stage we will be suggesting certain amendments.  One of the <Col N="1421" /> requirements on local authorities is that they maintain a register of all derelict sites.  That provision is appropriate and one that all of us will welcome.  One of the matters that concerns me is this.  What guideline will local authorities use to ensure that a derelict site in one county differs from that of another?  That is one of the things on which we should seek clarification.  Indeed, I would ask the Minister when he is replying to clarify what criteria will be used to define a derelict site and how the same criteria will be used in each particular county.</P>
      <P>A number of the provisions included in this Bill give local authorities additional powers and also provide for additional funding with regard to the levy.  One wonders what criteria are going to be used for the levying and for defining a levy <i>visà-vis</i> the city as against an urban area, which the Minister referred to in his speech.  I would like to know precisely how this levy is going to be defined and what criteria will be used.  That is very important.  It cannot be emphasised enough that there should be a broad level of agreement as between one county and another.  As the Minister knows, I come from an area within a few miles of four or five different counties.  I would like to see the same criteria used for the definition of a derelict site in each of those counties.  I would not wish to see a different standard applying in each county. This is what I refer to when I make this point.</P>
      <P>Another requirement in this Bill puts an onus on owners of property not to allow that property to become derelict, and again that is right and appropriate. Unfortunately, very often we see in our towns and cities throughout the country property which has become derelict.  That is a great pity.  The State should use its influence in ensuring that that does not happen and does not continue to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Very often in this situation we find that people allow their property to become derelict simply because they know that, as inflation continues and as property prices rise, in their long term interest they are going to benefit.  They are reluctant to spend money to update this property <Col N="1422" /> and bring it into use, when if they simply leave it lying there they are going to have the advantage of it because of inflation. It is right that there should be a levy to ensure that this does not continue.  There are certainly advantages there.</P>
    <P>One of the areas which worry me, which, is not spelled out in the Bill and which I would like clarified when the Minister is replying is: what are the implications of this Bill for rural areas?  That has not been defined.  The Minister in his speech referred to the fact of urban areas being levied, which would to some degree indicate that rural areas are excluded.  I would like to know from the Minister precisely what are the implications of this Bill for rural areas?  At present many rural areas throughout the country have a dwindling population, emigration is rife and we have many vacant houses in rural areas.  What is going to happen with regard to this Bill?  How is it going to deal with that situation?  I would like clarification of this matter from the Minister when he is replying.</P>
    <P>We have a reducing number of thatched cottages throughout the length and breadth of this country. Many of those could be described as derelict buildings under the 1961 Act.  I would like to know from the Minister what precisely he has in mind under this Bill with regard to that type of house?  Unfortunately, many of the type of houses I have described have fallen into dereliction.  It is a great pity that the house improvement grant was discontinued because with that grant many of those houses could be brought up to an acceptable standard.  While it is not within the definition of the Bill, would the Minister indicate to the House what proposals, if any, his Department have to deal with this situation?  It would be a great pity if those thatched cottages, which are part and parcel of the culture and history of this country, are allowed to dwindle and disappear.  Many county councils are now giving a grant to have a thatched roof replaced by slates or other type of roofing.  That is a pity.  The Minister <Col N="1423" /> should examine this and see what can be done about it.</P>
    <P>Very often when major road improvements have been carried out there are sites left where the road line has been changed.  What does the Minister propose to do with these sites, which are very unsightly and undesirable from the point of view of our tourist industry.  Many of our semi-State bodies have been very careless with regard to leaving properties in a derelict state.  Semi-State companies, such as CIE and Bord na Móna, have left property in an undesirable state.  It is time that those boards were made responsible for the condition in which they leave their properties.  On our lakes and rivers we often see sights which none of us want to see &mdash; boats in a dilapidated condition, many of them left there for years.  I would also like to know what the Minister proposes to do about this.</P>
    <P>In the last few years the OPW bought a property and seemingly forgot they had purchased it.  They let that building fall into a dilapidated, derelict condition. Not alone had they to come along some years later and spend vast sums of money in doing the property up but they also had to pay compensation for adjacent properties.  The full rigours of the law should be applied in that case.  It is undesirable that a State body should be allowed to purchase property and let it fall into dereliction simply because it would appear that nobody knew that the property existed.</P>
    <P>I believe the definition of ownership of a derelict site will cause problems in the years ahead.  This is one area in the Bill which has not been adequately covered or adequately spelt out, I would like to hear what steps the Minister or his Department propose to take to define who owns a property.  It will be of vital importance to the success of this Bill that the ownership position is clearly defined and that the State will have the power to establish ownership of a particular site. Without those powers and without that being defined in the Bill it will be very difficult for the Bill to have any real meaning.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1424" /> In welcoming this Bill we all must recognise that dereliction has been one of the greatest scourges of the scenic beauty of our country.  Tourists visiting our country unfortunately very often get the wrong impression by the way we have allowed our derelict sites to spoil the beauty of the country.  It is time we introduced legislation to clear this matter up.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill, I believe that its provisions will reclarify the situation.  I am, however worried about another aspect of the Bill.  Will the local authorities be able to maintain a register and establish the number of derelict sites in each area?  What additional resources will be given to the local authorities to provide this information?  That has not been clearly specified in the Bill.  Over the last number of years &mdash; you, a Chathaoirligh, like myself, being a member of a local authority will be well aware of this &mdash; additional functions have been given to local authorities, but unfortunately no additional funds to carry them out.  The Water Pollution Bill, the Abattoir Bill, the Air Pollution Bill have given additional powers to local authorities, but no additional finance or no additional personnel have been approved for the purpose of carrying out this legislation. Local authorities will have to get additional resources to implement the powers contained in this Bill and I appeal to the Minister to make additional funds available to local authorities.  I cannot see how they will be able to maintain a register and keep it up-dated if they do not get additional funds.  As the Minister knows, many of the local authorities today are merely ticking over and cannot carry an additional workload without getting additional funding.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier the situation with regard to the Office of Public Works, I have no doubt that many other Government Departments have been responsible for allowing buildings to lapse into a derelict state.  That is undesirable and should not be allowed to continue.  I welcome the Bill and will be putting down amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome <Col N="1425" /> this Bill and record my appreciation of the work that has been done by Senator Norris who, unfortunately, is not here at the present time.  He has probably done more than the Derelict Site Bills we have had in 1940 and 1961 to draw attention to the dereliction in Dublin and to get the community interested in the preservation of our heritage.  It is only proper that that should be recorded.</P>
      <P>One might say that all of Dublin is a derelict site because there are so many areas of dereliction.  I have no doubt that the measures presented here will go some way to dealing with the immediate, though individual problems, as distinct from the overall environmental and planning issues that are required.  The extending of the definition of &ldquo;derelict site&rdquo; to include dwellings and other structures, the establishment of a register of derelict sites, the duties that are put on authorities and owners and occupiers of sites and buildings are all very desirable.  The onus on the local authorities and the powers that are given in relation to the acquisition of derelict land by local authorities and the levies, penalties and taxes that are to be meted out are all desirable objectives.  They will address specific instances of dereliction.</P>
      <P>Of course, we must look at dereliction in a wider context and that wider context must be in the area of urban renewal, environmental planning and protection, and overall city development and planning.  In 1991 Dublin will be the cultural capital of Europe, yet in the Dáil the other day we could not get any commitments in relation to substantial funding to ensure that Dublin will be a showplace and that the extensive dereliction that permeates the capital, particularly the inner city, will be remedied in time.  That is an area of planning and of a comprehensive approach but, again, the question of funding of resources is not being addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have the scandal of five listed Georgian houses in Arran Quay and Batchelors Walk which were demolished in January of this year by the car dealers, Linders of Smithfield.  The other day Bord Pleanála granted approval for an <Col N="1426" /> office development even though those listed buildings were demolished illegally.  It is an absolute scandal that people can flout the law with impunity and get what they want in the long term.</P>
    <P>This Bill will not address a serious problem that has destroyed five houses along the quay front in the inner city. Two other houses on Batchelors Walk, Nos. 5 and 6, have recently been demolished and a third, No. 7, is threatened because of its serious condition, It is an 18th Century panelled house which has been purchased by Arlington Securities who want to develop the area for a massive shipping centre.  This is another fine part of the waterfront.  I am worried that there is no protection.  We have seen already where parts of Lower Fitzwilliam Street, Hume Street, Molesworth Street and Wood Quay, fine areas of our heritage, have been demolished.  Are we now to witness the demolition of Dublin city quays from the Phoenix Park to the sea? That is the fine old quay front that can be seen on the ten pound note.  There is nothing in this Bill that will prevent the continuing demolition and vandalism of the inner city.</P>
    <P>In relation to the stock of public housing, the corporation in recent years have been negligent in not maintaining the existing stock.  A lot of that is in need of refurbishment already but also in need of essential services.  There are 2,000 units in the city centre without bathrooms or shower facilities.  Virtually all of the stock, because of lack of funding, has been allowed to fall into major disrepair. This, Bill, of course, does not address that problem so public housing is an eyesore.</P>
    <P>The inner city has a very extensive quantity of public housing.  Indeed, where something is being done, as in Sheriff Street, we are not talking about refurbishment but de-tenanting, where, because of a particular development in the financial services centre, it is better to get rid of the people than to think about refurbishing the existing property. The public housing stock is in a dreadful state of disrepair and there are no provisions that I can see in this Bill for its renewal, its protection or funding to <Col N="1427" /> ensure that it does not fall into further disrepair and become a worse eyesore.</P>
    <P>There are many omissions in the Bill and on Committee Stage I will be introducing appropriate amendments.  Probably the most glaring failure in the Bill is resources.  Where will the staff and finances be got from to ensure that the provisions and duties, particularly of the local authorities, will be implemented? How will all the local authorities be able to identify, catalogue and compile the sites?  Will they do this on fresh air? Where will they get the funding?  How will they monitor the development that will take place for which they are responsible? How will they acquire the sites and develop them?</P>
    <P>There is no indication how funding will be made available to provide the necessary skilled trained staff to effect these functions.  That is a glaring failure.  You cannot introduce legislation responsibly unless you provide the means, methods and procedures to implement it.  While this Bill addresses the immediate problems of the scandalous state of many of our towns and cities, which have become wastelands particularly the inner city of Dublin, unless the local authorities, who are empowered to implement the provisions, have the initiative, imagination and, crucially, the staff and financial resources, to enable the measures to be introduced, the Bill will be useless.</P>
    <P>To this end the local authority councillors and officials must concern themselves with the needs of people living in urban communities.  In aiming to obliterate direliction they must strive to enhance the environment, the appearance and attractiveness of urban areas for residents and visitors alike.  The city's appearance and success depends on what people, both residents and visitors, think of it and what they want it to be.  Creating an appropriate and successful image helps to revive the city's sense of identity and self-confidence and also helps to change perceptions and to overcome prejudice.  Dublin, as I have said, has fallen into a scandalous state of dereliction, because of the developers, the <Col N="1428" /> negligence of owners, occupiers and the inadequate planning legislation and support of local authorities.</P>
    <P>Dereliction is symptomatic of industrial and commercial decline in the inner city.  Due to the problems of traffic congestion, inadequate parking facilities, and an inefficient and a grossly underdeveloped public transport system, much of the city centre has become a wasteland.  Despite the fact that so much derelict land is available for redevelopment in the heart of the city, planners seem committed to building new towns in the suburbs, duplicating, or in many cases, making people live without facilities which already exist in the city centre.  The population of the inner city has decreased by over 50 per cent in the past 60 years. Any plans for urban renewal must involve bringing people back to live in the city, not de-tenanting the city and getting rid of communities in the inner city.  There are over 600 derelict sites within the canal ring in Dublin city amounting to a total of 161 acres.  This level of dereliction in a city where there is a dearth of public amenities and a lack of suitable land is totally unacceptable.</P>
    <P>Land assembly for developments or road widening schemes that may never take place is one of the primary causes of dereliction in our cities.  In many cases land assembly for a proposed development may take up to 40 years, as was the case with the Ilac Centre in Dublin.  Until this Bill is enacted and implemented there is absolutely no incentive for property owners in the city to maintain their property in a proper way.  In fact, dereliction has been positively encouraged in our cities as owners are not liable for rates for such a property.  Dublin Corporation have been assembling sites for over 30 years and it is unlikely that they will be used for road widening schemes in the near future.  It is a sad fact that the main culprits of dereliction in many cities are the local authorities.  One derelict site in a generally well-kept and cared-for street, such as Mount Street, does not have the same impact as a whole street area of dereliction like Summerhill or Sheriff Street.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1429" /> Bord Fáilte are promoting our heritage in the form of our Georgian and Victorian architecture, particularly in Dublin city and county and, as I mentioned before, in 1991 Dublin will be the cultural capital of Europe.  Unless drastic action is taken to implement the provisions of the Bill tourists can look forward to visiting a cultural capital in decay.  Terraces of Georgian houses facing demolition, overgrown derelict land with ugly hoardings exploited by advertisers and used as rubbish tips will be in full view.  If our tourists are looking for parking they can, of course, use one of the many illegal car parks for which these sites are used.  We have a bare 12 months to make Dublin a cultural capital of which we can be proud.</P>
    <P>Property has duties as well as rights. Speculators and developers do not have the right to hoard land and deface our city in order to make huge profits.  Many owners of derelict sites are retaining these and have no intention of developing them until they are designated tax incentive areas and they can make a huge profit.  It is absolutely disgraceful that the city has had to become such an unsightly mess before action will be taken.</P>
    <P>In 1986 John Boland, who was then Minister for the Environment, launched the urban renewal incentive packaging that was supposed to bring about a new age for the quays and other neglected areas.  As I pointed out, little has happened there other than further dereliction.  Of the 161 acres that lie derelict in Dublin, only 62 have definite proposals, leaving 99 problematic acres.  The Urban Renewal Act has designated certain areas within the inner city for special and immediate attention.  Only 10.5 acres of the 99 are located within the designated incentive areas.</P>
    <P>Urban renewal is posing a problem for our planners.  The experience of other cities such as Glasgow and London indicates that any policy for urban regeneration must include a comprehensive plan to bring people back into the inner city.  The population of the inner city has decreased by over 50 per cent in the past 60 years.  In regenerating our urban population, local authorities must take the <Col N="1430" /> initiative but they must do so in conjunction with the local communities.</P>
    <P>Many houses are in a dilapidated state throughout the inner city.  Much upper floor space is under-utilised.  Many multistorey buildings have been demolished in favour of single storey shopping outlets. The vacant floor space could be converted into flats for single and married people working in the city.  This would have many cultural benefits assisting the arts, tourism, growth in community self-confidence and a reduction in crime.</P>
    <P>In any plan for urban renewal the public sector must take the initiative.  It is not sufficient to produce disincentives to dereliction.  The problems will not disappear with the enactment of this Bill. Alternative uses, both temporary and permanent, must be provided.  Sites that are to be developed in the near future must be developed in such a way that the street or locality maintains its essential character.  In many cases a derelict site is a temporary site but large flats and office developments are more permanent fixtures that reinforce the view that planners are totally uncaring for the cultural heritage of our city.  In many cases dereliction and demolition of some of our finest buildings could be prevented if local authorities had the funds to help maintain and preserve buildings.</P>
    <P>The 1963 Planning Act empowers local authorities to assist private owners with the cost of maintaining existing buildings. However, no funds have been made available from the Department of the Environment for this purpose.  Of course, this is the real nub of the matter we are discussing in this Bill.  Owners should be required by law to keep listed buildings in good repair and, where it can be proved to be necessary, financial assistance should be available from local authorities for the maintenance of these buildings.  Apart from being unsightly, many derelict sites are definite health hazards.  Rubbish on these sites encourages rodents to infest the site and often the area.</P>
    <P>The greatest number of derelict sites in the north inner city occur in areas such as Summerhill, Blackhall Place, North <Col N="1431" /> Strand, Sheriff Street, Mary's Mansions and so on.  They are all located in residential areas &mdash; working-class areas where there is a high level of corporation housing.  These areas totally lack recreational facilities.  Many children play on cleared sites and apart from the health hazards of rubbish tipping, many of these sites are positively dangerous.  Many of them could be converted into temporary sports grounds, adventure playgrounds, wildlife gardens and parks.  Work could be carried out at a minimum cost, perhaps with the aid of FÁS and SES schemes, thereby providing training and employment in the area.</P>
    <P>Such schemes need to be supported by local authorities.  In order to tackle the problem of derelict land, in many cases temporary solutions can provide the best way to improve the environment while the land is waiting permanent development.  As Dublin Corporation are one of the principal owners of derelict land in Dublin, I urge them to consider the benefits of short term leases to community groups and associations as a way of offloading many such sites for a temporary period of time.</P>
    <P>The possibilities for temporary use of derelict sites are endless, ranging from temporary wildlife parks and urban farming to adventure playgrounds.  One example of how this can be done is how the Active Retirement Association of Oxmantown acquired a derelict site from the corporation at the junction of Audley Road and Oxmantown Road.  With the help of the corporation they have turned this into an invaluable recreational facility for the old age pensioners in the area.  The game of French bowls is played there every afternoon.</P>
    <P>Many derelict sites already have an interesting flora and they could be converted into valuable recreational and educational facilities as temporary wildlife parks.  This could be achieved at a minimum cost.  Other ideas include the reintroduction of allotments in the city. This would not only enhance the environment but would also serve as a precious <Col N="1432" /> educational resource and would introduce a civil spirit into an area.  The Minister should urge local authorities to take full advantage of section 20 (2) of the Urban Renewal Act.  Local authorities are too concerned with red tape and the level of bureaucracy.  This leads to a growing conservation as each is reluctant to experiment with new ideas.</P>
    <P>Private owners should also be encouraged to lease land to community organisations who would restore and care for it with civic pride.  While the terms of this Bill are welcome &mdash; and, indeed, they have been improved by the amendments that were passed on Committee Stage in the Dáil &mdash; it is imperative that from the enactment of the Bill local authorities compile the register of derelict sites, that the Minister give clear guidelines to the local authorities on the operation of such a register and that the Minister must guarantee that local authorities have both the necessary funding and staff to operate this register efficiently.  Otherwise, what we are doing here is passing a piece of legislation without teeth and without the means to ensure that it is implemented. If that is the case, how are we going to look in the years to come at this piece of legislation that promises so much, this reforming piece of legislation that is to fill the loopholes of the previous Bills which proved so unsatisfactory in preventing the continuing dereliction of Dublin?  It is the responsibility of the Minister to ensure that a desirable piece of legislation is given the necessary resources, backing and staffing to ensure that it is properly implemented.  As I said, I will be introducing on Committee Stage a number of amendments to seek to improve the substance of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to deal with a couple of points raised by Senator Naughten.  I am sorry he is not here because I do not like to be political in his absence on the issue he mentioned: house improvement grants the fact that they were discontinued and his hope that they would be renewed.  I hate to point out that when the Coalition Government were in power £37 million was provided in the <Col N="1433" /> budget for home improvement grants whereas the actuality was that they cost in excess of £200 million.  For somebody to be calling for the reintroduction of that type of home improvement grant, given that this Government had to provide £100 million in the first number of years they came into office, is going a little beyond belief.</P>
      <P>I would also like to remind Senator Naughten when he mentioned a scheme for thatched cottages that possibly he is not aware of a letter which emanated from Bord Fáilte to the local authorities asking them to look in particular at the development and preservation of thatched cottages within their jurisdiction.  I am glad to be able to report to the House that in Cork we provide a £1,000 grant from our own coffers in respect of the retention of thatched cottages.  I also understand that in Dublin something similar is happening.</P>
      <P>I am amused when I hear Senator Costello, in particular, talking about additional resources being made available.  Who is going to pay for this register that is set up by the local authorities in connection with derelict sites?  It is comical in that in this country local authorities have more engineers than we can find work for.  For the Labour Party in this Seanad to be calling for additional resources for local authorities verges, in my view, on the comical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I might come to a number of issues relating to dereliction, everyone is agreed that dereliction is a blight on the horizon. It gives an image of want and decay.  It is certainly not conducive to investment.  It is offputting to tourists.  It gives a perception of a flagging spirit among the people where dereliction is rife.  There is certainly not a city or town in Ireland where derelict sites are not in evidence. What I would like to do from time to time is put myself in the position of, say, an outsider coming into a city or town, having a look at what is around me and objectively asking myself the question &ldquo;What improvements could be made?&rdquo; Up to now, listening to the speakers who have spoken prior to me, I understood that this Derelict Sites Bill related to <Col N="1434" /> Dublin only.  You will not be offended, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, if I take it into the realms of Cork.  When I drive in from the Dublin side of Cork city, I must say there is one particular building that looms on the horizon.  I say to myself: would that the owners of that property replace a number of panes of glass and put a coat of paint on it.  The IDA in Cork are particularly concerned, dereliction and the image that Cork gives to the investor coming from abroad.  I think of the old adage &ldquo;By their image, do you know them&rdquo;.  Certainly in that area in Cork a lot of commercial properties have a lot to do.  I would say to the owners of such properties that they go out, have an objective look and take remedial action.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong in dealing with the Derelict Sites Bill if we did not have a look and take cognisance of the major improvements that have taken place.  I refer in particular to the Tidy Towns Competition, which in itself has brought about remarkable achievements over the years, so much so that the tidy towns committees find it hard to understand why, when in their individual towns they embark on a massive programme, at the end of the day their marks have not increased sufficiently.  It reminds me of students seeking third level places in colleges where there is a minimum requirement and at the end of the day, candidates find unfortunately that the minimum requirement is not sufficient to obtain a place.  In the same way this applies to the Tidy Towns Competition in that marked improvement has been brought about which has brought up the standards.  That being said, one must encourage the tidy towns committees to continue their great work and the achievements they have wrought for their communities.  These committees are extremely soundly community based and provide tremendous benefits for the people in their areas.</P>
    <P>May I also take the opportunity of congratulating the local authorities who have organised tidy districts competitions within their jurisdiction?  Where these have been organised the response has been truly magnificent.  Something that <Col N="1435" /> the Minister might take cognisance of is that in areas where these tidy district competitions are not taking place he should make it mandatory on the local authority to ensure that they provide adequate funding for such competitions. The Department of the Environment should encourage the various festival committees around the country to bring in tidy districts competitions as part of their overall festival activities.</P>
    <P>It should also be recorded that the establishment of the designated areas has also provided a major boost.  I acknowledge that developers have responded very positively to this scheme.  Again, if I may be parochial, we have two designated areas in Cork.  The larger site consists of 81 acres including the South Parish, the Marsh and part of Shandon Street.  The second one covers 18 acres and is on the north side of the city, covering Blackpool in particular.  If we take the south side one, South Terrace was particularly dilapidated and it has been an extraordinary success.  It has demonstrated that apartments can be marketed successfully in the city centre at price levels which make such developments economic.  I would exhort the Minister to consider very seriously extending particularly the Blackpool scheme.  When this scheme was initiated by the Coalition Government many of us in Cork felt it was a rather remarkable achievement that the party faithful seemed to be included in the designated area where those who were not supporters for some reason or another seemed to be kept outside the Pale.</P>
    <P>I would also like to comment on the refurbishment programme which was introduced and initiated by the Minister and funded by him.  Again, that has brought about a dramatic improvement to what were otherwise derelict houses. I would like to thank the Minister in particular for the £3 million which he made available in Cork last year.  I want to report to him today that the schemes have been a major success.  Areas that were once in the throes of dereliction are now beautifully restored and in the <Col N="1436" /> process the spirit of the people living there has been uplifted.  Once more they are taking a pride on their homes.  May I also take the opportunity to request the Minister to continue this funding into 1990?  Having examined the Estimates, it would appear to me that this is his intention.  It is my view that this is money very well spent.</P>
    <P>Coming to the Bill itself, the wider definition of derelict sites is appropriate in that it now includes dwellings which were excluded from the 1961 Act.  Taken in conjunction with sections 11 and 12 of the Bill, it would mean that action can be taken by the local authority against potential or early dereliction as well as actual dereliction.  This has to be seen as being a major step forward on the previous Bill.  The Minister said something like 50 local authorities never bothered with using the 1961 Derelict Sites Act.  The costs involved for them were prohibitive.  I think that was one of the main features, and also the fact that they could never recoup those costs.  We have a situation now where the local authority is mandated to establish and maintain a register of all derelict sites.  This will ensure their active involvement in administering the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>A positive result is that we can now quantify at last the scale of dereliction in each area.  In the case of urban areas we can allow the application of a derelict sites levy.  I would like to say to the Minister that it is one thing to set up a register but it is another thing to maintain and update that register.  I ask him to take particular cognisance of this fact.  We must ensure within the ambit of this Act that renewal of the register on an annual basis by local authorities is imperative.</P>
    <P>Dealing with the question of levy, it strikes me that we have been very successful when we provided a carrot for our citizens, as was evidenced by the massive sums collected under the tax amnesty.  It also strikes me that people would be far quicker to get rid of dereliction if they were given some sort of incentive.  I can see a disincentive for the person who immediately refurbishes his derelict building in that such a person then has <Col N="1437" /> a rateable commercial property on his hands.  Most of us will have examples of somebody who was paying no rates on a property without a roof but immediately he refurbished that property he found himself faced with a bill of £1,100 for rates.  An option to the owners of such properties might be provided by the Minister if a five year rates remission was applied to such premises, particularly if they were converted into a commercial activity.</P>
    <P>The Minister might, in my view, also consider the extension of section 27 of the derelict sites and buildings being converted into industrial utilities.  Under the old act the establishment of ownership proved to be extremely difficult.  In my own area a row of houses was involved. The owner was living in Australia and his legal representatives refused point blank to give his address.  For refusing to do so, that individual was levied with a paltry fine of £5.  Thankfully, under the new Act that situation has been rectified and the fine has been increased substantially.  I suggest to the Minister that he look at the possibility of making it compulsory, when property changes hands, that the rating authority be notified of the new owners and the rate records be given some legal status when it comes to derelict sites.</P>
    <P>When the Register of Titles Act was introduced it was envisaged that the Land Registry system could be gradually extended to the whole country.  Initially, the counties of Carlow, Laois and Offaly had this applied, but no further steps have been taken to have it extended to other counties.  At present, town properties are registered in the Registry of Deeds Act and not under the Registry of Titles Act.  I would ask the Minister to check the feasibility of having this extended also.  We are all aware of the unscrupulous measures taken by some to induce dereliction for their gainful purposes.  For those cases section 29, with its provision for increased fines, is timely.</P>
    <P>Another point to be aware of is that where people have been left derelict property.  Their financial circumstances may be such that they would not have <Col N="1438" /> the means to refurbish such property.  I express some concern that such persons might be criminalised under section 29 of the Act.  Indeed, I ask the Minister to have a look at the possibility of exemptions in particular cases.</P>
    <P>In the same vein, I refer the Minister to section 12 (3) of the Bill and pose the question of the constitutionality of the question that it may offend one of the principles of natural justice, that is, that no man can act as a judge in his own cause.</P>

      <P>May I, by way of very brief explanation, state that Mr. Mills' position is terminated on 1 January under the Act. Next week is the last week the Seanad will sit and tomorrow is the last day the Dáil will sit.  This matter must come before both Houses and be voted on by the Members in both Houses.

      <P>May I appeal to you, a Chathaoirligh, to reconsider your ruling? I respect your decision, but I would like to appeal to you in view of the enormous importance of the Office of Ombudsman and its resounding success.  The establishment of this Office was with all-party agreement.  There is a procedure whereby once the six years in office of any incumbent are over the party leaders get together and agree or approve the name of someone being put forward.  It also comes before Cabinet so that that agreement can be presented there.  Then it comes into both the Dáil and the Seanad.  To the best of my knowledge it had not come before Cabinet up to one hour ago.  The party leaders or the party whips did not get together on it.  Tomorrow is the last day's sitting of Dáil Éireann and we are finishing up our business here next week.  With respect, I consider it to be urgent because we must do nothing to jeopardise the future of the most important Office of Ombudsman.</P>

      <P>I was dealing with the question of the constitutionality of the Bill, particularly with reference to section 12 (3).  I was suggesting that it might have been one of those principles of natural justice, that is, that no man can act as a judge in his own cause.  It would appear that in the old Act there was a provision to appeal to the Minister when a notice of dereliction was served by the local authority.  I find no provision in this Bill for that.  I ask the Minister, therefore, to look carefully at this section to see if he could restore what was in the old Act.</P>
      <P>All in all, this Bill is a tremendous step forward and is a serious attempt to eradicate dereliction.  As such, I recommend it to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome this legislation.  It is a Bill which has been pending for some time and, indeed, a Bill the formulation and contents of which received much attention from John Boland, the former Minister for the Environment, and whose Private Members' Bill, I would like to suggest, indeed, prompted the introduction of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main purpose of this legislation is to provide for the most effective arrangements against urban blight, decay, dereliction and dilapidation.  The Long Title of this Bill states that it seeks first, to make a provision with respect to land to prevent it being or becoming a derelict site; second, to enable local authorities to require the taking of measures on derelict sites by the owners or occupiers; third, <Col N="1441" /> to enable local authorities in certain circumstances to acquire derelict sites by compulsory acquisition; fourth, to enable local authorities to establish registers of derelict sites; fifth, to enable the Minister for the Environment to give directions in relation to derelict sites and sixth, to provide for a derelict sites levy.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, true that one of the earliest, and indeed one of the most enduring, purposes and objectives of local government in Ireland has been to minimise and to control the impact of dereliction and dilapidation in urban areas, in our cities, towns and villages. However, the principal concern of the various town improvement Acts and public health legislation of the last century was with the physical and health dangers to the public arising from neglected buildings.  With the passing of the Derelict Sites Act, 1940 and its successor, the Derelict Sites Act, 1961, the primary emphasis was focused on the amenity and visual aspects of land dereliction.  However, these Acts had a number of serious limitations.</P>
    <P>The 1940 Derelict Sites Act enabled local authorities to secure the clearance of derelict sites but only by acquisition or the threat of acquisition.  On the other hand, the 1961 Act did not apply to dwellings, and could only be used when the sites had actually become dangerous, or indeed injurious to health or to the amenities of a particular neighbourhood. It would, of course, as the Minister has indicated be wrong and, indeed, counterproductive to build too much complexity into derelict sites' legislation.  The basic purpose of such legislation must be, and should be, to prevent and to quickly remedy situations which are immediately and obviously offensive from an environmental point of view.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt but that urban dereliction has become very extensive.  It poses a serious problem in many of our cities, towns and villages.  It takes away very much from the attractiveness of these places to our own people, to tourists and, indeed, to potential industrialists. <Col N="1442" /> So wide is the problem that the enactment of modern and efficient legislation is of paramount importance.</P>
    <P>This Bill contains ten main provisions and they will be welcomed especially by those of use who are members of local authorities.  I welcome them as a member of a local authority, Limerick Corporation, for the past 22 years and also as Chairman of the Limerick Inner City Urban Renewal Committee.</P>
    <P>The first provision under section 3 of the Bill is designed to widen the definition of derelict site so as to include structures which are dwellings.  The second provision under section 8 will require local authorities to maintain a register of all derelict sites.  The third provision under section 9 places a general duty on owners and occupiers of land to prevent land from becoming or continuing to be a derelict site.  The fourth provision under section 10 places a duty on local authorities to take all reasonable steps to ensure that land in their functional area does not become or continue to be a derelict site.</P>
    <P>The fifth provision under section 11 improves the enforcement powers for local authorities against dereliction and dilapidation.  The sixth provision under section 12 reserves powers to the Minister for the Environment to direct enforcement action by a local authority or remedial action in relation to land owned by a local authority.  The seventh provision under section 13 enables the Minister for the Environment, after consultation with the appropriate Minister, to direct any statutory body to dispose of land in their possession which is derelict and which is not necessary for the performance of their statutory functions.</P>
    <P>The eighth provision under sections 15 to 19 provides for improvement procedures in relation to the compulsory acquisition of derelict land by local authorities. The ninth provision under sections 21 to 26 provides for an annual levy based on the market value on certain derelict sites in urban areas.  The tenth provision provides increased penalties in respect of the summary and indictable offences.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1443" /> These are ten very worth-while, important aims and objectives in this legislation.  However, on closer scrutiny I have a number of misgivings about this Bill.  The definition of dereliction, as contained in the Bill, does not mean what the ordinary person thinks it means. Under this legislation dereliction can be avoided by somebody whe merely tarmacadams a piece of land in a priority area and leaves it there, clean and tidy. Under this legislation it appears to me that nobody is obliged to build on a site and this is one of the fundamental weaknesses of this Bill.</P>
    <P>There are, perhaps, indeed legal and constitutional problems related to certain sections of the Bill and we will be able to discuss that in more detail on Committee Stage.  I am pleased to note that section 24 of the Bill, as initiated, has been amended on its passage through the Dáil to take account of the view expressed by Mr. Michael McDowell when he as a Member of the other House that section 24 was constitutionally infirm.  He rightly stressed that the method of imposing the levy seemed to be arbitrary and to delegate extraordinary powers to the Minister for the Environment, allowing him, at his discretion, to vary the amount of the levy as between one place and another.  I hope the Bill is now legally and constitutionally safe although it may have to be looked at again.</P>
    <P>We owe a considerable debt of gratitude to Mr. Michael McDowell for the way he advanced amendment of the Bill as it passed through the Dáil.  However, I do not see any acknowledgment from the Minister or the Minister of State or any spokesman for the Government in this regard.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong to give the impression that measures to deal with land dereliction and urban blight are the exclusive preserve of derelict sites legislation.  Our physical planning system has, as one of its most important objectives, the preservation of amenities by local authorities and the renewal of obsolete areas.  The special scheme of urban <Col N="1444" /> renewal introduced by the previous Government in the Urban Renewal Act of 1986 was also designed to make intensive provision for the renewal of designated areas in cities and towns.  That scheme has now been in place for over three years and has achieved considerable success.  It was in that context, and realising the need for overall national urban renewal as envisaged in the 1986 Act, that I, as Mayor of Limerick, stated on 5 May 1986:</P>
    <P>The urban renewal momentum has been greatly encouraged by the package of tax incentives for inner city redevelopment and reconstruction announced by the Government on 23 October 1985 and applied to cities such as Limerick by John Boland when he was Minister for the Environment when on 25 March 1986 he designated a comprehensive and coherent zone of 39 acres in Limerick which qualified for the special programme of tax and rate incentives.</P>
    <P>That package of financial measures to promote urban renewal and development of substantial areas of our city represented for us in Limerick a very exciting and challenging development.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the 1986 Act was to bring new life to the run down areas at the core of cities so that these areas would again become attractive areas for living, working, shopping and leisure amenities. As the Chairman of the Limerick City Urban Renewal Committee since 1986, I am pleased to put on record that Limerick is now very much to the forefront of cities in this matter of urban renewal and has responded quickly and wholeheartedly to the Government initiatives on inner city redevelopment.</P>
    <P>Limerick Corporation now see themselves as a development broker bringing together land owners, developers and potential investors and doing everything we can to facilitate development and redevelopment proposals.  After an aggressive marketing programme and with the able and fantastic assistance of Shannon Free Airport Development <Col N="1445" /> Company, we now have an overall investment in excess of £50 million for the designated area.  All this has been achieved in the short period of three years.  This designated area in Limerick includes much improvement city areas as Arthur's Quay, Charlotte Quay, John's Gate and the important river front area from King John's Castle to Sarsfield House.  The £15 million multi-use complex at Arthur's Quay which commenced two years ago has already opened and comprises retail amenity office and multistorey car parking.  The new £6 million city centre at Merchants Quay which commenced approximately 12 months ago and which is situated on the river front will be ready for use by corporation officials and others in March 1990 and will comprise a mayoral chamber, a council chamber, administrative offices, sports facilities and a museum.</P>
    <P>The 1986 legislation and the 1989 legislation which we are now about to pass should be read together.  I also believe that an extension of the time limits and a judicious review of the geographic boundaries would further encourage the development and enhance the urban fabric.</P>
    <P>I would like to welcome very strongly the main provisions of this Bill.  If there are some legal and constitutional problems we can have them teased out at Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>In February of this year I had the pleasure as a Member of Dáil Éireann of speaking on the Derelict Sites Bill 1989.  On that occasion I welcomed the Bill and expressed the view that it was a sound legislative measure that was overdue.  I am delighted to have this opportunity to speak further on it and to substantiate my contribution by update of references to matters related to the notion of dereliction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened to the debate over the last week and I will mention one or two points that were made by some of the Senators. I was glad to hear Senator Hederman mention the impact that the Tidy Towns competition has had on the environment and in particular the role that competition <Col N="1446" /> has played in eliminating dereliction in towns throughout the country.  I would like to say to the Minister and to the Minister of State that the Department of the Environment should have a role in that competition.  It is one of the most important competitions in the country.  I have been a member of the Malahide Tidy Towns Committee for the last seven years and former chairman and have been lucky enough to have been involved with some great people in that regard.</P>
    <P>I know the role the competition plays throughout the country.  I will come back to that later.  I want to say, in the absence of the two Ministers that I hope they will take on board the idea that the Department of the Environment be involved in promoting funding for that competition. Bord Fáilte are heavily involved in it but the Department of the Environment should be, too.</P>
    <P>I found it extraordinary that Senator Costello did not refer to the tax incentives that have been provided by the Government for areas of dereliction.  Last Sunday's <i>Business Post</i> had a major article on inner city tax breaks and on what can be achieved.  Last Saturday's <i>Evening Press</i> had a headline that about £500 million worth of investment in Dublin related to tax incentive schemes.  It is extraordinary that in this regard Senator Costello's contribution was negative.</P>
    <P>In fairness, a great deal has been done over the last two years to try to eliminate dereliction.  Senator Costello also made the point and asked the Minister to answer it &mdash; I am sure he will have no problem next week when we come back to this Bill &mdash; as to the funding and personnel that would be involved in the establishment of a register of derelict sites.</P>
    <P>Senator Eoin Ryan, speaking last week, mentioned that the corporation had already put in place a register of derelict sites.  Dublin County Council, the local authority I am involved with, are already putting such a register in place too.  I do not see any problem in regard to implementing this very important provision.  Cost and personnel are not major problems.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1447" /> Senator Naughten rightly said that thatched cottages were something that should be preserved to ensure that they remained part and parcel of rural and urban life.  In north County Dublin we are very pleased that many property owners have thatched roofs and are very keen to keep them.  As Senator B. O'Keeffe mentioned, Cork County Council have brought in a scheme.  I am very pleased to say that Dublin County Council recently brought in a scheme to grant-aid the refurbishment of thatched cottages and so forth and to promote the idea that applicants for planning permission would be encouraged, where suitable, to provide thatched cottages.  While the money this year is limited, I have no doubt that the concept of promoting and grant-aiding thatched cottages is worth while.  I am delighted that the scheme was unanimously passed at a recent council meeting.  These are important issues that are coming in place.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal first with section 8 of the Bill as I believe the compilation of a register of derelict sites by local authorities in their respective functional areas is a key factor in dereliction control.  The Bill broadens the definition of derelict site as it was understood in the Derelict Sites Act, 1961.  It very wisely includes lands which already detract to a material degree from the amenity, character and appearance of land in the neighbourhood of the land in question as well as lands likely to detract in this manner.  I am sorry that Senator Manning is not here because he would know in this area the old Baldoyle racecourse.  That has been lying there for about ten years.  We also have a position now where a major planning application is in front of us for the Phoenix Park racecourse.  Without going into what might happen to that application, at least this Bill will make sure, if the decision were to be against the application, that we would not have the same situation that prevails in the racetrack in Baldoyle.  Again, it is something very important.  It will come into effect straightaway on an issue such as that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1448" /> This latter clause allows for the consideration of incipient dereliction as a proper focus for the attention of local authorities.  This dovetails neatly with the provisions of section 8 concerning the compilation of a register of derelict sites. Such a register could consist of properties already derelict and as such would not take into account cases of incipient dereliction, where in the view of engineers or other appropriate professional persons, the state of lands in question would be likely to deteriorate further to an ultimate state of total dereliction.  Owners of such properties could be advised of this and made aware of the penalties and restrictions to which they would be subjected in the event of further deterioration.</P>
    <P>I have in mind the other side of the dereliction coin, which is preservation. Such a register could, or should, I suggest, advert to the significant features of any site and where necessary cite any other Act of the Legislature which would relate to their upkeep or preservation.  In recent weeks we have had the unauthorised demolition of Talbot Lodge, Grove Avenue, Blackrock, which, unfortunately, was not yet listed but had been noted for listing in the Dublin County Development Plan.  We had demolition of property of historic and architectural note on the public quays and we had the case of the recovery in Newry by the RUC of two 18th century fireplaces which had been taken from a listed building in Parnell Square.</P>
    <P>I believe a register of derelict sites would be of value in the field of preservation just as much as the control of dereliction.  The Bill does not lay down in minute detail how this register shall be compiled, nor does it essentially limit the extent and the exact detail it might usefully contain.  This gives scope for an innovative, constructive approach by local authorities along the lines I have just mentioned.  The Bill directs the local authorities to compile the register within one year after the commencement of this Act and thereaftr maintain it.</P>
    <P>I hope that the notion of maintenance is sufficiently directed to ensure that each <Col N="1449" /> local authority would carry out an annual review of the register and that the maintenance of it would make it obligatory to keep it constantly open for new entries in the interim period.  I would like to see this register as an instrument that would have a very public life so that the concept of dereliction prevention would be placed firmly centre stage in the public consciousness.  This could be assisted in two ways.  First, I would like to see a copy of the register readily accessible to the general public in each area, town or borough.  The local public library might serve this purpose.  On the occasion of a formal annual review of the register, inspection of the register for the purpose of new submissions, additions and deletions should be invited by way of public notice. While the Bill requires the local authority to inform the owner of a site prior to its inclusion in the register, it might be useful and give a spin-off benefit if through the public awareness measures I have mentioned, citizens could see there is a process in place to redress negligence of civic duty in this regard.</P>
    <P>Major black spots of dereliction tend to get a lot of attention while we tend to ignore the lesser sites and sometimes these are even more hazardous or unsightly.  It was good to read in the newspapers in recent days that Dublin City Manager, Frank Feely, said that £500 million would be spent over the next five years on derelict sites in Dublin.  This large sum represents a huge investment in replacement works which will not only transform the sites visually and aesthetically but will mean that the replacement developments will provide employment during the period of construction and afterwards there will be sustainable employment in commerce, manufacture and specialist services.</P>
    <P>The Dublin docklands transformation is a good example of innovative derelict sites use.  I am aware that in towns and cities throughout the country there are sites of this nature that have had their initial purpose outpaced by the March of time and as a result, have been neglected. They are often disused railway yards and dock facilities or mills.  The reasons for <Col N="1450" /> choosing them initially to fulfil a commercial or industrial role are as valid today as they were in the past.  There is a greater opportunity today for such developments as we approach 1992.  Location today is not so tied to factors like transport, market nearness, <i>et cetera.</i>  We should exploit our great assets in our young, well-educated and highly skilled work-force.  We should marry all these factors in attractive packages to lure overseas investors to come to us rather than have us export our expensively educated and trained brainpower to their home bases.</P>
    <P>I quote all this to show the persuasive values which I see in this Bill.  In addition to the large sites already adverted to, there are many substantial buildings which, despite the passage of time, the ravages and neglect, somehow managed to remain structurally sound and which would present opportunity to developers with an eye for the architecturally beautiful, cut stone, <i>et cetera.</i>  It is a great pity that such fine premises should be allowed to fall into disrepair and irredeemable decay.  Finally they reach the stage where the awful sentence of dereliction is pronounced.  For the most part they are buildings of great and enduring character and it would be a pity if under the terms of this Bill there was an inconsidered rush to demolish them.  Demolition is not the best remedy for derelict buildings and should be the remedy of the last resort. Rather than act hastily in this way, consideration should be given to the possibility of restoration and a continued life in another capacity.</P>
    <P>Members of the House will remember the sad fate of the old Grammar School in Drogheda, which, like the Talbot Lodge already mentioned, was pulled down. Buildings like these are not easily replaced with modern structures of equal dignity.  At a time when enterprise is central to all modern theories of economic advancement, we should seriously consider converting such buildings to enterprise centres in order to stimulate local manufacture and enterprise.  An employment group in Malahide, of which I was a member, were able to convert an old school that was lying idle there, into a <Col N="1451" /> worthwhile community enterprise venture.  There are many committees throughout the country involved in community enterprise.  The IDA's project, Enterprise Space Limited, is probably a way where an old factory or mill could be restored.  Senator O'Keeffe suggested the extension of the tax incentive in section 27 to this type of project.  There are many buildings in different parts of the country which could be converted to enterprise centres.  This would ensure the upkeep of the property and provide much needed enterprise space for the promotion of business and the creation of jobs.  The scheme in Malahide that I have referred to has taken persons who may have been working from a garage or a house in the black economy, into the system.  In my view, this is very much self-financing.</P>
    <P>The Minister should discuss with the Minister for Finance the question of having section 27 extended to the type of promotion where an old building is developed by private investor, that he or she would get relief on the rents that accrue later.  I would like this type of development to be encouraged by an extension of the provisions of section 27 so that the refurbishment of buildings such as old mills, warehouses and schools could be carried out at little or no cost to the Exchequer.  Instead of wrecking or levelling of buildings with a one man JCB the owners could be encouraged to replace dereliction with development and thus provide valuable workspace units on such leasehold or rental terms as would allow the owner to recoup in time his or her outlay by writing off the capital cost against rents accruing from the development.  That is something that might be looked at.</P>
    <P>This does not represent such a big concession as it at first seems.  For example, there are very attractive tax breaks available to encourage the revitalisation of inner cities within the designated areas. This means that a person on a particular rate of tax actually earns income by renting a premises within a designated area or alternatively a person willing to <Col N="1452" /> acquire and to redevelop old premises, may avail of capital allowances which can be offset against current income.  These tax breaks apply to inner city zones in Dublin, Cork and Limerick and other areas as well as to a sizeable list of provincial centres.  It applies even to buildings or restoration of dwellings in designated areas.  My proposal is more simple.  It is to ask that the concession of section 27 relief be extended to derelict sites in non-designated areas where the restoration and redevelopment works would be for the purpose of providing enterprise workspace.</P>
    <P>If I could be parochial for two sentences.  In my constituency, the town of Balbriggan, an area where there is very high unemployment, unfortunately, and a lack of investment both public and private, there are many old factories that with the right type of tax incentives would be redeveloped.  This would have a major impact in improving the environment and more importantly or equally importantly would provide jobs.  I hope to have an opportunity to come back to the Ministers on that, to see if that town can be helped.</P>
    <P>I would like to make a few points about the city and the corporation.  The present physical planning system envisages as a priority the preservation of amenities and the renewal of obsolete areas.  However, over the past ten to 15 years we have seen the complete dereliction of Aston's Quay and Batchelor's Walk just yards from the centre of the capital city.  This dereliction was a joint effort between Dublin Corporation and the property owners.  It is not true or fair to theorise that if the development plans, planning enforcement and urban renewal incentives were doing the job, we would not have any dereliction.  The ridiculous road planning schemes adopted by Dublin Corporation were the main contributory factor to this dereliction.  Over the years owners of property were not permitted to redevelop pending the implementation of the new ring road systems proposed.  This resulted in property being allowed to become derelict while awaiting compensation or compulsory purchase orders.  It is for this <Col N="1453" /> reason that the problem in Dublin is extensive.  I would like to suggest to the Minister that a more flexible approach should be adopted in the development plans at present under review in relation to derelict sites.</P>
    <P>I genuinely believe that temporary permission should be encouraged even for non-conforming uses.  These uses may from time to time be in conflict with the zoning of the area but would be of great social use to the community &mdash; scout dens and various other community uses could be allowed where there is this type of road lines.  The idea of a temporary permission is worth pursuing.  It is something that would possibly eliminate the situation we have had in the capital city over the years, while waiting for road lines to come on board.  This dereliction has been spoken of by many Senators over the last couple of weeks.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the powers in this Bill will put an end to carelessness or neglect on the part of local authorities in dealing with their own derelict sites. Under section 11 the duty of reasonable action falls on the local authority.  Section 12 goes on to outline the power of the local authority to take action directly or to make the owner take action.  This is where the Bill is clearly a two-edged instrument.  It would be very difficult for a local authority to apply the powers under this Bill against a third party if at the same time they were failing in their duty as the owner/occupier of lands.  The powers conferred on the Minister in section 13 should prove an effective break on any local authority whose lands might fall short of the requirements.</P>
    <P>Finally, if I might turn to the implications for the environmental aspect of tourism in so far as dereliction is a factor, one of the great annual events in Irish tourism, is the Bord Fáilte Tidy Towns Competition.  Under the aegis of this competition, many derelict sites have been eradicated by the voluntary workers, who year after year by sheer persistency and unremitting effort have done incalculable work in the reduction of dereliction.  Having attended the annual award winners press conference <Col N="1454" /> on six occasions when Malahide was awarded the accolade of the Tidiest Large Town, I am well aware of the views of tidy towns campaigners on the problem of dereliction.  From Bord Fáilte personnel I am aware of the negative impact which derelict blackspots have on visitors.  With those two perspectives very much in mind, I could never overstate what I perceive to be the value of this legislation.</P>
    <P>This Bill will do great things for tourism and for Irelands clean, green image.  The image of Ireland as a clean green island on the fringe of Western Europe is a key point in the marketing strategy of food exporters.  Anything we do to boost this image greatly enhances the marketability of our food abroad.  We must never forget that the IDA and other agencies and individuals are constantly seeking to woo foreign investment so as to create employment.  Investing companies use personnel from the company base to oversee subsidiaries.  These foreign managers will not choose to live in areas whose landscape is married by dereliction. When acts of vandalism occur we are very quick to lay blame usually on teenagers who very often are obliged to live out their young lives in the shadow of derelict buildings.  They are surrounded by derelict sites and the physical evidence of decay and neglect.  The owners of the buildings live elsewhere and find it easy to condemn these young people.</P>
    <P>This Bill has as one of its ingredients environmental reform which is the forerunner of social reform.  The Bill has both direct and indirect values which will in time realise to all of our advantage.  It is a very important Bill and taken together with other legislation for the control of litter, it will bring us close to the ideal of a clean green country.  I am very happy to congratulate the Minister on promoting this Bill.  I sincerely hope it will pass through the Seanad as quickly as possible so that it can come into force.</P>

Ní hé nach bhfuil fáilte roimh an Leas-Chathaoirleach agus roimh an Aire Stáit atá anois i láthair ach go ndealraítear domsa go bhfuil an Teach seo tréigthe, ar nós an Bhille atá os ár gcomhair.  Tá sé tréigthe ó thaobh theanga de.  Fáiltím go speisialta roimh an reachtaíocht.  Is iontach an dul chun cinn i meoin an phobail agus an Rialtais a léirítear ann, d'ainneoin na lochtanna a ghabhann leis.  Tá iarracht mhacánta á dhéanamh chun an talamh agus na foirgintí tréigthe a chur de láimh.  Cúis ríméide domsa ab ea an tAcht um Urban Renewal/Athnuachan na gCathracha, 1987.  Thug mé féin faoi deara an t-athrú mór chun feabhais a tháinig ar chathair na Gaillimhe i leith thithíochta, siopaí agus mar sin de, de bharr an Achta seo.  Do fiafraíodh díom le déanaí agus mé ag dul trí Ghailleamh, ar son Chlár Gay Byrne, na cúig chuimhní ba mhó a bhí agam d'imeachtaí na ndeich mbliana atá caite, agus ba é an príomh cuimhne a bhí le lua agam ná an teabhas mór atá tagtha ar chathair na Gaillimhe.  Feictear domsa go bhfuil an Bille seo ag cur barr feabhais ar an obair sin.  Is dóigh liom, leis, go bhfuil aitheantas cuí á thabhairt do chomórtas na mBailte Shlachtmhara agus don tréan iarracht atá déanta aige lena chinntiú go rabhthas ag fáil réidh le ana-chuid seanithe agus foirgintí a bhí ag milleadh bóithre, bailte agus cathracha.</P>

    <P>Ba mhaith liom, freisin, comhghairdeas a dhéanamh le Telecom Éireann, cé go gceapfaí nach raibh mórán ceangail idir Telecom Éireann agus tailte tréigthe. Cupla bliain ó shin, áfach, nuair a bhí mé féin ag obair ar oileán Árann tháinig plean chugainn ó Thelecom Éireann chun malartán beag a thógáil ar oileán ann. Mhol mé féin agus comharchumann beag eile ar Inis Meáin, arbh é Proinnsias Ó Dónaill an bainisteoir, do Thelecom Éireann, athsmaoineamh a dhéanamh ar an bplean agus díon ceann tuí a chur ar an bhfoirgneamh a bhí á thógáil.  Mhol sé freisin go n-úsáidfí clocha de dhéanamh na háite ann in ionad na ngnáthclocha stroighin.  D'athraigh siad a gcuid pleananna agus rinneadar amhlaidh.  Tá malartán breá le feiceáil anois ar an oileán le <Col N="1456" /> clocha dúchasacha agus ceann tuí air. Murach Telecom Éireann dob fhéidir go mbeimís ag tagairt d'áit tréigthe nó d'fhoirgneamh tréigthe go gairid sa láithreán sin.  Labhair an Seanadóir a ghabh romham faoi thithe tuí i dtuaisceart Bhaile Átha Cliath agus is eol dom go bhfuil scéim dá shórt i Loch Garman, ach ní miste a lua gurb é polasaí an Rialtais agus polasaí Roinn an Gaeltachta is cúis le ana-chuid laithreán tréigthe a bheith le feiscint thart fán dtír faoi rialacha tithíochta na Gaeltachta, toisc nárbh fhéidir deontas tithíochta a fháil gan an seanteach tuí a leagadh go talamh agus an díon a bhriseadh.  Is doígh liom go ndearna an reachtaíocht Ghaeltachta sin níos mó dochair do radharcanna na Gaeltachta ná mar a rinne ní ar bith eile.</P>
    <P>Ní foláir dúinn a bheith cúramach agus sinn ag labhairt faoi thithe agus thailte tréighte mar go bhfuil an oiread sin seantithe ann, go háirithe in iarthar na tíre ar a dtugtar &ldquo;sráidbhailte tréigthe&rdquo;, agus b'shin a ghlaoití ar na háiteacha seo fadó. Bhíodh cúig no sé cinn de thithe le chéile in aon bhaile amháin agus tithe cheann tuí a bhíodh iontu uilig.  Tá an-chuid de na tithe seo scriosta agus tréigthe ach fós féin tá conablach na mbailte beaga seo le feiceáil agus bheadh faitíos orm go mbreathnófaí ar na háiteacha sin mar áiteacha tréigthe faoi théarmaí an Bhille seo, agus go mbeadh an fhaill ann chun iad a leagadh.  Tithe tréighte atá iontu gan amhras; cúig nó sé cinn de thithe inar mhair ár seacht sinsear de lúth agus d'fhuinneamh na Gaeltachta.  Oidhreacht na hÉireann is ea iad.  Níl fuinneog ná doras sna tithe seo; tá siad uilig titithe isteach ach mar sin féin, ba thrua dá gcuirfeadh Bille mar seo deireadh le iarsmaí, mar a thabharfaidh mé orthu, in ionad iad a chaomhnú agus a atógáil mar déanadh le roinnt tithe den chineál seo.</P>
    <P>Fáiltím roimh an mBille sa mhéid is go bhfuil sé i gceist ann roinnt mhaith de na seanlaithreáin tréigthe atá le feiscint sa chathair seo agus i gcathracha eile a fheabhsú.  Buíochas le Dia go bhfuil siad ag imeacht sciobtha go leor agus tá eiseamlár don tír ar fad le sonrú i gcathair na Gaillimhe.  Molaim do Sheanadóirí cuairt a thabhairt ar lár na cathrach, an <Col N="1457" /> chéad uair eile a bhéas éinne acu i nGailleamh, agus feicfidh siad go bhfuil na laithreáin uilig a bhí tréigthe, athfhorbairte anois, agus go bhfuil siad beo anois le daoine, agus foirgintí nua ann.</P>
    <P>Ábhar imní domsa i leith an Bhille seo &mdash; agus tá súil agam go bpléfear amach anseo é, ar an gcéad chéim eile &mdash; ná an chiall atá le &ldquo;urban area&rdquo; mar atá sé anseo.  Tugann sé isteach an focal &ldquo;contae&rdquo; ach is é an tuiscint a bheadh agamsa agus ag go leor daoine eile maidir leis an mBille seo ná go mbaineann sé le baile nó le sráidbhaile nó le cathair agus gur beag baint atá aige le contae, leis na páirceanna agus leis an dtalamh atá lasmuigh de na bailte.  Ba mhaith liom míniúchán sásúil a fháil ón Aire ar an gciall atá leis an bhfocal &ldquo;baile&rdquo; nó &ldquo;urban area&rdquo;, ní faoi mar a chuimsítear sa Bhille é.  Má chiallaíonn sé an rud a cheapaimse go gciallaíonn sé tá mé ag ceapadh go mbeimid i dtrioblóid leis an mBille seo.</P>
    <P>Tá sé ráite in alt 4 go gciallaíonn &ldquo;laithreán tréigthe&rdquo; talamh ar bith.  Ní deir sé go gciallaíonn sé teach nó foirgneamh ar bith.  Is trua nach bhfuil an tuiscint iomlán agamsa faoin a bhfuil ráite ansin mar gheall ar thalamh tréigthe, mar go ndeir sé go mbaineann sé le talamh ar bith a bhaineann ó áilleacht na háite agus a chuireann drochchaoi ar thalamh timpeall air.  I bhfo-alt (b) d'alt 4, tagraítear, ní do theach nó d'fhoirgneamh ach do thalamh.  Deir sé, i leith aon talamh nach mbeadh ag breathnú go maith nó a bheadh tréigthe, go bhfeádfaí an tAcht a chur i bhfeidhm i leith na talún sin. Ciallaíonn sé, seo, dar liom, go bhfuil talamh nó foirgneamh i gceist ag an mBille agus más amhlaidh, creidim go mbeidh ar an Aire nó ar an Rialtas, an Bille seo a leasú.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the many Senators for their very interesting contributions to this debate. These reflect the complexity and the urgency of problems of land that decay. The concerns expressed by Senators bear out the timeliness and the relevance of <Col N="1458" /> the Bill and I hope we will see it implemented very shortly.</P>
      <P>In his opening contribution the Minister cautioned that the present Bill would not provide all the solutions to the problems.  As Senator Costello explained, of course the Bill is a limited but important measure, designed primarily to place a clear onus on individual property owners to keep their properties in a reasonable condition.</P>
      <P>Senators Hederman and Norris in particular have dealt with the questions of urban decay and urban renewal against a very wide background.  As Minister of State with special responsibility for urban renewal, I greatly appreciate the interest expressed by the Members of this House in the success of the urban renewal scheme.  I was glad to hear Senator Ó Foighil speak about the great progress that has been made in Galway.  I am very pleased with that.  That is one of the success areas in regard to urban renewal. It has been a wonderful success in Galway and I would like to congratulate everyone concerned.</P>
      <P>Senator Jackman rightly emphasised the need for a thorough and effective implementation of the Bill.  In this regard, she mentioned first that regulations would have to be introduced by the Minister.  It is true that the Bill provides in a number of instances for the making of regulations.  However, it does not by any standards depend heavily on regulations.  I would like to assure the House that this aspect will not hold up the implementation of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Jackman referred also to limitations on local authority staffing resources and argued that these might restrict the proper implementation of the Bill.  Senators Naughten and Hederman also took up this point.  I do not accept this argument.  This Bill is principally about providing better powers for local authorities and in particular about encouraging them to take preventive action.  This approach should prevent the emergence of further chronic problems and in future it should actually ease the burden of administration on local authorities in a number of other areas &mdash;<Col N="1459" /> for instance, that of dangerous buildings control.</P>
    <P>I would like to confirm for Senator Jackman that the derelict sites levy will apply automatically to all existing urban areas, including Newcastle West.  The Minister will have a further power to extend the scope of urban areas &mdash; for example, to smaller non-municipal towns &mdash; so that the levy can be applied within these also.  I intend to consult all the county councils for their views as to areas within their jurisdiction to which the levy could usefully be applied.</P>
    <P>Regarding the scheme of urban renewal grants which I mentioned during my contribution, I should clarify for Senator Jackman and others that the £2 million available in 1989 and again in 1990 is for complementary works by local authorities in designated areas.  This is quite separate from the tax and the rates incentives designed for private developers.  These tax incentives, under present law, will expire in May 1991. Might I say that the £2 million that has been allocated this year and next year &mdash; I think Senator Hederman will agree with me here &mdash; is being put to very good use in the Dublin area.  I think Senator Wright will also agree with me here.  I would instance the lovely pavement job that is being done by Dublin Corporation.  I would like to congratulate everyone concerned in that.  It was something I had very strong views on.  I felt that, as well as the urban renewal programme and bringing in all these incentives, the paving and lighting would be brought up to a high standard so that we would have the capital city looking extremely well.  I am glad to say that is being brought about now.</P>
    <P>I am also glad to say that this year has seen an upsurge in development here in Dublin and throughout the country in general, because in Dublin now everything is going extremely well.  In so far as I can ascertain, development now throughout the country, excluding the Custom House Dock, will be amounting to about £312 million.</P>
    <P>There have been some comments in <Col N="1460" /> regard to the charging of the levy.  Some would say that that should have been put into a special fund, but we cannot have it both ways.  We are looking for powers for the members of local authorities and corporations.  We want powers and we say that.  If I or the Minister say that this levy should go into a special fund, I do not think members of local authorities would respect us for that.  They are all intelligent people, as I know them.  I would say that whatever money they collect in levies will be put to good use in all their areas.  I would like to leave the powers with them.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan was concerned about the difficulty of establishing ownership of derelict sites.  I would like to assure him that the Bill contains a number of devices to overcome this problem, as we will see on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Senator Hederman spoke in detail about the historical causes of dereliction here in Dublin and about the need for a coherent urban renewal policy if the inner city is to be rid of dereliction.  I have already indicated that we did not see the entire onus of this task resting on the present Bill.  The Bill will make many worth-while improvements to the powers of the local authorities to deal with urban decay but it cannot on its own provide all of the solutions to the work of physically regenerating all our cities and towns.</P>
    <P>The Bill is designed to apply to the whole country.  While it will have a particular relevance to Dublin and other major urban areas, I would be reluctant to be drawn into a long response to the historical aspects highlighted by Senators Hederman and Norris in relation to the Dublin situation.  The tendencies towards suburbanisation and relocation from Dublin inner city go back a very long way.  These were necessitated in part by the huge increase in the overall Dublin population, which has trebled in the past century, as well as by the unacceptable housing conditions and population densities existing in some inner city areas in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Whatever the misjudgments of the previous housing and planning policies in Dublin or elsewhere, we must face the <Col N="1461" /> present day problem of urban decay as we find it and seek to adopt the best solutions for its remedy.  Increasing residential land use in inner city areas is a vital element in urban renewal.  The major contributions to inner city housing in the past ten to 15 years has come from local authorities.  Some 2,500 new houses have been provided under this programme, for the most part in Dublin.  The IDA have also, over the past ten years, been providing specially designed industrial estates in Dublin and Cork with the specific purpose of encouraging urban renewal.  As I stated earlier, this has been a great success.  I am glad to say that especially this year all of the land in the designated areas in Dublin is being disposed of, or there is a commitment involved.  Much of it now is in the planning process.  I am delighted with that, because some had reservations in regard to whether it would go so well.  Some had doubts but I am glad to say now that this has brought about wonderful development here and has created great employment.</P>
    <P>I want to say that when we come to deal with Committee Stage I will be only too glad to go into the various aspects of the Bill in great detail with Senators, because I know you would like me to expand and explain all the relevant details and be as helpful as I possibly can. That will be my aim.  In the meantime I want to express my sincere thanks to all the Senators for their excellent contributions to the Bill.  Their contributions are very much appreciated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 16:</P>
      <P>In page 15, line 23, after &ldquo;(4)&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;subject to section 18&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It was with pleasure that we waited seven and a half minutes for the Minister to join us, I would like that to go on the record.  There is reasonableness on this side of the House.  I hope that is a precedent from the other side in future.</P>
      <P>We are on section 17, amendment No. 16 I should like to speak on amendment No. 19 which is related.  I should like to bring the Minister back to the discussion we were having shortly before 1.30 in relation to section 17 and the whole thrust of this section, where there is no detail of the actual procedure for the appointment of trustees.  My amendment No. 19 attempts to deal with this serious omission in the Bill.  We also discussed earlier today the apparent fact that once a trustee is appointed at some stage over the age of majority I believe, if we have to get into specific ages, he or she effectively has a life tenure as a trustee until for some reason when that person reaches the age of 70 he or she is no longer competent to be a trustee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must question seriously what has been referred to by other Senators as this age-ism that is creeping into our legislation generally.  I do not think anyone should have tenure for life without strict conditions governing the situation.  They may be re-elected or reappointed but not automatic tenure for life.  I would like the Minister to address that, which would appear to be a tremendous weakness with this section.  I would also like the Minister to indicate to me why once a trustee reaches the age of 70 he or she becomes <i>non compus mentis</i> or a doddering fool, if we could resort to the vernacular.  I know as many doddering fools at 60 and maybe more than I do of 80 years of age.  There is many a wise octogenarian around with plenty of time on his or her hands.  That person has completed their main job of life, be it in a professional sense or in a personal family sense, and has time on his or her hands.  We are <Col N="1464" /> excluding all these wise, older people from our society, many people who continue to make a tremendous contribution. At the same time we are setting up a system whereby an incompetent 60 year old, who effectively has tenure until they are 70, cannot be removed unless they do something fraudulent.  I would like the Minister to address very seriously this issue which concerns far more than those of us in this House.  Much concern has been expressed elsewhere about this section.  Subsection (1) of my amendment, No. 19, which I would like inserted on page 15 before section 18 reads as follows:</P>
    <P>In page 15, before section 18, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
    <P>(1)  Every trustee (other than a trustee appointed to fill a casual vacancy) shall, unless he sooner dies, resigns or becomes disqualified, hold office for five years from the expiration by effluxion of time of the term of office of his predecessor.</P>
    <P>That is a point I would like the Minister to take on board.  He has been quoting precedent, the necessity to have all these financial pieces of legislation moving down the same road in relation to these matters.  I have lifted this section from the Central Bank procedure and I have imposed the word &ldquo;trustee&rdquo; for &ldquo;director&rdquo; and so on.  The procedure is exactly the same.  I am asking the Minister to take on board what I am suggesting.</P>
    <P>I go on to request the Minister to include subsection (2) as follows:</P>
    <P>That every trustee who is appointed for a purpose other than filling a vacancy amongst the trustees shall, unless he sooner dies, resigns or becomes disqualified, hold office for five years from the day as on and from which he is appointed.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting at all that they be not eligible for re-appointment, re-election or for selection again because according <Col N="1465" /> to what the Minister said this morning the trustees will continue to self select. Some of the Members were not too happy about that but at least we now know what is intended.</P>
    <P>It was not in the Bill how the trustees were to be appointed.  The Minister told us this morning that they will continue to self appoint.  That is questionable and it is different also to the procedure that is used among the other financial institutions.  So much for your precedent and your level laying field.  In any case, at least we now know what is to happen.</P>
    <P>I am suggesting that the self appointment last for five years and that the person again comes up for re-appointment.  There should be a way of re-issuing the appointment for five or six years or, if the Minister feels another period would be appropriate, I am open to persuasion. On an interval basis trustees should come before the board to be given the imprimatur for another period or if there is reason for believing that there is some type of incompetence not to have their appointment validated for another term.</P>
    <P>There are major problems when we take into account that the Minister has not detailed the actual procedure for appointment, that, barring fraud, he is giving people life tenure or at least ten years, until they are 70, that the is insisting that the number of trustees be reduced to ten and that even with amalgamations &mdash; as I said this morning, the number will have to wither over time down to ten &mdash; there will be the least competent people sitting it out and ensuring that for the next number of years the trustees will be totally unrepresentative of the local community and will not have the broad breadth of experience which is essential.</P>
    <P>After all, the whole purpose of a board of trustees is to give confidence to the operations of the bank.  You just have to look at the profile of any board to get a feeling of the particular business, company or institution concerned.  You judge the competence of a particular outfit or company by those at the top table.  If we are to have a top table of the least competent septuagenarians or as near to <Col N="1466" /> it as makes no difference who are sitting it out because there is nothing else to do until the numbers come below ten, you are not presenting the whole principle of a trustee savings bank in the best light. You are certainly not doing them any justice or representing them as they should be represented.  Certainly when it comes to a level playing field, given the situation that exists with boards, banks and other financial institutions, the Trustee Savings Bank is being put at a major disadvantage relative to the other financial institutions.</P>
    <P>The third point of my amendment is that I am requesting that a person appointed to fill a casual vacancy in the office of trustee shall hold office for the residue of the term for which the trustee whose death, resignation or disqualification created the vacancy, would have held office if he had not died, resigned or become disqualified.  This is lifted directly from the equivalent procedure in the Central Bank Act.  I ask the Minister to accept my amendment. He may want to change the language if he feels it is not 100 per cent appropriate. I feel it is appropriate.  Above all we should ensure that we do not have tenure for life because if there is incompetence there has to be a system through which the Trustee Savings Bank can remove incompetent people.  Particularly with the reduction of the number down to ten, it could be many years before more competent people with a broader range of experience can be included on a board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the main burden of what Senator Doyle has said.  It is particularly appropriate that this appeal for respect for elder statesmen should come from the Seanad which through the Roman period was a place in which the views of the aged and the worldly wise were treated with very considerable respect.  It seems to me that there is an element of ageism in this.  I am very glad that Senator Doyle has picked up and reused, this very valuable phrase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conversations off the record and in another section of this House with <Col N="1467" /> members of the Government I got the clear impression that this was not a matter of real principle and it really was not something to which they felt they have got to nail their colours very firmly to the mast.  It is something that is quite important because it could deprive the Trustee Savings Bank of the services of people who have a considerable body of experience and who also have time at their disposal to make their services available free of charge.</P>
    <P>I understand, though I could be quite wrong in this, that the trustees of a trustee savings bank do not receive remuneration and particularly, that they do not receive very large degrees of remuneration.  If this is true this would be something that would indicate that it is a more appropriate post for somebody who has already earned his or her money and does not require that the time should be spent in a way that is directly financially profitable to that person.</P>
    <P>There is something slightly ludicrous about the Seanad passing a regulation, which means that it is not appropriate for somebody over the age of 70, to take part actively in the commercial life of an important financial institution, considering that this very morning I received a circular dealing with the acts of personal accident claims.  My attention was drawn to the fact that were I over 75 certain things would happen, that were I over 80 certain things would happen, so apparently it is quite plausible, quite reasonable for people over the age of 75 or over the age of 80 to legislate but yet those very legislators themselves appear to believe that there is a lower level of competence existing in the general community.  This is an illusion from which I am glad to say I do not suffer.</P>
    <P>I may also say that I spoke to a Member of the Dáil at lunch time.  I was explaining this situation to him and he said he agreed with me absolutely, that his father is a prominent member of the Dublin Port and Docks Board, that he is over 80 and takes a very active interest in the board and that his view is highly regarded.</P>

      <P>I do not have a copy of the Bill in front of me but I have a photographic memory so I am consulting it rather than the documentation.  I feel that this fact which I adduce as evidence, in other words that a respected member of the community who happens to be over 80, is regarded as sufficiently competent to take a very active part in the discussions of the Dublin Port and Docks Board, which has at its disposal and within its responsibility sums of money, many hundreds of millions of pounds, does not seem to me to be an unreasonable request that this matter of an arbitrary age limit should be reconsidered by the Government.  I stress the fact that age limits are arbitrary and I felt this in legal terms for some years.  For example, in a parallel case with regard to the question of consent in criminal matters, have always felt that ages of consent were dangerous because they introduce an arbitary cut-off level.  Instead, what should be introduced is the principle of consent to be judged by a court.  What we are talking about here is not somebody's calendar age.</P>
      <P>The Minister should be concerned about the principle of competence.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to be insulting to the Minister or to the parliamentary draftsman but it is a slightly sloppy way of doing things.  I know the intention is to get at competence but I do not think that it is reasonable to assume that competence suddenly ceases on one's 70th birthday.  I shall observe the next occurrence of this phenomenon and I shall hungrily await a person of my acquaintance approaching their 70th birthday and attempt to ascertain the precise hour of their activity so that I can watch this phenomenon as it occurs.  I very much doubt it will&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would have to say that I feel we should be in the debt of Senator Doyle who has put down another date which is also arbitrary.  I do not really believe she means 75 years.  I am sure this was a device to allow the matter to be properly ventilated in the Seanad.</P>

      <P>Could I just mention the fact that matters dealing with the appointment of trustees and the removal of trustees are dealt with in the Second Schedule.  I presume when the Trustee Savings Banks Bill has passed all Stages there will be consultation with the Central Bank.  I ask the Minister to comment on that.</P>
      <P>It occurs to me that the debate we had this morning on the worker-director situation could be covered by the Second Schedule, that the bank could decide that it would have one or two worker directors.  The 70 age bracket is precluded as a result of specific reference in the Bill. It is no harm to refer at this stage to the Second Schedule because it covers matters that are provided for by the rules of the Trustee Savings Banks.  One of them is the manner of the appointment and the removal of trustees of the bank.</P>

      <P>Section 18 specifies that a trustee shall cease to hold office at 70 years of age.  Senator Doyle wants a limit of five years in the tenure of office of trustees after which they would presume to come up for reappointment.  She also wants the 70 years age limit increased to 75 years.  I have listened with interest to her excellent contribution and also to Senator Norris's excellent contribution.  I find a conflict between their earlier contributions and the situation now in that earlier on they seemed to be suggesting that trustees were appointed for life and nobody could remove them and now we have tried to put some limit on their tenure of office on the age side.  We have also put a limit by making sure that the trustees board would consist of no more than ten people.  At the moment some of those boards consist of up to 32 people so we are limiting the number. We are going for a movement and change on the boards, which senators were suggesting earlier on but now we seem to be at opposite ends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are proposing to continue the present system subject to the modifications I mentioned: the Central Bank consent to new trustees and an age limit of 70 years.  Should it prove necessary at a later date, the Minister will consider amending the Second Schedule under section 16 (2).  Should the Trustee Savings Banks convert the company status under section 57, then the normal company procedures regarding directors will apply.  I consider that 70 years of age is an appropriate limit.  I appreciate what Senator Doyle says.  Could I repeat again her <i>non compos mentis</i> argument with which I can readily agree.  That is an individual matter and we cannot generalise on it.  It is not to imply that any trustee who passes 70 would not be capable of doing a good job.  However, it is the limited means of ensuring some turnover of trustees without drastically <Col N="1471" /> changing the present system and something which the Senators seem to be suggesting earlier on today.</P>
    <P>As the Bill stands, existing trustees subject to a maximum of ten would become trustees of the Trustee Savings Banks to which a licence is being granted under the Bill.  Such trustees would remain <i>in situ</i> until they retired, reached 70 years of age, resigned, because disqualified under section 19 (2) which involves bankruptcy, making composition with creditors or had liability for any deficiency in funds of the bank caused by omission or neglect in relation to the rules or certain requirements of the Central Bank under section 22 of the Bill, or were convicted of fraud or dishonesty. Other than in the above conditions the initial trustees remain in office unless they do not comply with the rules.  In this we are continuing the existing situation, namely, making minimum amendments. If a person becomes seriously incompetent, it will be possible under the Second Schedule, which includes the proposed rules for the Trustee Savings Banks, to take the necessary action to remedy this situation.</P>
    <P>I hope the information I have given to the House can put the Senator's minds at ease and can find a balanced overview of their desire to have fresher thinking on boards of the Trustee Savings Banks, respect the contribution made by existing trustees and that there would be a reasonable turnover to ensure that there is a genesis of new thinking on the boards of the Trustee Savings Banks to ensure they are able to compete in a modern financial climate.  I trust that with that, Senators will be able to agree to this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe it is the hour of the evening or the length of time we have been talking today but I did not make myself clear and for that I apologise but likewise the Minister's contribution is not too clear to me, particularly the interpretation of what I said and what Senator Norris said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will try to get to the moot point.  We pointed out this morning and again this <Col N="1472" /> evening that as the Bill now stands a trustees who stays within line is there until the age of 70.  I do not think that is a good thing.  I do not think anyone should have an automatic entitlement to any position for life.  That is why I am suggesting they come up for reappointment every five years as happens under the Central Bank Act.  The Minister has been quoting procedure and precedent to us all morning.  I am asking him to continue.  He has used that as his defence for not accepting other amendments.  I am now trying to stay within precedent and treat the trustees as their equivalents in the other banks and financial institutions are treated in other legislation.</P>
    <P>I do not want anyone to have an appointment for life regardless of what impression I gave this morning.  I would much rather a competent, wise 75-year-old than a blundering idiot of 40.  We need a type of gentle procedure for removing people after five years, ten years or whenever their useful contribution are over in terms of being members of the board of trustees of a trustee savings bank.  That is why there should be a five year period of office, and let them up for re-election again and reappointment.  You can reappoint the good, competent trustees. You can say &ldquo;Thank you very much&rdquo; and give the gold pen to those who are making no contribution or are incompetent. There is no problem at all.  There is no reason at all why a very bright, experienced 75 year old with time on his or her hands should not stay on the board of trustees.  There is no reason why the board of trustees should not have a means of getting rid of an incompetent 40-year-old.  When you think of it, a trustee appointed, say, in 1990, next January or February, at the age of 20 could be still on the board of trustees in the year 2,040. Things will have moved on very fast and changed.  Very few of us will be capable of a sustained commitment or contribution to any board, barring the very bright and brilliant person specialising in a particular area, for 40 odd years.  I do not think any of us should be left in the same position for 40 years.  There will be another generation coming up with <Col N="1473" /> different breadth of experience and qualifications.  Times will have moved on. Europe will be different.  The whole world will be a totally different melting pot in 40 years time.  Yet some of these Trustee Savings Banks will be stuck with trustees whom we appoint now until the year 2040 and will not be able to get rid of them, regardless of the Second Schedule.</P>
    <P>I think Senator Fallon for his reference to this Schedule, which I note.  I accept that there may be room for expanding this debate under that Schedule.  I think on the section we are talking to at present section 17, we should include here the procedure for appointing trustees, the procedure for removing them and the procedure for reappointing them within a five or six year term as is provided for in the Central Bank.  I will talk again in relation to the 70 year age when we come to the next amendment.  We are all confusing two amendments slightly here at present, because they are connected.  So you will bear with us on that, a Leas-Chathaoirligh.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding what the Minister said this morning, which concerns me greatly, I think he is not in the frame of mind to take on board any amendment, much inclined as he may be to the substance, because he really does not want the trouble of the matter having to go back to the Dáil.  That worries me in relation to the whole principle of what we do here in the Seanad.  We could close our books and go home now if that was to be accepted as the true feeling of how the Seanad should be treated.  I feel, however, it was only a slip this morning and not a true reflection of what the Minister considers to be the worth of the Seanad and of the Senators' contributions.  I appeal to him to take on board the system whereby, given that ten trustees will be the most they will be allowed to have &mdash; although some have 35 &mdash; at present &mdash; it will be a long time before the 35 withers doen to ten through natural ailling, if I may use a slightly vernacular expression.  Which ten would be left in ten or 15 years?  Perhaps the least suitable ten.  There would be no way <Col N="1474" /> the board would be able to remove them and bring in new, fresh ideas or different experience.  I appeal to the Minister to respect the point I am making here.  It is extremely important.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The arguments advanced by Senator Doyle are very persuasive.  I share her concern that perhaps there may be the administrative difficulty that the Minister, or indeed the Government, may not wish to have the bother of going back to the Dáil, I drew the attention of the House to this with regard to the Derelict Sites Bill which we were discussing earlier on.  This is a strong feeling in the Seanad.  Very often for reasons of administrative convenience, amendments which are well intentioned and generally well received by Ministers of the Government are not taken back to the Dáil simply in order to avoid little problems of that kind.  I hope that is not the case, but I strongly suspect that it is.</P>
      <P>As I say, Senator Doyle's case is very cogently argued.  The Minister is a little disingenuous.  He used phrases like, for example, that this procedure whereby people topple off the board of a Trustee Savings Bank at the age of 70 ensures a reasonable turnover.  It does not.  It shows a turnover, but the use of the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; is not logically sustainable, because it may very well be the most competent person on that board who reaches age 70.  It is arbitrary, capricious and smacks of ageism.  There is no doubt in my mind that Senator Doyle is perfectly correct when she says that what she opposes is the granting of a life tenure for people up to the age of 70 from the date of their appointment.  Clearly, a five yearly rotation of sections to the board would ensure a turnover, as would the age limit, but there is this difference that it would ensure an equitable and, therefore, a reasonable turnover.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the fact that both Senator Fallon and the Minister have introduced this question of the Second Schedule. That is quite important.  There clearly are advances in this Bill.  I understand the Minister to have said that under the Second Schedule a trustee can be <Col N="1475" /> removed for incompetence.  This is not the case?  It is the case?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister could clarify that.  It seems to me that this would solve the question of a person becoming incompetent through age.  If that is the case, then there is absolutely no reason for an age limit.  It is clear that the requirement of a five year turnover would legitimately meet this worry.  I am not being provocative or coat trailing when I remind the Minister that a distinguished former member of his own party, President Éamon De Valera, was considered competent by a considerable majority of the citizens of this State to assume the office of President and continue in that office until he was nearly 90.  I wonder if we think that somebody is competent to be President of the State and not competent to be on a board of a Trustee Savings Bank at the same age.  That would be a very dangerous notion for a republican party to entertain because it comes perilously close to the notion of an empire, or of a God king who is separated by special qualities from the rest of us mere citizens.  I do not imagine that Fianna Fáil, the somewhat constitutional and always republican party, would take that on board with any great ease.  I accept that the Minister is intending to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;would probably be too canny to be a member of an nonpaying non-remunerating body.  I am sticking closely to the trustees.  I accept the Minister's good intentions, particularly with regard to limiting the number <Col N="1476" /> of trustees.  I have had experience of being on a number of boards &mdash; also, I may say, not remunerated &mdash; but I have always found as chairman of a board that the fewer people you have on them, up to a certain point, the better.  I have chaired a board that had about 30 members on it.  It was very difficult. When you get down to ten or six you can really get some executive action going.  I approve of this intention in the Bill.  But I would return strongly to the fact that I believe the arguments advanced by Senator Doyle in this amendment, and the arguments I made myself on Second Stage and have continued to sustain here, are reasonable and should be considered. They must be considered at this stage. As Senator Farrell has very honestly, perhaps a little unwittingly, made clear, if this section is passed as it stands without these amendments there can be no further recourse through regulation until the Second Schedule to alter the position with regard to the age of trustees.</P>

      <P>At the outset, it was very canny of Senator Norris to use the reference to the late President De Valera in the case that he has made.  I am sure he would agree that he was an unique and a rare person and made a tremendous overall total contribution to this country. However, there are exceptions to every rule.  We cannot just generalise in any one individual situation.  I want to assure Senator Doyle and the House again that immediately on the passing of this Act the Trustee Savings Banks will be obliged to have a board of ten members only. They will have to make those changes immediately on the passing of the Act. There will be a reduction in the numbers of those boards from 32, 24, 19 or 15, which some of them now have.  They will immediately be reduced to ten.  Therefore, there will be a change and fresh thinking immediately.  I appreciate the sincerity and commitment shown here by the Senators who have contributed to see if we could agree on increasing the age to 75.  I think you will all agree that we are generous in having it at 70.  People going on boards such as this would be <Col N="1477" /> doing so in their thrities, forties and fifties.  When they reach the age of 70 they would, perhaps, like to take a break and relax from the pressures of deliberations in board rooms and give an opportunity to others to make their contribution.  The idea that we were going to have people there for life will not now happen.</P>
      <P>Under No. 4 of the Second Schedule, it will be possible to draw up the necessary rules to ensure that incompetent people, once it is proven that they are incompetent, could no longer be members of the board.  The reduction in numbers will come into effect as soon as the section comes into force and is law.  It is intended that this will be at the same time as the commencement of the rest of the Act. That should clarify the situation.  I hope we will be able to agree on this section.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Not a lot more needs to be said because, effectively, we have spoken to the substance of this amendment with the previous one.  Basically, I have an amendment here to delete age 70 and substitute 75.  I do not suggest that at the age of 75 anyone becomes less likely to <Col N="1478" /> be able to act in a competent manner as a member of the board of trustees.  I put down this amendment to enable us to use it as a vehicle of discussion at this stage more than anything else.  Would the Minister, for a couple of minutes, concentrate on the reason that the age of 70 has been selected as a cut-off age for membership of the board of trustees?  Could the Minister indicate on what basis the age of 70 was taken?  I would like 75 to be the age. Therefore, could the Minister justify the reason for not accepting my amendment? Frankly, we do not need any upper age limit at all.  Competence should be the sole arbiter as to any person's ability to hold a trusteeship.  Maybe there is something behind the selection of the age of 70 that I do not understand.  The Minister will probably now quote precedent to me now.  When it suits it is ignored such as in the case of the length of the reappointment of the trustee.  The Central Bank has their equivalent being reappointment every five years.  Here the Minister will probably dig up some Financial Act and say that the age is 70, that we want the Trustee Savings Banks to have a level of playing filed and, that therefore, we will kick this lot off at 70 as well, regardless.  I await the Minister's response.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened again with interest to what the Senator had to say.  We have dealt with this matter over a wide range of amendments during the day.  Modern law is such that we have to be more factual than heretofore so that there will be no ambiguity pertaining to particular matters, especially to appointments of bodies, boards, and so on. Taking into account modern thinking, and reviewing the present trustee status, membership and composition of the Trustee Savings Banks over the years, it was felt that 70 was a reasonable age at which to place a limit.  We know that changes will have to take place immediately on the Act becoming law.  There is a large number of people, some excellent people, on these boards.  All of the trustees over the years have performed very well and have made a great contribution. <Col N="1479" />are obliged, as legislators, to give an indication of our wish to the Trustee Savings Banks on the type of composition we want to see, so that we can get on the boards the best people, the people who will make the best decisions in the interests of the investors, the depositors and the borrowers.  Ultimately, it will be in the best interest of the country to ensure that the best financial climate and equality of opportunity is available to all and sundry so that people can have the maximum opportunity to utilise finance in the best way possible.</P>

      <P>The Minister says it all himself when he says the &ldquo;best people&rdquo; but if it is to be the best people, why has he drawn a line at 70?  This means that those who are better, even though they may be over 70, have been eliminated.  Accordingly, we will not have the best people. We will only have the best people under 70.  It is quite possible that there will be better people over 70 years of age.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, indeed.  I find it difficult to understand why the Minister has drawn a line at 70.  My suspicion is that it relates to a fairly pleasant way of getting rid of some of the people off the boards.  It is a polite way of shunting off whatever number they want shifted.  The problems might be easier sorted out if there was an age cut-off limit.  Maybe it is my way of thinking that leads me to that conclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the Minister's argument at all.  If what the Minister says is logical, with respect, he could easily have accepted my amendment or, indeed, incorporated those views in the original Bill so that each trustee comes up for reappointment after five years. The Minister's defence of not accepting that was that, in any case, under the Second Schedule the rules for each trustee savings bank can be made and they can sort out their own way of getting <Col N="1480" /> rid of incompetent trustees.  There is no need for an upper age limit whereby persons are compulsorily evicted from the boards of Trustee Savings Banks.  Such people might, perhaps, be the better contributors and the more comptent trustees.  We need a mechanism whereby each person's position is reviewed every five years or so.  Then the less competent could be moved sideways gently.  The best and the brightest of the over 70s, who have experience and time on their hands &mdash; and many have a tremendous commitment and love a voluntary involvement of this kind at that stage in their lives should not be evicted.  We are talking about a voluntary involvement here, and that is worth reiterating.</P>
      <P>If the Minister trusts the Second Schedule and the rules that will be drawn up by the Trustee Savings Banks, he should omit this section altogether and let them decide at what stage someone is incompetent.  Item 2 of the Second Schedule which relates to matters to be provided for by the rules of a Trustee Savings Banks, reads: &ldquo;The manner of appointment and removal of trustees of the bank&rdquo;.  If the Minister trusts the Trustee Savings Banks to draw up their own rules and to judge the competence of their trustees &mdash; he has assured us on this in relation to his defence of the previous amendment &mdash; he should trust them to know when someone is too old to behave competently and thereby protect the best and the brightest who may be over 70 rather than force them out at 70.  It is illogical, given the Minister's defence to my previous amendment &mdash; which I have just withdrawn reluctantly and under pressure I might add &mdash; to present the case he is now presenting.  Let the Second Schedule and the rules of the banks decide who is competent and at what age they become incompetent.  Do not tie the hands of the Trustee Savings Banks by forcing them to evict their brightest at 70 years of age.</P>

If we have the best and brightest at 70 years of age, fit and committed, with a further contribution to make, now that we are changing the entire status of the Trustee Savings Banks rather than heretofore, where trustees were voluntary people, it will be possible to remunerate them.  I cannot see any reason there cannot be an opportunity to appoint these over seventies, who are unique, special, particular and very bright with a further contribution to make, as advisers to these successful institutions.  I do not think there is any element here of disposing or removing unfairly anybody over 70.  It is a general proposal in the Bill that when people reach the age of 70 they will know the rules, regulations and the law and there will be an opportunity for them to move on.  Perhaps it may help them to make an even greater contribution while they are on the board.  If there is a need for these bright people to be retained or used in another way, I am sure there will always be advisory positions to which they can be appointed.  That would be a matter for the board, directors or managers of the Trustee Savings Banks at any particular time.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(1) For the purposes of this section, &lsquo;interest&rsquo; has the same meaning as it has in section 49 of the Companies Act, 1989.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I move my substitute amendment No. 22 on today's Order Paper:</P>
      <P>In page 16, between lines 40 and 41, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  For the purposes of this section, &lsquo;interest&rsquo; means a pecuniary or other beneficial interest.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is not an amendment I will be able to withdraw if the Minister is not in a position to accede to my request.  It is terribly important that we have a definition of interest under section 21.  We are talking about disclosure of interest by trustees of a Trustee Savings Bank.  Section 21 reads:</P>
      <P>(1)  A trustee of a trustee savings bank who has&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  an interest in a company or concern with which the bank proposes to make or has made a contract, or</P>
      <P>(b)  an interest in a contract which the bank proposes to make or has made,</P>
      <P>and it goes on in that way.  We are talking about the disclosure of an interest.  Under similar legislation &mdash; I refer the Minister to the Companies Bill &mdash; there is a similar section, directly comparable.  In that section the Minister felt it essential to define &ldquo;interest&rdquo;.  In fact, I put it to the Minister that this section is inoperable without a definition of interest included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1483" /> It is a very serious section.  We are talking about a person being connected to a trustee.  We define what &ldquo;being connected to&rdquo; means, but we do not define what &ldquo;interest&rdquo; means in relation to disclosure of interest by trustees.  I am asking the Minister to accept my amendment, or similar words; the Minister may come back at Report Stage, if he wishes. I have suggested that we could define &ldquo;interest&rdquo; here as a pecuniary or other beneficial interest.  If the wife, son or daughter has an interest in, does that impinge on the interest of the trustee? This section is inoperable without defining interest.  The Minister gave a very detailed definition of interest in the Companies Bill which was essential to make the equivalent section of that Bill operable.  I await with interest the Minister's response as to why there is no definition of interest in this section of the Bill, unlike equivalent sections in other Bills.</P>

In the absence of such a definition the ordinary and relatively wide meaning of interest would apply.  In addition, it is not appropriate, and would not be appropriate, to have a cross reference to a Bill which is currently before the Oireachtas.  There is no difficulty in having a reference to Acts which have been passed by the Oireachtas, but it is not appropriate to have a cross reference to a Bill which is currently being debated, as each Bill must be taken&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not any documents available to me here to interpret the word &ldquo;interest&rdquo;.  It would be my opinion, reading section 21 which is very clear, that the trustees are bound to declare an interest in any company or any concern or, indeed, in any proposal in which they have a particular interest, or in any contract which the bank proposes to make or has made.  If a person to whom a person who has such interest is connected, they shall disclose it to the bank.  That covers the point Senator Doyle was making earlier&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;pertaining to the situation regarding wives, sons, daughter or other connections.  It is fairly clear and it will also give greater adjudication powers to the Central Bank in the consideration of the performance of any particular trustee.  Once the broader definition of interest is there, the Central Bank will have much broader opportunities to adjudicate in any particular situation pertaining to non-disclosure by a trustee of their interest in a particular situation or in a connection with any contract or company with which the bank proposes to do business or, indeed, has done business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the Minister <Col N="1485" /> that this section is inoperable without a definition of interest, as the section is concerned with disclosure of interest.  We all have a vague view as to what interest may or may not be but without a clear definition included in this section, as we feel is necessary to include in the Companies Bill which is presently going through the Oireachtas as the Minister pointed out, we are presenting to the legal people a field day.  Dare anyone challenge &mdash; you or I, if we happen to be trustees of a board &mdash; that we did not disclose our interest?  How much of an arm's length would an interest in a certain business relate to a trustee savings bank?  If your wife had a major interest, or even a minor shareholding, in a company that wanted to borrow &mdash; now we are giving corporate powers to the Trustee Savings Banks &mdash; from a trustee savings bank, is that an interest if you are a trustee?  You are not responsible for your wife.</P>
      <P>We should define here what interest means and how close it is connected.  If your son or daughter worked for a company that is looking for a loan of money from a trustee savings bank, you are not responsible for them once they reach the age majority.  Is that an interest in terms of your trusteeship?  Is your daughter-in-law, one step further out, who may be managing a little company that is looking for a loan &mdash; as they will be able to in the future from a trustee savings bank &mdash; too far out?  Is that not an interest when it is the daughter-in-law? Where does interest begin or end? It is a minefield.  The legal people will have a field day.  We are really giving them a licence to go to town on this.  I suggest that without a definition it will be virtually impossible to challenge whether or not a trustee has disclosed his interest. I would ask the Minister to please reconsider this matter and to accept my amendment which is only trying to achieve what the legislation is trying to achieve.  We must have a proper system for the declaration of interest and without a definition of that interest we are going nowhere.</P>

      <P>We have to be clear about the position pertaining to one's interest or one's personal connection. One's wife, daughter-in-law or son-in-law does not necessarily have to be involved in a company for one to have a connection with that company.  One can be involved with people on boards, corporate bodies or organisations or can be personally friendly with people who may be applicants for financial accommodation from the Trustee Savings Banks.  Does that mean that a person because of his friendship with somebody has an interest?  I do not think it does.</P>

The fact that we are inserting this measure in this section allows a broader context to be taken into account.  It gives flexibility to the Central Bank to be able to make a broader adjudication.  At the end of the day it serves the Trustee Savings Banks and, ultimately, the individual depositor and indeed the individual lender in a better manner.</P>

      <P>Dare I suggest that there is sloppy drafting in this section?  We define a connected person here and we define a connected person in the Companies Bill.  We define interest in the Companies Bill but we do not define interest in the equivalent section here. This is sloppy drafting.  The Minister is being disingenuous again and I cannot accept the point he is trying to make. Effectively, he said he agrees with my amendment where there is a pecuniary <Col N="1487" /> or a financial interest.  If he agrees with it, he should please accept it and we will have no problems with this section.</P>

      <P>I can agree with it in the overall context without being absolutely specific and enshrining it in the law.  The Senator's point is well made, but I think we must allow flexibility to the Central Bank so that they can adjudicate on the motives and the performance of a person, on whether that person, being a trustee, used his own situation on a board to have a decision made in favour of a company or an individual which normally may not have been made.  We must allow that flexibility to the supervisory body to decide whether or not the trustee acted improperly in any particular instance.  If we narrow it down we take away the flexibility and the adjudication rights that the Central Bank, as the broad supervisory authority over all financial matters in the State, needs to have.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to get an explanation as to why we are again stepping out of line in the treatment of Trustee Savings Banks under section 23 relative to the Central Bank Act or the Building Societies Act.  The Minister quoted precedent and the need to keep in line and keep a level playing field with the other financial institutions.  Yet in section 23 (6) we are prohibiting Trustee Savings Banks from purchasing, leasing, selling or exchanging buildings or other land or erecting buildings or incurring expenditure of a capital nature on the doing of work to buildings or other land of the bank without the consent of the Central Bank.</P>
      <P>We are talking about a period of rationalisation for our financial institutions in the years ahead.  Some years ago up to four banks and other similar institutions had a branch each in some towns but these have been rationalised down to one or two branches in most areas.  The banks were not prohibited from disposing or otherwise of their surplus buildings and other capital requirements so why are we placing restrictions on the Trustee Savings Banks from disposing of any property they may not need with a view to future rationalisation?  It is possible that the two remaining trustee savings banks will amalgamate.  They had negotiations some years ago&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that fully so why are we placing restrictions on them?  I accept that the Minister does not intend to prohibit but he is placing restrictions on their ability to freely deal or dispose of property surplus to their requirements. There may be a good reason for this but it is important to point out that we are not placing those restrictions on other financial institutions.  Therefore, we are not talking about a level playing field, a precedent or anything else.  What is the rationale behind this?  It seems to be totally illogical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1490" />
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to point out that we are not placing restrictions on the Trustee Savings Banks.  We are incorporating into the new Bill a provision that is contained in the old legislation.  Subsection (6) states that the trustees of a Trustee Savings Bank shall not buy, lease, sell property and so on or engage in capital works such as building new offices or extending offices without the consent of the Central Bank.  In the case of any property purchase or leasing from the trustees of a Trustee Savings Bank the Central Bank approval of that transaction may be taken as given.  The amendment proposes that the authority of the Minister for Finance should be required for property purchase and leasing by the Trustee Savings Banks.  That would be totally inappropriate.  This is part of the day to day activities of the Trustee Savings Banks.  The approval of the Central Bank will be required and the Minister should not be involved in what is essentially a supervisory function.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated on several occasions that we are repealing the old legislation governing the Trustee Savings Banks.  It is right that we should do so because it is very old but I wonder why he has chosen to incorporate this section directly from the old legislation. I fail to understand the reason for it. Subsection (6), together with similar provisions in the Building Societies Act, 1989, has been specifically included in the Bill to ensure consistency in the detailed provisions of banking laws as they will apply to all financial institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not clear as to why this section which places restrictions on the purchase or sale of buildings and other expenditure of a capital nature relating to the buildings will apply only to the Trustee Savings Banks.  It is illogical; it is irrational given that we are trying to establish a level playing field and fair competition between all the financial institutions.  It does not make any sense with amalgamation and rationalisation in the offing.  Trustee Savings Banks will not be able to sell a sub-branch without a big scene with the Central Bank.  Other <Col N="1491" /> financial institutions do not have that restriction and I wonder why the Minister is imposing it on the Trustee Savings Banks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The position in regard to Trustee Savings Banks is different in that we are talking about a unique structure.  The Trustee Savings Banks were set up in a different way to the other banks. At present the Minister for Finance has supervisory power and is the controlling authority pertaining to leasing, selling, managing or changing property.  We are transferring that responsibility to the Central Bank.  The reason is that the scope of the Trustee Savings Banks is being changed.  Obviously, if we are to change their ratio of lending rights, if we are to give them different opportunities, and if we are creating a new environment for them we must take into account their reserves, the role they should play.  The responsibility which lay with the Minister for Finance is being transferred to the Central Bank.</P>
      <P>I do not visualise any difficulties arising because the Central Bank must take cognisance of the financial environment in which the Trustee Savings Banks operate.  We must take into consideration the competition they have with other banks. The Central Bank cannot make decisions that would put the depositors of the Trustee Savings Banks at a disadvantage or put any impediment in the way of the commercial opportunities available to the Trustee Savings Banks.  I do not see any difficulty with this transfer of functions which were the responsibility of the Minister for Finance to the Central Bank. That is being done in the best interests of depositors and in the interest of proper financial management <i>vis-à-vis</i> the unique position of the Trustee Savings Banks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>We now have semi-State financial institutions without any restrictions and they enjoy a special position in terms of protecting the taxpayers' money and investments.  Those bodies do not have the restriction of having to obtain <Col N="1492" /> the permission of the Central Bank. Banks now use agents for sub-offices rather than erecting new buildings.  I have no doubt that this provision will prove to be unnecessary.  In fact, it contradicts what the Minister has been saying about the need for consistency and a level playing pitch.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not envisage any difficulty in regard to this section which refers specifically to Trustee Savings Banks.  Senator Doyle referred to the position in the semi-State sector &mdash; I am sure she was referring to the ICC and others &mdash; but I should like to tell here that they must have consultations before they can take certain decisions.  If in a lending ratio liberation which the Central Bank would approve for the Trustee Savings Banks, the Trustee Savings Banks decided to acquire property or to go into a certain line of activity then the Central Bank would invoke the section. The Central Bank may decide that that activity was not the role of the Trustee Savings Banks.  The Minister for Finance has a supervisory and consultative role to play.  We are seeking to transfer those powers to the Central Bank, the national supervisory and financial authority over all financial institutions.  I presume the section will ensure that if the board of a bank take a decision to acquire a certain block of property or a company the Central Bank may invoke the section if they are not satisfied with the reasons given.</P>

If we are giving the Central Bank a supervisory role in regard to the Trustee Savings Banks what they will be doing will be part and parcel of their work.  I do not see how there will be any difficulty about this.  Section 23 states that the trustees of a Trustee Savings Bank shall not purchase, lease, sell or exchange buildings or other land or erect buildings or incur other expenditure of a capital nature on the doing of work to buildings or other land of the bank without the consent of the Central Bank. I am certain that the Central Bank will be reasonable in their approach to this.  I am sure they will see such moves as normal transactions of a Trustee Savings Bank.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say why the Trustee Savings Banks have been singled out for this treatment?  It is an enormous restriction &mdash; I was not aware of it before now &mdash; on the ability of Trustee Savings Banks to operate.  It will mean and enormous reduction in their competitiveness against the other banks.  This is a major issue.  We are talking about their rights over property of any type.  We are talking about their right not only to buy or sell property but to lease or to do anything with property.  I cannot understand why property has been singled out as a restriction for the Trustee Savings Banks.  This means that they are not competing at all in one of the major markets, in one of the major financial instruments if you like, open to the banks.  I cannot understand why the Trustee Savings Banks have been singled out specifically.  Perhaps the Minister of State can tell me if there is a parallel restriction on any other institution.</P>

      <P>In reply to Senators Ross and Doyle, let me repeat what I <Col N="1494" /> have said already earlier today.  The Trustee Savings Banks are a unique structure set up under specific legislation and have clear guidelines.  It is proposed in subsection (6)&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to transfer supervisory control from the Minister for Finance to the Central Bank.  As my colleague, Sentor Fallon, has pointed out, we do not visualise any difficulties for the Central Bank in interpreting this. The Central Bank directors and management are familiar with the financial environment in which we operate.  I appreciate what Senator Ross says about the property market and the opportunities that lie therein and that it would be unfair to put a restriction on the Trustee Savings Banks.  What we are saying is that we do not visualise restrictions but, due to the uniqueness and status of the Trustee Savings Banks, we believe we should transfer the controlling authority from the Minister for Finance to the Central Bank and that what is contained in the old Act should be carried over into this Bill.  The building societies find themselves in a different position in that they are owned by the shareholders and are managed on their behalf.  In most cases apart, from their national headquarters and the branches in the bigger provincial centres, they operate on an agency basis. They have a different status to that to the Trustee Savings Banks.  They are unique. Senator Ross spoke about the restrictiveness of this provision, but the whole thrust of this Bill is to remove that restrictiveness, to open up opportunities and to provide increased options for the Trustee Savings Banks.</P>

      <P>It may, but that is a matter of opinion.  I do not think that the Central Bank operates in that kind of environment or makes that type of negative decision.  It must take an overall view in the best interests of the nation and the financial markets.  It cannot operate in isolation and say &ldquo;We are going to support this and stop that there&rdquo;.  It could not operate on that basis.  It would not be fair to do so.  I am confident that the Central Bank would not do so.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State has said that the building societies are owned by the shareholders and that the Trustee Savings Banks are owned by the trustees.

      <P>If they could be trusted they would be left, as the owners, with this <Col N="1496" /> very large responsibility.  For some reason instead of it being transferred from the Minister to the trustees, which to my mind would be the logical thing to do in a Bill of this sort, it is being transferred to another State run, State organised and State directed body.  In fact, this is reducing the independence of the Trustee Savings Banks to a degree where it would be totally wrong to say that they are competing in any equal form with other banks.  The question I would like to ask is: why did the Minister of State not leave it with the trustees.  Why did he not just say that the trustees can do what they like in regard to property, that they are people in whom the Government have confidence?  To me this implies a lack of confidence that he has to give that responsibility to the Central Bank. Can the Minister of State tell me if he has that sort of confidence in the trustees?</P>

      <P>I am very pleased to hear that.  I am sure if he had listened to some of the contributions already made on this Bill today he will know that we have the utmost confidence in the trustees and indeed in the management of the Trustee Savings Banks.  The Minister for Finance confirmed this in 1984.  There is no doubt about this.  We still have that confidence in them.  This is not restrictive and does not show any lack of confidence on the part of the Government or the Central Bank in the trustees or in the decisions they have made.  The property is only invested in the trustees and will remain so.  This is carried over from the existing law, but it has been broadened to include block consents to be granted by the Central Bank on a very liberal basis.</P>

We will give the Minister of State the benefit of the doubt.  Perhaps the implications of including this section were not as obvious as they must be now. Would the Minister of State agree to withdraw this subsection from the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Deputy's request.  The Minister of State in his reply seemed to be anticipating the decisions of the Central Bank.  If I understand his reply correctly he is saying that the law has been interpreted in a very liberal fashion and that therefore it will continue to be interpreted in a liberal fashion. Nothing could be further from the truth.  I can envisage the trustees and the Central Bank coming into conflict over a decision of this sort.  In that event the Central Bank would of course make the decision. That is a situation I would like to avoid. The Minister of State could easily avoid it by leaving the Central Bank our of this but it seems that he is justifying the inclusion of this section by saying there is no need to worry because the Central Bank would make the right decision. That is bad law as for as I am concerned.</P>

      <P>Let me clarify this matter.  It is now ten years since a decision was taken to bring forward new Trustee Savings Banks legislation.  Therefore, the genesis of this Bill goes back over a good few years.  No effort was made to rush in or carry over any section from the old Bill into this Bill.  Great care was taken and the best legal advice was obtained to ensure that we brought forward before this House the best legislation possible. What we are talking about here is a transfer of functions from the Minister for Finance to the Central Bank.  We do not visualise any difficulties with this.  It is important we do so and our advice is that it should be done.  I put it before the House and I ask the House to accept the section.</P>

      <P>The terms of this section are very broad with regard to any type of capital expenditure, presumably meaning that if the trustees want to spend £1,000 on capital expenditure &mdash; and there would be many circumstances in which that would be possible &mdash; they would have to go to the Central Bank for that.  If the trustees want to spend £500 they will have to go to the Central Bank for permission.  If they want to spend £10, and there are capital expenditures of £10, will they have to go to the Central Bank for permission.</P>

      <P>Subsection (6) covers the entire property portfolio pertaining to Trustee Savings Banks.  It states clearly:</P>
      <P>The trustees of a Trustee Savings Bank shall not purchase, lease, sell or exchange buildings or other land or erect buildings or incur other expenditure of a capital nature on the doing of work to buildings or other land of the bank without the consent of the Central Bank.</P>
      <P>This may be general or limited to a particular transaction.  It can be a general consent or a limited consent.  It is something which has worked well over the years.  It is something that we recommend should be done again.  It is something that has been legally clarified as being necessary.  I regret if I cannot convince the Senators of the necessity for this but I am satisfied that the operation of this provision will impose no restrictions on the Trustee Savings Banks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the Minister is genuine in his belief but I would like to know when permission will have to be sought.  It says that permission will have to be sought in every case of capital expenditure on the doing of work to buildings.  It is not even a matter of them doing it and then seeing if it is all right afterwards.  In every single case where they are incurring capital expenditure on the doing of work to buildings, they have <Col N="1501" /> to get permission.  It may not have worked like this in practice before but that does not justify us passing badly worded, badly drafted legislation.  The Central Bank can, whenever the Trustee Savings Banks want to incur minor capital expenditure, require them to get permission.  I am talking about small amounts of money, about buying desks, about painting walls and so on.  The Trustee Savings Banks cannot do those things without permission.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister explain what is capital expenditure here and then we might get to the bottom of this because otherwise we are talking about minor amounts of money.  Capital expenditure is not necessarily something which is very high. We could be talking about tiny items of expenditure and they will have to seek the permission of the Central Bank.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is missing the point.  The purpose of the Bill is to ensure that competitiveness and opportunity prevails across the board for the Trustee Savings Banks.  Theoretically this section includes everything but it will be operated in a broad way, with block consent which will not inhibit the competitiveness of the Trustee Savings Banks.  Senator Ross is talking about the technical management of a particular situation at any given time as if to say that if a bank needed a new window they would have to request the permission of the Central Bank for it.  We are not talking about a situation like that but about block proposals from the Trustee Savings Banks going to the Central Bank.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister could solve this problem by telling us exactly what expenditure of a capital nature on the doing of work to buildings, means. Does it include minor items of expenditure or is the Minister saying that it is only a policy decision about large matters? That is not what it says in the Bill but that is what it appears to me the Minister is saying and that is in direct contradiction to the section as the Minister will know if he looks at it carefully. We are not here to allow sloppy legislation through because it is unlikely that something will happen.  I can envisage a situation where the Central Bank interfere on the tiniest items of expenditure because the Trustee Savings Banks did not ask for permission.  As far as I am concerned the Central Bank has every right to do that under this Bill.</P>
      <P>It is ridiculous that sloppily drafted legislation should be allowed through.  If the Minister could tell us what expenditure of a capital nature on the doing of work to buildings means specifically, maybe we will get through this.  Otherwise, it means any sort of spending at all and we could have a chaotic situation in the future.  The Minister knows as well as I, that this Bill has taken ten years to draft and it will be 25 years before it is amended again.  We should not allow this legislation to go through for posterity nor allow the Central Bank and the Trustee Savings Banks to come into conflict on minor items of expenditure, which is what this is allowing.  Perhaps the Minister could tell me what this phrase means.</P>

      <P>The Central Bank and the Trustee Savings Banks will have no difficulty, as far as I am concerned in incorporating what has prevailed successfully and for so long between the Minister for Finance and the Department of Finance.  Clear guidelines can be agreed <i>vis-à-vis</i> expenditure, nominal expenditure, minor expenditure.  Where the Central Bank require the Trustee Savings Banks to put forward proposals pertaining to larger capital expenditure there should be no difficulty.  There would be no hope for this country financially if we had to operate in an environment where permission had to be sought from the Central Bank for every single penny expended by an institution.</P>

      <P>There would be no hope whatever.  There is no point in suggesting that is the case.  It has not been the case, it will not be the case and the guidelines will be agreed on a block, consensus basis between the Trustee Savings Banks and the Central Bank in the best interests of everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I know there is some pressure to continue but I beg the House's indulgence.  I think the Minister bases his justification for this section on hopes that clear guidelines can be agreed.  I base my objection to it on the fact that this leaves us where there may be serious conflict, and serious conflict on very minor matters.  It is not good enough for a Minister to come forward and say, this will be allright because we are dealing with sensible people who have a liberal policy. We are not here to legislate for sensible people who have liberal policies; we are here to legislate for stupid people who have stupid policies because that is what we must prevent.  The Minister is legislating for the most optimistic possible scenario.  We should be legislating for the worst possible scenario and taking precautions against that.  We are allowing through here very sloppy legislation which could give rise to conflict which, <Col N="1504" /> with minor amendment or the co-operation of the Minister, could be solved this evening.</P>
      <P>The case for taking out or amending this section is great and surely self evident to everybody in this House, and I must say I find the Minister's reply totally unconvincing.  I am a little tired of putting forward amendments in this House at this time of year or towards the summer recess when, whatever case is made for them, whatever the Minister's or the Government's belief, there is no question of them being accepted because the Minister is not going to let the Bill go back to the Dáil.  It is just not good enough that because the Dáil wants to adjourn this week and the Minister does not want to take the Bill back to the Dáil, we should allow this to go through.</P>

I think the section is totally unnecessary even if we are not going to get a definition of work of a capital nature to buildings. Obviously the Minister is not going to give that to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This subsection is totally unnecessary because it leaves the Trustee Savings Banks uncompetitive relative to the other financial institutions in property dealing, disposing of unnecessary assets etc.  It is unnecessary without our ever getting down to defining what it means.  I ask the Minister to consider coming back to us on Report Stage, having left his mind open here this evening to withdrawing <Col N="1505" /> section 23 (6).  The section is irrelevant and unnecessary and it fouls the level playing field we talk so much about in relation to this legislation.</P>

      <P>I want to go back on this section.  Senator Ross and Senator Doyle are making a mountain out of a molehill. The Trustee Savings Banks since they were formed have made steady progress. They have built new offices and new banks.  They have not been hindered with their work by the Department of Finance.  The Minister on Second Stage told us of further expansions.  Are the Central Bank going to say to them, &ldquo;Sorry, you cannot build your little bank in Longford&rdquo; or Galway or wherever?</P>

      <P>Senators who say they do not know what expenditure of a capital nature means are trying to fool us.  Somebody asked if it meant we would have to go to the Central Bank for expenditure involved in putting a nail in the wall.  This is total nonsense.  Expenditure of a capital nature means what it says, something worthwhile, such as if you are going to build a large extension or another branch. That is what it has meant to the Department of Finance in the past.  If we want to exagerrate a very minor issue we are being unfair.  This section will present no problem for the Trustee Savings Banks.</P>

I ask him again to give it to us and solve the problem.  I tell Senator Fallon I have seen knives, forks, spoons, mats and such minor things in accounts year after year classified as items of capital expenditure, and they are things that cost less than £5.  For 20 years I have seen this sort of thing.  They are <Col N="1506" /> caught by the Bill by any normal, respectable accountancy standards.  The Minister has a duty to tell us what expenditure of a capital nature means and whether there is any minimum limit on it.  Perhaps he will tell us what the minimum limit is.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(c) from publishing or continuing to publish an advertisement or from issuing circulars inviting the public to take out loans.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment seeks, in the event of Trustee Savings Banks being prevented from seeking deposits, to prevent them issuing loans.

      <P>Section 27 empowers the Central Bank to give directions to a Trustee Savings Bank regarding the content of their advertisements and whether they may advertise for deposits. Senator Upton and colleagues propose an amendment to extend these powers to loans as well as deposits.  The existing <Col N="1507" /> provision is based on section 39 of the Central Bank Act, 1989.  Deposits are singled out because the immediate concern in any case of difficulty would be to limit the Trustee Savings Banks from taking in further deposits.  This would in turn limit their ability to make further loans.  Section 27 (1) allows the Central Bank to control the content of advertisements and any event, should the situation require it, section 26 allows the Central Bank to direct a Trustee Savings Bank to suspend all or part of its business. The addition of a specific provision on advertising for loans is not therefore required.</P>

      <P>Section 32 deals with the investment of Trustee Savings Banks' funds, the Minister's special account in the Post Office Savings Bank and the payment of interest thereon.  This section provides for the continuing investment of funds in the Exchequer by the Trustee Savings Banks.  The Central Bank, after consulting the Minister for Finance, will determine the proportion of total funds to be so invested at any time.  Senator Doyle proposes that there be a ceiling of 70 per cent of total deposits in this proportion.  The present amount lodged to the Exchequer is 80 per cent and the intention is to reduce this progressively over time.  The combined primary and secondary liquidity ratios of the Associated Banks at present amount to 35 per <Col N="1509" /> cent of their relevant resources.  The rate at which the present 80 per cent would be reduced would depend among other things on the opportunities which would become available for prudent expansion of Trustee Savings Banks' business.  The imposition of a ceiling of 70 per cent would impose a requirement to reduce from 80 per cent to 70 per cent immediately, regardless of the opportunities available for the prudent expansion of Trustee Savings Banks' business.</P>

    <P>This section deals with the appointment, qualification and removal of an auditor of a Trustee Savings Bank.  I am directing my amendments to the removal procedure in respect of an auditor.  There is a glaring omission and a lack of equality in that there is no appeal procedure.  If an auditor is removed from office for any reason he is not entitled to appeal.  Any professional person who is removed from office faces a very uncertain future.  The very least he or she should be afforded is an appeal in relation to the issue before them.  I hope my amendments are self-explanatory.  Amendment No. 30 purports to include new subsections, one of which states that the trustee shall give 21 days notice to an auditor of their intention to remove him from office and shall also serve notice of their intention to the Central Bank and during this period the <Col N="1510" /> auditor may appeal in writing to the Central Bank against the proposed decision of the trustees to remove him.  This is a basic right of anybody put in the position of being removed from a professional post.</P>
    <P>My amendment goes on to state that the Central Bank should be able to decide an appeal under this section, subject to the consent of the Minister.  The reference to the Minister is not, perhaps, ideal but it is the best available, given the structures within which we are talking. Before deciding thereon the Central Bank shall consider any representations duly made either orally or in writing on behalf of the auditor or trustees.  That is self-explanatory and would be a minimum requirement in removing anybody from such office.</P>
    <P>My amendment continues that, for the purposes of this section, a notice of intention to remove an auditor shall include all notices, documentation and other communications relating to the meeting of the trustees at which it was decided to remove the auditor.  Here we are dealing with rights of freedom of information.  If I were being removed from office, the decision having been determined at the meeting of the trustees in this case, I should like access to the documents, minutes and all other relevant literature or information presented at the meeting.</P>
    <P>I await the Minister's response.  The Building Societies Act contains an elaborate appeals procedure.  When it suits us we refer to the level playing field and consistency; if not, it is ignored, as in this Bill.  I know the type of procedure provided for there is not directly applicable here, but the principle of an appeal has been conceded and we must at the minimum include the principle of an appeals procedure for anyone removed from office in this Bill.  I am not saying that the parliamentary language I have used in my amendments is the only or even the best way of conceding the principle of an appeal for such an auditor.  I will be advised by the Minister if he feels there is a better way of expressing it or a better system of including the principle of an appeal for such an auditor, but if <Col N="1511" /> the Minister feels there is a better way of expressing the content of my amendment or a better system of including an appeal system for such an auditor, I will be guided by him.</P>

      <P>Section 36 covers the appointment and removal of an auditor, circumstances under which an auditor may be disqualified from the position and the type of people who will be ineligible for appointment as auditor.  Senator Doyle wants notice to be given to and provision for appeal by an auditor whom it is proposed to remove from office before his term of office expires.  The appeal would be to both the Minister and the Central Bank.  This is not really necessary as the matter is unlikely to arise as a practical problem.</P>
      <P>A trustee savings bank would only remove an auditor from office before his term expired in the most serious circumstances as the auditor would have recourse to the courts if he felt the trustee savings bank acted without due cause.  The procedures laid down in the building societies legislation are to ensure that the auditor can make the members of the society aware of what is going on.  That is not relevant in the case of a trustee savings bank, which does not have members like a building society or shareholders like a company.  It is the trustees who will take the decision.  In the building societies or Central Bank legislation there is no provision for any appeal to any quarter outside of the immediate body concerned in the case of the removal of an auditor from office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a right of appeal to the body concerned.  Senator Doyle also wants an appeal from the Central Bank's direction to the Trustee Savings Banks not to appoint or reappoint a named person as auditor. This is not appropriate and no such appeal is envisaged in the building society or Central Bank Acts.  Senator Doyle also wants to delete the qualification &ldquo;other <Col N="1512" /> than an auditor&rdquo; in section 36 (10) (a) in describing persons disqualified from being auditors of the Trustee Savings Banks.  I take it that her concern here is that it implies that an auditor could be an officer of the bank rather than an independent third party, whose relationship with the bank consists of providing a professional service.  The qualification set out in the Bill do not make the auditor an officer of the bank or change his status. It is simply a precaution in case an auditor might need to be regarded as an officer of the bank for a specific purpose.  When auditors are carrying out functions for normal corporate bodies or companies, they can be removed at any time by a vote at an annual general meeting and they have no recourse to appeal.  They are employed on the basis of their performance and their professionalism.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to comment on the appointment of the auditor.  In the course of the insurance Bill, we discussed at some length the role of the auditor.  At that time the Minister introduced a fairly substantial amendment to give the auditor direct access to the Minister in cases where he found something amiss, or if he felt the company was trading in such a way that it might not be in a position to meet its liabilities, there was a requirement on the auditor to make that fact known to the Minister responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the provisions of this Bill, I find <Col N="1513" /> it quite extraordinary that an auditor can be dismissed without reference to a broader body.  The Central Bank is informed, but perhaps the Minister will take us through the process?  Let us take an example where a duly appointed auditor is going through the books, and finds something amiss and gives some indication of that fact to the trustees, and at that point is dismissed,</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;or removed from office, if that is the appropriate phrase. At that point, what is the auditor's duty?</P>
      <P>To whom does he give the information? It seems there is no place they can bring this information.  I understand that under company legislation &mdash; I stand to be corrected and the Minister will very quickly do so &mdash; an auditor can only be dismissed at an annual general meeting.  The Minister is quite right when he says the auditor can address the meeting, but I find it unusual that the trustees board could dismiss an auditor without reference to a wider body.</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister to clarify how the auditor is required to conduct himself, what he is supposed to do with information he has gathered during the audit which has never been published because he was dismissed and removed from office before the audit was completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad Senator Doyle put down these amendments because had she not done so, I would have tabled something very similar.  I would have done so because I was extensively briefed by the Consultative Council of Accounting Bodies in Ireland.  They specifically drew my attention, and possible also Senator Doyle's, to their concerns in this matter.  It would not be taken that it is just a set of partially informed, well meaning Senators who have concerns in this matter.  It is the principal professional body representing the accountancy profession in this country, and I do not think it is possible to dismiss these problems quite so airily as the Minister and his advisers wish to do at this <Col N="1514" /> advanced hour.  They are very important amendments, and they have not been fully answered.</P>
      <P>I have some small acquaintance with this, as I am managing director of one company at least and a director of several others.  I think the Minister may have confused the situation in which a board declines to reappoint an auditor at a general meeting, at which meeting the auditor may be present and may answer questions from shareholders or interested parties.  Indeed, some may be primed to bring out certain things so that he may have the opportunity to explain himself and thereby plead his case.  There is a difference between that and a decision taken in between general meetings and not at an annual general meeting to summarily dismiss a professional.  I made this point at some length during second Stage and I hoped that that coupled with Senator Doyle's excellent amendments, might have persuaded the Minister to think again.</P>
      <P>I have to concur with what my colleague, Senator O'Toole, has said, because there are two ways of approaching this.  First is the avenue Senator Doyle and I have explored, which is the slur on the professional reputation of an accountant and the breach of natural justice involved in denying that person the opportunity to clear his name.  Second, there is the very serious possibility which has been explored by Senator O'Toole, that it may be that an auditor has discovered a deficiency and discrepancy in the books of the Trustee Savings Bank and wishes to draw attention to this in the audited accounts but is dismissed summarily before he can do so and consequently has absolutely no status.  Senator O'Toole's argument that this situation was addressed in a previous Bill by giving a person in such a position direct access to a Minister indicates that the Government have already taken this on board and regard it very seriously.  There is quite a degree of substance to the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I realise it has been a long debate and I absented myself for a while but I listened very carefully on the monitor because I wanted to speak specifically on this point <Col N="1515" /> because I had been briefed.  I urge the Minister to think again.  I would like, if I may, to compliment Senator Doyle because it is rare in legislation, and it is particularly rare in legislation dealing with finance, that one comes across poetry.  There is no question or doubt that there is poetry in this amendment. What a beautiful phrase: when he &ldquo;resigns or becomes disqualified, holds office for five years from the expiration by effluxion of time&rdquo;.  I will cherish that beautiful phrase and I congratulate the Senator on her superb command of the English language.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support this amendment.  Unlike Senator Norris, I wish to apologise to the House that I have not been here for a great deal of this debate.  I would like to have been here for a great deal more.  It is very unusual for me not to be here for a Bill in which I am interested, but it was unavoidable.  I think this is a very important amendment because for a financial institution to change its auditor is a very serious step. The Minister should consider it in this light.  The only possible reasons I can think of why an auditor would be changed are for negligence or inefficiency, on his own part, or because he has discovered something which is awkward for those employing him or possibly because somebody has a croney in another company whom he wants to appoint, the latter two reasons being very bad and the first one being very good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the editor has been inefficient or negligent his right of appeal would obviously be rejected, but his duties in the other two cases should be paramount. I do not know what the case normally is with banks but I think they very rarely change their auditors.  However, in other financial institutions it is not as easy as it is in this Bill.  I take, in particular, the case of stockbrokers where the change of auditor &mdash; I remember trying to do it for what I thought were very good reasons <Col N="1516" />&mdash; is an extremely difficult procedure. Quite rightly it is a very difficult procedure in financial institutions because it is a very delicate and sensitive matter.  Certainly, no stockbroker can change their auditor without going to the Stock Exchange and getting full permission from the Stock Exchange, who will not grant it without one providing a very good reason.  This in itself, is an appeal procedure for the auditor, because he will not be removed unless there is a good reason. It protects the auditor and the shareholders in that company from actually having the auditor removed for bad reasons.  Perhaps the Minister would consider that there is nothing to be lost in the appeal procedure but there is certainly a lot to be gained by giving the auditor this form of Bill.  There is a lot to be gained for the owners of the Trustee Savings Banks themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened again with great interest to the desires of the Senators on these amendments.  I think I would refer them to section 38, where the auditor is required to report to the Central Bank if he discovers any inaccuracies and so on in the running of a Trustee Savings Bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>That is if he can get it done before he is removed.  That is the whole point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing in the Bill which states that his removal from office would debar him from the right to report to the Central Bank on any inaccuracy or anything he had any doubt about.  I have been asked what the functions of an auditor would be.  The functions of any auditor are very clear in that they have to examine in great detail, appraise, account and verify all the transactions, figures, conclusions on all books, deeds, documents, vouchers and other accompanying documentation in the operation of any company's performance.  That is the standard practice pertaining to an auditing function.  In section 38 it is clearly stated that the auditor is required to report to the Central Bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1517" /> If he is being removed or if he discovers something with which he is not satisfied, of course he has the right to report to the Central Bank and, of course, he has recourse to the law if he feels he is being unfairly treated.  That in itself is the maximum that anybody is given in this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to hear from the Minister which law a dismissed auditor might have recourse to.  I do not understand which law it could be.  I understand that an auditor is not a strict employee of the company and therefore may well not be in a position to claim under the Unfair Dismissals Act.  I would like to stress one point.  It is clear in section 38 that an auditor may report to the Minister.  It is a bit smart of the Minister to say there is nothing in the Bill which prevents the auditor from making a report to the Minister or to the Central Bank.  Of course, that is true.  Neither is there anything in the Bill to say what happens if an elephant walks into the Trustee Savings Banks.  What kind of nonsense is it to say there is nothing in the Bill to stop him&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>If push ever came to shove in this business, people would read this line by line.  It is very clear that the auditor has a direct line to the Central Bank.  The Central Bank may require certain things of the auditor.  I put it to the Minister very clearly that the Central Bank may do nothing if somebody who is no longer an auditor and may no longer seek information from somebody who is no longer an auditor.  The auditor who has been dismissed has no right under the terms of this Bill to make a report to the Central Bank.  That is fact.  There is not the slightest doubt that that is the case.  I know very well how smart lawyers would deal with this operation if it happened that the Central Bank decided to move <Col N="1518" /> against the Trustee Savings Banks on the report of an auditor who had been dismissed and the Central Bank were purporting to act under section 38 (2), (3) or (4).  Any lawyer worth his or her salt would immediately say: &ldquo;Hang on a second, that person was not an auditor at that time, that subsection of section 38 does not apply and there was no case or ground on which the Central Bank might initiate the legislation&rdquo;.  If it ever comes to the time when this section must be tested we would certainly be in deep trouble long before we get to examine it line for line.</P>
      <P>It is as clear as day that, if Senator Doyle's amendment is not acceptable to the Minister, all it needs, in effect, is that there would be a period between the decision of the Trustee Savings Banks to dismiss the auditor and the actual dismissal.  In other words, there should be some period where the person could make a case for himself or herself or to present information to the Central Bank or to do whatever needs to be done.  Why the unholy haste?  Why can we not build in some delay mechanism so that everything would be done clearly?  The reason we are discussing it is to see that the shareholders and the State and those with an interest in the Trustee Savings Banks can rest more securely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ramify the point which I think Senator O'Toole has made very well.  There is consistent reference in what the Minister says to the auditor. The problem is, of course, one of timing. By the time he is dismissed he has ceased to be the auditor and is plain Seán Citizen.  His rights as an auditor cease, presumably, with his dismissal.  That I would imagine, cut off his access under this legislation to the Central Bank.  I think it also is clear that it would cut off his access to the records, documents and accounts of the Trustee Savings Banks.  It is very difficult to know in the situation after the auditor has been dismissed upon what precise factual information he would be able to base a report to the Central Bank without placing himself or herself in danger of libel.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I detect a slight note of impatience creeping into the House as this side try to tease out a very important section.  It is understandable, given the day and the hour, but the real difficulty is that this Bill was guillotined on Committee Stage in the House before any of these issues was teased out at length.  I have no doubt that if this debate had been in the Dáil most of these matters would have been resolved and we would not now be requesting the Minister to amend the Bill and thereby bring it back to the Dáil to have the amendments accepted there.  I know the Minister does not want to take the Bill back to the Dáil because it rises tomorrow for the Christmas recess but, if this House means anything, the Minister must take this and other amendments on board for Report Stage.  We are not just in this House for a dress rehearsal, we mean what we say, a lot of work has gone into framing these amendments and there have been excellent contributions from different Members on this side of the House.  We are offering a professional, as well as a personal, opinion.  We have been briefed and we are not just giving half-baked Opposition views on the Bill.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to accept the amendments on this section for the many good reasons that have been given here. He should not feel inhibited in accepting them because of the difficulty of bringing them to the Dáil before Christmas to have them sorted out.  The fact that the Dáil did not think this Bill important enough to debate Committee Stage in detail is not our problem.  The Seanad does not have to justify its existence to anyone but ourselves.  We have a job to do in thoroughly going through Bills, line by line, and we should be allowed to do that.  Our amendments should be judged for what they are and taken back to the Dáil, if necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some very good points were made and I will not reiterate them.  However, one point bothers me in relation to subsection (10) which says that none of the following persons shall be qualified for being an auditor of a Trustee Savings Bank: (a) an officer or employee of the bank (other <Col N="1520" /> than an auditor).  I cannot understand that in view of the Minister's answer to my point on the amendment earlier.  The Minister says that an auditor cannot be an officer or employee of the bank.  It does not make sense and there is something wrong with it.  That is not just my view, it is the view of the professional body and of the financial institutions.  It is a technical or, perhaps, a drafting error and I draw the Minister's attention to it. Perhaps he can explain what it means. The Minister said that an auditor is an independent third party whose relationship with the bank consists of providing a professional service.  I agree with that and he cannot, therefore, be an officer or employee of the bank.  I am not sure what that reference in (a) means, there is a difficulty and perhaps the Minister will explain it.</P>

      <P>Subsection (10) sets out the categories of people who are disqualified from acting as auditors of a Trustee Savings Bank.  These categories include any officers or employees of the bank, which would include the trustees, other than an auditor.  This is very clear as it means that an officer or an employee of the bank cannot be an auditor.  It can only be a professional auditor appointed as an auditor to the bank.</P>

That can only mean one thing, it is as clear as day; it means that an auditor who happens to be an officer or employee of the bank is not disqualified from being the auditor of the Trustee Savings Banks.  It says that an officer or employee of the bank cannot be an auditor, but then it says &ldquo;unless that person happens to be a qualified auditor,&rdquo; in which case they would appear to be eligible for employment.  I remember two years ago this night &mdash; the Government should also have good reason to remember it &mdash; I appealed to the Minister not to put through a Bill.  I said that it was legislation which could not be implemented.  I am saying the same thing tonight.  There is a clear problem in regard to the issues we raised.  Two years ago I told the Minister that I had discussed it with people in the know and all the information we have been given indicates that there are problems in regard to this Bill.  If there is a problem, why should we push the Bill through?  If we pass the Bill it will certainly lead to difficulties somewhere along the line. Why are we trying to force the Bill through?</P>

It is perfectly clear, there is no <Col N="1522" /> question of doubt about it, there is a drafting error and the section clearly states that the Bill contemplates a situation in which an auditor who is an employee can be appointed.  The point has been well made by Senator O'Toole. I take this as a very clear indication that a substantial, important, technical amendment which has the full force of logical argument behind it, is not being taken on board by the Minister because of the difficulty with regard to the Dáil. This is the test case.  I am astonished that the Minister would brush aside the very careful and detailed briefing given to a number of Senators by the senior body representing the accountancy profession. The argument that the Minister did not have advance warning of this could not be sustained because I put a great deal of this on the record on Second Stage.  I will be very surprised if this amendment is not accepted.</P>

Subsection (10) is explicit in the title or qualification of officers who can be auditors. It is very clear.

I will go through them, (b) a person who is a partner, an employer or employee of an officer or employee of the bank (other than an auditor).  This means a professional auditor under the section.  (c) A body corporate, (d) a person who has been an officer or employee of the bank within a period in respect of which accounts would fall to be auditied by him if he were appointed <Col N="1523" /> auditor of the bank.  It is absolutely clear that you cannot have a staff member of a bank, an officer or an employee who may become a qualified auditor, who has been working on those accounts.  The paragraphs state:</P>
      <P>(e) a spouse (or a person living together with an officer of the bank as a spouse) parent, step-parent, child, step-child, brother, sister, half-brother or half-sister of an officer of the bank,</P>
      <P>(f) a person who is disqualified under the Companies Acts for appointment as auditor of a subsidiary or holding company...</P>

      <P>I am absolutely delighted if the Senator only has a problem with subsection (a) because it is very clear that a professional auditor only, so employed and appointed may become an auditor to the Trustee Savings Banks.  If that person happens to be an officer or employee of the bank they are debarred from becoming that auditor; they are debarred while&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>May I ask a question. May I point out an issue.  May I be allowed read it without the parenthesis, that is section 36 (10) (a):</P>
      <P>None of the following persons shall be qualified for being an auditor of a trustee savings bank:</P>
      <P>(a) an officer or employee of the bank...</P>
      <P>That means that an officer or employee of the bank shall be debarred from becoming an auditor.  Now we say but there is only one way in which we could allow him or her to become the auditor, that is if he or she is a qualified auditor in the first place.  There is no doubt about that; it is written there.  We are facilitating the appointment of an employee of the bank as the auditor&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I really have got to add my voice once more to this.  I must emphasise the force of the phrase which reads:</P>
      <P>None of the following persons shall be qualifies for being an auditor of a trustee savings bank:</P>
      <P>(a) an officer or employee of the bank (other than an auditor),</P>
      <P>which means that, unless he or she is an auditor &mdash; I stress unless he or she is an auditor &mdash; and if he or she is an auditor then they shall be qualified.  Nothing could possibly be clearer.  The Minister has signally failed to address that point. It specifically permits and facilitates the appointment of an employee of the bank if such an employee is qualified as an auditor.  That is the only possible construction that could be put either linguistically or legally on that phrase.  It may very well not have been the Minister's intention but nonetheless it is the effect in language and in law.  I am greatly troubled if this causes the Minister difficulty, if it causes the Government difficulty, if it means that the Dáil must sit another day or if it means that the passage of the Bill has to be postponed temporarily.  But I am sure the Minister will agree with me that he would not wish a Bill that contains so serious a flaw to be allowed pass into legislation because it could lead to corrupt practice.  As I understand it, that is what the Minister wishes to extinguish.</P>

As far as I am concerned, I take my interpretation of what is said in this House as much as Senator O'Toole is entitled to take any other interpretation.  It is quite clear from this section that nobody can become an auditor of a bank unless he or she is a professionally appointed, professionally qualified auditor.  I might quote subsection (d): where it is clear that:</P>
      <P>A person who has been an officer or employee of the bank within a period in respect of which accounts would fall to be audited by him if he were appointed auditor of the bank,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>cannot be appointed to do so.  It is categorically clear.  There is enshrined there <Col N="1527" /> protection of the quality of the accountancy and the auditing to be done.  I do not think it could be made any clearer.</P>

      <P>I did not mean to be disrespectful as far as the Minister is concerned. I stand corrected; I beg your pardon, Minister, I did not mean any disrespect by referring to you as &ldquo;he&rdquo;.  I think tempers are getting a bit frayed and that that was an unnecessary intervention. I really do feel there is a problem. That is not my view; it is the view of the professional bodies involved and <Col N="1528" /> of the Trustee Savings Banks themselves. Notwithstanding those logistical difficulties, could the Minister please concede this point which is extremely ambiguous.  In fact, the view of the CCAB is that this section effectively means, as at present drafted, that the auditor could be an officer or employee of the bank, which is not what we want. We want them to be independent, third persons.</P>
      <P>If I may be so bold as to address a remark to the Leader of the House, through the Chair, this Bill was guillotined before it reached this amendment on Committee Stage in the Dáil so this point was not picked up.  Had it been picked up it would have been resolved there and we would not be experiencing this difficulty here today.  That is why so many of the sections are causing problems here.  We need to deal with it.  It is the responsibility of Senators that we put in place what they did not do in the Dáil. I know the day, the time and logistics may cause problems but we cannot renege on our responsibilities in the Seanad as a result.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>However, having said that, the Minister has indicated a degree of movement in his last response which suggests to me that he is beginning to take on board the points we are making because the argument we had was that the section, as phrased, did permit a person who was an employee of the bank to be the auditor.  The Minister has, very honourably, honestly and directly at last acknowledged that this is so.  He said that in his last response but he went on to defend the position by saying that, while this was so, an employee of the bank could not audit the specific accounts of a section for which he had been responsible, or something like that.  However, I am sure the Minister would agree with <Col N="1529" /> me, having advanced this far, that nevertheless there remains the possibility of a conflict of interest.  That is the principle at which we were all trying to get in attacking this section.  I am not impugning the honour of the accountancy proression, but there is clearly a conflict of interests in the position of somebody who is an employee of a group auditing the accounts, even of a section of that group for which he or she was not primarily responsible.</P>
      <P>I accept that the Minister has gone a certain way with us because he had originally dismissed the possibility of interpreting the section in the manner in which we had done; however, he is now interpreting it in that fashion himself but he is hedging it with a further set of restrictions from another part of the Bill.  Let us get into that area if we must but I have to advise the Minister that it clearly indicates to me the existence of a professional conflict of interests, and I really think that the Minister must take that on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite clear that this section does not contemplate an employee being appointed as auditor under any circumstances.  It is clear from what we have said on all sides that this is not the case.  In fact, an auditor could be an employee of a company under certain circumstances.  There may be conflicts of time where the person happens to be working, but there is no doubt that an employee could be appointed as auditor.</P>
      <P>When I used the phrase to the Minister &ldquo;Let us be honest with each other&rdquo;, I did not impugn anything.  It is no more than a turn of phrase.  The Minister may interpret that phrase as much to my disadvantage as to his own.  I have too much respect for the Minister to say that.  I do not believe in cheap shots like that, and that was not my intention at any time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what Senator O'Toole said and I appreciate his elaboration of the point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to what the Senators have said, I would like to try to clarify the matter beyond any doubt.  As section 36 (4) deals with the qualifications needed <Col N="1530" /> to be eligible for the position of auditor to a Trustee Savings Bank, he must either be a member of a body of accountants recognised for the purpose by the Minister for Industry and Commerce or be authorised by the Minister to be an auditor by virtue of having gained similar qualifications elsewhere, or by having adequate knowledge and experience or by having practised as an accountant in Ireland before 1 April 1964.  The bodies which are recognised by the Minister for Industry and Commerce are the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland, the Institute of Certified Public Accountants in Ireland and the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants.  It is only a person with qualifications from those bodies, and recognised by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who can become an auditor of a Trustee Savings Bank.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Except by implication on subsection (10) (a).  We agree with the Minister there but subsection (10) (a) confuses the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The position as regards subsection (10) (a) is absolutely clear. That provision is included so that there can be no prohibition on a staff member, an officer or an employee, of a Trustee Savings Bank going to university to do a particular course to become qualified as a professional public auditor under the relevant bodies which are recognised by the Minister for Industry and Commerce. There can be no discrimination on the rights of a staff member, an employee or an officer, to become a qualified accountant. As a result of that qualification being conferred on him or her, under subsection (10) (d) that person is further debarred from auditing any accounts while he or she was working on those accounts as an employee or an officer of the bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to listen to the conditions I put to him, <Col N="1531" /> and this encapsulates what I am concerned about.  Let us assume that next February when this Bill is in operation a person is appointed an employee of a Trustee Savings Bank, and he takes up duty some time in mid-January or early February.  That person is then an employee of the bank but he was not an employee previously.  As outlined under subsection 36 (4), he also happens to be a person qualified for appointment as an auditor and fulfils all the qualifications. He is an officer and an auditor as outlined in subsection (10) (a).  He has not been working as an employee of the bank during the period for which the accounts were to be audited, in other words, the last financial year.  Can the Minister explain under what section or subsection that person would be debarred from operating as an auditor of the bank?  My understanding is that the person fulfils all the requirements &mdash; he was not an employee during the period to be audited, he is fully qualified as an auditor and he is now an employee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what Senator O'Toole says.  He paints a scenario that probably could be considered, but it is my understanding that an officer of the Trustee Savings Bank cannot become an auditor for that bank's accounts.  An auditor who is appointed may, for a specific purpose, be regarded as an officer if necessary.  In other words, if an auditor is appointed as an auditor to the bank he may be regarded as an officer of the bank.  He has a professional qualification which means he is an auditor.  If the auditor being appointed is to audit the accounts, he must be appointed solely to audit the accounts or to replace another auditor.  He cannot just be taken on to the staff and told: &ldquo;There are the accounts; audit them&rdquo;.  There can be only one auditor.  He must have proper professional qualifications and he must be appointed to do the audit specifically. That is his sole function.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Neither is there disagreement, although I do not fully understand it, on the retrospection where somebody who is an auditor can be considered in certain circumstances to be an officer.  I understand certain aspects of the company law where that could be the case, but certain difficulties are created here and I will spell them out again.  If somebody is appointed on 1 February as an employee of the company &mdash; let us say, a manager of a branch &mdash; he is also fully qualified as an auditor and has never worked in a Trustee Savings Bank before, under my reading of the legislation &mdash; and the Minister has confirmed it now &mdash; that person could be appointed as the auditor of the company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>He or she has all the qualifications, is an employee of the bank and also a qualified auditor and therefore is not debarred under subsection (10) (a) and he was not working for the bank during the period of the accounts to be audited.  In other words, the person was not working for the bank during that financial year, the reason being that he was on a career break, studying to become an auditor.  He had been working for the bank before he took the career break and he has now come back, fully trained, to his old job as manager of the branch and under the legislation is perfectly entitled to be appointed auditor.  I believe that was never contemplated by the legislation.</P>

      <P>In response to Senator O'Toole, I would say that that person could only become auditor from the time he was appointed auditor.  He could not be appointed as an auditor of the bank and subsequently given the job of auditorship.  That could not happen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>We are going to have to resolve this point.  It is not just our view; it is the view of the professional bodies, who are urging that this is a most serious issue which should be resolved.  I do not want to lose sight of my amendments and the principle of an appeals procedure for accountants.  Apparently, this section <Col N="1534" /> does not deal with the resignation of a auditor, which it should do.  This is only one of the many problems in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is clearly taking on board the sense of much of what we are saying.  It seems to me from his last statement that he quite clearly accepted that somebody could be appointed as an auditor and remain an employee of a Trustee Savings Bank.  I do not fully comprehend the import of what Senator Fallon said.  He seemed to suggest that there were different degrees of accountancy, responsibility and so on&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>It could be, but I do not think it is a good idea in any case.  I do not think it is a good idea for somebody who is a manager of a Trustee Savings Bank branch to be in a position to audit the accounts of his own branch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the microcosm of the situation we are addressing now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also accept that there has clearly been movement on the part of the Minister. First, he was reluctant to accept the interpretation we placed on this provision; but, eventually, he accepted it and hedged it around with further qualifications. He now seems to be moving towards the position that perhaps in some remotely possible situation this kind of eventuality might arise.  But it seems to me this is precisely what accurate drafting of legislation is all about &mdash; that loopholes should be closed off at this stage.  Nothing I have heard from the Minister answers the essential nub of the argument which I made earlier on this evening, that is, what we are looking at here is a clear possibility of conflict of interest.  I do not think financial legislation in particular should permit of conflict of interest.  I am convinced this exists and I regret that we have to tease it out in this manner.  We are not doing this to be tendentious at <Col N="1535" /> all.  But, given the degree of movement the Minister has shown in understanding our interpretation of this provision, I honestly believe that if we stick at it we can convince the Minister of what we are saying and he may, with great reluctance, be prepared to accept the amendment.  I recognise the difficulties this may cause with his colleagues, but in order to make good legislation I believe this may very well be necessary.  It is very important that the Seanad should be used for this purpose.  This is one occasion on which I welcome very positively the existence of a rejected politician from the Dáil&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because Senator Doyle is able to say that one of the reasons these amendments were put down was that the legislation was guillotined in the Dáil.  For that reason I find it particularly offensive that the Leader of the House should bounce in and try to intimidate us by waving a guillotine in front of us.  I should like to serve notice on this House that if that is attempted it will be resisted in a manner which will be particular uncomfortable for those who attempt it.</P>

      <P>I have been listening to this debate fairly carefully for most of the day and it strikes me that we have reached somewhat of an impasse at this stage.  Senator Norris said he hoped the Minister would take on board what he was saying.  I suspect that persuasion will not work tonight.  It seems that this Bill is fitted into the Government time table and I would like to try to undo that. When do the provisions of this Bill come into effect?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there a great urgency about it?  I believe this is a classic case of a Bill which was guillotined through the Dáil and there are very serious doubts about it.  If there are doubts about the Bill it should not go through.  On my first day in this Seanad I heard Senator Michael Howard, who is a very experienced Senator, saying to one of the new Senators: &ldquo;If you are not clear and there is not total clarity then the Bill should not go through&rdquo;.  We are quite happy to sit for two days next week, if needs be, to have this Bill teased out.  I have been very impressed by the arguments made by my three Independent colleagues and especially Senator Doyle.  There arguments are very well founded and they have genuine doubts.  I believe that, in the face of the very real doubts which have been raised, we will be doing ourselves a disservice if we push this Bill through.  Speaking on behalf of the Fine Gael group, we would be more than happy to come back next week or early after the Christmas recess <Col N="1537" /> to fully discuss this Bill.  I am sure the Independent Senators feel likewise.  We are not doing this in any tendentious sense.  We want the Seanad to be used properly and to see the right legislation going through.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to debate this matter and I have not suggested at any stage that we should guillotine the Bill.  I am prepared to stay here all night long if it means debating the Bill section by section, line by line.  I have no difficulty with this.  I respect the Legislature and the right of people to have an input into this debate.</P>
      <P>To clarify the question asked by Senator Fallon, I see no difficulty in a qualified professional auditor being appointed as an employee or officer of a bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the other way around.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>He can carry out several functions.  I want to put it clearly on the record that only a qualified auditor, qualified through the professional bodies and acceptable to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and be appointed a professional auditor by a Trustee Savings Bank to carry out the audit of that bank. It is not just any officer who can be appointed to carry out the audit.  He or she has to be fully qualified and clearly appointed to do that job.  They may not under any circumstances audit accounts for the period during which they dealt with those accounts.  I do not think I can make it any clearer than that and I ask the Senators to accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying there is no question of us taking this Bill a few days down the line so that he can consider the points we have made and come back to the House?  The Government may end up have to fight a very expensive case in the courts a few years down the line because of what may well be an error in drafting or a lack of clarity in the legislation.  Without pushing the point, all we are saying is we are quite happy to spend time next week debating <Col N="1538" /> the Bill so that matters can be clarified and there will not be a cloud of doubt hanging over the Bill.  We are happy to stay here all night also, but I do not believe the legislation will be served by victory going to those with the strongest bladders or whoever happens to stay longest.  Sorry, that may be slightly indelicate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems the Minister has retreated a little bit because he does not quite understand the points we are making.  There is no objection whatsoever on this side of the House to somebody who manages to qualify as an account being employed by a Trustee Savings Bank.  There is no Luddite lobby on this side of the House which says that advanced education of any kind shall be a bar to employment.  What we are saying is that an employee of a bank so qualified in the practice of accountancy should not in any circumstances be employed as an auditor of any function of a bank.</P>
      <P>Despite the intention of the Bill the section permits that possibility which, I agree, may be remote.  It is my belief, although I accept I may be wrong, that Senator Fallon has failed to differentiate between the functions of an auditor, on the one hand, and those of an accountant on the other.  Of course, an employee of a Trustee Savings Bank who had certain skills could employ those skills in making financial projections.  That is not the principal function of an auditor; it is the principal function of an accountant who may in certain roles be an auditor for a company or not.  There is nothing to prevent somebody so qualified preparing a set of projections for their own bank but we seek to prevent an employee of the bank auditing any section of the bank's operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to clarify the point at issue for Senator Fallon.  I am not making the point that a person who is a qualified auditor cannot become an officer or an employee of a company. <Col N="1539" /> I agree that it might be useful to employ a person with an auditor's qualifications in the company but that is not the issue; it is the cart before the horse.  What I am referring to is the person who was an employee, who may have taken a career break or was away from the company for one year, and returns as a qualified auditor to his position as a branch manager. There is nothing wrong so far and that person's skills might be used to the best effect within the company but it is the next step that I am concerned about. Under the Bill that person could be appointed as the auditor of the bank.  He is not excluded on the qualification issue. We are all agreed on that and it will not be necessary to refer to it again.  We are all agreed that in certain circumstances an appointed auditor could become an officer.  However, I am referring to an employee of a company who is qualified as an auditor being appointed as the auditor for the bank provided he or she was not in the employment of the bank during the previous 12 months.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 44:</P>
      <P>In page 42, between lines 34 and 35, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(12) An order under this section shall not be made by the Minister for Finance until arrangements for employee shareholding in any company so reorganised by the Minister shall have been made by him.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not have to spell out to the House the benefits of employee shareholding. This principle has been well established among many companies and among the many successful companies, the employees are inclined to give of their best and more than they might otherwise <Col N="1544" /> be inclined to give if they feel they have a direct contribution to the profitability of the company and if their representative is on the board of the company representing them.  I fully believe in that principle of employee shareholding and of employees sharing in the profits of a company.  Such companies are likely to have increased profits to distribute among their shareholders. In this case the employees will benefit if there is total co-operation between employers and employees.  One of the most beneficial vehicles for co-operation, open and free dialogue and the resolution of problems is employee shareholding on the board of any company, and I so propose.</P>

      <P>I note with an interest what Senator Doyle proposes.  She wants to oblige the Minister to make provision for employee shareholding before any order converting the Trustee Savings Banks to company status is made. However, I do not think it is appropriate at this stage to make such provision.  It can be considered if and when the Trustee Savings Banks are being converted to companies and an order is being drafted. If this was to be done and if this conversion and change of status were to take place, then it would have to be taken back to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It would be appropriate at that stage that the proposed amendment which Senator Doyle has recommended here would be considered.  It is unnecessary now to include it here and I trust the Senator will be able to accept the bone fides of what I say.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Second Schedule be the Second Schedule to the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the considerable debate we had on the whole procedure for appointing trustees, the fact that we are virtually giving them life tenure, the fact that we have not detailed how they may be removed if incompetent and not contributing to the board and the fact that we are bringing in an upper age limit of 70 notwithstanding the competence of the individual in question, will the Minister please expand as to what paragraph 2 on the Second Schedule, namely, the manner of appointment and removal of trustees of the bank, means?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>In support of what Senator Doyle has said, perhaps we overlooked the Second Schedule when we discussed the Bill this afternoon and this morning. Clearly there is a great deal in the Schedule which is very important.  Senator Norris asked whether there was a payment to trustees.  Subparagraph (8) provides that a trustee should not derive any benefit from the bank other than any honoraria pursuant to section 20.  The question of worker directors could well be taken on board in the Second Schedule and could well meet Senator Upton's aspiration in his earlier amendment.  I think the effect of this will be that the Trustee Savings Banks will consult with the Central Bank and they will agree on rules concerning what is best with regard to appointment and removal of trustees. It should not present problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Second Schedule contains the minimum which will be acceptable to the Central Bank by way of rules which shall be put forward by <Col N="1546" /> the Trustee Savings Banks to the Central Bank as a result of the passing of this Bill.  It is incumbent on the trustees to put forward the set of rules to the Central Bank for their adjudication.  There may be several other matters included in the rules to the Second Schedule provided they do not conflict with the Act.</P>
      <P>That covers some of the points that have been so well made by many Senators here pertaining to directorships, deposits, type of deposit books and so on.  All these matters can be included in the Second Schedule but what is proposed in the Schedule is the minimum that is acceptable so that there shall be total adherence by the Trustee Savings Banks to the Bill that the House has just debated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Independent group let me say I am absolutely horrified at the idea of taking Report Stage this evening.  Committee Stage of this Bill, to which I openly admit I was a very late contributor, has been extremely contentious and, to say the very least, <Col N="1547" /> totally unsatisfactory in terms of explanations given to us this evening.  Issues have been raised mostly by Senator Doyle, and I congratulate her, which cause great difficulties to those explaining the Bill partly because these issues were never debated in the Dáil.  It seems absurd and in contempt of this House that we should rush this Bill through, it having been guillotined in the Dáil.  These issues which have been raised on Committee Stage and which the Minister in one case has promised he would consider on Report Stage seem to me so important that they should be delayed until next Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The Minister's promise to consider things on Report Stage rings very hollow if there is some rush to get Report Stage in tonight.  I think we could meet the Minister on his need to get this Bill through in a rush by Christmas or to consider it again by Christmas, although I do not understand the reason for the rush.  I ask him very sincerely to consider deferring this until next Tuesday or Wednesday, or tomorrow or some other time. It is absurd that tonight, having had this debate where totally unsatisfactory replies have been given, we rush it through in contempt of this House.  I ask the Minister to put it back to a time when we can discuss these issues in depth again and when he is prepared to consider them seriously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the urgency? We are willing to come back for Report Stage next Tuesday or Wednesday.  The House is sitting anyway.  Some major points have been raised which the civil servants and the Minister will need to ponder.  There is no need for this steam-rolling this evening.  We will have potentially explosive, bad legislation rushed onto the Statute Book late on a Thursday evening.  We have raised serious points which need to be considered further.  The civil servants and experts need to be asked to take a further look at the Bill in <Col N="1548" /> the light of the points made.  They and the Minister may well be right but I think there are areas where almost certainly they are wrong.  We are asking that they come back next Tuesday or Wednesday with a considered view of what has been said this evening.  It would be a contempt of this House and of the Oireachtas if this Bill, large parts of which were guillotined through the Dáil, were never considered in detail.  A financial measure should be gone through line by line where there is any question of doubt.  Unless legislation is crystal clear, it should not leave these Houses.</P>
      <P>We are not seeking a victory for the Opposition over Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats or a victory over the Minister.  We are asking that Report Stage be deferred until next Tuesday or Wednesday in the interests of the job we are asked to do in this House and in the interests of good legislation.  There will be no obstruction but rather a constructive contribution to the debate.  All of us can consider the issues in the interim.  We make this plea to the Minister to respond to the spirit which has prevailed on this side of the House and on the part of Senator Fallon and others in this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add my voice very strongly to what has been said. There is an issue of principle here which extends beyond the specific provisions of this Bill.  If this Bill is steamrolled through, having been guillotined on important sections in the Dáil where there was no discussion of precisely the matters we have teased out &mdash; some of the matter we have been able to examine in detail has begun to be taken on board by the Minister &mdash; it will show a contempt for the role of this House as part of the Oireachtas.  It also shows a contempt for parliamentary democracy.  It will indicate that the Government feel that by virtue of having a majority they can force their measures through without any degree of participation, particularly by the Upper House.  That essentially renders this <Col N="1549" /> House redundant.  The Government can guillotine their legislative programme and force it through but it would be very dangerous.  It is dangerous because we have clearly highlighted cruxes in the Bill on which the Minister, despite his valiant efforts and the efforts of his advisers, has been quite unable to satisfy a large section of the House.</P>
      <P>It must be emphasised again that this is not just a view taken for the sake of opposition by an Opposition; it is an informed view.  That view is informed by very senior elements within the accountancy profession.  We have dealt with quite complex matters and I believe strongly that it is important that the Minister and his advisers have the opportunity to reflect and have further consultation, examing the Bill in the light of the discussion here to see if there is a way to incorprate some of the most serious and cogently argued amendments.  If this process is not allowed to take place it will be a flagrant contempt of this House, a contempt of democracy and a contempt which will prove expensive at some stage in the future, be it five or ten years.  I am convinced there will be a court case and the people of Ireland will pay the bill.  I do not believe that simply to get the early passage of a Bill it is worth paying the price of having defective legislation which will cost the people dear at the end of the day.</P>
      <P>None of us particularly wanted to be here this evening as late as this.  There is no political masochism on this side of the House.  We all have other engagements and none of us anticipated being here. There is no intention to be tendentious or difficult but it is a very serious point. I hope that the Minister, perhaps after some consultation with his colleagues in the Government, will be able to give an undertaking that the Bill will not be put through all Stages this evening.  I am afraid that if such an attempt is made there will be a serious row.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have known the Minister <Col N="1550" /> and have worked with him on different Bills.  I was in his shoes as I took different Bills through the other House.  I was also in this House and I understand fully the Minister's position.  Knowing him personally, I would ask him to consider that he gave me his word this morning &mdash; and I respect him as a man of his word &mdash; that he would consider issues on Report Stage.  If that is to mean anything it must mean that we cannot rush from Committee Stage straight into Report Stage, particularly on the three or four sections which have proved very difficult.  I know we have had a long session and everyone is getting somewhat tired, but there are these sections which deeply concern us and the financial bodies.  The Minister has had a job to do and was given stripes coming in here tonight.  He has battled well but he has not managed to convince us on the three or four sections about which we are concerned.</P>
      <P>I would also thank the Leader of the House for his commitment last week that he would not guillotine this debate.  To be fair to him, he has allowed us to debate it at length and very thoroughly.  It is in the interests of this House that it is so and we have all done the House a particular service by going through this Bill line by line when the Dáil chose not to do so.  It would be a pity to spoil the lot for a hap'orth of tar, as it were.  Given the nature of Report Stage, two and a half hours next week would complete it.  To allow the Minister to stand by his word to me and other Senators that he would consider issues on Report Stage, I urge that we leave it until next week.</P>

      <P>We have completed Second Stage and Committee Stage and I agree with Senator Doyle regarding amendments.  My understanding is that the only section which the Minister agreed to examine on Report Stage was section 23 (6).  While there was much debate on other sections, that is the only section which the Minister agreed to examine on Report Stage.  If that is the <Col N="1551" /> case, it will not take much time.  I am sure he has considered his position by now.</P>

I will be quite happy to take the Minister's own amendments &mdash; I am not particularly interested in my amendments or the literal amendments of other Senators &mdash; provided the principle of the issues is considered.  I think the Minister knows what we are referring to.</P>

      <P>Before we came to Report Stage I gave an indication that I would consider one amendment in particular and, perhaps, a second amendment on Report Stage.

      <P>I am confident of the expertise that is both in the Dáil and in the Seanad to come up with what we believe is the best type of legislation.  We are armed with the full support of the various Departments and the expertise contained therein and the Office of the Attorney General.  I am satisfied that most of the legislation we pass will, when it is interpreted by the Supreme Court, stand the test of time.  However, in deference and particularly in view of the fact that I have been described as disingenuous and told that I lack the Christmas spirit, I have considered in totality those sections on which I gave commitments that I would reconsider.</P>
      <P>Following consultations I am satisfied that section 23 (6) is in order.  Consultations have been held between the Central Bank, the Trustee Savings Banks and the Minister for Finance and they are at one that this section is in order and is relevant.  I have considered the area which gave rise to most debate, and particularly most heated debate, section 36 (10) (a) and (b).  In deference to the wishes of this House, the very important points raised and the veracity and force with which those points have been made, I am prepared to accept an amendment.</P>

An enormously important principle has been established here tonight.  It is not a <Col N="1555" /> principle in relation to the Opposition, it is a principle in relation to the operation of Seanad Éireann.  We have to establish the fact that if we are to have any relevance as a House of Parliament, we may go through any Bill that comes to us from the Dáil, line by line, and reject or amend an issue where that is so warranted.  I thank the Minister and I only wish we could have extended that to a few of the other points where we had difficulty today.  I accept the generosity of the Minister, notwithstanding the obvious difficulty he was under here today, for accepting this most important amendment. It goes way beyond the actual amendment itself which is intrinsically very important.  We have established an exceedingly important principle even if it causes logistical difficulties in that this legislation will have to go back to the Dáil and this amendment will have to be stamped in the Dáil and agreed.</P>

      <P>Notwithstanding the day and the fact that the Dáil is going into recess for Christmas tomorrow, and notwithstanding the late hour and the length of time we had to debate this issue, the fact that the Minister has been able to take on board this amendment speaks volumes for the relevance of this House on a most important piece of legislation such as this.  It is worth reiterating that this Bill was guillotined in the Dáil during Committee Stage when only a few of the amendments had been taken.  That fact has given rise to the necessity in this House to spend extra time on it and the added difficulty there was in teasing out different points as the different sections came up.  This added to the importance of the contribution of the Seanad and to the fact that we have managed to amend the Bill.  We have a most important role and if we do not stand up for the role and the rights of the Seanad, nobody else will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we are on Report Stage I presume <Col N="1556" /> we are taking the different sections.  The Minister conceded this principle this morning of section 10 and amendment No. 7.  This amendment seeks to insert a time limit of 12 months on the bank in relation to the application for a licence. The Minister will recall that he conceded that principle this morning but he would not accept the amendment because of the logistical difficulty of bringing the Bill back to the Dáil.  As the Bill is now going back to the Dáil I ask him to propose an amendment to incorporate that principle in the Bill.  My amendment was defeated this morning so I cannot move one now, even though the Minister conceded the principle.  I urge him to draw up a ministerial amendment to incorporate the principle I was trying to establish and which he conceded.</P>

      <P>I would like to welcome the generosity of spirit from the Government side, even if a little belatedly, in accepting this amendment.  I think it is very important.  It underlines the functions of the Seanad and makes clear that despite the difficulties the Government may experience in managing legislation they are, under pressure, prepared to acknowledge the important role played by this House.</P>
      <P>I would like to congratulate Senator Doyle on the very effective way in which she placed her arguments before the House.  It was a very useful example of collaboration between the different elements, both on the Opposition and Government benches.  I would like simply to state our own little claim, as Independents, because I do not really believe that these amendments would have been carried through without the participation, both in argument &mdash; and we played a substantial role in that argument &mdash; and by being physically present to stand up and to make the required number in order to have votes carried through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Cathaoirligh, I remember very clearly the first day you were elected to <Col N="1557" /> this very responsible and important position in the Seanad.  You said you wished to do everything you could to improve the performance and the status of Seanad Éireann.  I am sure you will agree that tonight has been very significant in enabling the Seanad to play precisely that role of refining legislation for which it was intended.</P>

      <P>I too warmly thank the Minister for accepting the amendment on section 36 (10) (a) and (b).  It was debated at length.  At times it was a tough debate. Some of us lost our tempers but it was that kind of debate, and at the end of the day we have got a good result.  Certainly on that section there was an element of ambiguity and I think the Minister has wisely corrected it.</P>
      <P>In relation to section 23 (6) I honestly do not think Senator Doyle and the other Senators who were seeking a change in the section should have any worries.  It seemed to me that we were really sinking to new depths on this debate.  For example, it was suggested that if a Trustee Savings Bank wanted to put a nail in a wall they would have to get the permission of the Central Bank but, of course, that could never be the position. What the Central Bank will decide &mdash; and the Minister has hinted this &mdash; as part of their supervisory role is that the Trustee Savings Banks do not build branch offices in every town and village.  I consider that particular section on the expenditure of a capital nature will work out fine.  As I said before, the bank has grown and matured and made a fine contribution to the financial life of this country with the same restrictions placed on it by the Department of Finance and I do not think it will be any different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister who has a fantastic understanding of the Bill.  He dealt with Committee Stage line by line and it is a pity that in <Col N="1558" /> the Dáil it was guillotined after 17 sections but the debate here today has more than made up for what happened in the Dáil.  I congratulate Senator Doyle as she fully understood the Bill, was well prepared and made her points excellently.  I am pleased with the outcome of the Bill. It is a far better Bill now.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank the Minister for the manner in which he addressed the issues in the Bill.  This is very important legislation and the Minister has shown himself to be totally <i>au fait</i> with the principles and practicalities of the Bill.  We have been criticised on occasions for not legislating but, irrespective of who takes the credit, this Bill was debated properly and agreed.  The Government accepted amending legislation in this House and it now goes back to the Dáil.  Committee Stage of this Bill in the Dáil took up only two pages in the Official Report.</P>
