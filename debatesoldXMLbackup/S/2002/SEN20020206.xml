      <P>I have received notice from Senator Jackman that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to sanction the establishment of a Garda station in Castletroy, County Limerick, as a matter of extreme urgency.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Taylor-Quinn of the following matter:</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Public Enterprise if she will publish the recent report by London-based Professor Rigas Doganis to her Department and a Cabinet sub-committee and if she will confirm if the position of Shannon Airport was considered in the context of this report and the findings therein.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is No. 1, motion re the Order of Business, to be taken without debate; No. 2, motion regarding the referral of article 3 of the Fourth Protocol to the Treaty of Amsterdam to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, to be taken without debate; No. 3, Competition Bill, 2001 &ndash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage, with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 20 minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed 15 minutes and on which Senators may share time; and No. 21, motion 20, to be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreed. I would like to have had some discussion on No. 2, but it has been the practice to refer these matters without debate to the relevant Oireachtas committee. Two of the largest companies quoted on the Irish Stock Exchange, Allied Irish Bank and Elan, have suffered very serious setbacks in recent days. This is a very serious issue for corporate Ireland and also for the many investors in these companies. A significant amount of Irish pension funds is invested in these companies or <Col N="3" /> their subsidiaries. What has happened does nothing to instil confidence in this major area of Irish business and it should be discussed in this House.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader to make time available next week to debate this with the appropriate Minister or Ministers because the responsibility may range over a number of Departments. Regardless of which Minister deals with it, it is important for this House to discuss the issue and give assurances in relation to small investments and pension funds to people who are extremely worried about what has happened. The problems seem to relate to accounting practices, which need to be seriously reviewed.</P>
      <P>Ratification of the Rome statute to establish the international criminal court is very relevant in the context of the trial of people who are charged with very serious offences arising from what happened in Afghanistan. That was signed in 1998 and a referendum, held last June, was needed before Parliament could ratify it. Some 50 member states that signed the convention in Rome in 1998 have ratified it, but ratification by 60 states is needed to bring it into effect. An international criminal court would be a much more appropriate place to hear the cases of the people brought to Guantánamo Bay than a court set up by the United States. Such a court would have the competence to deal with the crimes allegedly perpetrated by these people. The dissolution of the Dáil must take place within three months and the Government should ensure this very important legislation, which was made simple by the result of the referendum, is passed before the recess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be inappropriate for us to meet and not refer to the fact that a Member of the Oireachtas is behind bars. I do not wish to discuss that individual case, but I want to refer to something I have mentioned many times before. It is important that we look after our own business, and we have obviously failed to do this. As soon as possible in this session we should discuss how the Oireachtas imposes standards in terms of the conduct of its Members. We are doing certain things internally in our own way at present. In general that is important, but we may have missed the boat and it may now be more appropriate for some external body to run the rule over the activities of Members of the Oireachtas. We have reached the stage where it is anathema to us to countenance the behaviour of Members who undermine the process of democracy. I will not say any more at this stage other than that we should go on record and discuss this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make it clear that I do not consider that to be in any way party political. People are as concerned about this matter on the other side of the House as they are on this side of it. It is not a party matter; it is something about which we all must have a concern. I appeal to the Leader of <Col N="4" /> the House to examine this area in terms of how we manage our business, examine the conduct of our Members and deal with it.</P>
    <P>I also ask for a debate on an issue closely related to the one raised by Senator Connor, the recent developments in Enron in the USA and Elan in this country. A large number of the pensions of ordinary people have been hit hard while those at the top of those companies have saved themselves, bought out of the company and used their knowledge and information to protect their assets and wealth. Large publicly quoted companies tend to a significant extent to invest their pension funds in their companies and pensioners are the ones who will lose out as a result of such developments.</P>
    <P>As a member of a group that deals with auditing standards in Ireland, I declare an interest in this area. We need to ensure that the investments of ordinary workers in ordinary companies, which we all know, are protected. It is not good enough to see the top echelon of people escaping because of their superior knowledge, realising their assets and leaving the people at the bottom of the line to pick up the pieces. I call for a debate on those two issues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Traditionally, the Labour Party has been opposed to the imposition of a limitation of 30 minutes on the Order of Business. I wish to oppose that again in this session on the grounds that the Order of Business gives Members an opportunity to raise issues of national importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I point out to the Senator that this procedure is in place as a result of a decision by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges of which the Senator is a member. I also suggest his right to contribute on the Order of Business has not been curtailed at any time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that. The Chair has never curtailed or diminished&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>That is regrettable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;my right to contribute on the Order of Business. I speak on behalf of other Members who might say they have rights that might be curtailed by the imposition of a limitation of 30 minutes on the Order of Business, which provides an opportunity for Members to raise issues of importance that they would like debated or legislated upon. I will leave it at that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to No. 2, I have reservations about matters of this nature coming before us, being passed to a committee and that being the end of it. Many of these issues are important. They emanate from Europe or from one or other treaty. This issue concerning minimum standards in respect of third country nationals is very much in the news and we should have a debate on it now. If the Leader of the House will not grant us a debate on it today, there should be an <Col N="5" /> opportunity to debate it when this matter comes back to the Seanad on 12 February, as it gives rise to serious problems in relation to racism in terms of the issue itself, and in relation to the White Paper on governance that is being currently discussed, which is extremely important in terms of the distance we are from decision making in Europe.</P>
    <P>I ask the Leader of the House to invite the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to come to this House to discuss the recent flooding in this city, in East Wall, the North Strand and Ringsend, and throughout the country. There does not seem to be an emergency plan under which all the relevant agencies co-operate in dealing with such matters or where one supremo deals with them. There seems to be a major problem in having a humanitarian or emergency fund without councillors and other people going a-begging to the Taoiseach and he, at his discretion, deciding to acknowledge the case for relief and granting it or not. That is very unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise the number of businesses experiencing serious accounting problems or fraud, whether AIB, Enron or Elan. Very few of us would shed tears about losses experienced by many of the banks because AIB and the Bank of Ireland have closed almost 100 branches here in the past two or three years. They have taken services away from the people and, as we saw from the proceedings of the Committee of Public Accounts, they have not been dealing with their customers in a proper fashion in many cases as well. We should have a debate on fraud and the accounting systems that operate in businesses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought Senator Costello would have some sympathy for trade union members who are members of pension funds and who might be affected by the diminution in the value of the shares within those funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe we will compensate them like the Eircom shareholders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not our suggestion to compensate them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>A very good one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>It was the suggestion of another party. Perhaps it might consider it in the context of Elan and AIB.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>We did not rob them beforehand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be appropriate for the House to consider the regulatory and statutory framework within which accountancy and auditing practices operate. It is evident from the Enron case in America that it is not appropriate that a large accountancy company should be responsible for auditing books on the one hand and gaining substantial fees from consultancies on the other. There appears to be an inherent <Col N="6" /> fundamental conflict of interest. I am not suggesting it is the case in Elan but perhaps there is a parallel problem.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable, in view of their dominance in the Irish Stock Exchange, that both companies should suffer losses in their value on the exchange. However, there should be a sense of proportion about this. The figures I saw at lunchtime indicate that AIB is down in value by about 7% but its value is still much higher than its low point in 2001. Nevertheless, I accept it is a serious incident.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole referred to a code of conduct. That is being considered by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and the Leader has also asked us to pass on our observations with regard to the Standing Orders of the House. That work will progress over the coming months. One of the difficulties is the sort of sanctions that can be imposed. Members, like every other citizen, are protected by the Constitution so the sanctions that are available are limited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader invite the Minister for Health and Children to the House to explain why he is resisting the advice of the Women's Health Council in relation to the proposals in the forthcoming abortion referendum? The Leader should also ask the Taoiseach to come to the House to explain, now that the alleged consensus on this issue is shown to be the sham it always was, why he is proceeding with this when the National Women's Council, the Adelaide Hospital and every women's group in the country opposes it. There is no consensus and it is foolish of the Taoiseach to proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister with responsibility for dealing with illegal child pornography on the Internet to come to the House? I understand an advisory board to deal with this issue was established but the world at large knows little about the board. The board has launched a code of ethics and practice dealing with illegal child pornography and this is a golden opportunity for the House to highlight it. There is an onus on everybody &ndash; parents, the Government and the Garda &ndash; to combat this problem. Perhaps the Leader will find time in the near future to arrange for the Minister to come to the Seanad to hear statements on this issue so the public will know that the board exists. It should be publicised more. Parents are concerned about the complaints that have been made in recent times about illegal pornography on the Internet.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I join my colleagues in calling for a debate, as soon as possible, on the situation in Allied Irish Bank. There seems to be extraordinarily bad judgment at the top levels of this bank. Some years ago the taxpayer had to rescue it after a disastrous investment in ICI. Now the branch in Baltimore appears to have lost four times the bank's annual gross profit. I <Col N="7" /> listened to Mr. Buckley on the wireless this morning and I thought he did a good job. He is obviously learning, but he is a slow learner. He is now talking about the customers.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot pre-empt the debate which has been sought on this matter. The matter is too wide to debate in detail on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree. However I add one point&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is not the appropriate time for this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>This point is important for the purposes of correction. One or two of my colleagues have given the impression that there was a direct parallel between Elan and Enron, but that is not the case. I did not say Senator Dardis did so but two of my colleagues did, as the record will show. I want the record to be straight. There is no suggestion that anyone at the top of Elan has been demonstrated to have made a profit from the disadvantage of the customers. In fairness to those people whose reputations have been traduced, it ought to be put on the record that this is the case.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Connor on the issue of the international court. Even the State of Israel has acceded to it, so why have we not done so? It is obviously the way to go.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Keogh in calling for the Taoiseach's presence in the House. I enjoyed the comment last Thursday on the one o'clock news of the political correspondent of RTÉ who said that the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, had decided to have &ldquo;an abortion on the referendum issue&rdquo;. It appears that this is exactly what is in line for him.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader make provision to take No. 19 regarding West Papua? This is a directly analogous situation to that which obtained in East Timor where Ireland played a disproportionately significant role in the formulation of European foreign policy, largely due to the work of Tom Hyland and, through the Oireachtas, the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs. We can do the same with West Papua but it requires a debate. Will the Leader indicate that he will take such a debate and, if so, give an approximate timescale for it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCreganFF" hpid="Mr. J. Cregan Mr. J. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>Reference has been made to the recent severe flooding in parts of this city during which many houses were damaged by flood waters. I welcome the Taoiseach's announcement of a relief fund to compensate victims. There was severe flooding in other parts of the country, including my county, where houses and lands were damaged. Will the Leader confirm whether these people will also have access to this fund? </P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of the recent announcement of a new low-cost pier at Dublin airport, I ask that the Minister for Public Enterprise come to the House to explain what is being done for Shannon Airport. At present we cannot have flights in or out&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not quite the same matter. I raise the issue in the context of where the Minister stands in relation to Shannon.</P>
      <P>I ask that the Minister for Health and Children come to the House to explain the findings of a survey published today concerning the lack of cancer treatment for women and men west of the Shannon. The issues are linked because we are forgotten about. Women from the area must travel to Cork for radiotherapy and women in the west possibly must travel to Dublin. Despite the repeated airing of radio advertisements featuring Marian Finucane, the mid-west does not feature in breast check provision.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Keogh's comment regarding women's mental health and I will raise that with the Minister. In a statement today, Professor Cecily Kelleher said that she and her council have raised a major issue regarding women's health and suicide in the context of the forthcoming referendum. It is important that the Minister answer those questions in the next few days.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>At the risk of sounding like a broken record, I again ask the Leader to arrange to have the Minister for Education and Science come to the House to enable us discuss the poor provision for the teaching and learning of science in our first and second level schools and the inevitable adverse impact this will have on the job prospects of young people in the next generation and on the technology industry. I ask that this session not be allowed to pass without such an important debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call for a debate on the recent developments in corporate Ireland, but it would not be wise to make it too specific and to relate it only to the role of auditors, about which no one in this House is qualified to talk. We should have a general debate on what has happened. Almost everybody in the country, as Senator Dardis has said, is affected by the fall in Elan and AIB share prices. This is not an elitist debate as everybody's pension fund is invested in those companies to an extraordinary extent, if they are invested at all. There is a certain amount of soothsaying going on, with people being told not to worry and that only a tiny percentage is involved. I cannot think of anything worse that could have happened to people's pension funds than a collapse in the price of Elan and a disaster <Col N="9" /> for AIB. If we are not alarmed now then we and corporate Ireland are asleep. It is time for a serious and responsible debate.</P>
      <P>Another area that the House looked at a little while ago in a motion put down by Senator O'Toole and me is the role of non-executive directors. I do not wish to attribute any blame here, but there are many people who have a responsibility in the case of both catastrophes. They draw very large salaries for doing what appears to be very little, given that they noticed nothing happening. They should be questioned and I am not out of order when I say that we can ask people from the various relevant bodies to come to this House to answer questions on these issues.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. D. Cregan Mr. D. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>Has any Government Department assessed the inflationary impact of the euro? There is no mention of the cent wherever you go, it is always of the &euro;1 and &euro;2. Coins are thrown around as if they are of no value and there is obviously an inflation rate far greater than was anticipated. Is anybody prepared to assess what exactly is going on? It is quite obvious that there have been price increases of 20% to 25% in some areas. Nobody is saying anything about it and the problem is much more serious than we realise. AIB and other organisations can suffer, but it is much more serious if the ordinary person finds that their money is worth nothing. Somebody should come to the House to explain.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I also want to raise the issue raised by Senator Connor and I agree entirely with Senator Ross. My initial reaction on hearing the news this morning was to worry about pension funds. I would like a debate on that issue to be broadened to include banking in general.</P>
      <P>What annoyed me most this morning were comments by Mr. Buckley. I do not say that he was trying to justify what has happened, but he was claiming that circumstances were not as bad as they appeared to be due to the fact that the group has still made profits of &euro;400 million in the year ending in December 2001, despite having lost a potential &euro;600 million in this fraud. Those sums added together would mean a &euro;1 billion profit by the bank last year.</P>
      <P>I refer to issues raised here before and in an article penned by Senator Ross in last week's <i>Sunday Independent</i>&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise an issue, which has been raised already, in relation to Elan and Enron and accounting practices, policies and auditing standards. As somebody who has taken part in auditing for the past 30 years, I want to tell Senator O'Toole that there is enough regulation in place for small firms of auditors. In fact, they are probably over-regulated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I will finish on this point about larger firms and companies. There does not appear to be the same regulation as for smaller auditors, as Senator Ross stated, mainly due to the fact that it is so complex and the issues involved are impossible to quantify at auditing dates. Therefore, I want the Leader to organise a debate on that in the future with the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>

      <P>During Committee Stage of the Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy) Bill, 2001, I said that a very effective brand of the morning after pill, Levonelle, had been licensed by the Irish Medicines Board. Senator Keogh said it was not and she was right. I want to apologise for inadvertently misleading the House on that matter. I support her call for the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, to come to the House and explain why he did not consult the Women's Health Council, which is a statutory body set up to look after the health of women regarding this issue. I hope it can be done urgently in view of the fact that the referendum is so near.</P>
      <P>I also ask the Leader for a debate on the health strategy which the Minister for Health and Children brought forward before the Christmas recess and also the primary health care strategy. There are many aspirational strategies in book form but very little in the way of debate on them and it is important that both these issues come before the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnieCaffrey" hpid="Mr. Caffrey Mr. Caffrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I call for a debate on the problems that are arising now from the operation of the Equal Status Act, 2000, for publicans, guesthouse owners and hoteliers who have lost the right to run their establishments as they feel they should be run and who have lost control of their premises. It is reported in today's newspaper that 40 publicans in Castlebar possibly will be prosecuted for closing for a traveller's funeral recently. I am sure they had good reason for closing but that is not the point. The point is that publicans throughout the country are in a precarious position <i>vis-à-vis </i>the law and <Col N="11" /> something will have to be done to regularise the situation.</P>
      <P>Regarding the issues of Enron, Elan and AIB, it is unwise and unfair to link Enron and Elan in the same sentence.</P>

      <P>We had a lengthy debate in this House on 4 March 1998 about passports for sale. The Minister at that time told us that he was setting up a review group and that his response would be determined by Government soon after. Last year I asked if that review group had published its decisions and I was told that it would be determined by Government shortly. Last week I telephoned the Department to establish what had come about from that and was told that it will be published shortly. Will the Leader invite the Minister here to tell us what is happening and what decision has been reached? In the March 1998 debate the Minister told us he <Col N="12" /> had set up a review group in September 1997 but it seems no decision has been reached. I urge the Leader to invite the Minister here forthwith.</P>

The public believes the introduction of the euro has provided a great opportunity for the retail sector to increase prices. This has affected many people. This is worthy of a debate and should be put before the House.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Taoiseach's announcement of support for areas that have suffered flooding. That is also worthy of debate. A lot of damage has been done in the midlands and on the western seaboard. I would like a debate to explore how the support can be applied in a fair way.</P>

We do not even have the merest &ldquo;top-shelf&rdquo; policy in garages or supermarkets. The Minister said he would not accept a position where any child is exposed to pornographic images. All one has to do to see such images is enter one's local Spar store. It is a disgusting way to introduce people to adult images. I want an answer to this because I was promised that something would be done.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Caffrey's remarks on the equality laws. As a society we will soon arrive at a point where one will not be able to smoke in a public house but will be permitted to have a three year old child there at 3 a.m. We have gone mad.</P>

I have asked the Leader on numerous occasions for a debate on the funding that has been made available for the BMW region. We are nearly two years into that programme and I cannot see where the extra funding that was promised has been spent. I ask the Leader for a debate on this as a matter of urgency so that we can establish if the BMW region is getting the funding that was promised. I call on the Leader to make that a priority.</P>

      <P>Senators Connor, O'Toole, Costello, Dardis, Norris, Ross, Bonner and Caffrey expressed their shock and horror at the massive fall in value of Elan and AIB shares. Various views have been expressed also about Enron. Nobody in Ireland realises the serious effect the collapse of Enron has had throughout the US. I was there for the past few weeks and the business community has been shocked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="13" />As a native of County Westmeath, I want to highlight the major contribution Elan is making in my county and the entire BMW region. It is the largest employer in the region and it is most unfair that the company's position has been judged in the same light as the collapse of Enron. Some commentators have been unfair in their assessment, as Senator Ross said. He is one of the foremost experts in stocks and shares and I have always held him in high regard. Many of us have taken his strong advice in contributions he has made in the House through the years. He has an expertise in this field and I support the views he expressed and the confidence he placed in Elan.</P>
    <P>With regard to AIB, many people have heeded its advice and taken out pensions with the bank. However, the bank's share price has experienced a major but temporary fall. AIB has played a major role in Ireland through the years and I hope the problems highlighted by the bank today can be brought to a conclusion at an early date and that everyone's fears will be laid to rest. All of us who have pensions with the bank look forward to the future. It has been and will continue to be a successful stock. I hope to schedule a debate on the AIB situation next week with the agreement of the Whips and the group leaders. Perhaps AIB's position will be clearer then.</P>
    <P>I take the point made by Senator Lanigan and will seek further direction at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges in regard to the views expressed by the former Leader of the House.</P>
    <P>Senators Connor, Norris and Bonner referred to the International Criminal Court and the referendum that was held last year. I will pass on their views to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform following the conclusion of the Order of Business.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole called for a debate on standards in the Oireachtas. I have no difficulty making time available for such a debate. The Oireachtas passed four or five Bills, which introduced the strictest regulations for Members, and all Members must account for their activities in the business world. I will arrange a debate on this issue during this session.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris called for a debate on human rights abuses in West Papua and I propose to schedule an hour long debate, similar to those I arranged on many occasions in regard to East Timor.</P>

      <P>Senator Quill called for a debate on the teaching of science in second level schools, which I will also schedule during this session.</P>
      <P>Senators Dino Cregan and Chambers called for a debate on the changeover to the euro. I congratulate everyone, from businesses, big and small, to banks and everyone associated with the changeover on what has been a wonderful success. I will have time allowed for this debate. For the information of the House, Second Stage of the Finance Bill will be discussed on the Wednesday and Thursday after St. Patrick's Day. If the House believes we should have a debate on the euro changeover in the meantime, time can be provided for it.</P>
      <P>Senator Henry called for a debate on the health strategy. It is with great pleasure I confirm to the House that this will happen in this session. I look forward to the participation of those who called for the debate and of many other Members who I know want to make a contribution.</P>
      <P>Senators Caffrey, Ridge and Burke called for a debate on the Equal Status Act. As Fine Gael has Private Members' time next week I will endeavour to have time allocated for a debate on the stocks and shares issue, perhaps the Fine Gael Whip, Senator Burke, would consider discussing the Equal Status Act during his party's Private Members' time.

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to provide a modern legislative framework for the promotion of competition in Ireland. It will replace our existing enactment relating to competition and mergers and put in place a new framework retaining what is best of the existing arrangements and introducing new features based on the best independent advice available to the Government.</P>
      <P>In September 1996 my predecessor, Deputy Richard Bruton, established a competition and mergers review group under the chairmanship of Michael Collins, SC. Wide-ranging terms of reference were given to the review group, which in effect asked them to examine the whole field of competition policy and law in Ireland, including merger law, competition arrangements in the newspaper and grocery sectors as well relevant EU and international developments. The membership of the review group was drawn mainly from relevant interest groups such as IBEC, ISME, ICTU, the Consumers' Association and the legal profession.</P>
      <P>During the course of its work the review group published four major discussion documents, commissioned a number of studies and other research and engaged in wide-ranging public consultations. Its final report was received by me in March 2000 and published in May of that year. I believe it is no exaggeration to say that the review carried out is one of the most thoroughgoing and extensive ever carried out into competition in this country or possibly anywhere. I would therefore like to place on the record the Government's appreciation of the work done by all the members of the review group and especially by their chairman, Mr. Michael Collins.</P>
      <P>The analysis and recommendations contained in the final report form the main background to the proposals for change which are contained in the Bill. In addition, two other influences have helped to shape the reforms being proposed. These are developments in the competition law of the European Union and the views and experience of the Competition Authority which since 1991 has been the main executive agency for the implementation of Irish competition law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="18" />This is a time of change for the competition law of the European Union. Articles 81 and 82, formerly 85 and 86, of the EU Treaty set out the basic competition rules applying to undertakings. The practical application and enforcement by the Commission of these rules are mainly provided for in Regulation 17 of 1962. In September 2000, the Commission proposed a draft Council regulation to replace Regulation 17. This proposal, which is currently under consideration in the Council working group, involves a complete recasting of the existing arrangements for the implementation of Union competition law.</P>
    <P>Two proposed EU changes are of particular relevance to the Bill. First, it is proposed to abolish the EU notification system and to make the whole of Article 81 directly applicable. Second, the Commission is proposing that the competent authorities in member states, in our case the courts and the Competition Authority, shall be empowered to apply Articles 81 and 82 using national procedures and remedies. While the draft regulation is still under discussion in Brussels, these two changes are very likely to be included in the final version and appropriate account has been taken of them in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Before outlining the Bill, I would like to indicate why I believe it is important for us to keep our competition legislation up to date. It could be suggested that some of the legislation being replaced is of relatively recent origin, particularly the Competition Acts, 1991 and 1996, and that is true. However, the importance of legislation in this area derives from the importance of competition itself. It is proverbially true that &ldquo;competition is the life of trade&rdquo;, but that proverb is especially applicable to an economy as dependent on external markets as ours, an economy which must achieve and maintain the highest standards of competitiveness in its goods and services. Sound competition law arrangements contribute to competitiveness, domestic and international, by penalising anti-competitive and anti-consumer behaviour, protecting the competitive process in all sectors of the economy and facilitating orderly restructuring of enterprises. Without such arrangements, national competitiveness would be continuously at risk from the pervasive effects of cartel behaviour, abuses of market power and excessive market concentration. All factors contributing to our competitiveness, therefore, should be kept under regular review and any action that is identified as being necessary or desirable should be taken whenever required.</P>
    <P>I now propose to outline the principal contents of the Bill drawing attention to the main policy innovations which it contains. The Bill will repeal and replace the three main statutes which deal with merger control and competition generally in the State, that is, the Mergers, Takeovers and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978, the Competition Act, 1991, and the Competition (Amendment) Act, 1996. This will, for the first time, bring under one statute our legislative provisions relating to competition and mergers. That, in itself, is a use<Col N="19" /> ful innovation which will make access to the legislation easier for competition law practitioners and the public alike.</P>
    <P>The structure of the Bill follows generally from the earlier Acts. Parts 2 and 4 substitute for the Competition Acts, 1991 and 1996, but with a clearer treatment of the provisions relating to the Competition Authority. Part 3 &ndash; Mergers and Acquisitions &ndash; stands in place of the 1978 Mergers Act and Part 5 &ndash; Miscellaneous &ndash; includes a provision relating to the maintenance of the Groceries Order 1987. Part 2 of the Bill &ndash; Competition Rules and Enforcement &ndash; makes provision for the rules and procedures which will govern the prohibition of activities which prevent, restrict or distort competition in trade in the State or which constitute an abuse of a dominant position in such trade. It was the Competition Act, 1991, which first introduced into our national competition legislation the concepts of the general prohibition of anti-competitive agreements, decisions and concerted practices and the prohibition of abuse of dominant position. The Act of 1991 relied for enforcement of these rules mainly on private civil actions and on a system of voluntary notification of agreements to the Competition Authority.</P>
    <P>By 1996, it was considered that these methods of enforcement were not achieving the desired results and the Competition (Amendment) Act of that year introduced two important enforcement changes, first, infringements of the competition rules were made criminal offences, in addition to being civil wrongs and, second, the Competition Authority was empowered to initiate or recommend civil or criminal proceedings in appropriate cases.</P>
    <P>In general terms, it can be said that the present system of competition rules and enforcement is working well. The concepts of prohibited anti-competitive agreement and prohibited abuse of dominant position, which were derived from EU competition law in 1991, are now widely understood and accepted in this jurisdiction. That has helped to bring closer alignment between our competition law and EU competition law.</P>
    <P>The availability of private civil remedies for breaches of the competition rules, while it may not have had the widespread impact envisaged in 1991, has nevertheless produced a useful if small body of Irish jurisprudence in competition law. The notification system introduced in 1991 led to the establishment of a substantial body of Competition Authority decisions which has produced much certainty and guidance for business enterprises. With regard to enforcement changes made in 1996, it may be too soon to reach a definitive verdict on them but the initial results are reasonably encouraging. I have no doubt that introducing criminal sanctions for breaches of competition law has greatly increased the deterrent value of the whole competition regime and has probably changed business culture and atti<Col N="20" /> tudes in Ireland in regard to anti-competitive behaviour.</P>
    <P>Part 2 of the Bill will retain the main features of the present system but will abolish the notification system. The number of notifications has declined considerably in recent years, suggesting that the level of understanding of the substantive rules regarding anti-competitive agreements, decisions and concerted practices among the business community and their advisers is now quite high. A second reason for abolishing the notification system is, as I indicated earlier, that there is every likelihood the comparable EU system of notification will be abolished when the EU draft council regulation for the modernisation of EU competition law is adopted. The current system of notification will be replaced by the direct application of the relevant statutory provisions. The Bill retains in section 4(3) a power for the competition authority to issue category declarations which will be broadly similar to the category licences under the 1991 Act. The most important policy change proposed in Part 2 is the rebalancing of the imprisonment penalties in section 8 to reflect the gravity of different types of anti-competitive behaviour.</P>
    <P>The current statutory provisions relating to penalties for offences under competition law are set out in section 3 of the 1996 Act. These provide for penalties of fines up to a maximum of £3 million, or 10% of annual turnover, and imprisonment of up to a maximum of two years. The new maximum fine provided for in section 8 will be &euro;3.8 million, slightly less than the level in 1996. No change is proposed in the penalty relating to turnover. While the CMRG did not recommend any changes in the level of penalties provided for in the 1996 Act, I requested my Department, in consultation with the Competition Authority, to review the effectiveness of existing penalties. The advice to me was that the maximum imprisonment penalty of two years for any infringement of competition rules was an inadequate penalty and an insufficient deterrent for the hard core competition offences of price-fixing, market sharing or bid rigging, while at the same time it could be considered excessive and over the top for the lesser infringements such as agreements to limit technical development.</P>
    <P>The Bill, therefore, introduces a distinction between the two categories of infringement in sections 6 and 8, increasing the imprisonment penalty from two to five years in the case of the more serious category and abolishing it for the less serious category. I think this is a reasonable approach to take. The new five year maximum penalty, which also makes the offence an arrestable one, sends the clearest possible signal that blatantly anti-consumer activities such as price fixing will not be tolerated.</P>
    <P>Part 2 also makes a number of important technical changes in relation to criminal procedure for competition offences. These relate to presumptions &ndash; section 6(2), section 8(7) and section 11; defences &ndash; sections 6 and 7; fines &ndash; section 8; <Col N="21" /> provision of information to juries &ndash; section 10; and evidence &ndash; section 12. These changes, in conjunction with the new approach to penalties, are primarily designed to facilitate the prosecution of serious competition offences while taking due account of the rights of accused persons.</P>
    <P>Two major policy innovations are provided for in Part 3. First, it is proposed to transfer from the Minister to the Competition Authority responsibility for examining and deciding upon mergers generally, based on competition criteria only and, second, it is proposed in the case of mergers in the newspaper-media sector to retain for the Minister and ultimately for the Legislature, a right to intervene where the protection of certain stated public interests require such intervention. I will elaborate on these two important proposals in turn.</P>
    <P>Under existing legislation the Minister is responsible for merger control. While the Minister can refer a merger control proposal to the Competition Authority for investigation and report, it is the Minister who makes the final decision on all mergers notified. The Competition and Mergers Review Group considered at length the question of who should control mergers. While the group was divided on the issue, a majority recommended that merger proposals should, in the first instance, be notified to the Competition Authority, with the final decision resting with the Minister on stated public policy grounds. I was concerned, however, that a &ldquo;two-tiered&rdquo; approach would create a more cumbersome regulatory system than the existing one. At present more than 95% of merger notifications are cleared following an initial assessment and without referral to the authority.</P>
    <P>In considering the review group's recommendation I also questioned whether a reformed mergers regime should rely on non-competition criteria in the assessment procedure. Most competition experts maintain that mergers should be assessed by reference to competition criteria only and while I believe there is a theoretical justification for the use of non-competition criteria, decisions have very rarely been influenced by such considerations. In light of that fact and so as to provide as simple and as speedy a regulatory procedure as possible, I have formed the view that merger notifications should be determined by reference to competition criteria alone. Indeed, even the European Commission assesses mergers on the basis of competition only. There are no public policy or common good evaluation criteria applicable under the EU merger regulation. Furthermore, I believe that the Competition Authority, being the specialist body, is the appropriate forum for undertaking the required competition examination and analysis. Its personnel are well placed to assess mergers expertly, impartially and free from party or lobby affiliations.</P>
    <P>In light of these facts I propose to depoliticise the merger control system and transfer the function to the independent authority so that in the <Col N="22" /> future mergers will be examined and decided upon using competition criteria only. The transfer of responsibility for mergers to the authority can be seen as completing the process begun in 1991 when responsibility for the implementation of competition rules was allocated to the authority and not to the Minister who previously, under the restrictive practices Acts, had exercised the main executive responsibilities for competition matters.</P>
    <P>The second proposed policy change, which is related to the first, concerns the treatment of mergers and acquisitions in the newspaper-media sector. As this proposal concerns matters which have frequently been a source of controversy, I propose to go into it in some detail. The special dangers that arise from excessive concentration of media power and ownership are recognised in the competition law arrangements of many democratic countries. In Ireland, this recognition finds expression in our mergers code, mainly in the Mergers, Takeovers and Monopolies (Newspapers) Order, 1979. Under that order, which was made by the then Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy, Deputy O'Malley, every merger involving a newspaper must be notified to the Minister irrespective of the financial thresholds. The current Bill includes a provision, section 17(4), which will permit the making of an order to succeed the 1979 order. It is my intention that the new order, which must be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas, will apply to the broader class of media businesses along the general lines of the definition of &ldquo;media business&rdquo; in section 22(9).</P>
    <P>In September 1995, my immediate predecessor established the Commission on the Newspaper Industry. This was against the background of various difficulties in the newspaper industry, including the events which led to the cessation of the Irish Press titles. The commission, under the chairmanship of the former Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Thomas Finlay, reported in June 1996 and made 16 recommendations, three of which were relevant to merger control over newspapers. As the CMRG, which was established later that year, was specifically looking into the mergers legislation in the context of a legislative consolidation, it was appropriate for it to consider how best to implement those recommendations.</P>
    <P>The essence of the recommendations of the Commission on the Newspaper Industry, as adapted by the CMRG, were, first, that certain public interest criteria, including the competitiveness of the indigenous newspaper industry, plurality of ownership and titles, maintenance of cultural diversity and cross-media interests should be taken into consideration in the case of newspaper-media mergers and, second, that the scope of merger law should be extended to include the acquisition of control over newspapers-media by means other than the acquisition of shares or assets.</P>
    <P>The reasoning behind the first recommendation was described in Chapter 1 of the report which referred to &ldquo;the special position of the <Col N="23" /> media, including newspapers, as purveyors of information and opinion to the public and as organs of public opinion&rdquo;. The commission also suggested that regulatory regimes applicable to the media &ldquo;should be consistently concerned as a fundamental matter with the diversity of viewpoint and culture and the representation of a wide variety of interests.&rdquo;  The recommendation was made in the assumed context that the Minister would continue to be the merger authority, as under the 1978 Act, or would have a general power to overrule authority decisions on public interest grounds.</P>
    <P>Neither the commission nor the CMRG recommended or envisaged that the proposed special criteria relating to newspapers or media should be the responsibility of the Competition Authority. The purpose of the second recommendation relating to control over newspapers and media was to ensure that the acquisition or control over newspapers by means such as the provision of financial assistance or by any other means would be covered by merger law. The Government has accepted both of these recommendations and they are provided for in the Bill in sections 15 and 22. Section 24 provides that any order made by the Minister in relation to a media merger may be annulled by either House of the Oireachtas. In this way, the final say on media mergers will rest not with the Minister but with the Legislature. The authority will exercise its normal competition scrutiny over media mergers and it is not to be expected that this will be overruled frequently.</P>
    <P>Before leaving Part 3 of the Bill, it should be noted that, following the advice of the CMRG, section 17(1) of the Bill alters the type and level of financial thresholds that are used to determine whether a merger is to be notified. It is proposed to abolish the threshold relating to assets and to have a notification threshold based solely on turnover. It is also proposed to increase the amount of the current turnover threshold from £20 million, or &euro;25 million, to &euro;40 million. This is a little more than the &euro;38 million recommended by the CMRG. The current threshold has not been increased since 1993.</P>
    <P>Part 3 also contains a considerable number of technical changes and it may be appropriate to consider and debate those on Committee Stage. In general terms, the effect of those technical changes is to bring our merger control regime closer to that of the EU merger regulation following the recommendations of the CMRG report.</P>
    <P>Part 4 of the Bill ensures the continuation of the Competition Authority and makes a new provision with regard to its functions. The authority is now ten years old and it is possible to form a view of its performance during that period. The authority has established itself as a competent professional executive agency executing its statutory functions to a high standard. It has gained widespread respect both in Ireland and internationally. It has had its share of difficulties in <Col N="24" /> the past, particularly concerning the turnover of personnel, but these have largely been resolved. This year it will achieve a staff complement of 44, which is almost double that of five years ago. The authority is well positioned to take on the new functions proposed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I have decided to retain the current collective nature of the authority as a body comprising a number of persons but to enhance the role of the chairperson broadly in line with the CMRG report. The collective nature of the authority is emphasised, in particular, by section 28(4), which requires the authority not to delegate certain key functions in the Act. These functions include the power to initiate proceedings for an offence under sections 6 and 7 or to make a determination in merger cases following a full investigation.</P>
    <P>The Bill includes provision in section 28(1) for a new advocacy function for the authority. I place particular importance on this as an instrument for bringing about change in business culture. We need the carrot as well as the stick. Some business attitudes towards the notion of competing, or rather of not competing, are rooted deep in business tradition and culture. Many of the problems have to do with the interface between business and Government itself. An example of this is the era of price control, which may have contributed to a sense of not rocking boats within particular business or trade communities. The authority is already playing a very valuable advocacy and educational role and the Bill recognises and provides for this.</P>
    <P>Part 4 also includes a number of changes which will strengthen the independence of the authority. Section 27(3) makes express provision, for the first time, for the independence of the authority. Increased autonomy in financial and staffing matters is provided for in sections 36, 37, 39 and 41.</P>
    <P>Section 32, pertaining to co-operation between the authority and certain statutory bodies, provides a statutory framework for practical co-operation between the authority and the sectoral regulators listed in Schedule 1. These are the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland, the Commission for Electricity Regulation, the Commission for Aviation Regulation and the Director of Telecommunications Regulation. This provision, which is wholly new and is based on the advice of the CMRG, will underpin and enhance existing levels of co-operation between the relevant bodies.</P>
    <P>Part 5 of the Bill provides for miscellaneous matters such as repeals, expenses and saving and transitional provisions. Section 46 warrants specific comment. It empowers the Minister to amend or revoke the 1987 groceries order. I understand that the inclusion of this provision in the draft scheme of the Bill, which was published last July, caused some concerns about the future of the groceries order. I can, however, assure the House that reports of the imminent demise of the order are exaggerated. I have no proposals to amend or revoke the order. The purpose of section 46 is <Col N="25" /> simply to ensure that the order is not placed in a legal limbo in which it could never be amended or revoked. I doubt if even the most ardent admirers of the groceries order would want that.</P>
    <P>I hope that the outline of the Bill which I have just given, together with the detailed explanatory memorandum which accompanied the Bill on presentation, provides a good guide to the content of the Bill and to the key changes that are proposed. Much of the Bill is technical in nature and unlikely, I think, to prove contentious. I look forward to the detailed examination of those provisions on Committee Stage. As regards policy innovation, it comes down to a small number of key judgment calls: do we want to toughen up on hard core competition offences? Do we want to take merger control out of the political arena? Do we wish to retain a right to intervene on media concentrations that might pose risks to the operation of the democratic system itself? Do we want to build and develop a strong independent agency to enforce our competition law?</P>
    <P>The area of competition policy and law has never been noted for uniformity or unanimity of opinion. That is hardly surprising as the same can be said of the two main intellectual disciplines which underpin it, law and economics. It is appropriate that competition policy is an area where ideas and proposals compete vigorously with each other. Ultimately, however, when all the reviewing, reporting and advising is done, the buck stops here. It is the Government's responsibility to decide what competition legislation to promote and propose to the Houses of the Oireachtas and it is for the Oireachtas to decide what legislation will be enacted. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>From what Senator Cosgrave just read out, one would think I am a person of widespread knowledge, but I will disabuse the Members of that view in a few minutes. Today's Bill is not my area of competence so any errors I make are purely my own. With whatever competence I have, I thank the officials from the Minister's Department for giving me some insight <Col N="26" /> into the Bill, which is, to a great degree, technical in nature &ndash; I will not go into that. There are a lot of issues in the Bill worthy of being restated. We in Fine Gael, as far as I know, completely support the principle behind the Bill. One may find that the attitude in the Dáil has changed but my overall view is that this Bill is well worth recommending.</P>
      <P>The legislation has a consolidation function because it takes into account a number of existing enactments. As the Minister rightly pointed out, the balance between economics and the law is always a very difficult one to achieve. I have no doubt that this legislation will probably be modified again in a few years' time. The legislation brings together a lot of issues that have teased people over recent years. Like the Minister, I recognise the work carried out by the Competition and Mergers Review Group under the chairmanship of Michael Collins. I commend him as well as my colleague, Deputy Richard Bruton, who was Minister at that time. There is no doubt that much of the legislation before us today is derived from the recommendations of that group, which did extraordinary work in the difficult task of finding the balance between the legal and economic aspects.</P>
      <P>There are two proposed EU changes that are particularly relevant to the Bill. The first would abolish the EU notification system and make all of Article 81 directly applicable. In the second, the Commission proposes the competent authorities in the member states, in Ireland's case the courts and the Competition Authority, should be empowered to apply Articles 81 and 82, using national procedures and remedies. If this is true across Europe, why are we making laws that only apply to Ireland and not throughout the EU? This legislation and particularly the penalties, procedures and remedies should be the same across Europe. Does the Tánaiste intend to try to get EU regulations the same across the board? </P>
      <P>There are reports in the newspapers today about the varying cost of motor cars in different parts of Europe. While not relevant to this Bill, it indicates there are different regulations governing differing levels of taxation on motor vehicles in EU countries. If we are really in Europe, we should ensure that regulations and laws are the same.</P>
      <P>Senator Paul Coghlan has written to the Tánaiste on several occasions about the groceries order. He is delighted that she is retaining that and I note she has said she will review it constantly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the third in a series of Bills to come before the House in the past ten years aimed at encouraging competition and enterprise. In the context of this Bill, we have the opportunity to look at the performance of the Competition Authority since 1991 and the benefits it has brought to the economy. Competition is the lifeblood of commerce. Giving consumers choice and value is at the centre of the market economy that has sustained our economic growth in recent <Col N="27" /> years. The existence of a watchdog dedicated to protecting the interests of consumers can be an asset.</P>
    <P>The Competition Bill comes before the House following an extensive review by the competitions and mergers review group, established by my colleague, Deputy Richard Bruton. The important and very valuable work carried out by this body is reflected in the extent and detail of the provisions contained in this Bill.</P>
    <P>If we are to establish a Competition Authority and to provide for competition laws, we must fund and resource that authority to carry out its functions. There is no point in our debating yet another piece of competition law and giving even more responsibility to the Competition Authority if the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment starve that authority of resources and personnel. I must believe that the Tánaiste intends to ensure there will be adequate funding and staff.</P>
    <P>Companies engaged in anti-competitive practices or cartels will always have significant resources at their disposal to prevent their schemes being detected. It is equally important that the State should not skimp on the resources to be made available to the State authority charged with eliminating such illegal practices. Unless the Tánaiste is prepared to commit to resourcing the authority, then there is little to be achieved by introducing yet more legislation in this area.</P>
    <P>It is also important for us to review the performance of the Competition Authority over the past ten years and to draw whatever lessons might be useful for the next ten years. On a value for money basis, has the Competition Authority delivered for Irish consumers and is it deserving of these additional extensive powers? It is hard to think of any single episode where the Competition Authority took an action that benefited the mass of consumers. There are many examples of cases where the authority, at the instigation of large companies, took action to prevent smaller companies or organisations from engaging in alleged anti-competitive practices. There are also several instances where the authority has come down hard on trade associations. It is always easy to squeeze the small guys and usually the actions that gave rise to the Competition Authority intervention resulted from some collective effort on the part of a trade or sector to stand up to a big company.</P>
    <P>However, in most instances, one gets the impression that the Competition Authority has failed to deliver any killer blows to cartels or major anti-competitive practices since its establishment. Has the authority examined why car insurance is so high, why cars are more expensive in Ireland, why credit card charges are higher? Has it dealt with the lack of competition between banks? It is important that we should assess the effectiveness of the authority on an ongoing basis <Col N="28" /> to ensure that it represents value for money and is fulfilling the role envisaged for it.</P>
    <P>While recognising the need for the independence of the authority, it is important that the authority should have some responsibility and accountability to the public who are served by it. Will the Tánaiste provide for some consumer input to the authority to ensure that consumer needs are constantly at the forefront of the authority's work programme? There is considerable merit in such a suggestion.</P>
    <P>I have also heard it commented that some of the business community believe the authority adopts a &ldquo;pointy headed&rdquo; approach to addressing matters that come before it. As I understand it, the membership of the authority is primarily composed of economists, including some academic economists. Some business people have commented that this results in a narrow focus being taken on commercial issues. This is known as the ivory tower syndrome.</P>
    <P>Another issue in this Bill that requires attention is the periods that apply for the consideration by the authority of mergers notified to them under the Act. It is extremely onerous for a company to have to wait for up to four months for a transaction to be cleared or vetoed, particularly an Irish plc. The cost and vulnerability of underwriting such a bid over a four month period must be prohibitive and I strongly urge the Tánaiste to reduce the period to not more than two months. Imagine someone who was buying a house having to remain on a bridging loan for 120 days before getting the surveyor's approval. There is no reason why the authority should take any longer than six weeks to assess if a particular transaction is acceptable from a competition law perspective. If the whole focus of competition law is on increasing efficiencies and reducing costs, then this is one very clear area where some improvement could be made with the authority's own procedures.</P>
    <P>In terms of the retention of some political involvement in approving mergers of media companies, I urge the Tánaiste to ensure this section is drafted as widely as possible to cover modern developments in technology. The conventional media of newspaper, radio and television are now being supplemented by the Internet, DSL and the possibility of the phone system being used to carry significant volumes of data. It is imperative that the powers given to the Tánaiste are wide enough to encompass all types of media merger and not just the conventional ones. For example, in Ireland there is at least one company that has interests in cable, newspaper, Internet and phone services &ndash; all potentially competing platforms.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill, but it could be improved by a number of key recommendations that reflect the need for competition law to be placed in context. Competition law and competition authorities exist to benefit consumers and commerce. They must always have a practical focus and not become embroiled in theoretical considerations. I would <Col N="29" /> welcome greater interaction between the Oireachtas and the authority and suggest that the authority should come before the House on an annual basis to give an account of itself. This would lead to a useful exchange of ideas and result in greater accountability.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that the Tánaiste has retained the groceries order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are different views on it, but in the overall interest of the consumer and the public the Tánaiste has made a wise decision. She intends to review the position on a constant basis, which is a practical approach.</P>
      <P>I wish to deal with a number of points raised by the Tánaiste. I note the changes to the 1996 Act regarding the distinction between the two types of offences, the first type being the more serious, the so-called hard-core offences, which include price fixing, market control and market sharing, and the second type which includes offences that are not as clearly anti-competitive such as ancillary agreements and applying different considerations to similar transactions.</P>
      <P>I welcome the new elements that have been introduced with regard to the serious offences, that there will be a presumption that the effect or the object of the activity is the prevention, distortion or restriction of competition. I am aware this will aid in the prosecution of those involved in such offences. I also welcome the second element in respect of the defence that is currently available to the defendant allowing him or her to plead that he or she could not have known the effect of the activity as being anti-competitive.</P>
      <P>Another major change to the 1996 Act is contained in section 3, which provides that for offences such as market sharing, bid rigging and price fixing, penalties are increased from three years' to five years' imprisonment and also include fines. These fines are personal and corporate, but remain at the same level. Is the Tánaiste satisfied that they should remain at those levels? I agree with the Competition Authority and the Tánaiste's Department on increasing the period of imprisonment for such an offence from three to five years. I concur that such an offence constitutes serious fraud and it should be treated the same as other serious offences such as bank robbery. In relation to the remaining offences, which clearly are not as anti-competitive, it seems logical that the Tánaiste has removed them from the penalty of a jail sentence and left the fines in place, but again I wonder why she did not increase the fines from the 1996 level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the electronic storage of documents on computers, whereby a person could be said to have written a letter or drawn up a contract on somebody's computer, it is difficult to prove that the individual who typed it on computer is the person who mainly uses that computer. The Tánaiste might indicate how it can be claimed that the person who is the main user of <Col N="30" /> a computer can be liable in the case of a document typed on it, when other people can access the computer. Many people have the competency to find passwords and type and issue documents. The CMRG identified this early on as being one of the most difficult measures to implement. I would be grateful if the Tánaiste would give whatever assurances she can that a person would not be charged with a crime that he or she did not commit.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that if a person decided to blow the whistle on another person, the whistleblower would be relieved of any responsibility for an act, criminal or otherwise, that he or she committed. Some criteria must be used whereby it is provided that whistleblowers will not be let off in terms of any crime they have committed. A whistleblower who played a major part in committing a crime might be given a reduction in the penalty imposed but he or she should not be given the freedom to walk away from the crime while whistleblowing on someone else.</P>
    <P>I commend the Tánaiste and her Department on taking on board the CMRG's recommendation removing the public interest criteria on mergers in general. That was a grey area. The public interest criteria on the media mergers remain in place. This is to protect and maintain the cultural diversity of our society and to allow the Tánaiste have the final say in any media merger application, be it concerning newspapers, magazines, television or radio broadcasting or the other areas to which I asked the Tánaiste to respond. I support the criteria that the authority will use in coming to a decision on such a merger, those being the plurality of ownership, plurality of titles and the strength and competitiveness of the indigenous media industry coupled with the issues I mentioned, the maintenance of cultural diversity and the diversity of views of our society in general.</P>
    <P>There are many provisions in the Bill which will be teased out on Committee Stage and I would be interested to hear the Tánaiste's response to the questions I raised. We, on this side of the House, fully support the general thrust of the intention behind the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to welcome the Tánaiste to the House. When dealing with this legislation it is important to examine the reasons we need competition. The Tánaiste said that competition is the lifeblood of trade, which is true. If we did not have competition, none of the businesses that are so successful in our thriving economy would be in operation. We would have monopolies and cartels and the cost of living would be too expensive for many members of the public. We would have profit for profit's sake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our competitiveness is one of the key attractions for the people we encourage to invest here. Given her brief in enterprise and employment, the Tánaiste is very much aware that competition is not only about rules and regulations but about ensuring we put money into the right type of sup<Col N="31" /> ports and structures for trade and industry, such as education, enhancing skills and building the value of our resources.</P>
    <P>In addition to putting in place a strong legislative framework to deal with competition, in order to maintain our competitiveness and attractiveness to outside investors it is important we do not forget that we must have something that other countries want and that is not mobile. It is not good enough to attract a factory to locate here because of a cheap labour supply in the west. We must give investors a reason to stay here by enhancing our research and development, enhancing the skills of the people working in companies and increasing the number of people available to work in these organisations. By doing that, we will build our resources, which are part of the overall framework for maintaining competitiveness. The scope is there for us as Members of the Seanad to maintain that concept as we deal with the Bill. It is in that context that I will raise the issues on which I wish to comment.</P>
    <P>What is the purpose of the Bill? The Tánaiste outlined that. The Bill sets a new framework. It retains the best of the existing arrangements and introduces new features. These new features have come about for various reasons. Our economy has changed over the past ten to 15 years. On our High Streets we notice the competition that has come from the UK. When one walks down a High Street, one sees shops that one used to see only in London and Edinburgh and one wonders what it is about Ireland that attracts those shops to open here. On our High Streets, one sees Boots, Next, Laura Ashley and all the other UK High Street stores. Even in small towns and villages, one sees the golden arches and the big M advertising McDonald's fast-food outlets. From the consumer point of view, that gives us an indication of how things have changed. Given those changes and the threat they pose to Irish businesses, it is vital to ensure we do not lose out to the larger monopoly cartel-type organisations which have greater resources than many of our businesses. It is important to achieve a balance and not to rely on cartels to bring in competition to ensure that our indigenous business people are not fleecing us and depriving us of the benefit we would gain from organisations that would introduce competition in the market.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste and Senator Coogan commented most favourably on the work of the review group. I read various chapters of the report which is quite lengthy. It appears to be one of the most wide-ranging reports on competition and policy in Ireland. It took a long time to complete and I was delighted when the Tánaiste published it in May 2000. We have had time since then to reflect on the issues and the recommendations. We now have legislation which, although I accept there are matters which need to be teased out on Committee Stage, addresses those recommendations and does what the review group suggested. I wel<Col N="32" /> come the hard work done by all members of the group in that regard.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer, with the indulgence of the Chair, to the overall issue of competition. Various initiatives have been put in place to create the type of environment that will keep people and jobs here while maintaining a competitive environment. The skillsnet initiative is one example. It is vital that we keep this initiative moving forward, particularly when we find it is worthwhile and has made a contribution to the overall quality and competitiveness of companies, especially those in peripheral areas. It is important not to let something like that go.</P>
    <P>I welcome early indications from the Department that perhaps this model will continue. I add my voice to those the Tánaiste has probably already heard asking for it to continue. It has been particularly successful for women in business and in areas such as Mayo where the north Mayo skillsnet was introduced and has successfully utilised the resources available to it. This contributes to maintaining and enhancing the competitiveness of businesses which are set up in areas outside the Dublin metropolis and other large centres of employment. It is something we must continue to focus on and keep in mind when dealing with competitiveness.</P>
    <P>Competitiveness has always been a challenge for small and medium sized businesses. Indeed, it is a challenge for every organisation. How does one maintain a balance where costs are not cut so low as to take from the value of the product or service while ensuring that one gives good value for money? The one thing to bear in mind when discussing competition is value for money. If somebody is producing a product or service in a way that gives value for money, that is the result of competition.</P>
    <P>It is important to ensure that everybody is on a level playing pitch. That is what this Bill is about, setting out the rules and regulations of competition. It defines the offences and sets out the penalties. I will speak briefly later about the changes the Tánaiste is making to the penalties. The Bill sets out the ground rules for civil and criminal cases and trials and maintains the right of civil action. These elements are welcome.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Tánaiste on moving responsibility for assessing mergers to the Competition Authority. I was not particularly interested in the Competition Authority when it was set up some years ago but I have seen over the last number of years, since my involvement at national level, how its role has evolved. It has worked well in some instances and it is good to recognise that in this legislation. We are saying, in effect, that the authority has been working well and has the expertise and required knowledge to be given further responsibility. The reason for doing this is that the expertise is there and it will make the examination of competition issues more impartial and free it from lobbying and party affiliations. That is welcome.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="33" />However, I wish to sound a note of warning, although it might not be necessary. One of the great values of having public representatives or committees look at different types of business and listen to people on the ground is that they can get a feel for how certain mergers and rules and regulations will affect them. Political representatives sometimes makes changes that may not appear to be logical, but sometimes what is logical is not always what is best. It would be sad to lose entirely the role of the public representative. Senator Coogan mentioned this also. It is important to have some type of link between the Competition Authority and the Oireachtas or public representatives to ensure that ordinary people, who cannot afford the expensive lobbying groups and are not represented by strong associations, have their voices heard at all levels when decisions are being made that will have an impact on them. If competition criteria alone are used in making decisions, it can sometimes leave out important matters that should be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>Senator Coogan mentioned resources. It is vital to resource an organisation adequately. The Tánaiste said the Competition Authority will have a staff complement of 44, double the level of five years ago. I welcome that and I hope it is enough. One can assume a certain number of staff is enough but it is important, and I have no doubt that the Competition Authority has done this, to ask how many people are required to do a job, how are they doing the job and if technology is being used to its best capability to ensure the job is done correctly, efficiently and effectively. We should not have people in jobs just for the sake of having them there and I have no doubt that is not the case in the authority. We must ensure the resources are in place and the Tánaiste is doing that. It appears the manpower is in place with a staff complement of 44 so, despite the concerns raised by Senator Coogan, the Competition Authority appears to be ready to take on its new tasks and will be able to deliver according to the expectations we have set out for it.</P>
    <P>Senator Coogan was correct to bring up another matter. I am a little disappointed that over the years there have been areas where it seems, and perception is sometimes accepted as the reality, that apparent monopolies have not been addressed. The banking monopoly or cartel in this country is one such example. It was not until the entry of the Bank of Scotland into the mortgage market that there was any real competition in that market. Why was it not due to the Competition Authority that there was a reduction of 2% or 3% in mortgage interest rates? That type of competition is most welcome. Perhaps it was not within the remit of the Competition Authority.</P>
    <P>However, there are other problems. Our telecommunications charges are too high. Look at the mobile phone market and the companies involved in it, Esat, Eircell and Meteor. We thought the introduction of the third mobile <Col N="34" /> phone licence would lead to charges gradually reducing. I have not looked at the figures in the last couple of months but I understand we are still paying the highest charges in Europe even though this country is one of greatest users of this technology in the world. It does not make sense that we are still paying more. Where is the competition?</P>
    <P>Senator Coogan referred to the credit card market. It is up to the credit card user; if they do not pay their bill and use the credit, they must pay the charges. However, there are charges of between 17% and 21% on outstanding balances on credit cards whereas in other countries the percentages are much lower. A question must be asked about competition in this area. There are three main banking institutions in the country and that is reflected in the type of service and virtual disdain with which they treat their customers. Last September and October they suddenly changed policy and said people could no longer cash cheques in their banks and that all cheques had to be lodged. Now one cannot have standing orders from non-current accounts and further charges have been introduced. All the banks do this together so there is no competition between them. Furthermore, they are getting away with it. That is the end of my rant on the banks.</P>
    <P>I welcome the point the Tánaiste made about the increased co-operation of bodies under the authority. It will be good to see better co-operation between the broadcasting commission, the commission for electricity regulation, the commission for aviation regulation and the telecommunications regulator. As the Tánaiste has said, it will underpin and enhance co-operation that is already there between them.</P>
    <P>I spoke about competition in the telecoms area, which is the responsibility of the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation and I would like to know why we do not have fast, low-cost access to technology. We do not have a flat rate Internet access package. Why not? What is happening? The ODTR has the responsibility for introducing it, but because there is no agreement on the price that will be charged by Eircom to the other subscribers, nothing has happened.</P>
    <P>We have peripheral areas such as Donegal, Connemara, north Mayo and north Kerry where there will continue to be no access to broadband technology. These areas are dependent on high speed Internet access for which they are being charged a fortune by their Internet service provider. They are paying more than people in Dublin or other centres with access to broadband because they do not have access to the bandwidth of cable required to download information quickly. In Dublin one can download a package in three seconds but if one is in north Connemara it takes three or five minutes and one pays for the difference in connection time. This is not acceptable. We must address these areas in terms of competition. We are told we will see enhanced levels of co-operation between relevant bodies, <Col N="35" /> which is welcome, but things like flat rate Internet access should become available and accessible to areas on the periphery that need this competitive edge.</P>
    <P>Instead of looking at this issue from a regulatory point of view, let the Competition Authority look at it from a proactive point of view. In other words, let it see what it can do to make our country more competitive, what needs to be put in place to give us the type of environment we need and how it can support businesses that are on the periphery. Ireland has done well because it is on the periphery of Europe and now we have our own periphery within the country that is losing out because of the divide between east and west. Once the line is crossed into the west, one sees that people are losing out.</P>
    <P>This Bill is clear in terms of identifying what we can and cannot do. It is clearly laid out and, as the Tánaiste said, it is technical so I do not intend to go into it in detail. It is interesting and relevant to analyse the types of penalties contained in the Bill and the carrot and stick approach that the Tánaiste spoke about. I welcome the distinction between different levels of penalties. The Tánaiste is correct to make the change so that, depending on the seriousness of the category, there are different imprisonment penalties from two years to a new maximum penalty of five years which makes the offence an arrestable one. That is important because people need to understand that fines are not a sufficient deterrent to an organisation which has plenty of money. For example, the speeding fine of £50 is no longer a deterrent. People get caught speeding, pay the £50 and forget about it. It does not slow people down so the fines are not working. Something that will work are the penalty points applied to speeding. Equally, under this legislation, the fines should be a deterrent but the indictable offence and different categories of imprisonment penalty will be enough to frighten would-be offenders. Many companies believe that their managing director could not possibly be sent to jail but this is clearly laid out in the Bill as punishment for the appropriate offences.</P>
    <P>It is important that, while we have competition and the proper framework to manage it, we should reflect that sometimes too much competition is not good. Competition can drive down standards and we must not allow that to happen. Without going into specifics, we are seeing that happening in Dublin in certain industries where deregulation has taken place and we have seen a corresponding decrease in the level of service given to customers, an increase in overcharging and an increase in crimes &ndash; probably misdemeanours &ndash; being reported. We must bear that in mind when we examine how important competition is.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste asked a number of key questions the answers to which are clear. She asked if we wanted to toughen up on competition offences. The answer is yes and we have addressed this. <Col N="36" /> She asked if we wanted to take merger control out of the political arena. The answer is yes and we have done that with this Bill. She asked if we wanted to retain our right to intervene on media concentrations that might pose a threat to the operation of the democratic system itself. The answer is yes. She asked if we wanted to build and develop a strong independent agency to enforce our competition law, all in the interest of ensuring that Ireland maintains its competitive advantage as an island on the periphery of Europe which we hope will become the centre of trade and competition for Europe and that we would continue to build on the strong economic success we have had and move forward in a progressive and successful way into the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with Senator Norris. I welcome the Tánaiste and this Bill to the House. I will avoid speaking on Committee Stage and concentrate my remarks on Second Stage.</P>
      <P>I have railed many times against the way Bills are normally drafted as amendments to previous legislation. This process, when it happens, becomes cumulative so that the legislation on a particular subject is not just one Act but a succession of measures that stretch back over generations. This makes the law difficult to access and puts further distance between Government and people. That is the reason I like this Bill. Too seldom have we seen the approach adopted in this Bill. It repeals all the existing legislation and starts again with a clean slate. When this Bill reaches the Statute Book &ndash; and I hope it soon will &ndash; it will contain, in one place, all the laws and competition measures. That is as it should be but it happens so rarely that I need to draw attention to it.</P>
      <P>I will focus my remarks on the provisions relating to the Competition Authority and the need to make it more independent than is provided for in this Bill. According to the explanatory memorandum, section 6 (2) has the following purpose: </P>
      <P>It introduces a new presumption which will apply in the prosecution of the more serious offences. This obliges the court to presume, unless the defendant can prove otherwise, that the object or effect of the agreement, decision or concerted practice at issue is to prevent or distort competition.</P>
      <P>I do not want in any way to minimise the gravity of the offences we are dealing with. A crime against competition is one which makes the entire community its victim. It is only right that we take such offences seriously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the increased penalties the Bill attaches to the more serious offences but this legislation sends a shiver down my spine because it strikes at our whole way of approaching justice. It sweeps away, with a casual brush of the draftsperson's pen, the presumption of innocence until proven guilty which underpins our entire legal system. With every other offence in the book the <Col N="37" /> burden of proof is on the prosecutor who must make the case for the defendant's guilt beyond all reasonable doubt. What is so special about the offences we are dealing with here that we have to sweep away that basic principle? It could be argued that it would be difficult to get prosecutions otherwise, but that surely applies in every case. The authorities would favour extending this provision to all offences because it would make their lives so much easier. Picture what would happen if the same law applied to suspected bombers, terrorists and rapists.</P>
    <P>I am trying to make sure that my point is understood. If the same presumption applied in the case of such suspects it would make it much easier to secure convictions, but we have decided to single out this area and make it different. We do not apply this principle generally because our legal tradition has always held that putting the burden of proof on the prosecution is a necessary part of the system of checks and balances regarding the power of the State over its citizens.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the negation of this fundamental principle is proposed with regard to the offences in question because they are esoteric crimes which will not be committed by the general run of people. Does this, more seriously, represent a clash within Europe of two different systems of law? Are we conceding this principle to bring us into line with continental practice where, as we know, the presumption of innocence is a much smaller fundamental principle? If that is so, we should be open about it.</P>
    <P>I also want to dwell on section 22, which sets out special treatment for mergers in media businesses. It allows the Competition Authority to make a ruling on purely competitive grounds after which the matter is pushed upstairs to the Minister who will make his or her decision on the broader grounds of public interest. The public interest is to do with the understandable desirability of keeping control of Irish media primarily in Irish hands and to have a spread of ownership across the media generally. My problem is not with the aspirations of the Bill, which are laudable. It is that its provisions are unenforceable. We are deluding ourselves if we think this legislation will ensure that Irish media stay in mainly Irish hands and that ownership is diverse. That is a non-starter in the age of globalisation. The European Union would presumably stop us applying this law to potential investors from other member states.</P>
    <P>Why attempt to draw a distinction between one medium and another? We can do nothing to control the satellite signals that come to us from the skies above, so why try to control who owns a local newspaper or radio station? That might make sense if one could control everything, but as some media are by their very nature out of control, such as satellites, trying to control the others is like attempting to bail out last week's flood waters with a colander.</P>
    <P>The centrepiece of this Bill is the Competition Authority. Our experience over the past decade <Col N="38" /> has been very instructive and we should learn from it in deciding how to constitute the authority for the future. I read the OECD review of regulatory reform in Ireland, which was published last year, and this comment was made:</P>
    <P>The authority is perhaps too reliant on the Ministry for its resources and staffing will require continuing attention in Ireland's tight labour market. The authority has tried to move into an advocacy role, but making advocacy effective will require more resources and clearer independence.</P>
    <P>In two restrained sentences the OECD sums up the key difficulties we have had in making our competition legislation work effectively.</P>
    <P>The history of the Competition Authority surely teaches us that legislation alone is not enough to make things happen. The earlier Competition Acts gave the authority quite wide powers, but there is a simple reason it did not use them to the full extent envisaged. The Department of Finance systematically starved the organisation of the resources it needed to do its job properly. Again and again it was refused permission to employ the number of staff it needed at the levels of remuneration required to ensure that the right people were available to it. I have heard the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Senator Cox speak of promise, but I would like to hear how that is to be guaranteed in the future, long after the Tánaiste has left office. Whether it was intended, the Department of Finance's stranglehold has had the effect of hobbling the authority and preventing the full realisation of the provisions of competition legislation. It is no wonder that many said the real intention was to maintain an enforcement authority as a showpiece while preventing it from showing its teeth by starving it of resources.</P>
    <P>The OECD report is right to cite greater independence as the way forward, but as I look through the provisions of this Bill I see no sign of any intention to strengthen the authority in that way. If we can change the Bill, that is how we must do it. The independence we are talking about does not refer to the independence of the competing parties in a merger. What is much more important is making the Competition Authority independent of the Government of the day. I have full confidence in the Tánaiste, but I have no guarantee that she will be there in ten, 20 or 30 years' time. I am sure she would not fancy that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Unless it is independent in that way, the authority cannot be fully effective in policing the legislation in the interests of the public. Competition issues are and should be matters of law. That is the kind of regime we are trying to put in place with this legislation as is the EU with <Col N="39" /> its overarching framework of competition law. Competition issues should not be political issues and to ensure that they do not become so we must ring-fence the implementation of the law from the political process. We have allowed competition issues to get caught up in politics here and that is why I have a problem with what Senator Cox said. I have a great fear in that regard.</P>
      <P>I note three examples. The creation of a free market in the taxi industry should have been a legal matter, not a political one. The creation of a free market for pharmaceutical services should have been a legal matter, not a political one. I congratulate the Tánaiste for what is taking place in those areas now. The creation of a free market in the selling of alcohol should be a legal matter, though perhaps not altogether as there have to be political implications in that regard. At least steps have recently been taken in that area, but it is not a coincidence that the three markets I mentioned have concerned the Competition Authority since its inception.</P>
      <P>It is not a coincidence that the authority has been systematically deprived of the resources to stand up to the Government on those particular issues, as well as on others. It is perhaps no coincidence that the authority has lacked the resources to act as an advocate. I ask the Tánaiste to take us through the advocacy role which follows on the removal of restrictive Government legislation that conflicts with the letter and spirit of competition law. On Committee Stage we must amend the Bill to strengthen the independence of the Competition Authority and I look forward to the support of my colleagues in the House in doing that. Let us make no mistake, the effectiveness of this legislation will depend entirely on the degree of that independence.</P>
      <P>I want to avoid debating as if this was Committee Stage, but I would like answers from the Tánaiste to a number of questions. I have not seen other legislation where the Minister may appoint any number of members to the Competition Authority. They are described as part-time members in the Bill, but they have the same number. The Bill provides that there are four members of the authority plus a chairman. However, the Minister of the day may appoint any number of extra persons. That is surely an opportunity for a Minister to overcome the decisions of the authority. As chairman of An Post I had the experience of producing a report every year which my colleagues and I were not allowed to publish. We had to hand it to the Minister who sometimes delayed publication and I see here that the authority does not have the right to publish its report either. It has to give it to the Minister who has to publish within four months, which is an improvement, although I do not understand why that provision has been made at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why not trust the authority with the groceries order? I will not use that order on this occasion, <Col N="40" /> but I must respond to Senator Coogan who said that practically everyone is in favour of it. He forgets that the Competition Authority has strong views on it. I urge the Tánaiste to hand over responsibility for it to the Competition Authority rather than retain it for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
    <P>It is our job to give the authority the teeth it needs to fulfil its functions. I welcome the Bill and its provisions and I urge that we give it a great deal of attention to help the Tánaiste through it on Committee Stage.</P>

There is the Minister, whom I remember well from her days in Trinity for her work politically and I notice a distinguished financial journalist in the Press Gallery whom I have known for many years.

      <P>The Bill which strengthens and consolidates the 1991 and 1996 Acts is very welcome and this is probably not the last we have heard of it. We should watch this space. I am sure that following the election the incoming Government, which I hope is of a similar composition and continues for the same length of time as this one, will introduce further legislation. I hope I will be re-elected and expect that if I am, I will have to deal with further legislation on this matter because I do not think everything has been fully addressed in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Competition is very important. It is not just a question of restriction. Any intelligent commentator will recognise that one of the engines we have which can drive the economy forward is the positive encouragement of competition, particularly in this country when so many economic levers such as exchange rates and interest rates have been removed from us and centralised in Brus<Col N="41" /> sels. I do not see this Bill as a negative restrictive measure, rather as a very positive move in terms of the economy. It is good for business.</P>
    <P>Coincidentally, the United Kingdom is also introducing legislation in this area. I wonder whether the Tánaiste and her Department have scrutinised that legislation because it seems to me there are parallels from which we can learn. I hope the Bill can be strengthened in this way.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn referred to amendments. This is almost a virgin Bill. It is coming before the Seanad first and I very much hope that the Minister will accept amendments, as I, too, intend to table some.</P>
    <P>I briefly examined some of the Bill's main provisions. The fact that all mergers are now to be referred directly to the authority is a good development. At present, they are only referred if there is a ministerial refusal and this has happened only ten times, only once in the past two and a half years. I look forward to the Competition Authority being strengthened in this area.</P>
    <P>Criminal sanctions are being strengthened which is also to be welcomed. I applaud the move from two to five years. I do not believe people will be sent to prison nor do I want them to be. I have never wanted blue collar people to be sent to prison because it is a waste of taxpayers' money. It is even more of a waste when they are white collar workers, but it does trigger certain investigative provisions in the criminal law and gives greater teeth and strength to the Competition Authority which can only be welcomed. That is the significance of the five-year protocol.</P>
    <P>There is a presumption with regard to documents such as e-mails. This is something on which I would welcome further comment from the Minister. The presumption favours the authority. I am all in favour of the authority, but I have been reading Dick Francis recently and am, therefore, full of conspiracy theories.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Senator not to interrupt because I have a limited amount of time. It seems to be slightly dangerous if it is always taken to be the owner of the fax machine or the e-mail system or whatever. There is always the possibility of a conspiracy to implicate a company and, in my opinion, the shifting of the onus of proof is questionable in this area but not, perhaps, in others.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provision for the exchange of information. I vaguely recall that in the past few years there was a meeting in a nice hotel in County Kildare of some major international producers of vitamins and they managed to rig the prices, especially in America. We were not in a position to exchange that information with the US authorities. If we had been, perhaps they would have been prevented from doing this to everybody's advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the assumption in regard to a negative impact on competition although I am not an economist and do not understand it. When I hear <Col N="42" /> economists on &ldquo;Today with Pat Kenny&rdquo; or &ldquo;Marian Finucane&rdquo; , I end up confused. One says one thing and another says something else. I heard Brendan Keenan making this point this morning on the radio when he was asked whether he would buy Elan shares. He said, &ldquo;Well, you just look at the information&rdquo;, and then he said, &ldquo;You make up your own mind, but I am not taking any responsibility.&rdquo;  He is a very responsible and good economist, but in the courts the Minister, under this legislation, will not have to introduce the evidence of professional economists.</P>
    <P>I do have some difficulties with the Bill. There is provision for an appeal to the High Court. Why is there no appeal to the Supreme Court? I will certainly table an amendment on this as such a provision is desirable. There is considerable case precedent in this area to demonstrate this. For example, there is the judgment by Judge Fidelma Macken in the Orange mobile phone case. It is a complex area. Even a very fine judge can make a decision that can be challenged. The judgment in the above case was appealed to the Supreme Court and was reversed. If we pass this Bill as it stands, this cannot happen. We must have the full range of appeal, right up to the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>Then there is the question of advocacy. I referred to the UK Bill. In the United Kingdom, when the Office of Fair Trading gives a public recommendation there is a statutory requirement for the Government to give a measured response within 90 days. There should be such a provision in this jurisdiction also. This is very important as it would mean, for example, that if the Competition Authority were to decide to go into an area such as taxis, pharmacies or pubs, then the Government would have to come back with a response.</P>
    <P>The Competition Authority should be both financially and politically independent. Political independence is extremely important. Senator Quinn referred to the question of the number of members on the authority. There should be a finite number. This Minister would not load the jury but other Ministers might well do so.</P>

      <P>Thank you. This is the most important point I want to make. The exemption for media mergers is completely and utterly wrong and must be addressed. For example, in 1994, the authority found the Independent Group abusing its dominant position. The authority had no power at that stage and when it subsequently got power, it did nothing. Politicians will be queasy about taking on the media. Let there be somebody independent out there to tackle the media.</P>
      <P>In terms of the media, it is obvious there should be additional criteria. This is not just a commercial issue. One must allow in a democracy for a plurality of views. It is not just a question of 80% of people voting with their money to take up a ticket on an airline or a share in this or that. This is the life-blood of democracy in terms of the media, in terms of television and newspapers. This Bill will be defective unless the Minister addresses the issue of media mergers, an issue on which I will also table an amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to the House and I welcome the legislation before us. I particularly welcome the fact that the Bill has been <Col N="44" /> initiated in the Upper House. This is not a first for the Tánaiste. When she was a junior Minister in the Department of the Environment, she introduced the Environmental Protection Agency Bill, a very lengthy and comprehensive piece of legislation which was very important. She is very amenable to listening to the arguments in the House and, where required, she has had a history of amending legislation where deficiencies can be demonstrated.</P>
    <P>I am also pleased that this Bill represents continuity in terms of Ministers. The 1978 mergers Bill was introduced by the then Minister, Deputy O'Malley. Of course the Competition Act, 1991, was introduced during Deputy O'Malley's tenure. The 1996 amending Act was introduced when Deputy Richard Bruton was in the Department. I am glad to see that continuity being maintained by the Minister, and I say that from a party perspective.</P>
    <P>The Government and previous Governments have achieved a lot in the management of the economy and the creation of an environment which has allowed the economy to develop to the point it has with regard to personal and capital taxes and general fiscal policy. The missing element is the matter of competitiveness, and that is now being rectified. If we are to maintain the successes we have achieved it is obvious we must be competitive in the world market. We must have an environment, through our political stability, tax regime and competition law, that makes it attractive for businesses to locate here. They can do so in the knowledge that they will be treated fairly and be able to compete on an equal basis. This Bill is one of the elements which will allow that to happen. The next stage will be the building of the knowledge based economy. That is a very important aspect and one which is related to the content of the Bill. It has been said to me in the past week that in the roll-out of broadband technology we have a duopoly and that there is a lack of genuine competition leading to increasing costs for people who require such technology. That is something that needs to be looked at.</P>
    <P>The legislation is very much pro-business and I also regard it as pro-consumer. I do not think there is incompatibility between those. It is reasonable to say that consumer power in this country has not been particularly strong. Perhaps it has been strong at ground level and in general consumer terms but in terms of organised consumer power we are some way behind other countries, particularly the United States. That is a matter which the Director of Consumer Affairs has referred to and one she mentioned at a recent meeting of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service. Ensuring that competition operates properly and fairly is just as important as the work of IDA Ireland or other agencies that are involved in attracting businesses to this country. It is also important from a domestic point of view. I always believed that if somebody started with a very small business and had enough <Col N="45" /> energy, vision and commitment, they could build it into a large business. Unfortunately, devices were used by dominant market players in the past to ensure that small businesses could not develop, flourish or become as large as they were. It is important to encourage the people who have that energy, vision and commitment as it is at the heart of what makes us a competitive and effective economy.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to see that some of the European competition measures are being introduced into Irish law. Even if we had not been obliged to do that we should have gone ahead and done it because it is so critically important to our competitive position in the world market. It is also important that we have a level playing field whereby companies can operate and flourish. I applaud the work that was done by the competition and mergers review group. They laid the foundations for the legislation that is before us.</P>
    <P>The question of a dominant position is important. As far as I can recollect, a dominant position of itself was not grounds for disqualification on a merger. It related to the misuse of a dominant position, and that is obviously something that is very difficult to prove. This is the area where we have the most problems with the legislation. Most beef producers in the country would have said there was a lack of competition between meat factories. That was evidenced by the protests, organised by the IFA, that took place outside meat factories last year. That matter was investigated and it was held that there was no evidence of collusion in pricing between the factories. There are difficulties in establishing and proving the facts where lack of competition is a commonly held view, although I accept that because something is commonly held it is not necessarily the case.</P>
    <P>It is reasonable to say that the burden of proof for some of these serious matters should lie with those who are the subjects of the investigation or the scrutiny of the merger. The onus should lie with them, as it does in other legislation, to make their case properly and prove the contrary. For example, insider trading and conspiracy are notoriously difficult to prove. That is why the provision regarding the whistleblower, which has been criticised in the debate, is reasonable. I envisage many circumstances whereby the only way a charge can be laid, apart even from proving it, is if somebody has immunity because they have come forward with information. That makes it easier to build a case and make it stick.</P>
    <P>Other speakers have referred to the timescale. The Competition Authority is notified that it has to make an initial adjudication and then another timescale &ndash; I think it is three months &ndash; is imposed on it. That is very reasonable. With the nature of these mergers there has to be a defined timescale, otherwise investors will get edgy and the deal may fall for reasons other than that there is a dominance.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned the roll-out of broadband technology &ndash; Senator Cox also raised simi<Col N="46" /> lar points. I know Shannon Development is among those concerned about it. I welcome the appointment of John Fingleton as chairman of the authority. He has returned from the United States to take up the position. It is good to see people with enough commitment and international experience returning to Ireland to take up these jobs. That can only be of benefit. I suspect it will not be possible for the Minister to appoint four Trinity College graduates, in addition to the chairman, to the authority. That is unfortunate. I note that the upper limit is four &ndash; I think other speakers suggested otherwise.</P>

      <P>It is appropriate that a distinction should be drawn between so-called serious offences, such as price-fixing, which are subject to a maximum sentence of five years, and those of a minor nature, such as refusal to supply. Minor offences are not subject to the same penalties. That is right and it is important that distinction is made as they are of different magnitudes. The fines have been referred to in this debate.</P>
      <P>The media can be adjudicated on and referred to the Minister. That is appropriate. There can be a dominance within the media which is not necessarily based on shareholding or financial interests. It is also unquestionable that a plurality of views in the media is part of a healthy democracy just as it is in society and it would be highly regrettable and totally wrong if there was to be unanimity in the media based on sole ownership or dominance by one owner. That would be highly prejudicial to the future of proper democratic and open debate and it would subvert democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Competition involves serious issues which relate to broadcasters as well as newspapers and one should worry about local broadcasting because it could transpire that one group or indi<Col N="47" /> vidual holds the majority of shares or a significant number of shares in a large number of small local radio stations or provincial newspapers. This is a hugely important issue and that is why it is correct that this legislation should be introduced. I have a reservation, which does not relate to the Minister, about circumstances in which it is conceivable that the Minister of the day could be the instrument of the particular media group or could be acting under its orders. That is something about which I have difficulties and questions. It is argued that the Oireachtas is the safeguard. In other words, ownership issues would have to be referred back to the Oireachtas but the capacity to influence the majority of Members within the Oireachtas could be a factor and perhaps the Minister will address this issue when she replies.</P>
    <P>The system of writing to the Department so that the Minister can decide whether the matter should be referred to the authority has been changed in that one can write directly to the authority. That is welcome and the timescale envisaged to provide clearance or proceed to a full investigation is appropriate and reasonable.</P>
    <P>Turnover is another issue. A reasonable threshold has been set at &euro;40 million before a company comes within the ambit of the mergers legislation. That is better than basing the threshold on assets, which I welcome.</P>
    <P>The administrative reforms have been strengthened and I am pleased that the authority has been given considerable powers under sections 28 and 29. While it is important that the authority should be able to cast its beady eye over activities in the wider economy, it should also be able to examine practices in Departments, semi-State bodies and so on. Under section 28(1)(<i>c</i>) the authority has power &ldquo;to advise the Government, Ministers and Ministers of State concerning the implications for competition in markets for goods and services of proposals for legislation, including any instruments to be made under any enactment&rdquo;. It is good that the authority has an advisory role. It is difficult to prove anti-competitive practices are in place and any improvement to the powers of the authority is welcome.</P>
    <P>The authority's advocacy powers are also important. For instance, it has the power to point out that a Department is not looking after the consumer properly. The pharmacy regulations have been mentioned and the authority would say the regulations that were in place were not helpful in terms of competition. The groceries order has also been mentioned.</P>
    <P>This is a reasonable Bill which I hope will have the desired effect by ensuring a truly competitive economy is created that benefits foreigners and indigenous investors and consumers who need to be confident that when they buy whatever goods and services they require, they are doing so on reasonable terms in an environment where there is no collusion, price fixing or inner circles operating to their detriment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Tánaiste to the House and congratulate her on her recent nuptials. I hope my remark relating to her public duty in Manorhamilton did not cause offence. It is always a pleasure to see her in the House as she is a breath of fresh air in what is mostly a stale Government.</P>
      <P>By and large I welcome the legislation. The Tánaiste stated that the legislation is being introduced in the common good and competition is the life of trade. However, the legislation, in addressing anti-competition measures and anti-merger cartels, endeavours to prohibit activities that restrict, prevent or distort competition and prevent a business monopolising the marketplace, thereby ensuring cartels are not established and there is a free flow of goods so that the consumer or the business community does not suffer in a distorted marketplace.</P>
      <P>The Government has concentrated on the public sector in this regard over the past five years. The word abroad, which the Tánaiste has echoed on many occasions, is that the public sector is not competitive. Every measure has been taken over the past five years to privatise State companies and now the public sector is overwhelmed with regulation. Regulators have been appointed in the telecommunications, aviation and electricity sectors. There is regulation throughout the public sector to the extent that it is top heavy with regulation.</P>
      <P>It is ironic that the public sector has always been perceived as a monopoly or a closed shop that has not been competitive because it dominated the markets in which it traded, yet it is expected to operate in the marketplace now as though it were operating on a level playing pitch. However, the semi-State sector is operating in a small island economy and it is extremely difficult to compete in an open global market. The Government has turned these State companies into commercial entities and expects them to float on their own, but that does not mean a level playing pitch has been created or anti-competitive measures have been removed because large businesses always have an advantage over small businesses.</P>
      <P>A David and Goliath scenario is still applicable to business operations in the EU and throughout the world and to multinationals in our economy. It is extremely difficult for indigenous industry, whether it has emerged from the semi-State or private sectors, to compete in the open marketplace. We know to our cost that, as soon as there is a breath of cold air through the global economy, we are the first to be hit by it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know the majority of our manufacturing output is not indigenous but multinational and that is the reason we have distorted the market and have a preferential tax rate for multinational companies over domestic ones. They pay less tax although they are much larger. Surely that is anti-competitive. What have we done about it? We have, under the influence of the European Union, begun to harmonise gradually towards a common <Col N="49" /> tax position in Ireland. Even still, the multinationals pay less tax.</P>
    <P>They have a constant advantage. They are also multinational which means they do not come any larger. They have a dominant position outside the country which means they dominate indigenous industry to such an extent that it is very difficult for the latter to develop under their tentacles. Consequently, we are an isolated island economy which is used and abused by every dominant foreign industry. We encourage it because we benefit in many ways from it. In the long term it means we can be the quickest to collapse as an industrial complex compared to other countries which have a greater balance.</P>
    <P>This key area must be addressed, but I do not know if there is anything in the legislation to do that. Multinationals operate as if they were a law unto their own. What is in the legislation to deal with this? It deals with the national sector, but how does it deal with the multinational sector which does not have trade unions and strikes sweetheart deals to avoid them, which benefits from preferential tax rates in this country, which hides many products made in other countries and which uses false accounting practices? Profits made in another country are often channelled through this country.</P>
    <P>The result of all this is that the productivity of a worker in the multinational sector is ten times greater than that of one in the indigenous sector. Can this be true? Of course it is not. It is because false accounting practices are in operation in the multinational sector although it benefits from preferential tax treatment. This is an area which is rather ugly under the surface. We do not touch it because we are afraid to say &ldquo;boo&rdquo; to multinationals in case the economy collapses. They comprise the economy in this country, by and large. Despite the wonderful things we say about ourselves being a dynamic economy with a well educated workforce, we are not dynamic in terms of productivity. Our little country, in common with a number of other countries throughout the world, mostly Third World countries, is a pawn in a much larger global game.</P>
    <P>I hope the legislation is effective. I hope we rid ourselves of mergers, monopolies and anti-competitive cartels. I am happy with the developments which have taken&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no competition in this case and there is no need for the authority to examine it. We are an open economy and it is something we have to address as best we can. There are many contradictions in the manner in which we deal with businesses. If we examine any of them closely, we find it very difficult to resolve matters in a satisfactory fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="50" />My main concern is what is happening in certain sectors in the domestic market where cartels operate despite the fact that the Competition Authority has examined these sectors and regulatory bodies are in place for them. The largest enterprise with which we deal almost daily is banks. We do not need the Committee of Public Accounts to tell us that banks abuse their dominant position and have defrauded their customers in a direct fashion. They do not compete with each other either. Bank of Ireland does not compete with AIB. They have been closing branches throughout the country in the past four years. I said on the Order of Business that, in the past two years, Bank of Ireland and AIB have between them closed almost 100 branches in this country. They did not do so in a manner which would have allowed them compete with each other.</P>
    <P>Bank of Ireland and AIB have a branch each in most places. When branch closures occurred, one branch was not left to operate in the area. Instead, both branches were closed. For example, in my constituency, both branches were closed in Stoneybatter and the customers were transferred to Phibsborough. It was not as if one stayed on to continue business or that there was cut-throat competition. The two closed and both sets of customers were transferred. They did the same where both had branches side by side on the quays in Dublin and also in Cabra.</P>
    <P>There is no competition, yet we hear the Central Bank keeps an eye on this sector and that the new financial regulatory body will deal with it. In practice, all we get is rhetoric and the competition does not exist. The charges are roughly the same and are outrageous. There is little competition between the two banks. I would like to know how the Bill will change that and improve the lousy service customers receive from banks with the associated high charges and the fact they cannot get to see anyone in person. Banks will accept business on the Internet or over the telephone, but God help one if one tries to conduct business in a branch. A person has to wait in a queue for a long time and there is always a shortage of staff to serve customers. Competition exists in other areas of business. Supermarkets would never get away with that because people expect service and competition.</P>
    <P>The media are an area on which I agree with the Minister. They are a central aspect of democracy. Without a free, responsible and diverse media, it is not possible to ensure democracy. They have incredible power. They constantly churn out information to the public and that is the regular diet the public receives in terms of what is right or wrong, good or bad and what is happening or not happening. A slant is put on events or not as the case may be. This is how the media operate.</P>
    <P>They can, when they choose, endeavour to become a complete monopoly and influence the direction of a country. We have seen them try to do this and the Minister's predecessor, Deputy <Col N="51" /> O'Malley, was right in taking the action he did at the time. It is an extremely dangerous development. The combined involvement of the Minister, the Competition Authority and, ultimately, of both Houses of the Oireachtas is right. It is the only way to address the development adequately, appropriately and, I hope, effectively.</P>
    <P>I do not know how legislation of this nature is enforced. I am pleased to see the penalties have been increased but an increase in penalties does not ensure enforcement. I hope the Competition Authority will be an effective watchdog but I am not sure the authority is effective now or will be effective in the future, even though its role is being strengthened and widened. We will be watching to see if it works effectively.</P>
    <P>The Bill is largely welcome. The prevention of distortion in the marketplace, which is the function of the Bill, is not an easy task. It is extremely difficult to maintain a balance between the various forces operating in the marketplace but we must make every effort to do so. In endeavouring to ensure that the domestic market is not distorted we must be careful not to compound the problem by curtailing the ability of our indigenous market to compete internationally. It is in this area that legislation such as this can fall down.</P>

      <P>I will try to be concise although those who know me might say that is an impossible task. The Minister has been ideologically wedded to the concept of fairer competition and committed to changing the business culture of this country since she entered public life and especially since she assumed leadership of the Progressive Democrats. This is the Minister's Bill, but it coincides happily with the current business environment which needs the type of legislative rationalisation and consolidation which is provided by the Bill. The Bill is clear, focused and unambiguous and draws together other legislation, which was commendable in its time. It has brought to fruition the long-held political aspiration of the Minister to set up a competition authority which would be independent of her Department and able to focus on its mandate. The Bill is to be welcomed because it covers all bases. Notwithstanding the contributions of our colleagues on the Independent benches who will bring forward amendments, no Senator could disagree with the broad thrust of the Bill and with what it attempts to achieve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EU Commissioner with responsibility for competition has taken an initiative with regard to the price fixing cartel which has operated in the car industry. The Commissioner is to be com<Col N="52" /> mended on his political courage in taking on a significant lobby and bringing it kicking and screaming into the 21st century. It is sad, therefore, that Ireland denies its consumers the right to be able to purchase cars on the same competitive level as their fellow citizens of the European Union. I fully understand the reason for the vehicle registration tax and I accept the argument that a radical reduction in VRT would place an enormous strain on the Exchequer receipts. Nevertheless, I suggest to the Minister that an attempt be made to dismantle the VRT albatross which has been around the neck of the Irish consumer since its introduction in 1993. This could be done on a phased basis over a period of years so that its impact on Exchequer income would be minimal. No Government could agree to a complete and immediate removal of VRT and I would not ask for that.</P>
    <P>Many of my colleagues have referred to media dominance. I too welcome the provisions in the legislation which cement the initiatives taken by previous Ministers in relation to media mergers but it is not enough to pass legislation to prevent dominance of the media by a single cartel. Let me be frank and brutal. When we speak of dominance of the media, particularly of television, we are talking about Rupert Murdoch. However, in recent years there has been an increasing drive by outside media companies, particularly those based in the United Kingdom, to identify business opportunities in the Irish media at local level. The first foray into media purchase in Ireland by Scottish Holdings, which is becoming a dominant player in the Irish media, was not of a large Irish conglomerate but of my local newspaper, the<i> Leitrim Observer, </i>of which the Minister has an intimate knowledge as a result of recent activities in my county. My local newspaper is now owned by a Scottish company.</P>
    <P>I say, as an aside, that the Minister will always be welcome in County Leitrim irrespective of her reason for coming. I know I speak for the overwhelming majority of the people of my county and the neighbouring county of Sligo in saying this.</P>

      <P>RTÉ is in financial crisis. There is an increasing concentration of power in radio <Col N="53" /> and television. Cork 96.8 was recently taken over by a consortium and Today FM has been taken over for a huge sum of money. As someone who has an interest in local radio &ndash; I declare an interest in this regard because I am a shareholder in a Dublin radio station &ndash;  I know that the rationalisation and consolidation of the Irish radio and television media industry will continue. The effect on television will not be so great because TV3 is our only independent commercial TV channel, but if RTÉ continues to be starved of funding for programming we will see the diminution and even the elimination of a public service voice in the Irish electronic media. RTÉ will not be able to survive commercially because of the powerful figures who control the electronic media and who can spend hundreds of millions of pounds.</P>
      <P>I cite as an example the enormous sum of money &ndash; between £6 million and £7 million &ndash; given to the premiership in Britain by Sky Television. At the end of this year, a similar arrangement between the English Rugby Football Union and Sky TV for exclusive rights to England's home international matches will come up for renegotiation. The international rugby union fought against this when it was first initiated three years ago. There is no doubt, when money of the order that has been dangled in front of the premiership is similarly dangled in front of the rugby authorities next summer, that, even with the best will in the world, they will succumb to it. What will then happen is what will happen next Saturday week when the vast majority of rugby followers in this country, including people like me who follow the game because we enjoy sport, will be denied the right to see the game being played at Twickenham.</P>
      <P>That is not because of any merger, competition legislation or legislative model that has been brought to bear on the issue but for the one basic old fashioned reason of money, and lots of it. I urge the Minister in her capacity as a member of the Cabinet to try to ensure that the final pieces of the jigsaw in regard to listed sporting events, which were promised several years ago, are acted on as a matter of urgency, notwithstanding the fact that we are in a pre-election situation. There is absolutely no rocket science involved in identifying the national sporting events that need to be protected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am adding this dimension to the debate because it is not sufficient to suggest this model of legislation is in place, although it is excellent legislation, and that all the infrastructure is in place to ensure there is no abuse and that, if there is abuse, sanctions will be imposed. The point has been well made by my colleagues about the importance of the media. It may seem like I would say so &ndash; I am declaring a vested interest as I still receive an income from RTÉ &ndash;  but I am passionately committed to the concept of public service broadcasting and an independent voice in this country when it comes to dissemination of news, current affairs and articulating and <Col N="54" /> reflecting our national cultural identity. Therefore, I believe it would be madness to allow the destabilisation of RTÉ as a public service concept.</P>
    <P>One can have this legislation which ensures there will not be a dominance of the media but if the existing semi-State body does not have sufficient money to, at least, try to compete, it will fall. I appreciate the Tánaiste and I might not necessarily see eye to eye on this issue, coming as she does from a free market philosophy, but I think I would do her a disservice if I suggested she would not see some merit in my argument about the protection of a separateness within television. The point has been well made about the print media. Therefore, I will not repeat what has been said in that regard.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to supermarket dominance. Since the introduction of the euro, what was anecdotal up to then has now become apparent, that is, some price fixing is taking place among supermarkets. How else can one explain the gross disparity in price for even the most basic items? I was aghast at one item in particular, potatoes, which have been the staple diet of the Irish for centuries. There must be something wrong given that we pay more for potatoes than any other euro zone country. It might be worthwhile for the Minister, who has already embarked on a series of studies and commissioned a number of reports in various areas, or the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, to embark on some type of comprehensive study on to why there are such gross price disparities between Ireland and other euro zone countries for staple produce.</P>
    <P>Is there a link between the fact that most of our larger food outlets are controlled from Britain? Most of the ordering process comes from Britain. Any day of the week one can see massive juggernauts with UK registrations which have just arrived off the ferry outside Marks and Spencer's. Much of that produce which is on our shelves and sold within a few hours originates outside the country. Similarly, Tesco has a dominant position in the Irish supermarket scene and, again, its ordering processes are UK originated. I suggest there is a linkage which is not just about the sterling and VAT differentials, but a culture in Britain which is not beneficial to this country.</P>
    <P>It would be remiss of me not to raise that issue in the context of the legislation. I should put on record the fact that there is still a significant independent player in the market, Senator Quinn of Superquinn. He is out there, he is Irish and proud of it and I am very happy to shop in his premises. If that sounds like narrow nationalism, I do not care because it is important to support our own. That does not in any way reflect on the thousands of Irish workers employed in the other dominant supermarkets. This is about a concept and philosophy. If price fixing is taking place, is there a link between the fact that the dominant players involved in the food chain are UK based, with UK buying practices and business practices that <Col N="55" /> are inimical to ensuring consumers get a fair deal in this country? </P>
    <P>Once again, I reiterate that the Minister is particularly proud of the fact that this legislation has finally come to fruition. I am particularly pleased it has been initiated in the Upper House of which she was a very distinguished Member at the beginning of her political career. I wish the Bill well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all the Members who participated in the debate and for their good wishes. It is always difficult to respond to individual points when Members have left. I will not respond in detail to all the suggestions made because, as I said at the outset, I have an open mind on some of the issues raised. On another occasion when I took the Environmental Protection Agency Bill through the House, I recall accepting 183 amendments. I do not want to encourage this as other events are occurring later this year. However, I genuinely have an open mind. I like good and healthy Committee Stage debates because the primary role of Members of this House, as in the other House, is to be legislators. I always think legislation is stronger if it has been properly scrutinised. I will not go into the individual points raised but I want to comment on a number of inaccuracies.</P>
      <P>In reply to Senator Costello, it is not the case that multinational or multi-locational companies have a preferential tax regime. The 10% tax which applies until 2010 is ring-fenced around certain activities, including manufacturing and internationally traded services, regardless of whether companies are indigenous or foreign companies in this jurisdiction. There are a large number of multi-locational companies which were originally indigenous such as CRH, AIB, Bank of Ireland, Elan and Iona. There are many multi-locational and multinational companies and, therefore, it is wrong to presume the reference to multinationals refers to foreign companies solely. It is inaccurate to say they have a different tax regime from that which applies to the indigenous sector because that is not the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any event, all companies will pay 12.5% tax on corporation profits from 1 January 2003. That proposal was initially made in 1997 by the rainbow Government in which Senator Costello's party was a partner. We have accepted the need for a low corporate tax rate because we realise it encourages activity and makes more things happen in Ireland. It has made Ireland more competitive and has generated substantially more revenue for the Exchequer than might otherwise have been the case. Companies in Ireland, paying on average one-third of the tax rate on profits that applies generally in Europe, contribute about 15% of the tax take. In other countries, they contribute about 5% or 6% of the tax take. The lower rate generates almost three times the rev<Col N="56" /> enue that is generated elsewhere &ndash; it used to be two and a half times the revenue.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney made reference to the proposal by Commissioner Monti. There is some confusion over this. Commissioner Monti was dealing with what is called the &ldquo;block exemption&rdquo;. This was an arrangement that existed between manufacturers and distributors which discriminated against retailers and purchasers of cars. That is a separate matter from the raising of taxation. Vehicle registration tax applies in eight countries in Europe. In some cases, it is at a much higher level than in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I am a strong advocate of lower taxes, not just lower personal taxes and corporate taxes. I like to keep taxes low because it encourages activity and it rewards risk-taking. Ultimately, it raises more revenue. VRT currently brings in &euro;800 million annually. If we were to abolish it, we would have to increase petrol costs by about 36% to raise a similar amount of revenue or put 2% on the standard rate of tax. There are issues concerning how we raise the tax revenue we need to provide the services we all want to see in this jurisdiction. That is separate from the decision that was made, which will benefit consumers in Ireland as it will everywhere else. I welcome the decision very much.</P>
    <P>With regard to pay-for-view television in respect of major sporting events, Senator Mooney should note that the English RFU has the ownership rights to the rugby match on Saturday week in Twickenham and it has sold them to Sky. The Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, who has responsibility in this area, can, under the 1999 Broadcasting Act, make an order designating certain major events of national importance to be made available on free television. Obviously, they are events that take place in this jurisdiction. I understand that the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation is in discussion with the national sporting organisations and there are two views emerging. Some organisations, for financial reasons, may have difficulties with that. The matter is being discussed between the Ministers involved and does not come within my remit.</P>
    <P>I welcome the support for this Bill. Nobody will oppose it on Second Stage, which I welcome very much. Across the House there is support for increasing the powers of the Competition Authority and simplifying competition law. The fact that previous legislation will be consolidated in one Act is a very good thing. Legislators and practitioners of the law find it difficult to get their heads around the law in Ireland because we have not yet reached the stage where we have been able to consolidate legislation, as we do with the Finance Bill every year. The Finance Acts are consolidated Acts, but this is exceptional because the law is not yet in a form that is easily understood. It is a great pity that is the case. It is the intention of the current Attorney General and others, over a period of time, to have all our laws <Col N="57" /> codified or consolidated. That is the way it should be.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately Senator Mooney has left, but he should note I am not a free marketeer. If I were, I would not be bringing in this legislation. If the market were so perfect, we would not need competition legislation. I strongly support private enterprise, individual enterprise and community enterprise &ndash; there is no question about that. People often misunderstand the issue when one favours both lower taxes and State disengagement from private and social lives or lives in terms of business and taxation. Neither am I an ideologue. My politics do not come from any textbook ideology. They come from practical experience. That is why I have a practical perspective with regard to this Bill. I have also had the benefit of working in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment for the past four and a half years. That experience gives me a certain perspective on the best way forward.</P>
    <P>It is untrue to say, as Senator Quinn said, that the Minister can appoint as many members of the authority as he or she wishes. It is limited to a minimum of two and a maximum of four. One can appoint part-time members and I would not rule out the possibility of using a provision like that because, from time to time, certain expertise may be required. It is important that legislation of this kind is flexible and not too rigid to allow for the different circumstances that might arise.</P>
    <P>The authority will be much more independent. I would be interested to hear how Senator Quinn thinks the authority could raise the resources that may or may not be necessary if they are not raised from central taxation. There are possibilities but I think they are genuinely quite limited.</P>
    <P>I remember that when the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Roads Authority were being established, there was a general welcoming of the fact that these bodies would be independent. Subsequently, after their establishment and their having being in operation for a number of years, there was much criticism from Members of the Oireachtas because they felt the bodies were too independent and that Members never had an opportunity to ask questions. We need to get the balance right in terms of public policy.</P>
    <P>This is a very small country with only 3.7 million people &ndash; fairly thinly dispersed in many places. We want to make sure that consumers, whether in west Cork or Dublin city centre, have access to a range of services. That is important in terms of public policy.</P>
    <P>I am surprised by Senator Costello's remarks about my visit to Manorhamilton recently. I got an opportunity to read them when they were faxed to me in Nairobi. There was a large wad of paper and among the comments included were those of Senator Costello. Given that he comes from a small village in Sligo, I thought that he in particular would understand the significance of opening an off-licence in a place like Manorhamilton. However, it seems that is not the case. Per<Col N="58" /> haps it was the mode of transport and not the event that caused him disquiet.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the groceries order. I emphasise that I said I do not have plans at present in this regard. We need to look at any restrictions that are in the way of competition and which act against the consumer interest. We all have a duty to do that.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the amendments that will be tabled on Committee Stage. I have no doubt we will have a very good debate because there is a huge level of interest. Some people have a theoretical interest. Sometimes the theory sounds great, but when one starts to put it into practice, a different view is often taken.</P>
    <P>At the end of the process, we must end up with a Bill that is practical and flexible, which ensures that consumer interest comes first and that we have the capacity to enforce competition law. Bearing in mind the importance of the 1996 Act, Members will recognise that having something written in law is one thing, but having the capacity to enforce the laws that are passed is often very different. We must ensure we have a workable regime in place so that serious offences are penalised appropriately and that the Competition Authority has the capacity to do that.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris has rejoined us &ndash; I thank him for his very kind wishes. There is no preference for Trinity graduates on the authority. It happens to be a coincidence that the current chairman&mdash;</P>

      <P>Competition is sometimes good in theory, but when it affects people directly, many who support the theory are not as good in practice. I have learned that in recent days from friends of mine in the pharmacy business and in the past year from constituents of mine who are <Col N="59" /> holders of taxi plates. It happens in the political arena also. I am not very happy that my constituency will go from having five seats to three seats at the next election. It makes things more difficult.</P>
      <P>I thank the Senators for facilitating the early Second Stage reading of this Bill. I look forward to Committee Stage within the next few weeks. That is the understanding we have reached with the different representatives in the House. I look forward to a very challenging and interesting debate.

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann acknowledges the very real achievements of the Government in the housing area as evidenced by&ndash;</P>
      <P>&ndash;&nbsp;the record levels of new housing output achieved in each year since 1977,</P>
      <P>&ndash;&nbsp;reducing the level of house price increases from about 40% per annum to avoid 5% per annum,</P>
      <P>&ndash;&nbsp;improving the position of the first time buyer in the housing market,</P>
      <P>&ndash;&nbsp;introducing for the first time a multi-annual and greatly expanded local authority housing programme, which has led to the highest level of activity under this programme for 15 years,</P>
      <P>&ndash;&nbsp;increasing voluntary housing output to the highest levels ever,</P>
      <P>&ndash;&nbsp;improving the range, availability and effectiveness of housing measures targeted at the needs of the disabled, elderly persons and the homeless,</P>
      <P>&ndash;&nbsp;putting in place an Integrated Strategy on Homelessness,</P>
      <P>&ndash;&nbsp;introducing measures to secure a strong and well regulated private rented sector, including the establishment of the Private Rented Tenancies Board;</P>
      <P>and supports the continued action and commitment by the Government to expand the supply of housing across all tenures and to improve access by all income groups to suitable housing accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="60" /> Cuirim fíorchaoin fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit go dtí an Teach and cuirim fáilte ar leith roimh an díospóireacht seo ar chúrsaí tithíochta. Molaim an rún ar son an Pháirtí Daonlathaigh.</P>
    <P>An old principle in education in my day was that if one did not see the dark, one would never appreciate the light. If we are to understand fully how things have improved in the course of the past five years, we would do well to remind ourselves of how things were in this country five years ago.</P>
    <P>In 1997 the housing situation was grim. House price inflation was spiralling out of control with the annual increase in house prices reaching a staggering 40% in 1998. First time buyers and low income households were being priced out of the market day by day. The shared ownership scheme was grossly underdeveloped. Planning delays and bottlenecks in planning were the norm. Local authorities had a haphazard, stop-go approach to house building. Families lived in squalor in substandard housing developments such as those in Ballymun and in its equivalent, although not quite as bad, high rise flats in Cork city. They were built substandard and were not properly maintained. They were not fit housing for young people. That is how it was. The supply of private rented accommodation was beginning to dry up. The supply of zoned and serviced land was very low. The housing situation was very bad five years ago.</P>
    <P>It is only against that background that we can evaluate the nature of the progress that has been made in the interim. I cite the planned policy based approach of the Minister of State in respect of which he enlisted the support of the best expertise available in the area of housing provision. He listened and learned and as a result put in place long-term sustainable policies on the provision of housing in terms of private, public and the voluntary housing sectors. That is a measure for which he should be commended more than any other. His comprehensive planned approach has not alone borne fruit in this five year period but it will continue to bear fruit in the future because that is the only way to move forward.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, local authorities are required to plan on a strategic, long-term basis. They are required to assess the housing needs in their areas in a scientific way and to put in place three year strategic plans. To enable them to have a continuity of work, they now have access to multi-annual budgets. That is a huge improvement.</P>
    <P>I have been a member of a local authority for more than 20 years and I am aware of the haphazard, stop-go approach that was a feature of the past. That is gone now. Local authorities are enabled and required to plan, like people running a business, on a long-term basis and to base their plans on scientific data. The budgets are put in place to enable them to do that. That single measure has transformed the approach to housing in local authority areas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="61" />The planning bottlenecks and the delays in planning departments, which were a feature of the past, have been addressed and additional staff have been made available. The Department and the Minister have also recognised other needs in terms of the provision of technical and other expertise to local authorities. That has been put in place. The delays that derived from shortages of staff and, perhaps, lack of best practice are now out of the way. That is a significant change of long-term value put in place by this Minister.</P>
    <P>Social and affordable housing has received an enormous shot in the arm in the course of the last five years. That has come about in a number of ways. Social and affordable housing is a mechanism which enables a range of families to become home owners. I welcome the fact that the Minister has put in place a long-term framework for funding and has removed bureaucratic obstacles to enable social and affordable housing to multiply and develop. There has been a dramatic and highly significant increase in the provision of housing under these schemes. That must be warmly welcomed.</P>
    <P>There has been a significant increase in the income limits for shared ownership. It was a great scheme but the limits were ludicrous. If one were at the threshold three years ago to benefit under the scheme, one would not have been able to afford to purchase. A realistic limit is now in place and, accordingly, more people are enabled to provide a roof for themselves and their families under this laudable scheme. To assist the process, this Minister has put in place a site subsidy for local authority houses to speed up the provision of funding.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most noticeable and significant trend is the downward spiral in house prices. The annual increase for last year is approximately 5.6% nationally and 6.7% in Dublin. The relevant increases in the secondhand market are 3.4% and 4.8%. That is a huge benefit to people who, four and five years ago, found the price of housing beyond their grasp despite having good jobs and incomes. The spiralling costs meant they simply could not bid for a house. They could not secure a mortgage or pay the deposit. That has levelled out now but it did not happen by accident. It is the result of a combination of well thought out tax based and provision based policies. It is a huge benefit.</P>
    <P>The changes that have been made in the provision of rented accommodation are significant, particularly for students who had a tough time in this regard. There are changes in the last Finance Act which enable them to secure more readily available housing. More than anything, I commend the Minister on the new initiatives he has taken in encouraging and driving the voluntary sector. There is better provision made for the elderly and the disabled within the housing schemes being developed by the voluntary sector than has ever been made since the foundation of the State. I commend the Minister for that, not to mention <Col N="62" /> what he is doing in terms of the strategy for homelessness.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion. Senator Quill gave a detailed outline of the huge improvements that have taken place in housing over the last five years.</P>
      <P>Let us look at the situation that prevailed five years ago with regard to housing demand. As a result of our economy growing and people having more disposable income, the demand for housing rose at an enormous rate, a rate we had never seen before. That led to a situation where the inflation rate in the price of housing was running as high as 40% per annum. It had a huge effect on people's ability to secure housing. There were houses available but the cost was spiralling out of control, to the extent that many people were excluded from the market.</P>
      <P>Fortunately, however, the Minister took a planned approach. Rather than just throwing money at the problem, which several Governments had done in the past, he discussed the issue, identified the constraints and worked on alleviating them. He focused the injection of capital into those areas and we can now see the results filtering through. The Bacon reports identified the problems and the Minister focused on them. However, some of the effects of implementing those policies created more problems. Fortunately, the Minister had the vision and approach to confront and correct them, in so far as it was possible and in so far as one could project what the effect would be. That is the essence of good government. It is approaching a problem, identifying how one can alleviate it and doing it. The Minister is to be commended for doing that over the last five years. Consequently, the inflation in house prices is reducing rapidly each year. That is making houses more affordable, particularly for first time buyers.</P>
      <P>One of the problems of the last four years was that the cost of housing in the Dublin area had got out of hand. Many people moved to towns outside Dublin and commuted daily to Dublin to work. That is extremely evident in Carlow. Entire housing estates are occupied by people who are working in Dublin and its environs. These people are most welcome in Carlow and, in time, they will integrate into the community and make it their home. However, some of them would have preferred to have been able to afford a house in Dublin or its suburbs rather than commute each day. The improvements that have been introduced by the Minister mean that this will not occur to the same extent in the future.</P>
      <P>One of the problems confronted by the Minister was the lack of serviced land. It was always a problem in this country but, fortunately, it no longer is. Land is being serviced on an ongoing basis. A huge amount of money has been pumped into it and will continue to be under the national development plan. There is now a land base for building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="63" />Another problem about which we heard on umpteen occasions in this House and which arose at every local authority meeting was the difficulty people had getting their planning applications through the system. There were delays on an ongoing basis because of the lack of personnel in the planning offices of every local authority in the country, but that has been addressed. Professionals have been put in place to speed up the process, which has to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>There is one area I would like the Minister of State to take a close look at; I have mentioned it here before and believe it is very important. We need to employ many more architects in the planning offices of every local authority. Unfortunately, they are manned to too great an extent by engineers. We need people who understand housing and how housing relates to people as distinct from being physical objects. Some of the social problems we have encountered as a result of poor housing could be identified at an earlier stage if we went down that road. Even though I have a personal interest as a landscape architect, we need to employ landscape architects in this area because it is all about the space in which we live.</P>
    <P>I encourage the Minister of State as he continues this work &ndash; no doubt he will continue it after the general election &ndash; to take note of those issues and to try to implement the changes on an ongoing and planned basis as he has been doing. I suggest that the Members opposite should sit back and think about what has been done and have the courage to compliment the Minister of State on the great job he is doing.</P>

      <P>Seanad Éireann condemns the Government for its continued failure to resolve the crisis in the housing sector, both in private rented accommodation and in social housing, which is reflected in the growing numbers on the housing lists and the increasing number of homeless.</P>
      <P>I was surprised to find this motion before us. I do not understand the reason for it. As Senator Walsh will verify, we have seen this motion before in the last 12 months. Somebody must be misreading what is happening out there and keeps putting this forward to praise the Minister of State. The facts are different. I suggest that, if one is going to war, one should pick the battlefield but not one on which one has lost before the battle starts. The truth is that I could go through the statements in the motion and take the ground out from under each one individually. Senator Quill and I rarely fall out but on this issue we do&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise but if the Minister of State continues to interrupt me I will have to react. It is within my rights to do so.</P>
      <P>The first point raised on the recorded level of new housing output achieved since 1997 fails to note that these were at the planning stage in 1994-95. No one thinks one can build a house in a day and Senator Gibbons spoke about the delays in planning. Local authorities experience these delays as well as everyone else. The Minister of State should consider how long it takes to build 100 houses and when they will be on stream. To accept praise for something that was put in place before the Minister of State was in office is unfair.</P>
      <P>The motion notes the reduction in the level of house price increases from 40% per annum to 5% per annum. They have come down from such a high base, but they are still up there. That is the reality for children who are coming of age and going out to buy a house. One should try and buy one in Galway, but not if one is a person who left college three years previously. I guarantee that one would not get one. The numbers on local authority housing lists are increasing because people cannot afford housing. There are other factors involved to which I will return.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said to the Minister of State before, an integrated policy is lacking. There is no policy. There is an<i> ad hoc</i> reaction. Parts of the Bacon report are taken out and other parts thrown in. Changes were made in house rental subsidies. There were incentives to encourage people to build apartment blocks but the Minister of State changed his mind and introduced the changes we were suggesting. There is no disputing that the number of people applying for local authority housing has increased dramatically. There is no denying that house prices have increased. All we have been doing is tinkering with the problem, <Col N="65" /> playing around with it and hoping it will go away, but it will not because there is no integrated policy.</P>
    <P>Senator Gibbons is correct that we must think about designs of houses because of the demographic breakdown of the country. There has been a 20% increase as a proportion of the population of people between the ages of 25 and 34. These are people who will not have children. We will have to take that into account. There are empty nesters. Have we taken that into account? There are people who have substantial houses with four or five bedrooms, their children have gone away and their houses are difficult to keep. Could we not encourage these people to find some other location which would have the same or better quality of life more appropriate to their needs and let their house go onto the market? We should intervene at this stage.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment said at the last election that children planning to leave their home place should consider staying at home. Perhaps that is correct and we should encourage them to stay on, but people want their independence. There is an idea in Ireland that we must all have our own house. It takes a leap of faith to believe in renting for life or second and third generation mortgages. We must change our attitudes and our plans.</P>
    <P>One of the recommendations of the Bacon report states:</P>
    <P>It would be appropriate that the next national development plan should address the issue of achieving a better geographical balance of economic activity with an associated more even distribution of population, affording a high priority to achieving it. The preparation of a national spatial development strategy would facilitate and assist with development policy in this regard. It is recommended such a strategy should be formulated and published. A comprehensive land use analysis relating to the Dublin and mid-Eastern region should be undertaken in the meantime. This should be sponsored under the direction of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister of State that the national plan seems to have stopped dead. We should get people to leave the centre of Dublin where the pressure is and develop new towns. We should change house design. We should be imaginative about it and find answers that are different from those that we have come up with so far.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why this motion was tabled, unless it is an attempt to praise the Minister of State before the election as a result of the poll in Galway West. I am afraid he picked the wrong battlefield.</P>

      <P>It might be just as well because I am winding myself up almost to explode. I do not know whether that is with laughter or with rage. I must be living on a different planet from everyone else because I cannot believe that the party of probity, the Progressive Democrats, would so indulge themselves. Self praise is no praise. Either their guilelessness or their gall is breathtaking. I can only assume that they have all become so rarefied and posh that they have no contact with a very large segment of the population &ndash; I meet those people all the time, perhaps because I represent a marginalised and specially designated area.</P>
      <P>It is wonderful that the motion states &ldquo;Seanad Éireann acknowledges very real achievements of the Government in the housing area.&rdquo;  I cannot so acknowledge as it is a lie. My information from Focus Ireland indicates that 148,000 people are homeless. In that case how could I praise the record levels of new housing? Who is being housed? Who can afford it?</P>
      <P>I am amazed that two particularly delightful and highly intelligent colleagues have put down this motion. I do not know who asked them to do it because they could not have thought it up themselves. I see no reason the Minister should bask in a rosy glow about housing conditions. Although he will glare at me and complain, it is obvious he concentrates too much on west Galway, which must have become a very wealthy area since I was last there, bearing in mind that I visit the area frequently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion refers to a greatly expanded local authority housing programme. In my area the housing programme for this year produced 80 houses, but there are more than 4,500 applicants on the waiting list. It is nice to read that in five years' time we may have caught up with it, but we never will. The figures out today show increasing fertility and there was a very high number of births this year. We are dabbling when we should be attacking and I am amazed that we have not recognised as one of the major tragedies of our time the incidence of homelessness among young people. I have said that in this House before and <Col N="67" /> I will say it again. Apart from the lighting, the streets outside this House resemble Dickensian London. Crossing the Ha'penny Bridge in the rain the other day I saw two young, homeless men lying on white, striped woolly blankets. Do Members remember that our mothers had them before duvets came in? Are we codding ourselves? We are a society that produces strategies and policies, but we do not seem to be capable of carrying them out or enforcing them. We have a derisory programme.</P>
    <P>At a health board meeting yesterday I was told that in the refurbished Clancy Barracks we will have a cold-weather hostel. I thought we had seen the light and realised that in Ireland you cannot say it is summer just because it is 21 June. It could very well be freezing on that date. Under these programmes we will continue in a vein we thought we had discontinued. We are going to evict the homeless on 30 April and invite them back in, God help us, at the beginning of November. For the six intervening months they will have enjoyed incessant sunshine and will return tanned and fit. Who is codding whom?</P>
    <P>We agreed that local authorities would take cognisance of their role in the provision of accommodation. There is a lady working, I presume, very hard in Leeson Street, but that has not filtered down to the people who need help. Long ago, when I was much younger, there was a major housing crisis in this city and the then Government very wisely opened Griffith Barracks on the South Circular Road. It provided emergency shelter. It is estimated that in my local authority area alone, in which live 250,000 people, there are 200 homeless every night. They have still to go through the same rigmarole. There are new offices which provide information, but they will not provide a bed. Senators are inviting not only displeasure, but complete ridicule when they talk about that.</P>
    <P>Society is now blatantly two-tier. Civil servants and teachers may be climbing back up to be able to afford houses, but they cannot do so yet. For the first time in the history of the State what are called the stabilising influences cannot afford to buy houses and that is very sad. I certainly do not agree with the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry I cannot wait for my own time slot, but I have a prior arrangement to speak at a public meeting at 6.30 p.m. I thought that one of my colleagues would be here. I thank Fine Gael colleagues for giving me a couple of minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have great respect for the Progressive Democrats as a party which has endeavoured to break the mould. It has good intentions in this matter, as in many others. I find it difficult, however, to accept the veracity of what is stated here. You cannot say that much of it is inaccurate, but that does not disguise the fact that we have a housing crisis. The Minister will deny that such a crisis exists, but when in the last century, no matter <Col N="68" /> how bad times were, could young marrying couples not afford to get homes of their own? This is the first time that has been the case, despite the Celtic tiger. There is a whole generation of young people raising families in private rented accommodation where they are being bled to the last by a free market. That is not the way to build a stable home environment.</P>
    <P>Homelessness has trebled in Dublin since the Government took office and a family cannot now expect to get a home from the local authority without spending at least one year on the waiting list. A family will spend at least 12 months in a hostel or bed and breakfast accommodation, or in moving from one place to another, and that is completely unsatisfactory. Increasingly those coming to my clinics are homeless or looking for accommodation and I estimate that each one costs the State roughly &euro;30,000 before he or she is provided with a place to live. That is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>I agree wholeheartedly with the introduction of measures to secure a strong and well regulated private rented sector as described in the motion, but that has not happened. The private rented sector has run amok. It is evicting at will the people coming from the homeless sector. It can evict them at the stroke of a pen to accommodate those from whom a better return can be got, generally those on the short-term housing lists of Dublin City Council. There is a crisis that is not being addressed. There is a housing crisis for those who would before have got housing without bother, there is a homelessness crisis and there is an overcrowding crisis. There is a whole new sector providing hostel and bed and breakfast accommodation and it is completely unsupervised. Those who are getting that accommodation are not those who are most in need of it. They are often those in low-paid employment. There is no proper regulation of hostels and bed and breakfast accommodation and there are no standards. There is a new category of landlord and entrepreneur to service that scene and I am getting very worried about that. The private rented sector and hostel and bed and breakfast accommodation are burgeoning to cater to those on local authority and health board lists and the Minister should address that.</P>
    <P>I am very unhappy the Minister thinks that going ahead with more of the same will solve the problem. It will not. The problem is out of control and the Minister must recognise that and address it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire go dtí an Teach anocht agus glacaim leis an rún atá á phlé freisin. This is an important topic. As a committed republican, I have always seen two fundamental aspects to the ethos of republicanism, one of which is that people are entitled to shelter. The second is that people are entitled to use their God given talents to provide for themselves and their families. That entails job creation. If republicanism counts for anything, then we must address <Col N="69" /> ourselves assiduously on a continuing basis to that task.</P>
      <P>The motion before the House clearly illustrates the very good work that has been undertaken by the Minister during the past four and a half years in his Department. I suppose it is understandable that people from the Opposition would take an opposing view and dismiss some of the facts that have been placed before us, but on an issue as important as housing it is essential that we, as politicians, whether we are in Opposition or in Government, do not take an approach which is along the lines of not letting the truth get in the way of a good propaganda story. In this instance the facts speak for themselves. On the claim by Senator Costello that this private rental sector body has been set up on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis, in fact the body is functioning at present and is arranging arbitration in certain instances. I am surprised that members of the Opposition are not aware that mediators are being appointed to adjudicate in certain disputes.</P>
      <P>The private rental sector has a very significant role to play in the provision of accommodation. Many of our tax incentives have been geared towards generating additional capacity in the private rental sector and that is good. What we need is a balanced approach to the housing supply side and every effort is being made to achieve that.</P>
      <P>It is interesting that the supply unit, which was established by the Minister, has generated 11,000 hectares of land with the capacity to provide 285,000 housing units. The Minister's serviced land initiative involves 165,000 housing units with a capital spend of &euro;63 million for the current year. That speaks for itself. We have seen in the past the need to service the land in order to generate the number of housing units required.</P>
      <P>On the strategic development zones which were established, we have heard a great deal about the supply side, particularly in the Dublin area. Three sites were designated by the Government as part of this residential development in June 2001. The three areas designated &ndash; in Fingal, in a section of Meath County Council in the Navan area and a section of South Dublin County Council in the Lucan area &ndash; have the potential to provide 12,000 housing units, which is quite significant in the context of supply. Much good work has been done in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had great discussions in this House in the past 18 months or so on the Planning and Development Act, 2000. At the time, I stated that one of the most courageous initiatives taken in legislation was Part V of that Act, which provided that up to 20% of the land involved in any planning application can be made available for social housing. This was acknowledged by all sides in this House. That also addresses social integration which should be a necessary part of our housing programme. That is something of which one should not lose sight. In fairness, I remind the House that many members of the Opposition <Col N="70" /> were loud in their praise of that section when it was introduced.</P>
    <P>The issue of house prices has certainly been a bone of contention for this Government almost from the outset. Economists failed to predict the significant increase in the growth rate which we have enjoyed over several years. A fallout from that was a capacity problem on infrastructure generally and housing was one of those areas affected. The serviced land initiative and various other initiatives taken by the Minister have been quite effective in tackling that problem, which many people at the time said was almost insoluble &ndash; they said that market forces should dictate.</P>
    <P>Because of the intervention in the marketplace, house prices, which were increasing at an enormous rate of some 40% in 1998, are now back to somewhat more realistic levels. In 2001, new house prices increased by about 5.6% nationally and secondhand house prices increased by 3.4%. Therefore the initiatives taken have been effective.</P>
    <P>That was a difficult challenge for a Government and it now appears to be under control, but it is imperative because there is a strong tradition of house ownership in this country and many people in all walks of life aspire to that. It is important that we make that ambition realisable. Certainly the type of house price increases in the mid-1990s, up to about 1998 or 1999, would have driven home ownership out of the range of fairly well to do middle class people.</P>
    <P>The number of local authority houses has been very significantly increased. There is a target to build some 25,000 local authority units between 2000 and 2003. That is interesting because ultimately this comes down to resourcing. The funding provided in 1997 was &euro;228 million. In 2002, it is &euro;755 million. Between 1992 and 1997, there were 16,0000 units built and the corresponding number of units for the period from 1998 to 2002 is 21,000 units.</P>
    <P>When my local authority did its last housing assessment we found, much to my surprise, that because of the increased investment in recent years, and with houses under construction and houses planned, we were able to transfer everybody on the three-bedroom house list to the priority list. That was a remarkable achievement.</P>
    <P>The demographic changes in society need to be looked at because the demand for two-bedroom houses has outstripped the demand for three-bedroom houses. It is all about effective management. Often I find that officials at local authority level can take a somewhat sanguine approach. There is obviously a demand for two-bedroom houses among single parent families, but I have also seen cases where, due to marriage breakdown, the husband holds on to a three-bedroom house and the family must be accommodated in another three-bedroom house because of the circumstances. We need to be able to manage those situations more effectively from the housing stock point of view and it is something which should be looked at.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="71" />The voluntary housing sector has increased very significantly. It is interesting that this sector now manages something like 15,000 units, with a further 7,600 under construction. The regeneration of Ballymun is something of which the Government can be proud.</P>
    <P>While homelessness continues to be a problem and will always be a problem in my opinion, genuine efforts are being made to address it. Funding has been increased from &euro;4.4 million in 1997 to &euro;31 million in 2002.</P>
    <P>I referred to affordable housing previously. Measures undertaken include the shared ownership scheme; estate management; remedial works schemes, where inadequate local authority housing has enjoyed very significant investment; and disabled person's grants. It should be acknowledged by all that very significant progress has been made under the Minister of State's stewardship. While there is more to be done, the same application continuing in that Department will see genuine overall improvements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to talk on the issue of housing. I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, to the House and acknowledge his intention to remain in the Houses of the Oireachtas for the next couple of years. He would have been a sad loss and I am glad to learn he is running for election again.</P>
      <P>We have discussed housing many times over the past five years and the same problems, which have been restated tonight, have been highlighted. Progress has been made through Government policy and the national development plan. The motion loses the run of itself. There is no mention that there has been an improvement. All the problems have not been solved. I note that over 50,000 houses were completed last year. That was a record. I also note that figures from the Central Statistics Office for the last quarter of 2001 forecast that housing completions would fall to 45,000 this year and 40,000 in 2003. The target under the national development plan was 50,000 per annum. That shortfall would see us return to the problems we had in the past. I do not know if that is the case in the aftermath of the budget. I have not had time to study the impact that had on figures for housing starts.</P>
      <P>There were two significant moves in the two most recent budgets which were helpful in the area of housing. Budget 2000 allowed homeowners to rent or let a room and earn up to £6,000 that would be tax exempt. That was very useful in helping people pay for their properties. I ask the Minister of State to talk to the Minister for Finance with a view to extending that scheme in a controlled way. There are some restrictions in the scheme that can be dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last November there was no movement in the housing market and many builders went out of business. Apart from normal human sympathy, it was difficult to have real sympathy for them. During the past three years builders bought land from <Col N="72" /> developers at any price. There were no business plans, costings or studying of the market. It was a case of buying at any price, building the houses as cheaply as possible, selling them for the highest possible price and screwing the consumer. It was difficult to have sympathy for those who operated on that basis when they were suddenly unable to sell their houses. That will have helped focus the minds of many people in the construction industry. At that time I spoke to people in the industry and outlined to them the difficulties that were there.</P>
    <P>The Bacon report was published and was, correctly, implemented by Government. The impact of the report was to take investors out of the market &ndash; I am speaking as a member of the ICTU. Many people talk a lot of nonsense about the housing market. The reality is that the housing market needs approximately 18% to 20% of purchasers to be investors. There is a rental market and it has to be a quality market. That is a reality and anyone who denies it is not living in the real world. We have to allow investors to operate. We need to regulate and it is important that we do that in a qualitative rather than quantitative way. I thought the budget decision took a &ldquo;one size fits all&rdquo; approach. I discussed it with the Minister for Finance and had as much luck talking to him as I would have had talking to the wall. He told me the way he was going to proceed, that he wanted to keep it simple and not complicate matters, and that is what he did.</P>
    <P>I thought what I suggested was infinitely reasonable. I suggested that the Minister soften the impact of the Bacon report but not in a way that would bring the investor back into competition with the first-time buyer or homeowner. Surely that was a reasonable objective and one that we would all share. That could have been done very easily. I suggested we look at where the investor would be most comfortable in the market, probably the apartment sector. I suggested the Bacon restrictions be released from that sector of the market, or from particular areas, and in that way first-time buyers would be protected and allowed into the market, but that was not done. Auctioneers now get telephone calls from investors who are interested in buying up to 40 apartments in a block that is being developed in order to get into the market. That will see us return to some of the problems we had last year.</P>
    <P>We had a year when the implications of the Bacon report were fully felt. We had another year with new budgetary measures. Let us consider them to be the two extremes of the arc of a pendulum. Can we look at the next budget with a view to tailoring that down a little and giving a little more space to the first-time buyer? We should direct that which is positive for the investor to particular areas, either geographical or sectoral, and leave the first-time buyer out of that. The other, more obvious, thing to do is to give greater tax relief to home owners. I think that is in line with Government thinking.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="73" />Why will there be a problem? The Minister will recall that there was a big gig in Galway in 1979 when the Pope arrived. The consequence was the highest rate of birth in the history of the State the following year. That is 22 years ago and many of those born in 1980 are now coming into the housing market. Added to that are the numbers of immigrants and returned emigrants. Both of those groups are putting a substantial demand on the housing market.</P>
    <P>Unless something has radically changed in the past month the targets set out in the national development plan will not be achieved this year or next year. That is a problem. I am not saying this to have a go at the Government. This is a market with forces acting on it and one that the Government cannot, and should not, control. It should seek to regulate it to a certain extent but there should be as little intervention as possible. We should try to help young people and first-time buyers, and that can be done by directing investors into particular types of property or areas. Special, intensified and increased reliefs should be given to first-time buyers.</P>
    <P>Social housing is causing all kinds of difficulties for builders. When granting planning permission in a particular area, why does the planning authority not insist that a certain percentage of houses in the development must sell for less than a certain amount? That would help going forward.</P>
    <P>I do not have time to discuss planning in depth but the hamlet and small village developments that many local authorities are examining will also be important going forward and they should move in that direction. If the targets in the national development plan are not met, we will experience the same problems as a year ago. I compliment the Minister of State on his efforts. The pendulum needs to be stopped in the middle in the next budget and I ask him to take my proposals on board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to address the Seanad in support of the motion, to set out again the main elements of the Government's approach to housing and to update Senators on the positive effect that this approach is having. Housing remains at the top of the Government's agenda. A wide range of measures have been taken over the last five years to reduce house price inflation; to increase housing output to match demand; to remove infrastructural and planning constraints on residential development; to afford greater access to the housing market to first-time buyers; and to improve affordability for first-time buyers and lower income households.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's publication of Action on House Prices in April 1998 was the first of three major policy initiatives on housing. Its primary focus was to increase housing supply through a range of infrastructural and tax measures and to prevent investors pricing first-time buyers out of <Col N="74" /> the market. These measures were supplemented in 1999 by further measures taken in Action on the Housing Market and in June 2000 the Government published Action on Housing, which spelt out additional actions necessary to continue the momentum that was being achieved on foot of the earlier measures that we introduced.</P>
    <P>I will outline some of the key measures taken by the Government because some Opposition Senators are not aware of what is happening on the ground. A range of tax measures, including adjustments to the stamp duty system, were introduced to bring forward the supply of development land, remove speculators from the market and improve affordability for first-time purchasers. We introduced targeted measures to increase the supply of serviced residential land on top of significantly increased investment generally in water, sewerage and roads services. More than &euro;63 million in Exchequer funding is being spent on the serviced land initiative, which will provide water and sewerage services for some 165,000 housing units. A total of &euro;248 million in Exchequer funding has also been provided to part fund the construction of 42 non-national roads that will provide services for more than 42,000 housing units. Six project offices have been established to drive key infrastructure projects necessary to support housing development.</P>
    <P>We designated the first three sites, comprising some 14,000 housing units, in June 2001 as strategic development zones for residential development to assist in the early development of these sites. We published planning guidelines on residential density in September 1999, which are helping to secure efficient use of serviced development land, facilitate provision of more affordable housing and promote sustainable development. Strategic planning guidelines were drawn up on a regional basis for the Dublin and mid-east regions and this is being replicated in other key regions throughout the country.</P>
    <P>We introduced a range of measures to expand the capacity of the planning system, including the appointment of additional planning staff to local authorities and An Bord Pleanála, the recruitment of planners from abroad, additional planning courses in third level institutions and revisions to regulations to increase the size of exempted domestic extensions.</P>
    <P>It is clear that Government measures in the housing market have been effective. I published details of the second national inventory of zoned serviced land at the end of 2001, which showed that the position in regard to the stock of serviced building land is encouraging. There is currently approximately six years supply of serviced land nationally, in Dublin and in the greater Dublin area. This will improve further on foot of increased investment in economic infrastructure such as roads, water, sewerage and public transport over the period of the national development plan. The availability of serviced land, which was identified as a key issue when we took office, has been fully and comprehensively addressed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="75" />More than 13 houses per 1,000 population were built in 2001, the highest rate in the EU in proportion to population and approximately four times the UK rate. House completions in 2000 reached almost 50,000 units nationally. Notwithstanding the Opposition's attempt last year to talk up problems in the house building sector, this record level was surpassed in 2001. The prophets of doom in the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party told us the numbers would decrease. Last year was the fifth consecutive year of record housing output under the Government. Since the Government came into office, housing output has increased by more than 33% from a little under 39,000 units in 1997. Some 216,000 new houses have been built in the five years that the Government has been in office, equating to approximately 18% of our total housing stock.</P>
    <P>Since house price inflation peaked in 1998, primarily as a result of the failed policies of the previous Government, there has been a downward trend in house price increases. My Department's September quarter data for 2001 showed a continued moderation in new house prices with the annual rate of increase at 5.6% nationally and 6.7% in Dublin, with second-hand house price increases of 3.4% and 4.8% respectively. This data is supported by other sources. According to the Irish Permanent, November 2001 figures show that for the eleventh consecutive month the year on year growth in national house prices has slowed, falling from 10.1 % in October to 7.5% in November. This is the lowest year on year increase since the index started.</P>
    <P>One of my principal objectives in office has been to create space for first-time purchasers. I am glad they are accounting for a larger share of the market, with applications for new house grants increasing by 7.3% in 2001, following an increase of 4.8% in 2000. Indicative figures also show that first-time purchasers accounted for 34% of the market in 2000. This figure increased to 43% in 2001. Our policies have achieved increased output, reduced house price increases and afforded a greater share of the market to first-time buyers. The facts speak for themselves.</P>
    <P>The Government can also claim credit for bringing about real and positive changes in the provision of social and affordable housing. We have, for the first time, provided a long-term framework for the funding of social and affordable housing through the inclusion of &euro;7.62 billion in the national development plan, which was earmarked for these purposes. This was supplemented by the Government commitment of a further &euro;1.27 billion for social and affordable housing in Action on Housing.</P>
    <P>Action on Housing also included a number of measures to address social and affordable housing need, including an increase of 6,000 units in the number of local authority housing starts under the national development plan, increases in the income limits for the shared ownership and affordable housing schemes and a new site sub<Col N="76" /> sidy for houses provided by local authorities under these schemes. This overall investment will ensure that the housing needs of approximately 100,000 households will be met with Government assistance over the period of the plan. The total provision for social housing in 2001 was more than &euro;1.4 billion, an increase of more than a third on 2000 and almost treble that provided in 1997 when the Opposition was last in Government. The provision this year is &euro;1.7 billion.</P>
    <P>The impact of the Government's social housing strategy under the national development plan is being reflected in the provision of local authority housing. I introduced a multi-annual local authority housing programme for the first time, commencing in 2000 and running through to the end of 2003. Under the programme we aim to provide a total of 25,000 local authority housing starts. The multi-annual approach was introduced to provide for greater forward planning and efficiencies of scale in delivering the increased local authority housing targets. Local authorities completed some 5,000 units in 2001 and commencements of new house starts are estimated at more than 7,000 units, the highest level of starts for more than 15 years.</P>
    <P>In addition to the main local authority housing programme, major regeneration programmes have also commenced in Dublin and Cork, most notably the redevelopment of Ballymun in Dublin, which is the biggest regeneration project in the State involving the demolition of all the towers and the construction of 2,800 houses. More than 500 houses are currently under construction and some have been completed and are occupied. Since 1998, I have provided more than &euro;86 million for this project. There are also other major regeneration schemes underway or due to commence shortly in Dublin and Cork. A large redevelopment programme is currently underway, at an estimated cost of some &euro;130 million, in Dublin's inner city, where there are currently more than 200 new houses under construction on six schemes. Work is also due to start shortly on the first phase of the &euro;50 million redevelopment of the Glen area in Cork city.</P>
    <P>My Department is also jointly funding with Dublin City Council a once off upgrading of high density older housing complexes, mainly flats, at various locations around the city at an estimated cost of &euro;110 million. These measures are additional to the main construction programme and they all represent new and additional social housing activity. More than &euro;165 million is being provided in 2002 for the Ballymun project and the various redevelopment programmes.</P>
    <P>On coming into office, the Government quickly identified the important contribution the voluntary and co-operative housing sector has to make in tackling the growing demand for social housing. The voluntary housing organisations were in deep depression when there was a change of Government. They were dismayed by the lack of support they received from the previous Govern<Col N="77" /> ment, as a consequence of which their house building activity had shrunk.</P>
    <P>The commitment of the Government to the expansion of the sector is reflected in the national development plan which includes ambitious targets for output by the sector for each year of the plan and provides the necessary funding to achieve these targets. This commitment is also reflected in my improvement of the terms of the voluntary housing funding schemes on four occasions since 1997, the most recent in July of last year. The improved terms for these schemes clearly have a positive effect on activity. Output by the sector in 2000 showed a substantial increase in the number of units of accommodation provided, with 950 units completed, the highest output by the sector since 1995.</P>
    <P>Indications are that output by the sector in 2001 will be in line with the national development plan target of 1,250 units. There has been a marked increase to 7,600 in the number of units of accommodation under construction and at various stages in the pipeline. Last year, I approved &euro;254 million in assistance towards voluntary house building programmes compared with &euro;151 million for the previous year. These indicators augur well for continued growth in the sector.</P>
    <P>Housing output from the local authority housing programme, together with output from the complementary social housing programmes of voluntary, affordable and shared ownership housing and with vacancies occurring in the existing local authority housing stock will have enabled the housing needs of about 11,000 households to be met in 2001.</P>
    <P>A key concern for me as Minister has been to meet the special needs of specific categories of households such as the elderly and the disabled. This concern is reflected in the substantially increased funding I have made available for the task force on special housing aid for the elderly, the disabled person's grant scheme, the essential repairs grant scheme and the scheme of improvement works in lieu of local authority housing. The total number of grants paid under the disabled grants scheme and the essential repairs grant scheme in 2000 was just more than 5,000 with a value of &euro;32 million. In 2001, more than 6,300 grants were paid under both schemes. The improvements I have made to the terms and conditions of both schemes since taking office have led to a significant increase in activity given that fewer than 3,000 grants were paid in 1996 at a value of about &euro;13 million. The number of houses improved under the task force, and the figure for the improvement works in lieu scheme in 2000 was just under 4,000. Activity under these schemes in the first half of last year points to an even higher level of activity in 2001.</P>
    <P>I launched the Government's integrated strategy on homelessness in May 2000. The strategy recognises for the first time that homelessness is not just about a lack of accommodation, but that the health, care, welfare, education and training needs of homeless persons need to be addressed <Col N="78" /> in a co-ordinated manner if the problem of homelessness is to be tackled effectively.</P>
    <P>A key element of the Government's strategy is that homeless action plans are to be drawn up at local level jointly by the local authority, health board and voluntary bodies to chart clearly what services exist for homeless persons and to outline what services need to be provided for them in the next three years. The plans for the main urban areas are completed and work is well under way on the plans for other areas and should be completed shortly.</P>
    <P>I have made substantial additional funding available to ensure that the recommendations in the homeless strategy are implemented. Capital funding for the direct provision by local authorities of accommodation for homeless persons is being doubled from &euro;25 million to &euro;50 million over the next five years. Current funding has been increased by &euro;7.6 million per annum to increase bed-night contribution rates to voluntary bodies and to fund other support services such as settlement and outreach services. Additional funding of &euro;7.6 million is also available from the Department of Health and Children to fund the provision of in-house care in hostels providing accommodation for homeless people.</P>
    <P>As part of the overall homeless strategy, the Government gave a commitment to prepare a preventative strategy to tackle key groups at risk of homelessness. Having received Cabinet approval for its publication on 30 January, I will be in a position to launch this strategy very shortly. The main theme throughout the strategy will be the need to ensure that no one is released from any type of State care, whether custodial or health related, without appropriate measures being in place to ensure they have a suitable place to live with the necessary supports, if needed.</P>
    <P>The Government has also brought about in the Planning and Development Act, 2000, one of the most fundamental changes to planning law introduced by any Government. Part V of the Act radically alters the role of local authorities in the planning and provision of housing. It requires them to undertake a much more strategic role in identifying and addressing housing needs through the preparation of housing strategies. These must address the housing needs in the area covered by their development plan, including the need for social and affordable housing. The Act also requires local authorities to zone sufficient land to meet these needs. The first set of strategies has been prepared by local authorities and almost all authorities have varied their development plans to incorporate their strategies.</P>
    <P>Housing output is not simply about increasing the numbers. It has been a fundamental objective of the Government to promote more balanced regional development by promoting the development prospects of areas outside Dublin while at the same time managing and dealing with Dublin's current problems in terms of meeting its housing needs and transport requirements on an integrated basis. This fundamental objective is <Col N="79" /> being fleshed out through the national spatial strategy which is being finalised.</P>
    <P>Ireland's critical spatial weakness is that we do not have a wide enough range of the type of locations needed to attract significant levels of international investment or sustain substantial indigenous investment. We need to add to the locations which already have this capability and tackle disadvantage in parts of the country not enjoying the level and growth of development and economic benefits in some areas, especially Dublin.</P>
    <P>Doing this successfully will depend on selecting and developing emerging stronger centres or combinations of centres to drive growth in their wider areas at an appropriate scale for each area and strengthening the roles of other towns, villages and rural areas linked to the emerging, stronger centres.</P>
    <P>My Department received more than 240 submissions in response to the public consultation paper on the strategy, Indications for the Way Ahead. These emanated from local and regional authorities, representative community groups and interested organisations and individuals throughout the country, not least from a number of Members of the House. All these submissions have been carefully considered with a view to ensuring that the views expressed in them are factored into the development of the national spatial strategy before it is finalised for approval by the Government.</P>
    <P>The objective of the strategy will be to identify and provide guidance on the key policies and actions that need to be developed to bring jobs closer to people through developing the potential of different places. The key to this will depend on being focused while seeking to set the agenda for what all areas can do in terms of widening opportunity and access to employment, housing and services. The Government is determined to leave a legacy which will enable all parts of Ireland to develop over the next 20 years and beyond in a way that is economically competitive, environmentally sustainable and socially inclusive.</P>
    <P>The Government also recognises the importance of and need for a diverse and well managed private rented sector. In July 1999, I established the Commission on the Private Rented Residential Sector to examine the issues of security of tenure, supply and development constraints and the balance of rights and responsibilities between landlords and tenants. This was the first comprehensive review of the sector undertaken by a Government appointed body. The commission reported to me in July 2000 and the Government accepted my proposals for reform of the sector arising from the recommendations contained in the commission's report. These proposals were announced in January 2001.</P>
    <P>A number of relevant measures have been implemented in the Finance Act, 2001, including a reduction in the stamp duty rate for new residential investment properties, tax relief on rental <Col N="80" /> income in respect of refurbishment capital expenditure, the reintroduction of interest relief on borrowings in the case of certain properties meeting specified conditions and roll-over relief on capital gains tax in respect of qualifying reinvestment in the sector.</P>
    <P>Implementation of reforms relating to improved security of tenure, graduated notice to quit periods, tenancy termination, landlord and tenant obligations and rent aspects require new legislation, including amendments to the existing landlord and tenant legislative code. The Government approved the general scheme of the Housing (Private Rented Sector) Bill which I brought before it earlier this week. It is the most radical legislative proposal dealing with landlord-tenant relations ever introduced in the history of the State.</P>
    <P>In the meantime and pending the enactment of the necessary legislation, I established the private residential tenancies board on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis in October 2001 to deal with disputes and perform other research and information functions. It is developing the necessary procedures to allow it commence dispute resolution. It has advertised for mediators and appointments will be made soon.</P>
    <P>As well as measures to improve the operation and regulation of the private rented sector, I proposed to Government measures to boost the supply of private rented accommodation. Over 900 units of student accommodation, providing over 3,500 bedspaces, have been provided on foot of measures introduced in the Finance Act, 1999. A further 3,800 units are at various stages of planning which will provide an additional 14,000 bedspaces, greatly easing the student accommodation problem.</P>
    <P>I also proposed a new rent a room scheme, introduced in the Finance Act, 2001, which provides for an exemption from income tax where gross rental income does not exceed &euro;7,600 per annum for accommodation provided in a person's principal private residence. The scheme will increase the availability of accommodation, will assist affordability for house purchasers and will also make better utilisation of the housing stock. In addition, the ceilings for income tax relief in respect of rents paid by tenants in the private rented sector have doubled over the budgets of 2000 and 2001.</P>
    <P>Developments in the private housing market, as I outlined earlier, have now allowed us to step in and introduce further measures in budget 2002 to deal further with the rental sector. We withdrew interest deductibility against rental income for housing in 1998 as part of a set of measures designed to reduce speculative demand for housing, reduce pressure on house prices and create space in the housing market for first time purchasers. As a result of these measures conditions in the housing market have altered fundamentally.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="81" />I make no apologies for using these financial instruments available to us in order to achieve certain Government policy objectives. The situation was running riot. Speculators were ripping off private tenants because of the shortage of housing at the time. That shortage still exists. It is a huge challenge to provide enough homes to meet the needs of all of our people. We are quite a distance from this. You can call it a crisis, a challenge, a scarcity. The problem exists no matter what you call it. The Government faced straight into it and took a wide range of measures to deal with it, as I had the opportunity to outline tonight. It all depends on the capacity of our house building industry, which we have stretched to the utmost in reaching the astonishingly high output achieved in recent years.</P>
    <P>The reintroduction of interest deductibility, as well as the changes to the stamp duty system whereby the rates applying for investors have now been aligned with those applying in the case of existing owner occupiers, will encourage an increase in the supply of rental accommodation. Accommodation provided with the aid of interest deductibility will, of course, be subject to compliance with proper regulatory controls and to registering tenancies with the Private Residential Tenancies Board. Any landlord who does not register his property will not qualify for any of these tax concessions. These budget measures complement the other reforms introduced on foot of the recommendations of the Commission on the Private Rented Residential Sector and are laying the groundwork to achieve my objective of a diverse, properly functioning and well managed private rented sector.</P>
    <P>I want to outline briefly a number of the significant initiatives I have introduced over my term in office. A local authority multi-annual approach has been introduced to achieve a total of 25,000 starts for the period 2000-2003 and allow for greater forward planning and efficiencies of scale in delivering the increased local authority housing targets. Senator Costello is a member of Dublin Corporation. I know the number of housing starts that I gave to Dublin Corporation. It has not started to build the number of houses which I authorised from the funding which I made available. It is buying houses with the money, rather than bothering to acquire brown field sites, designing houses, building them and adding to the overall housing stock.</P>
    <P>I have committed record levels of resources to funding and supporting the voluntary housing programme. I have increased the funding limits for assistance under the voluntary housing schemes on four occasions and by more than 100% since 1997. It is hard to hear Fine Gael challenging me about the terms of the motion when I know the dismay that existed throughout the voluntary housing sector when I took over. It had been totally neglected by the rainbow Government. The number of activities in the pipeline was at its lowest level for years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="82" />I resuscitated the voluntary housing sector and threw it a huge challenge. I told it to get up off its knees and I would help it. It was building 3,000 units per year under the previous Government and I wanted it to reach 4,000 units per year. I am funding that and supporting those organisations. I am helping them with estate management funding and special training courses for workers in this sector. I have increased the funding to these organisations fourfold with non-repayable loans. They are the brightest sparks in the country, the dedicated people who are active and committed in the voluntary housing organisations. They are coming together where they see a need in their locality and availing of the Government support and funding. They are providing fantastic new homes, through that partnership, for people who need them. Families with low incomes, elderly people and disabled people are benefiting from this. The output is up from 300 to 1,250. There are 7,600 units either under construction or in the planning stages. I want to increase the completions to 4,000 units per year. I know that will be achieved.</P>
    <P>It will not matter if I go out of office after the next election. I have started a momentum. It is like a big, heavy ship in the ocean. Once you get it going it will keep going on, even if you turn off the engines. What has been done will continue to bring results and benefit many people for years after the Government leaves office.</P>
    <P>I introduced a new initiative to enable voluntary bodies undertaking housing projects under my Department's voluntary housing capital assistance scheme to provide accommodation for elderly emigrants who wish to return and who are unable to provide it from their own resources. Many Senators do not know this. They have not read their brief and acquainted themselves with the facts. These emigrants did not qualify under the previous regime in which a person had to be living here, put their name on the housing list and wait for three or four years for an offer. Now a voluntary housing group can come together and allocate a large percentage of their homes to people returning from England. I compliment Doctor Gerry Crowley in Mayo, who acts as an agent for my Department in co-ordinating applicants to his organisation. This is in its infancy and I am proud of it although we have not yet brought home one emigrant. It will benefit people for many years.</P>
    <P>I provided funding to Rural Resettlement Ireland, a voluntary national agency, which deals with assisting Irish urban families to move to areas of their choice in rural Ireland. Funding has been made available for major research projects in housing including, for example, the three Bacon reports on the housing market, the establishment of the housing unit, which is invaluable now, particularly to voluntary organisations and local authorities and the undertaking of the national house condition survey.</P>
    <P>The Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) (No. 2) Bill, 2001, currently before the Dáil will <Col N="83" /> increase the Housing Finance Agency's borrowing limit to &euro;6 billion and allow it lend directly to voluntary housing organisations. It will no longer need to apply to the local authority, which no longer needs to seek the approval of the Department of the Environment and Local Government. Now it can go straight to the Housing Finance Agency.</P>
    <P>Substantial increases in funding were made available for the housing management initiative to enable local authorities to fund the employment of a number of staff to work with tenants and residents groups as well as addressing the training needs of their own staff in this area. A provision of &euro;63 million was made for the serviced land initiative which will provide water and sewerage services for some 165,000 housing units. This is a completely new initiative by the Government.</P>
    <P>I introduced increases in the income limits for the shared ownership and affordable housing scheme, which is a new scheme that I introduced a few years ago. My local authority, in Galway, is making excellent use of this. Other local authorities are not using it at all. It is quite astonishing. The local authorities are the housing authorities. We lay down the policy, provide the funding and the schemes. We have laid out all that is required, down to site subsidies to help them buy the land and they are still slow to avail of some schemes. Members of both Houses on the Opposition side, who are also members of local authorities, are criticising when they should be getting more action on the ground in their own areas.</P>
    <P>I introduced increases in the income limits for all of those schemes and extended the essential repairs grant to urban areas. There are still Deputies and councillors who have not made themselves aware, by reading the local authority circulars, that this extension has taken place. The terms and conditions of the scheme have been improved, as has the disabled person's grant scheme, on several occasions since 1997. I am very proud of the disabled person's grant scheme, which I introduced in 1971 and have greatly improved over the past four and a half years. Tens of thousands of disabled people have benefited from it. I am happy to say that &euro;32 million was spent on that scheme last year.</P>
    <P>Substantial increases in funding for the various grant schemes have been provided. The provision for the special housing aid for the elderly schemes has increased from &euro;5.1 million in 1996 and this year I will provide almost &euro;12 million for that excellent scheme. The health boards and the task force have been put to the pin of their collars to keep up with the funding being made available by the Government. Their problem in many cases is in spending the money provided. Some Western Health Board areas came back for more money before the end of the year but others could not keep up with the level of funding. I want to see backlogs being cleared.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="84" />Funding for the disabled person's grant and the essential repairs grant has been increased to &euro;32 million. Funding for Traveller accommodation has increased from &euro;12 million in 1997 to &euro;23.7 million last year and will be increased further this year. The enactment of the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act, 1998 has led to the subsequent adoption by all local authorities of the five year accommodation programme to meet the existing and projected accommodation needs of Travellers in their areas. I launched a comprehensive Government strategy on adult homelessness in May 2000 and will shortly publish the preventive strategy to ensure that people leaving State care do not become homeless.</P>
    <P>The Government's record on housing speaks for itself. We have responded to the numerous and diverse challenges with a credible and wide ranging set of measures. We have adjusted and fine tuned existing policies to reflect developments and introduced new policies where we deemed they were necessary. We have provided unparalleled levels of funding. Our vigilance in the housing area is paying off. Output is up, prices have been stabilised and social housing is being delivered at record levels. The motion clearly sets out the range of actions taken by the Government in relation to housing and these actions need to continue with the support of the Seanad.</P>
    <P>With the continued support of my colleagues in Government we can deal with the current housing challenge. The country is in an economic boom. We have had a huge increase in the number of people needing homes and applying to public authorities for them. We have responded to the need for housing and the house building industry has been challenged to keep up with the funding and planning of the Government. I am happy with the work we have done and proud of the contribution we have made. Much more remains to be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. He has done laudable work in his Department in the past five years. He has brought great changes in the provision of houses, particularly in the provision of social housing. However, shortcomings remain in the provision of housing.</P>
      <P>It is rich of the Minister of State to refer continually to the two years Fine Gael spent in Government. Fianna Fáil has been in Government for the past 14 years, with the exception of the two years Fine Gael was in office. The Minister of State's party was in Government on two occasions in that period. To hear the Minister of State speak one would think all the country's housing problems arise from the fact that Fine Gael was in office for two of the past 14 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government is lucky to have been in office for the best five years in the history of the State, when money was not a problem. Nevertheless, there have been shortcomings. Why is homelessness on the increase? Why are housing waiting lists getting longer? The housing list in Cork <Col N="85" /> has doubled. A number of years ago there were 2,000 people on the housing list in Cork and there are 4,000 today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>That is because of all the jobs being created under this Government. People have come home to take up jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Minister of State's own city the number has risen from 700 to over 1,000.</P>
      <P>Why are builders worried and why is there a lack of confidence in the building industry? This is partly due to the Bacon reports and to decisions taken by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. Every local authority has adopted a housing strategy, including a requirement for all housing projects to include 20% social housing. The Government has also introduced new planning regulations. At one time planning permission remained valid for five years but now, in order to retain planning permission, a builder must have completed 50% of the work within two years. A building contractor who applies for planning permission for a parcel of land is faced with the requirements to provide 20% social housing and to complete 50% of the work within two years. Such a contractor will think twice before investing in the building of houses.</P>
      <P>Where is the accountability in relation to the provision of the 20% social housing? A local authority manager enters into a contract with a builder for the provision of an amount of social housing and a price is agreed. Is there a tendering system to decide the price of the houses? The financial arrangement is between the builder and the local authority manager. There appears to be no accountability here. The Minister of State must address this question.</P>
      <P>There is a lack of essential services. I come from a county where there is a total lack of services. In Castlebar we are still waiting for the Government to provide a sewerage system. Six months ago our local authority manager refused planning permission for 200 houses. A builder from the Minister of State's own city has applied for planning permission but it looks as if he will not get a favourable decision. Other contractors are also seeking planning permission. These projects are dependent on the provision of a sewerage system which is on the waiting list. Numerous towns in the county lack services.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister of State on his achievements. He has introduced change and put many fine things in place but we are still lacking essential facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister of State on the extra funding provided for the essential repairs grant but I ask him to look at the long list of people in County Mayo who have applied for this grant. County Mayo's funding allocation is not sufficient. The terms of the scheme should be changed. Grants are provided only to extend the life of a house to meet the needs of its elderly occupants. A number of rural houses could be <Col N="86" /> brought up to a proper standard if the terms of reference were slightly changed to allow people to spend money on repairing their parents' houses. It is ridiculous if some of these people apply for planning permission and their children are willing to provide much of the funding, but they cannot avail of the funding the Minister of State has put in place. I ask him to consider that aspect.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOFearghaillFF" hpid="Mr. Ó Fearghail Mr. Ó Fearghail">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ó Fearghail</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I am pleased to have an opportunity to contribute to the debate on this motion. He made one of the most comprehensive presentations I have heard during my term in this House, setting out a litany of real and positive achievements made by the Government in the housing area since coming into office. It has always been my philosophy that the availability of proper housing affects more than anything else the quality of life of individuals and families. It impacts directly on the health, education and employment prospects of citizens. No area of Government activity is more fundamentally important.</P>
      <P>It is necessary to emphasise, as the Minister of State did, that the Government has prioritised housing. This is evidenced by the achievements set out in his address and by the fact that during its term of office the Government established a Cabinet-led sub-committee, chaired by the Taoiseach, which is a cross-departmental team on housing. In 1999, it established the housing supply unit. These initiatives, together with the &euro;63 million serviced land initiative, the implementation of the residential density guidelines and the construction of record numbers of local authority houses, have achieved an overall output of record proportions. The facts set out by the Minister of State cannot be denied and are incontrovertible. By the end of 2002 it can be expected that more than 21,000 local authority units will have been completed. It is also clear that the implementation of the Bacon recommendations has contributed enormously to the massive reduction in house price inflation, down from 40% in 1998 to approximately 5.5% for new houses and 3.5% for second-hand properties at the end of last year.</P>
      <P>The Government's multi-annual programme to 2003, to which the Minister of State alluded, sets the objective for local authorities of 25,000 new starts. We must accept that is a tall order and it will be a challenge for local authority members throughout the country to ensure their local authorities actually deliver. In order for them to deliver, there must be a radical new approach to the task at local authority level. I suggest mirroring what has happened at national level by establishing SPCs on housing as the engine that might drive that construction programme. We need a local engine to make these things happen and to achieve the sort of levels the Minister and the Government have set out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In County Kildare we are used to building major roads and every time there is a major road <Col N="87" /> programme we are able to recruit substantial numbers of technicians, engineers and so on. However, that has not been a feature of the housing programme. Recently, in County Kildare, the number of staff employed in the housing department was the same as in the early 1990s when we were building 20 or 30 houses. That is a local management issue and the Government can help by bringing additional pressure to bear on county managers. While the better local government initiative will be tackled in the medium to long term, perhaps the recruitment and promotional aspects within the housing department need to be prioritised. We need to professionalise the housing service within local authorities.</P>
    <P>I am convinced time will show that the most significant legislation introduced by the Government was the Planning Act 2000, particularly Part 5. I recall attending a housing conference in Britain more than ten years ago, coming back and making a proposal to my Fianna Fáil colleagues on Kildare County Council that we should emulate what was being done in Edinburgh where 10% of units being built were being taken for social or affordable purposes. I recall being laughed out of court in the early 1990s. We have now reached the 20% point. I was interested in what Senator Burke said and I wonder if he is suggesting, given his reluctance in regard to the 20%, that Fine Gael in Government will renege on that initiative. I believe it is one of the most positive things that has happened.</P>
    <P>As the Minister of State said, housing strategies have been adopted in practically every part of the country by local authorities. It must also be said that adopting the housing strategy is very easy &ndash; to a certain extent, it is an academic exercise. Making it happen is the big challenge. Local authorities will have to challenge developers and builders to make this a reality. If it is to become a reality, the construction industry must buy into the fundamental concept of social integration. The benefits for society of achieving that particular objective in the medium to long term are enormous but we need the construction industry to buy into it. Once the construction industry buys in and signs up to the basic philosophy, delivering the 20% is just a design challenge. It is possible to deliver estates with a properly designed 20% element if there is goodwill on all sides.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State said much about voluntary housing. I know he has done enormous work in that area and I salute him on his achievements. The fact that there are 7,600 units currently under construction or at the planning stage is indicative of how far we have come in the past four or five years. We have seen the growth in the number of indigenous voluntary housing associations, many of which are run on a professional basis, and all are committed to building communities, not just houses. A number of British housing associations have been coming into the country and getting in on the act. I have been involved in a number of <Col N="88" /> local community-based voluntary housing associations in County Kildare &ndash; I am sure the Minister of State is aware of what has been going on there.</P>
    <P>We need to monitor carefully the development of the voluntary housing sector. It is fair to say that the main priority for people on the local authority housing list is to get a house. As soon as people are housed they have other priorities. The two principal priorities of tenants of voluntary housing associations are that they want equity and parity with local authority tenants. They want a maximum rent system and the opportunity to buy their houses. That is currently being resisted by some of the large voluntary housing associations. I understand the Government is rightly emphasising at this stage the output issue. However, we need to move beyond that and to give parity of esteem to people housed by voluntary housing associations because at the end of the day the right of people to purchase or to have parity with local authority tenants is more important than allowing voluntary housing associations build their property portfolio.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister of State on his outstanding work on behalf of the people over the last five years when there have been enormous changes in society and family make-up. There will be a continuing demand in the housing area. Meeting that demand will be one of the major challenges for the Government over the next five years. However, it has proved that it is more than up to the task.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister of State on the work he has done and the amount of money he has put into the housing area since coming into office. Travelling throughout the country one can see the number of houses being built in towns, villages and so on. Housing is a big business and it is good that so much money has been invested in that area. I particularly welcome the fact that the Government has provided local authorities with the money to buy land. If they work out the figures, pre-built houses can be obtained cheaper than buying land and building on it, and those houses are given out almost immediately. That is a great advantage and I do not think enough local authorities are availing of it.</P>
      <P>Much was said about homelessness. It can be broken down into two categories. I reckon that about 25% of homeless people suffer from psychiatric problems. Houses should be bought and converted into high-support hostels for those people, as was done by the North Western Health Board, because they are not capable of looking after themselves and they are not taking the medication that they have been prescribed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other 75% are, by and large, involved in alcohol and drug abuse. I appeal to voluntary organisations and everybody else who talks about homelessness to bear in mind that unless we deal with alcohol and drug abuse, we will always have homelessness. Many of the homeless had good <Col N="89" /> homes but their parents could not put up with them and their drug-taking habits and drinking so they had to leave and become homeless. If they were not involved in drug and alcohol abuse, they would be at home where they should be.</P>
    <P>In other cases, people are homeless because they cannot stand the fact that their parents are taking drink and drugs. Drink and drugs are the two biggest problems in this country today. Some 75% of our social problems would be solved if we could come to grips with those issues. Throwing money at the problem will not solve it. I congratulate the Minister for financing a system whereby people with the aforementioned problems can be treated. It is a medical problem, a difficult problem. I know people who have tried to give up cigarettes and were not able, which shows the strength of addiction. It is a terrible problem but it must be addressed to solve the problem of homelessness.</P>
    <P>Objectors are causing a hold-up in terms of housing. We are becoming a very selfish society. When a scheme of houses is planned, there is an objection. People who have houses do not want others to have a house. It costs a fortune to go to An Bord Pleanála, and sometimes the person has to reapply for permission. This is a terrible problem. We face this problem with regard to social housing because people are now saying &ldquo;They are not good enough to live beside us, they will devalue our houses.&rdquo;  We are all human beings. We are all just passing through this world and on the path of life nobody will ask one what kind of house one lived in. What matters is the kind of life one lived. One will not have lived a proper life if one's attitude is to be selfish and object to other people getting houses.</P>
    <P>I am annoyed with An Taisce, which is objecting to fathers and mothers giving sites to their sons and daughters to build houses on their own land. They want to bring back the extended family system, which was prevalent in this country for years. Fathers and mothers would like nothing better than to have their sons or daughters nearby. People are forced to pay up to £40,000 and £50,000 for sites miles away from their parents. We have to confront An Taisce and objectors who are giving more priority to birds and bees than human beings. We hear so much about flora and fauna, but I say continually that people are fauna. We are part of the fauna. The problem is worse now than it was in the time of the landlords 100 or 200 years ago, when they put their tenants into holes and hollows so that the gentry from England would not see where they were living. We are now doing the same thing by saying that in areas which are scenic the views cannot be spoiled. The skyline is more important than human life. This must be confronted.</P>
    <P>In my county, everyone admires Classiebawn Castle, the home of the late Lord Louis Mountbatten, and rightly so. Who would get planning permission today to build a castle on top of the hill, right by the shoreline? The hypocrisy annoys me. If William Butler Yeats or some other <Col N="90" /> famous person lived in a house 100 years ago, it has to be rebuilt because it is argued that it is part of our culture and heritage. Yet, if the son or daughter of someone living on land for generations wants to build a house on that land, he or she is denied the right to do so. We have to face up to this problem, which is being blown out of proportion by objectors.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on bringing in more planners because we had a shortage, which was causing a hold-up. Unfortunately, many of our planners, although they are very good people, are not looking at the basic problem. Again, they are more interested in hedgerows, or whins as we call them in my part of the country &ndash; they are called furze in other parts of the country. People are not allowed to open a gap in the hedgerows to build a house on the inside. The objections are absolutely ridiculous. We have to come to grips with this and face the fact that the Government is doing its best. Objectors are getting money and objecting is now a way of life for many people. A crowd is gathered to object. Then engineers and experts are paid who know much more than the Government and all the officials it and the councils employ. It is a money-making racket that must be confronted. Unless we confront it, we will not get real value from the money we are spending. Too much of it is being spent on administration etc.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on what he is doing for the disabled because they had been neglected for a long time. He is doing a good job and I wish him every success. I hope that, based on what I said, some objectors will think in a more humane manner and realise that, only for the grace of God, they could be in the same position as the people to whom they are objecting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief. I congratulate the Minister on the great work that has been done since 1997. On many occasions during the Order of Business, I remember that many Senators were sceptical about the projected figures of the Government in respect of its commitment to have buildings in place. To have 250,000 units, houses and apartments built in the past two years is outstanding. Any fair-minded Member of this House could only congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, a Deputy of long standing and a respectable Minister of great repute in many Governments down through the years. I know he was very ably assisted by the Government, particularly the Minister, Deputy Dempsey and the Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace. It is one of the great success stories of the era that was known in Ireland as the Celtic tiger. Something meaningful has been done for the people of Ireland by building all the units, and I hope this continues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Farrell has said that a son or a daughter cannot live in the parish in which he or she was born, which is not in the spirit of the Constitution in many respects. This is because the thinking in the schools that are training our plan<Col N="91" /> ners &ndash; young, energetic, good planners &ndash; is that one cannot build here or there.</P>
    <P>I hope many of the planners will take the example of Cavan County Council, particularly the Cavan county manager, Brian Johnson. He has rejuvenated the declining population in County Cavan, which was 75% in decline at one stage. If any local authority member wants to see how planning should be dealt with, particularly in rural Ireland, he or she should go to County Cavan to see how the county manger, Mr. Johnson, is doing so.</P>

      <P>This has been a very worthwhile and useful exercise. I particularly want to thank the Minister for coming into the House and enabling all of us to have a fuller understanding of what has been put in place in terms of housing provision in the past five years. It was not just that money was made available but several worthwhile initiatives have been introduced by the Minister during his term of office. Those initiatives will continue to bear fruit long after the Government will hand over to the next Administration. There is no need for me to say who I hope will be the Minister with responsibility for housing in the next Government. It would be in the best interest of the upcoming generation of Irish people that Deputy Molloy be given another term to build on the very constructive contribution he has made to housing, which was chaotic&mdash;</P>

      <P>Senator Ridge is wasting time, both hers and mine. Homelessness is one of the things that hurts us most. Year after year we have heard the problem stated without a real solution being implemented. I take great heart from the prevention strategy the Minister is now proposing to introduce. Nobody is born homeless. They are homeless when they are released from prisons without proper provision for their aftercare. They are homeless when they are let out of big mental hospitals without proper care in the community. They are homeless when there are problems in the homes into which they were born. Very often the problem for young people is not of their own making. There are reasons people are homeless and unless we analyse those reasons, tackle them and implement a package of prevention, we will continue to have homeless people on our streets. We must stop it at source and I compliment the Minister. Nobody should be released from any institution in future unless a proper package of integrated care is introduced by the relevant social services to enable people to get back to live in some kind of home again. They must not be left on the streets.</P>
      <P>I am absolutely intrigued by what Senator Burke, who I believe is a very honourable politician, said about the 20% of social housing. Is the Fine Gael Party against the principle of social integration? </P>

      <P>Having said that, I think we had an extremely useful debate. It is an issue that should be returned to repeatedly. It is not easy to address the problem of providing housing for the explosion of population that fortunately has happened in my lifetime. I grew up in Kerry when houses were deserted, people went to Liverpool and London and households died out. Now people are coming back to build houses. The system has been strained to capacity because of the success of the economy. If success is our problem, God grant us no greater problems, but God keep in office people like the Minister, Deputy Molloy, who has the intelligence, initiative and courage to tackle those problems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to see the Minister. He would not be here if he did not have positive news so I look forward to receiving it.</P>
      <P>Nobody but the Minister and his officials knows how often I have been calling for the establishment of a Garda station in Castletroy. Since the last time I raised this matter on the Adjournment and wrote to the Minister the population has grown and now far exceeds that of any large county town. It is projected to grow to 25,000. Given the confines of time, I will simply list the reasons for establishing a Garda station there. There is the high population growth and the presence of 11,000 full-time students and staff at the University of Limerick. The additional sports arena brings a tremendous amount of extra traffic to and from the campus, particularly since the 50 metre pool was opened. There is the National Technological Park, the location of high tech industry which requires support in relation to security. There are a large number of employees and businesses are often burgled.</P>
      <P>The new post-primary school in the area is now half way towards achieving its target of more than 900 students. There are currently 500 students on the campus. There are three primary schools in the area, including a new gaelscoil. It is virtually impossible to get into the schools in Castletroy because the existing population is sufficient to fill them. There is a new shopping centre whose anchor tenant is Superquinn and it is attracting large volumes of traffic. In addition, there are the financial institutions, banks and two credit unions. The amount of money passing through the area is phenomenal. There are also many hotels and an enormous amount of house building. The missing link is an efficient and properly operated Garda station.</P>
      <P>As a local councillor and a member of the governing authority of the university, I am extremely concerned for the safety and security of both residents and students. On many occasions I have spoken about the number of attacks on students in the area, something we cannot treat as of little consequence. The Minister has received letters from the university president, Roger Downer, who has highlighted the problem of attacks on students within the campus, and from the chancellor, Miriam Hederman O'Brien.</P>
      <P>In previous correspondence the point was made that the university can be serviced by gardaí in the city. Even if they were able to get to Castletroy, and they are already hard pressed, it is five miles from Henry Street to Castletroy and given the volume of traffic and the traffic gridlock there is no way a police car could get there on time. By the time the gardaí arrive, the perpetrators are long since gone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Small instances of crime &ndash; there were two burglaries this week &ndash; are happening regularly in <Col N="95" /> the area. Not all of them are reported. The people of the area, the workers, students, residents and commuters, can see no reason that there is no Garda station in Castletroy. It is not good enough to claim that the force in the city is such that it cannot be redeployed. Of course, it cannot be redeployed. I am seeking extra gardaí for the Limerick area to ensure that the city and its environs can be looked after, along with the growth area of Castletroy as a separate entity. That would relieve the pressure on gardaí in the city centre.</P>
    <P>The deterrent effect of a Garda station in Castletroy would also relieve the pressure on gardaí. On New Year's Day, there was an armed bank robbery at the AIB. That would not have happened if there had been a Garda station nearby. The station would in itself act as a deterrent. Although this is a rapidly growing area, the local authority has told me it will make a site available to the Department to have the Garda station built in the centre of Castletroy. The authority cannot hold onto the site indefinitely because there is pressure on it to provide other services.</P>
    <P>The authority has shown leadership by moving its area office to rented accommodation in the Castletroy shopping centre. It demonstrates that the area needs a facility for the consumer. It is better local government where the focus is on the consumer. The same is true with regard to the need for a Garda station.</P>
    <P>The Government is in office for almost five years and I am sure the Minister is sick of the number of times I have raised this and of all the letters I have sent. It is a waste of his officials' time to have to reply to me on a regular basis. There is another element of this issue of which the Minister might not be aware. There is a burgeoning satellite town of Castletroy, Annacotty, which has a co-op store and is undergoing huge development. An extraordinary number of people are moving into the area. Furthermore, at the junction which will be the new centre of the Castletroy area, there will be the southern ring road, which means the traffic from Dublin will come off that road and through Castletroy. There will be even more through traffic. Even with the southern ring road, there will still be the same amount of traffic going through the area because of the huge housing densities and growth in the area.</P>
    <P>This is a matter of extreme urgency. If there have to be divisional changes, which I believe is on the cards for the area, in relation to aligning the Garda divisions with the appropriate counties of Clare, Tipperary and Limerick, which makes sense, now is the time to give that commitment to Castletroy and announce a Garda station there. I ask the Minister for that because if it is not done in the lifetime of this Government, I will pursue it as a priority in the next Government with Fine Gael. Deputy Noonan, as Taoiseach, will deliver because everybody is in favour of such a practical <Col N="96" /> proposal, particularly considering renewed attacks in Limerick and other areas. A Garda station is a deterrent. It is a major missing piece of the infrastuctural jigsaw of Castletroy. From the fact that the Minister is here, I know he is bringing good news.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Senator has a particular interest in this matter and has raised the issue previously. As the Senator will appreciate, as Minister I am responsible for the overall provision of resources to the Garda Síochána while the Garda authorities are responsible for the detailed allocation of personnel and resources to individual areas.</P>
      <P>In respect of overall resources provided to the Garda, the House will be aware that since I have taken office the strength of the force has increased consistently. It has gone from a figure of 10,800 in 1997 to a current situation where the number of gardaí is in excess of 11,700. Last November I announced that I had approved the holding of a further Garda recruitment competition early this year to recruit an additional 300 Garda trainees. Recruitment already under way will bring Garda strength up to an all-time record high of 12,000 by the end of this year and the recruitment of this additional 300 Garda trainees will ensure that Garda strength is maintained at that level.</P>
      <P>The commitment to a 12,000 strong force is a key priority for the Government. It is a clear sign that the Government is delivering on its commitments to give the Garda the necessary resources to enforce the law, clamp down on anti-social behaviour and fight crime. Having delivered on the commitment of a 12,000 strong force, I am determined to maintain Garda strength at this level.</P>
      <P>As I have already stated, the Garda authorities are responsible for the detailed allocation of personnel and resources to individual areas. It is a matter for the Garda authorities, in the first instance, to decide on the deployment of Garda personnel and how the force should be organised. This is how it should be. The Garda authorities are best placed to make these decisions. Where the Garda authorities seek new stations or the refurbishment of existing ones it is my job as Minister to see to it that adequate resources are provided.</P>
      <P>Since 1997 in excess of 20 new stations have been built or are under construction. Some 37 have been refurbished and a further 16 are currently being addressed. In addition, two major complexes have been built, namely the Templemore accommodation and theatres and the Talbot Complex in Santry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda occupy some 703 Garda stations and other units of accommodation around the country including married quarters, large complexes like Templemore and Garda Headquarters and a variety of smaller units. Many of the buildings occupied by them were built before the <Col N="97" /> foundation of the State and were designed for a different era. This extensive resource, while invaluable in guaranteeing the provision of police services to the community, creates its own unique maintenance and refurbishment demands. Consequently all Garda accommodation is continually under review to ensure it meets the operational requirements of the force. Where it does not, the necessary works are prioritised and completed with the appropriate degree of urgency to ensure, as far as is feasible, the ordered, timely and economically efficient construction or major refurbishment of Garda stations, as policing requirements demand and overall priorities allow.</P>
    <P>The Senator asks about the provision of a Garda Station in Castletroy. I have previously raised this issue with the Garda authorities and have been informed by them that, while acknowledging that Castletroy is a developing area with a large student population, they are of the view that the current policing needs are best addressed by providing resources from Henry Street Garda Station.</P>

      <P>The Minister has stated the Garda authorities are of the view that the current policing needs are best addressed by providing resources from Henry Street Garda station. My understanding is that if there were additional resources for the Limerick area, which is at least 100 gardaí down from previously, there would be no problem. It is a chicken and egg situation. The gardaí in the area recognise the need. It would relieve their problems in the city area by not having to address the problems in the Castletroy area, which has 25,000 people. Compare it to Clonmel or any large county town and they have 50 gardaí at least.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It was obviously re-jigged somewhere along the line. This was specifically addressed to the Taoiseach because it relates to him specifically. Obviously the Department of the Taoiseach changed it and sent it over to the Department of Public Enterprise. It is despicable behaviour on the part of the Taoiseach and his Department that they have not come to this House to account for themselves in relation to the actions they have taken in the past seven weeks on aviation matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An interdepartmental group was set up following the 11 September tragedy to investigate and report because of the fall out in relation to Shannon Airport where there will be 700,000 fewer passengers this year. This will have a massively negative impact on the tourism industry and other industries along the west coast. The Taoiseach has cynically used this tragedy to get his agenda completed which is to proceed with pier D in Dublin Airport. The interdepartmental group was pulled together and they reported, just as the Taoiseach wished them to, with recommendations that he specifically required. When this report was put to Aer Rianta it was found not to be a viable economic proposition, given that there was surplus terminal capacity at Shan<Col N="99" /> non Airport. Aer Rianta had proposed to go down that route in relation to low cost airlines.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, not satisfied with that and having been refused by Aer Rianta, went a step further. It was his Department, not the Department of Public Enterprise, that employed the aviation expert in the person of Professor Rigas Doganis, a London based aviation expert of Greek origin who was sent to make the report. It is interesting to note from his report that what he was given was the recommendations of the interdepartmental group upon which he was asked to comment, summarise and assess. It was geared in a specific direction to conclude with a recommendation to go ahead with pier D at Dublin Airport.</P>
    <P>I wish the Taoiseach was here to answer questions. Why did he not accept the expert advice from the aviation section of the Department of Public Enterprise? It was clearly reticent about proceeding with pier D. Why did he reject the advice of Aer Rianta, the body responsible for managing the three State airports? Why did he and his Cabinet not accept Aer Rianta's advice to use Shannon Airport as a hub for low-cost airlines? Does the Taoiseach feel he has a divine right to ram through Cabinet anything on his wish list? That is how it appears. The Taoiseach has only to click his fingers and his Cabinet will row in behind him. As the Government is facing an election he can do what he likes.</P>
    <P>This decision by Government is not in the national interest and it is appalling that the west should be so badly affected. The Taoiseach and his Government have made a decision that will bring further numbers to Dublin and expand its airport's capacity. That will lead to greater congestion and mayhem than already exist, leaving the west denuded of tourists and Shannon Airport operating at half capacity. That is not in the national interest.</P>
    <P>One might be cynical in suggesting that the Taoiseach is serving a vested interest. The vested interest he appears to be serving is that of Michael O'Leary and Ryanair. It is interesting that Michael O'Leary and his cohorts attended the Taoiseach's fund-raising dinner in rather large numbers some time ago. It is now payback time from the Taoiseach's point of view, but it is a despicable way to proceed. It is appalling that the Taoiseach has not come here this evening to address this issue and to face and answer honestly the questions I have. He does not have the courage to do so. He is facing an election, therefore he decides to keep the corporate sector happy so that it will support his party with contributions and he will get re-elected. That is obviously his ambition, but it is a very cynical exercise. It is appalling that such a decision can be made against regional and national interests. I hope he will have the courage at some future date to come before this House to answer the questions I have asked this evening.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="100" />Undoubtedly, the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, for whom I have the highest respect, has been sent here with a script which has been directed from the Taoiseach's Department to the Department of Public Enterprise. From the way that the Minister for Public Enterprise acquitted herself last night on television, anybody could see she was none too happy with the way she was over-ruled by the Taoiseach on this issue and with the way the advice of her Department was ignored. There are questions to be answered. I go further and say that this matter should be properly investigated by a committee of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>The Government, at its meeting yesterday, decided to publish the report prepared by Professor Rigas Doganis on Irish aviation and tourism issues for an interdepartmental group chaired by the Taoiseach's Department. The report was placed on the website of the Department of Public Enterprise yesterday afternoon and is available publicly. The interdepartmental group was established last year to examine the possibilities of encouraging additional travel by air and of increasing visitor numbers following the terrorist incidents in the USA last September. Apart from the Taoiseach's Department, the group included representatives of the Department of Public Enterprise, the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources, the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation, the Department of Finance, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Office of the Attorney General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Professor Doganis, an internationally renowned expert on aviation matters, was engaged by the Taoiseach's Department to provide an independent, expert view to the interdepartmental group in its consideration of possible strategies to reduce the impact on the Irish aviation and tourism sectors following the downturn in these important sectors as a result of the terrorist attacks. In its consideration of possible strategies, the group and Professor Doganis had <Col N="101" /> regard to the position of all three State airports, including Shannon Airport.</P>
    <P>In its decision yesterday the Government noted the principal conclusions and recommendations of the Doganis report on aviation and tourism issues and the endorsement by the report of the independent airport charges regulatory regime &ndash; already in operation &ndash; established by the Minister for Public Enterprise under the Aviation Regulation Act 2001. It agreed that the following actions should be taken. The Minister for Public Enterprise is to ask Aer Rianta to proceed immediately with the provision at the earliest possible date of a rapid turn-around facility at Dublin Airport, having particular regard to the planning permission already secured for the proposed pier D, to meet the specific needs of all carriers operating at the lower fares end of the market. The Minister is to monitor closely this project to ensure that Aer Rianta provides the facility at the lowest possible cost, takes full account of the needs of the low fares carriers and has the facility operational in good time for the 2003 season. The Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation is to ask Tourism Ireland limited to report to him on the existing consultative arrangements with the air carriers with a view to ensuring a greater degree of co-ordination and co-operation in marketing existing and new services to airports among it, the carriers and Aer Rianta. The Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation is to continue to highlight the need for accommodation providers and other tourism industry interests to improve price competitiveness to boost prospects for the 2002 season.</P>
    <P>In relation to facilities at the State airports, the Government noted that Dublin Airport has the capacity to cater for a resumption of normal traffic growth and that, while facilities at Cork Airport are already stretched, Aer Rianta is proceeding rapidly with its plans for a new, expanded terminal to deal with traffic growth. Shannon Airport, on the other hand, has ample terminal capacity, but has been more directly affected by the events of 11 September. Recovery of traffic levels at Shannon will depend largely upon the return of confidence among American travellers, a greater focus by the airport on security, more business travellers and a greater emphasis by the airport on securing business from the United Kingdom and continental Europe.</P>
    <P>The Government decision reflects the views expressed in the Doganis report that our tourism authorities, as well as Aer Rianta, have an important role to play in the drive to boost incoming tourists numbers. In this regard, the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation will continue to highlight the need for improved price competitiveness among accommodation providers and other tourism sector interests. The Minister will also seek to ensure a greater degree of co-ordination and co-operation in marketing <Col N="102" /> activities for existing and new air services at the State airports, including Shannon Airport, among Tourism Ireland, the carriers and Aer Rianta.</P>
    <P>In conjunction with marketing and promotional efforts abroad by the relevant authorities, Professor Doganis expressed broad support for Aer Rianta's expanded incentive scheme for the development of new routes at Shannon and Cork Airports. As the Senator will be aware Aer Rianta is offering zero airport charges for four years to carriers who develop new routes from Shannon and Cork and the company will also provide marketing support for route development promotional activities. Professor Doganis believes this scheme may encourage carriers to launch new services earlier than otherwise planned.</P>
    <P>Aer Rianta has recently announced a range of new services from Shannon which are scheduled to start this year. These include a new Air Canada service from Toronto to Shannon and Dublin to start on 1 June, a Skynet service from Shannon to Dublin and Warsaw starting on 16 April and a Ryanair service from Shannon to Paris which will commence on Thursday of next week.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Public Enterprise has asked me to emphasise again that Government policy in relation to transatlantic services at Shannon Airport remains unchanged. Indeed the Government confirmed the continuation of the policy in relation to transatlantic services at Shannon in the context of its consideration of the difficult financial situation at Aer Lingus.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
