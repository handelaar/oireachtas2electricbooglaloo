      <P>I have received notice from Senator Avril Doyle that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to outline the reasons for the delay in the Food Safety Authority of Ireland's scientific sub-committee risk assessment report on the potential hazards of having infant formula reconstituted with fluoridated water; and also the delay in the publication of the final report of the Department of Health and Children's forum on fluoridation.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by the Senator as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business is No. 1, motion re third country nationals and stateless persons, returned from the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, to be taken without debate; No. 2, Pensions (Amendment) Bill, 2001 &ndash; Committee Stage; and No. 18, motion 17, to be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. Business will be interrupted from 1.30 p.m. to 2.30 p.m.</P>

      <P>I asked the Leader yesterday about school supervision and he assured me that we could have full confidence in the Minister for Education and Science and that all would be well &ndash; in fact, one of the Leader's colleagues assured me on that as the Leader was slightly reticent on the subject. It is clear this morning, from listening to the leader of the parents' group involved, that no plans are in place, that schools are facing <Col N="194" /> chaos and that, if people are recruited, there will be a legacy of bad feeling. We are facing chaos, yet the Minister is blithely assuring the country that all is well. Will the Leader ask the Minister to come to the House, as was requested yesterday, to face questions on what measures are in place, what are the proposals and to consider if steps could be taken to resolve a dispute that can be resolved?</P>
      <P>I seek a debate on the role of the media as I was very taken yesterday by what I heard while listening to RTÉ reports on the JNLR listenership figures. At the top of the news in each bulletin was the claim that RTÉ programmes were in the &ldquo;top ten&rdquo;. It was only when I read this morning's newspapers that I realised almost every RTÉ programme has lost listeners over the period in question. My concern is not about which company lost or won. However, we expect news and not spin from a national news service. What we got yesterday from RTÉ was spin and propaganda about its performance dressed up as news. We expect that journalists and newscasters detect spin, sniff it out and ignore it; we do not expect them to propagate spin in their own interests. If they cannot be objective about themselves, how can we expect them to be objective about the rest of us?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole:</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised yesterday on the Order of Business the need for greater contact with the European Commission, a matter I have raised countless times before. Yesterday, we again saw evidence that there is a two-tier club within the Commission. Certain small countries, and Ireland in particular, have borne the brunt of criticism. Irish economic, financial and budgetary policies seem to count for less with the Commission than those of larger countries. I appeal to the Leader to ask the Minister for Finance to come to the House to explain how Members should explain this to a doubting public.</P>
      <P>What was done yesterday, apart from proving that there is a two-tier Commission, also undermines the euro. The Commission has not worked according to its rules and regulations and we may all suffer due to the vanity of the larger nations, the lack of commitment in the Commission and the absence of fair and equitable treatment for all members of the EU. It is creating a difficulty for us. We should continue the process, as recommended by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, which has been considering the issue. I ask the Leader to allow time for a debate on the matter as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan:</NameTxt>
      <P>As a parent of a leaving certificate student I blissfully accepted that there would not be disruption. The ASTI has gone to great lengths to avoid being disruptive and made its position clear. The assurances of the Minister, however, are becoming more transparent and it is urgent that he come into the House and explain the precise nature of his contingency plans. Senator O'Toole has raised a fundamental issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="195" />We should examine the code of practice we operate when debating sensitive issues, particularly race, in Irish society. I live in a city that has not had its reputation added to by the behaviour of a certain individual. All of us in politics have a responsibility to avoid seeking cheap headlines. The media also has a responsibility to avoid allowing itself to be used by cheap headline seekers and an obligation to ensure that those who stand up for decency are not squeezed out in the rush for extremist headlines.</P>
    <P>Speaking of extremism, I call for a debate on international law, particularly international jurisdiction. Sadly, the university in my city is running a commercial event at which the international mass murderer, Henry Kissinger, will be the number one guest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan:</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a convincing case that he is responsible for the deaths of at least two million individuals. The fact that he appeals to some people in this House is not my fault.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to see the &ldquo;compo&rdquo; culture included in any debate about insurance. Last night's edition of &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; reported that up to 50% of claims for compensation are spurious and are backed up by the medical and legal professions. It is a disgrace. The ordinary punters, small businessmen and young people trying to get insurance are paying the bill, not the insurance companies or the State. There should be a serious debate about behaviour. There should be a tribunal to investigate the Four Courts and what goes on in them because there is more criminality there than justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the conversion of Senator Ryan to plain speaking in the House. When I described Mr. Mugabe as a dictator, he said it was unparliamentary language and insisted I withdraw the remark.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator now describes Henry Kissinger as a mass murderer and, of course, he is perfectly right. Kissinger was complicit in the murder of a large number of people, the bombing of Kampuchea&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Chair would prefer if the Senator would use less emotive language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair might have thought of directing such instructions towards Senator Ryan as well. I stand reproved from time to time in the House for using mild expressions but I would like to state that this gentleman was clearly complicit in the invasion of East Timor, an issue on which every section of the House agrees, and Senator Ryan's point is valid. It is time we told the truth plainly and bluntly, although always obeying the judgment of the Chair.</P>

      <P>This has nothing whatsoever to do with the Order of Business. Has the Senator a question for the Leader of the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader specify a date on which he would be prepared to take No. 18, motion 16, which concerns West Papua? Last week, he kindly indicated that he would arrange for this debate to be held but will he provide us with some kind of timescale?</P>
      <P>No. 18, motion 19, highlights the point that despite the fact that there have been cosmetic rises in eligibility limits for access to civil legal aid, because of other attendant circumstances which I have specified in the motion, they do not assist the most vulnerable people. When will the Leader provide time for that debate?</P>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Government when it proposes to introduce amending legislation in this House governing the rules of criminal responsibility &ndash; the McNaughten rules &ndash; and the question of the &ldquo;guilty but insane&rdquo; plea? The attention of both Houses has been drawn by the courts to this gap in legislation. Great distress is being caused to accused persons, the victims and their families because of the lack of action in the Oireachtas. I would like us to consider if we can do something about this matter.</P>
      <P>I support what Senator Manning said about the media, although I have great regard for RTE. I wonder if the Leader, Senator Manning and the House generally would agree to expand such a debate to include all media, including the press? We do not have a press council so an individual whose reputation is traduced by the media has virtually no recourse. Irish newspapers have been taken over by the English gutter press, English editors have been parachuted in and journalists have been instructed to leave the National Union of Journalists, so there is no NUJ code to which one can appeal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris:</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor:</NameTxt>
      <P>While I will not rush to judgment on Henry Kissinger, there is no international criminal court in place where anyone, such as Dr. <Col N="197" /> Kissinger, who might be arraigned, could be tried. This is because Ireland is one of the countries that has so far failed to ratify an international treaty to establish such a court. Will the Leader ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform when the relevant legislation will be introduced? It would be ideal to initiate such legislation in this House.</P>
      <P>I wish to raise the issue of the recent appalling weather conditions which have caused widespread damage. Notwithstanding No. 17 on the Order Paper, it is time for a debate on what has happened in the midlands in recent weeks where massive inundation of land has occurred. Thousands of acres have become waterlogged and millions of euro in income have been lost by the farming community. A debate on this issue would be appropriate in light of the Government's prompt attention to the problems in the North Wall and East Wall areas of Dublin where many houses were flooded. Equality should apply to all citizens. If compensation is available for citizens of Dublin, and rightly so, then such a compensation package should be contemplated for people in the midlands, bordering the Shannon basin, who have suffered severe losses yet again. The Leader should arrange an early debate on this issue. There is no point having such a debate when the floods have subsided and the problem will be seen, at least by some people, to have gone away. The debate should take place this or next week.</P>

      <P>Last year, the Minister for Finance stood steadfastly against what I would regard as questionable pressure from Europe regarding our internal affairs. Recently, he has been proved correct. The bigger EU member states seem to believe that they can bend the rules when their interests are at stake. I get the impression there is a certain envy abroad regarding Ireland's economic progress. It would be appropriate for the Leader to arrange a debate on this matter now and the Minister for Finance should attend it. He has certainly proved to be a match for those people who do not want to play according to the rules.</P>

      <P>Last week, Senator Keogh and I raised concerns about the availability of the morning-after pill in Ireland and what effect the proposed referendum may have on its availability. I asked then if the Minister for Health and Children could attend the House to discuss the issue. The Leader kindly said he would try to make that possible. In view of the fact that Dr. Tom O'Dowd, professor of general practice in Trinity College, has queried the effect of this legislation in the proposed referendum on doctor-patient confidentiality, I ask the Leader to put this matter higher up on the agenda and inquire whether the Minister will come to the House next week to address the issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on the subject of rural decline and decentralisation. One of the ways to stymie the decline in rural Ireland and to halt the closure of post offices and small rural shops is to have more decentralisation. Successive Governments have paid lip service to the decentralisation of Departments. In my county one must travel 110 miles to meet a planner or even to pay tax. It is about time the Department of the Environment and Local Government took action on decentralisation. Everything seems to emanate from the Pale. There should be decentralisation to the rest of the country as a matter of urgency and it is about time action was taken on this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd:</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to arrange a debate in the presence of the Minister for Health and Children on the subject of how mental health services can be improved and to highlight the concern in many communities at the increasing number of suicides and the increasing number of people who are in despair and are not receiving help. The health boards should set up task forces to deal with the issue of improving mental health services in the community. There should be outreach facilities to help in the prevention of these terrible tragedies which shock the whole community. We need to do a lot more about this issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney:</NameTxt>
      <P>Once again the long-suffering rail commuter on the Dublin-Sligo line has had to experience medieval conditions as reported in the newspapers. The ongoing media campaign being carried out by Iarnród Éireann tells us about the brave new world of railways. This may be the case in the Pale, as Senator O'Donovan said, but it certainly is not happening in the outer reaches of this country. I ask that the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, come to this House for a debate on rail investment. I fully appreciate that she is not responsible for the day-to-day operations of the rail system, but as the Minister responsible for overall policy and for the massive Government investment in rail networks, it would be helpful for the House and for the wider public if she outlined the specifics of that investment programme. It would provide balance to the obvious propaganda of Iarnród Éireann which tells us that it is doing all this work &ndash; I have no doubt it is &ndash;  but certainly it is not happening on the ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle:</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator O'Toole's request that the Minister for Finance come into the House to explain not just to this House but to a rather sceptical public the apparent difference in treatment of Germany compared to Ireland in recent days by ECOFIN and by the Commission in terms of budgetary matters. There are differences in the two cases but most people do not engage in what is happening in Europe and the few who do are completely confused by the signals that are coming. In the context of the <Col N="199" /> review and the reform for which I commend this House, to use this esteemed Chamber to get our Commissioners and our Ministers to bring us all into the loop and to answer for decisions in Europe would be one of the most worthwhile ways in which we could look at the review of this House.</P>
      <P>Like all public representatives, I fully respect the right of the legitimate withdrawal of services in any industrial action when the case is a just one. On the matter of the secondary school teachers issue, I understand that there are major problems at second level. I ask the Leader to ask if there is any method whereby the teachers might exempt examination students from the industrial action. I plead with them to exempt junior certificate and especially leaving certificate students from their legitimate industrial action because, regardless of what the Minister says, there will be a huge supervision problem.</P>
      <P>I support the comments on mental health expressed by my colleague, Senator O'Dowd. The Government is sending a serious message on mental health in the context of the forthcoming referendum on abortion. Apparently it proposes not to believe genuinely suicidal women that they have a psychiatric problem in this area&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle:</NameTxt>

      <P>As one who has had different experiences of the quality of service provided by Iarnród Éireann, I was taken aback by its advertising campaign. This morning I travelled from Thurles in an unheated railway carriage and I laughed with irony when told of the massive investment in the company. There is little or no investment in the Ballybrophy to Limerick railway line&mdash;</P>

      <P>I support a call for a debate on the details of Iarnród Éireann's investment project. I have provided an example and I ask the Leader to broaden any debate to consider regional development in view of the call by SFADCo to extend a railway line to Shannon Airport. Despite what Iarnród Éireann says, the provision of 50 rail carriages nationwide does not amount to massive investment.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Manning's request that the Minister for Education and Science come to the House as a matter of urgency to advise us on what is happening regarding the teachers' dispute. I ask the Leader to request the attendance in the House of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to debate the breakdown of law and order throughout the country. All Members are aware of street violence and acts of murder at weekends. It is laughable that the Minister should have used the phrase &ldquo;zero tolerance&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>According to a report in this morning's newspapers, 75% of all insurance claims are false. Surely the legal authorities have a responsibility to ensure that they are not brought before the courts. Much more importantly, jobs are being lost because of increases in insurance premiums. It is important that the Leader arranges the attendance in the House of the relevant Minister to debate this very serious issue. Surely some people are accountable for what is happening.</P>

      <P>Senators Manning, O'Toole, Ryan, Avril Doyle and Burke called on the Minister for Education and Science to update the House on the dilemma facing the Department and the ASTI. I will endeavour to arrange this debate. Senator Manning and Senator Norris requested a debate on the role of the media, especially with regard to the new JNLR survey and the spin put on the events of yesterday, as outlined by Senator Manning.

      <P>I will endeavour to ensure a debate takes place at the earliest opportunity. I have always believed that there should be a press council, including for the 11 years I was the Fianna Fáil spokesperson on communications. Such a council must ensure that people are accountable and if the truth is not told, sanctions should be imposed on those in the media who are culpable in the same manner as they are imposed in other walks of life. I will take the Senator's request on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have come to know and have much experience of the media and if one pontificates the negative all the time, people will switch off and turn away. That is what is happening to the media on the airwaves. People have an alternative and will switch to something that is uplifting. As a small nation we are an example to the world in terms <Col N="201" /> of what we have done. From 1987 to date, all Governments and all parties&mdash;</P>

I congratulate the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, as I did on a previous occasion, on his sound, solid stance. One cannot beat a professional being in charge of a portfolio. He has proved that he knew his business.</P>
      <P>When the matter is reviewed later today, in the event of progress being made, I will endeavour to get agreement, as a matter of urgency, with the leaders and the Whips to have the banking and financial issue discussed by the House tomorrow.

I will discuss this with the leaders, the Whips and perhaps the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. Senator Farrell and Senator Dino Cregan called for a debate on the insurance industry. I will make time available for such a debate, as I said yesterday.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris asked about No. 18, motions 16 and 19. I have already given a commitment on these issues. I am keeping them foremost in mind, but legislation must take precedence and an enormous amount of legislation is being initiated here. I shall endeavour to arrange the debates at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
      <P>Senator Connor asked for a debate on the flooding in the midlands, the East Wall area of Dublin and elsewhere. Not since 1924 have rainfalls been as heavy or caused so much damage. I share the Senator's views and will endeavour to have this matter debated during the Private Members' time of one of the parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Henry requested an explanation from the Minister for Health and Children. The Minister clarified the position regarding the morning-after pill at length in the House and on radio this <Col N="202" /> morning. He firmly rejected it out of hand. That is clarification enough in regard to the Senator's proposal.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Donovan called for a debate on Government decentralisation. He particularly wants decentralisation in the area in which he resides. I agree that many areas are in urgent need of it. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government has started off the process in County Meath and many other counties have taken up the system where local authorities introduce their own decentralisation by having one-stop-shops in each electoral area. We have them in County Westmeath. The services include motor taxation and driving licences and the planning officer is on duty full-time. It creates jobs and services for people in the locality which means they no longer have to make journeys of 70, 80 or 100 miles.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Dowd and Senator Avril Doyle expressed grave concerns about the mental health services. I will pass on their views to the Minister for Health and Children. Senators Mooney and O'Meara called on my colleague, the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, to take part in a debate on the rail services. The Minister gave a very full account of investment and progress in the railways the second last time she appeared before the House, and I will endeavour to receive an up-date on that matter. While I fully agree that much needs to be done, there has been major investment in the railways since 1997 and it continues.</P>
    <P>Senator Burke called for a debate on law and order in towns and villages. I fully agree with his comments. The major benefit of one-stop-shops will be that regulations, particularly those issued by local authorities, will be stricter and more strictly enforced, notably where planning permission is given to restaurants and late night facilities. A great deal of undesirable activity takes place when people returning from late night entertainment venues get together at 3 a.m., 4 a.m. or sometimes even 5 a.m. Things go wrong and sometimes get out of hand. Many of these establishments do not have planning permission to open at these hours. Perhaps we will be able to include the issue in a future debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and ask for the indulgence of the Cathaoirleach to allow me to make a few comments which will, I hope, put the rest of the debate in context. This Bill was introduced on the first day of the last session. There has been a very long interval between the end of Second Stage debate and production of the amendments, which has caused a degree of frustration on this side of the House.</P>
      <P>I realise the Bill has genuine all-party support. It is very much in the national interest and I am aware there has been a wide degree of consultation between the Minister's Department and the various professional bodies. The annoyance on this side of the House arose because the Bill was published without being fully ready and since then the Department has been catching up on sections and changing sections in consultation. I have no problem with consultation but it took a great deal of pressure from us to finally get the amendments and we have not had sufficient time for people who are non-experts to go through all the amendments. I want to be fully supportive of the Bill, however, and to co-operate in its speedy passage through the House.</P>
      <P>I understand further major changes will be made on Report Stage, and the Minister will agree with me that bringing in major changes for the first time on Report Stage is not good parliamentary practice. I realise we are coming to the end of this Parliament and that those on all sides of the House would like to see this Bill on the Statute Book before the end of the Parliament. I will not be difficult today so as far as I possibly can I will help the Minister to get the Bill through the House. It will not be our fault, therefore, if it does not appear on the Statute Book before the end of the session.</P>

      <P>The Minister will be aware that I caused a vote on a number of occasions because of the tardiness of the Bill coming through the House. More than most I recognise that the legislation is complex and I confirm that the levels of consultation on it are almost unprecedented. I compliment and thank the Minister and his officials on that because what has come forward has an enormous level of agreement at all levels. <Col N="204" /> I am strongly of the view that this legislation should be enacted in the course of this Parliament and I do not intend to slow down the process in any way during the course of the day.</P>
      <P>I have reservations about one or two issues which have been raised with the Minister in consultation with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and others, but I wish to see the legislation go through the House as quickly as possible. I am concerned also about major changes on Report Stage, not just because of the practical difficulties but in case it raises new issues. However, I am supportive of getting the legislation through the House as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators for their remarks. A commitment was made in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to publish this legislation within a certain timescale and while I was not part of the negotiations, I had some input in relation to it and we know now that the forecast for that timescale was probably too optimistic. This is probably one of the most complex legislative measures to come before this Dáil or previous Dálaí. I appreciate the difficulties Deputies experienced in terms of the amendments and I thank them for their forbearance. Some people will say the legislation was not totally ready but it was published in that way because the social partners put extreme pressure on us to show cause in relation to the commitments made in the PPF. We then undertook to release the Bill in various tranches. I am not blaming the parliamentary counsel's office but there was other urgent legislation that tended to take precedence from time to time.</P>
      <P>The Government has always put a high priority on this legislation, however, and I thank the Deputies for their comments about getting it passed prior to the election on the basis that it has all-party agreement. It is unfortunate that some amendments will be brought forward on Report Stage. Many of those arose from further consultation that took place. When I published the original draft of the Bill I stated publicly on many occasions to all the partners involved that we would be willing to take on board representations for amendments to the Bill. It was stated that representations would be dealt with in an open manner and about 500 such representations were made as a result of the process. We endeavoured to explain as much as possible to the various groups that contacted us. I thank Senators for their sentiments.</P>

The emphasis in this legislation is to try to set up a new system of pensions apart from existing systems.

      <P>The legislation will require that a statement of reasonable projection will have to be provided by actuaries, but that each contributor will also be entitled to a statement of the value of the assets they have at a particular time. This is looking into the future but the PRSA provider will also be obliged to provide a statement of the value of the assets that the person has in the pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should expand on this. When statements of reasonable projection, which are off the top of the head forecasts, are embodied in legislation, are they binding on anybody? Do they have any value in relation to the actuary? If statements of reasonable projection had been made three weeks ago, they would not <Col N="215" /> look like statements of reasonable projection today, given the value of many assets. They are usually based on certain assumptions, one of which is that the value of assets goes up. I have never seen a statement of reasonable projection which does not assume that the value of assets of this sort, particularly pension assets, will rise in the long term.</P>
      <P>Is there any point giving status to these statements when they do not seem to be of any value? Will the Minister tell us on what assumptions these statements will be based? Are we leaving them in the hands of actuaries whose accuracy at predicting the future is no better than mine, the Minister's or a man walking up a wall? What is the point of these things, what is their value and why are they being enshrined in legislation in this way?</P>
      <P>I suspect that they are in many cases misleading. They give the impression that something is about to happen because they come from people who aspire to a science that does not exist, but they cannot reasonably bind anybody. In other words, these statements are meaningless because they are not binding on anybody in any sense. What is their value if they are not binding?</P>

      <P>Unlike Senator Ross, I do not come from a financial background. However, this measure will give additional information to an individual with no direct knowledge of the PRSA and who would previously have handed over anything related to pensions to others. If those with pensions get regular information in lay man's terms and readable language, they will be better informed. That is what this amendment is about and I support it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment puts in place something that is not there at the moment in relation to reasonable projection. It is for the information of the contributor so that the contributor can see whether the amount of money they are putting into a pension will be sufficient to sustain them when they retire. They will be able to build on their contributions if that is required. I accept that the measure is not binding but it is a benefit to the contributor.</P>
      <P>I refer Senator Ross to section 114, which I am proposing to insert as one of the group of sections I mentioned earlier. That section relates to general disclosure and says that a PRSA provider will give a statement of account in relation to a number of issues, including the total contributions credited to the contributor, a statement of account differentiating between the contributions paid by the employee and those paid by his or her employer and a statement of account in relation to the value of the PRSA on the date of publication of the statement, etc. There are significant disclosure obligations laid out in the legislation but this is an added look to the future measure for a contributor. It is a help rather than a hindrance for the contributor.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not clear about the point of this measure. I am in total agreement with the Minister about the benefits of transparency and of a valuation and facts being issued to a contributor any time he or she may want them. However, these statements of reasonable projection are dependent on the value of underlying assets. Is that not what we are talking about? One cannot make a reasonable projection unless one assumes that certain underlying assets will be worth something in the future. To put this in plain language, this relates to an estimate of the value of those assets in the future and the income that will come from them. That is what I am assuming although it is not clear from what the Minister said.</P>
      <P>The Minister may correct me if I am wrong but there is a real danger that these statements of reasonable projection, enshrined in law and with credible sounding names or titles, will be utterly misleading and wrong. Far from giving facts, they may actually tell someone that they will get something in the future. That could be very misleading and I want to know the underlying assumptions made by the Minister in relation to this and what is seen as acceptable in terms of underlying assumptions and if those assumptions are wrong. It may not be deliberately misleading, but it will be misleading nonetheless.</P>
      <P>We are talking about people who, as Senator Leonard rightly said, are not familiar with the movement of assets and financial dealings of this sort and people who will clutch at straws when they are told that they can expect something in the future. They will take such statements as gospel although the statements are just anybody's guess. If statements of reasonable projection had been made three weeks ago, they would be so wide of the mark now that people would claim they had been misled.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister will reassure me because making statements about the value of underlying assets is not an exact science; it is very dangerous. The Irish Stock Exchange is down 22% this year, but no one would have made a statement of reasonable projection forecasting that position. Every expert forecast that the assets would increase. Last year, the same market was down 5.7%. Any statement of reasonable projection would have suggested these assets would go up in that time, but they decreased by 25%. What will be done for the PRSA holder who is told a reasonable projection is a rise of 10% to 15%, but there is a fall of 25%? That is a difference of 40%. That is not a reasonable projection; it is haywire. How can these statements be of any value if they can be so wrong?</P>

I cannot understand why the Senator is being negative about giving more information to individuals so they can make their own decisions on their own contributions. If a statement of reasonable projection is given over a couple of years and it is obvious to the person that all these reasonable projections have not performed in the way forecast, then it would be up to him to change from that pension and make alternative arrangements. That is better than my experience of dealing with pensioners who put money aside, did not think about it until they retired and then found there was not enough money. Is it not better that they are given a year by year indication of how things are going so they will be able to make alternative arrangements or additional contributions?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is correct. It is better that they should be aware of the state of their funds and assets and if they should make further contributions. That is not the argument &ndash; perhaps the Minister is missing the point. That is the past. A person can look at it and say he has done badly and should put more money in, or that he has done well and does not need to put so much <Col N="218" /> in, but the Minister has not provided evidence that these forecasters are any better than someone taking a random guess. He is giving these forecasters great status. &ldquo;Actuaries&rdquo; is a grand word. None of us has actuarial qualifications so we think they have some kind of mystique. There is no mystique. The evidence is the opposite.</P>
      <P>Pension fund managers are consistently underperforming the market. It is absurd to give them this status. The Minister said &ldquo;if the experts forecast. . .&rdquo;, but there are no experts in this market except self-appointed experts who fool everyone, including, unfortunately, the Minister, that somehow they have an expertise in a science which enables them to outperform anyone else. In effect we are giving status to underperformers.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister help me by producing evidence that this expertise has, does and will assist people with their investments, that these people outperform the markets or have something to offer pensioners? Pension funds in Ireland fell over the past two years through bad investment. The forecasters said they would be up at the beginning of the year. Are these the people we are putting in charge of making forecasts in the new PRSA? Could I have the evidence that shows there is any benefit from giving these people any status of this sort?</P>

      <P>The Senator has a jaundiced view of actuaries and experts. I have some experience of dealing with actuaries and, generally, their forecasts are conservative. No one can foresee the future. We are trying to be of assistance to the consumer by giving some indication of what people who deal daily in this area have as regards their future. Obviously, the consumer does not have a clue and it is preferable for us to do something like this rather than leave it out. To delete it would mean in effect that, other than the normal disclosure, people would not get any indication of what they have in their pension fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards life policies, I like to see that what is being suggested will be the outcome. Sometimes it is the case that the outturn will not be as good as predicted, but these indications are not binding and are there only for the assistance of the consumer. It is better to have them included than not. This was specifically sought by the var<Col N="219" /> ious interests in the national pensions policy initiative, including the social partners, who asked for this type of disclosure. I was fully in favour of those proposals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have great sympathy with the point being made by Senator Ross. There is a mystique surrounding many fund managers whose activities could do with far greater scrutiny that at present, given their performance. Wearing his other hat, Senator Ross may be able to help us achieve that. The Minister is living in the real world, however, and must deal with what is there.</P>
      <P>I welcome greater openness but I would be happier if a group of fund managers engaged J.P. McManus or Dermot Desmond to advise them on future investments. Comparing the results of what they invested with what some of the fund managers invested I would feel more confident, if not quite as secure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross:</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a warning on many advertisements for pension funds which states that &ldquo;past performance is no guide to future return&rdquo;. Basically, that is saying one cannot tell anything from history in terms of fund management, and that is correct. I suppose one cannot foretell anything from history when one looks at it in an absolute sense. It is important to examine this science and ask questions in the light of recent events. The past few weeks have not been exceptional; such things have happened before.</P>
      <P>There have been two particularly dramatic events on the Irish Stock Exchange. One was the complete collapse of the price of Elan, and the other was a mini collapse last week in the price of AIB, with which everyone is familiar. I will not go into the virtues of Elan as a stock but, for reasons which are not to their credit, it is my understanding that every single pension fund manger, bar one, was heavily into Elan. As a result of that everybody's pension fund has suffered &ndash; some considerably more than others. When one asks fund managers informally why these pension funds were in that particular stock, they say that Elan is the biggest company on the Irish Stock Exchange and therefore they have to invest in it to a greater extent. The reason is that they prefer to track the stock market and the Stock Exchange rather than make what they might consider bold, decisive, value investments. As a result we have a group of 16 or 17 so-called experts, in the Minister's word, running what are very close to tracker bonds. In other words, they are tracking the index by putting in pension money according to the weightings of those stocks. It is not absolutely true in the case of Elan because as a more recent development it has taken a while to get there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same would be exactly true of Allied Irish Banks, although I suggest that every single managed pension fund would have been in AIB because they would go for a stock not on what they considered its merits but because it is <Col N="220" /> weighty and big. Roughly speaking, they all do it in about the same proportions; there is a variation but it is small. One can see the result in the performances of pension fund managers which are extraordinarily close over both short and long periods. The reason is that they all invest roughly the same amount of money in approximately the same stocks. There is no great skill or expertise in that. When things went wrong last week, people's pensions suffered to the extent of approximately 2%, which in pension terms is a big hit.</P>
    <P>It is an inappropriate time for the Minister to talk with reverence about experts because pension funds have been over-invested in the wrong stocks at the wrong time. If there was any expertise involved, those people would not be in those stocks. I do not have that expertise and I am not sure if anyone does, but to suggest they do so is misleading. The evidence, which the Minister refuses to produce because there is none, suggests exactly the opposite &ndash; that these people invest for all the wrong reasons and not because of what they consider to be the merits of the stock. They invest primarily because a quarterly table is published showing who is top and who is bottom. Over a long period they still come in with devastatingly or spectacularly similar results because they are all doing the same thing at the same time, not in the interests of pensioners but in their own interests. Nobody dares to step out of line and take a risk in case they do not track the Irish Stock Exchange index, the ISEC. They measure themselves against that or, even worse, against themselves.</P>
    <P>I will conclude with a minor example which is not facetious, although it may be funny. In the newspaper for which I work we conduct an experiment every year to see how fund mangers do against a monkey, that is, someone taking a random selection of assets.</P>

As far as I know, one expert in one year <Col N="221" /> out of the last six has never beaten the monkey. Last year a punter &ndash; a reader who wrote in &ndash; was first, the monkey was second and the four experts came in third, fourth, fifth and sixth. This year, the punter and the monkey are so far ahead that I reckon they cannot be caught. Where were the experts? Every one of them was in Elan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not making a political point but one of the hallmarks of what the Government has done over the last number of years in relation to pensions has been to try to give back to the ordinary person some independence and some ability to move their own money about in whatever way they see fit. That is the right way to go. It has been the case over the years that people's money has often been caught up in funds and non-accessible areas. From a taxation point of view and with a desire to implement an easier regime for people to handle, I would have thought Senator Ross would have been more complimentary. Like everything in life, even with expert advice, it is up to the consumer to decide finally on whether they wish to accept that advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer the Senator to section 116 which outlines what should be in the statement of reasonable value. Subsection (3) specifically refers to the health warning about which he is asking. It states: &ldquo;The statement shall advise a potential or actual contributor of the importance of making adequate financial provision for retirement and <Col N="222" /> of obtaining the appropriate financial advice in that respect.&rdquo; Subsection (2) states: &ldquo;. . . shall contain such warnings as are prescribed for the benefit of a potential or actual contributor to a PRSA.&rdquo; The legislation is providing for a health warning in so far as it is possible.</P>
    <P>Occasionally over the years I have read the Senator's articles in different newspapers. I compliment him because they are generally written in plainspeak which the average person can understand. I do not profess to have any particular expertise but, in relation to the investment of funds generally, the well-known old maxim of not putting all one's eggs in one basket applies equally in the higher echelons of investment. While there may have been some exposure in recent times in relation to the issues to which the Senator referred, I understand the position is that they operate on the principle of spreading the load over a number of funds and geographically throughout the world so that difficulties in one area of the world would not be replicated in another area. It is a question of swings and roundabouts.</P>

      <P>I would like further information on the purpose of section 113, which is almost a Bill in itself, and especially paragraph (<i>b</i>) which states:</P>
      <P>a written statement of the reasons why such a transfer is or is not in the interest of the person wishing to make such a transfer.</P>
      <P>I do not understand why a person would be told what is in their best interest rather than being able to make up their own minds on the effect of paragraph (<i>b</i>). Is there an indication that people may move their money out of schemes and spend it, as is possible, under the schemes introduced by the Minister for Finance rather than go into a PRSA, leaving a gap to be filled? I am confused about the purpose of that paragraph. Perhaps the Minister could explain section 113 in full.</P>

We discussed the matter generally in the Department and with the various interests, particularly the social partners. There was a view that there could be a huge move from good occupational pensions into PRSAs which might not necessarily provide all the benefits that the original occupational pension scheme would deliver to people. Its purpose is to inform people of the difference, perhaps, between where they are coming from and to where they are going. It is for no other reason.</P>

      <P>Yes. I thank Senators for their forbearance. I intend to bring forward a significant number of amendments to section 3 on Report Stage. These are on foot of a proposed change in the licensing and regulation of the PRSA provider. The Bill, as published, envisaged that this would be undertaken by the Pensions Board. Following further consultation with my colleagues, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Minister for Finance, I propose that the PRSA provider would be regulated by the Central Bank under the Investment Intermediaries Act or exempt from this in the case of life companies which are regulated by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. I am satisfied that this will not in any way lessen the protection for the consumer, the PRSA contributor, and while it will involve a large number of amendments on Report Stage, it will simplify the legislation.</P>
      <P>I will set out in detail what is proposed on Report Stage as this is still under discussion with the relevant Departments. The proposals will mean that some of the existing provisions regarding licensing of PRSA providers under this Bill would become redundant. The PRSA product will continue to be regulated by the Pensions Board. There will also be consequential proposals for amendments regarding the PRSA provider in other sections of the Bill to which I will refer as these are debated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning:</NameTxt>
      <P>The four amendments relate to the same issue. The establishment of the office of an insurance ombudsman is one of the more important aspects of the Bill. The Irish experience of the Ombudsman in all the areas in which he has operated has been very successful. There is now a general belief that the Ombudsman can be trusted and will ensure there is fair play. One of the more important features of the Ombudsman in recent years has been his willingness to be proactive in investigating cases.</P>
      <P>As public representatives, we have all, I am sure, come across cases of people with a real sense of grievance about how their pension matters were handled. Very often the non-resolution of these problems has led to people going to their graves with a sense of bitterness and leaving behind an embittered family because they bore a terrible sense of injustice in their final years. If anything can be done to rectify this, it should be done. It is possible that such persons have no case and nothing can be done for them, but at least they would receive a fair and final hearing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the measures contained in the Minister's amendments, which would extend the time period available. We should not be too rigorously bound by a time limit. All we ask is that people are given access to the ombudsman and get fair play at the end of the process. The Minister has, I think, conceded the principle that three years was too short. I very much welcome that move. There may be people &ndash; I have a case in point &ndash;<Col N="235" /> who, if they were given a hearing and regardless of the way the verdict went, would have their sense of injustice and anxiety resolved. I refer to a group which made submissions to the Minister. I am sure he or his officials are very familiar with the case, namely, the members of the Commissioners of Irish Lights.</P>
    <P>I declare an interest. For six years I was a commissioner of Irish Lights. In public life there is no more pleasurable board of which to be a member. In those days we made an annual tour of the coast, there was a very good lunch every Friday in Pembroke Street and all the commissioners were called &ldquo;Sir&rdquo;. It was a very nice experience for those commissioners unused to this kind of treatment. I got to know the organisation very well and hold it and its officials, on whose behalf I am talking today, in very high regard.</P>
    <P>The basic facts of the case are that a small number of retired officials are in dispute with regard to the correct application of pensions. As the pension increases in question date back to 1994, they are outside the scope of the Minister's proposal. The officials had already retired prior to April 1994, the point at which a pay increase was granted to the grade in the Civil Service by which their salaries were determined. The nub of the matter is that this <i>pro rata</i> increase was not passed on to their pensions. They have tried hard to resolve the issue. They tried to take it to the Labour Court but, because they are not deemed to be workers within the meaning of the Act, the court did not intervene.</P>
    <P>The Commissioners of Irish Lights have refused to meet their case. The anomaly is that Irish Lights is active in Northern Ireland and Britain and if the officials concerned had been employed in those jurisdictions, they would have access to the pensions ombudsman. Trinity House, as Irish Lights is known, would be under obligation in this respect. As I understand it, the organisation will not meet the group and its position is that the officials must accept the commissioners' interpretation of the case.</P>
    <P>I have been joined in this case by Senator Cosgrave who has been very active in talking to the group. At this stage, an issue needs to be resolved about which I do not know the rights or wrongs. It would be a terrible shame, however, if people who feel they have a genuine grievance which they wish to take to the ombudsman and who are willing to accept his word as the final say on the matter are not allowed to do so because of a time technicality.</P>
    <P>I have great sympathy with the Minister on this matter. I realise that when an ombudsman begins, he or she will have a great deal of work to do going back over six years and there is a danger that the office will be flooded. On the other hand, a right is a right and, as such, a right to be heard should supersede any cut-off point we establish with regard to when a matter can be addressed.</P>
    <P>It upsets us all to see people who have given good service with such a strong sense of injustice. <Col N="236" /> Unless they go to court, which is very expensive, they cannot get the matter resolved. They and retired people generally cannot afford to go to court and should not have that burden placed on them. All they ask is that the ombudsman examines the matter. I do not ask the Minister to provide an answer to this problem today, but I ask him to look at the matter. Will he try to find some way to meet this case, either by way of a time extension or extra powers given to the ombudsman so that he or she, at his or her discretion, can re-examine the matter? I will not push the issue today but I would like the Minister to consider it and come back on Report Stage with a view on it.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Manning for his sentiments in relation to this case. Those of us in public life have come across some awful cases from time to time and, as Minister, I have great sympathy for a number of the groups who have raised with me or my officials issues concerning their pensions. Senator Ross and I had differences in relation to statements of reasonable projection but, to be honest, much of what comes across to me in terms of elderly people who are in dispute with a company in their last years of employment, although in effect they are actually in dispute with the trustees of the pension set up under the company, is that they did not understand that. I remember a case in point where I specifically asked these very old gentlemen to give me a copy of the document under which the pension was set up, in relation to an issue with which they had a query, and one did not have to be a lawyer to understand it. If they or somebody else had read it at the time &ndash; they might not have realised the consequences decades ahead &ndash; it would have been obvious, and clearly written in the trust document, that the point with which they found issue was clearly part of the contract they signed when they became members of the scheme. They have that grievance, therefore, but they cannot air it and I do not believe the pensions ombudsman would be able to sort out their particular difficulties. I make that case because people need to be fully informed and the more they are informed, the less likely they are to have recourse to the pensions ombudsman.</P>
      <P>The proposal relating to a pensions ombudsman came partly from the national pensions policy initiative but also as a result of looking at the experience particularly in the United Kingdom. We decided to follow, to a certain extent, the practice in the UK legislation, which refers to three years, although there is scope to go back even further. We decided on three years but as a result of representations we will go back to six years which will satisfy many of the people involved in this area who have raised queries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will ask my officials to talk to Senator Manning about the specific case he has raised and of which I am aware, but we have gone as far as we can in this legislation. I will undertake to examine the Irish Lights issue between now and Report <Col N="237" /> Stage in the context of this matter but we have to have some consistency because the Statute of Limitations exists in relation to legal actions in that respect. There is a precedent in regard to the public service ombudsman but it does not help us in that there is no retrospection for the public service ombudsman. From that point of view, therefore, we are gaining a great deal in this legislation. Some people will be of the view that we should start the process from today or whenever the Bill is passed and that the pension ombudsman would work from that point on, but in all sympathy to people who have raised queries about certain difficulties we have to have some retrospection.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning referred to the possibility of the ombudsman's office being flooded with issues, and that may very well be the case. We felt that if we were to leave it open-ended, the office would not be able to deal with issues arising from the passing of the Bill onwards because it would be so inundated with queries, of which there are many, from people in pension schemes set up in, say, 1940. Many of the documents may not be available and some of the people involved may no longer be with us so we have to stop the retrospection from some date and go forward. Between now and Report Stage, however, we will examine the issue and I can make some officials available to Senator Manning to discuss the issue of Irish Lights, but I am constrained in relation to accepting his amendments and I propose our amendments in this respect.</P>

      <P>I disagree with very little, if anything, of what the Minister said. I realise that to go back six years is a significant improvement, but we are dealing with people as well as with dates and times and if there is a way in which people can be satisfied they will get a hearing, regardless of whether it goes against them, at least their minds can be put at ease and their last years will not be blighted by the bitterness and worry that can become almost obsessional. I am not saying that is the case with these people but we all know somebody who believes that an injustice has been done or that they have no right of redress. I am happy to withdraw my amendments with the right to re-enter them on Report Stage and to talk to the Minister about this specific case to see if it can be addressed.</P>

      <P>As I said earlier, our decision was based largely on the experiences of the pensions ombudsman in the United Kingdom. Many of the recommendations in this respect emanate from the national pensions policy initiative. The offices of ombudsman that have been created in this country have worked extremely well and while some of us may have queries, the creation of such an office to make determinations on pension disputes is long overdue. I cannot make the case more clearly than that. Does Senator Manning want me to discuss other areas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned by the proposal in section 4 of this Bill, which will become section 133 of the 1990 Act, to provide that the ombudsman will need &ldquo;the prior approval of the Minister&rdquo; to engage consultants or advisers. Does this not create a conflict with the independence of the pensions ombudsman? Without wishing to be partisan, I refer the Minister to the difficulties faced by the former Ombudsman, Michael Mills, when he incurred the displeasure of the former Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, in the late 1980s. Instead of merely attacking the office, Mr. Haughey froze the resources available to the Ombudsman, a decision which was later reversed by the Oireachtas when Members saw what happened when the office was not properly staffed or resourced. I am worried that the pensions ombudsman may face difficulties such as those encountered in the insurance industry when the ombudsman incurred the displeasure of certain interests. She was not replaced, but she encountered great pressure.</P>
      <P>The Minister should assure the House that an ombudsman who is making decisions which are unpopular with powerful sections of the pensions industry, which may, in turn, put pressure on the Minister of the day, will not be treated unfairly. Equally, the Minister may feel that the pensions ombudsman's decisions are harmful to the public purse. I ask that the provision in section 133 relating to the prior approval of the Minister not be used to damage the independence of the ombudsman.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the point the Senator has made. Officials from the Pensions Board, which needs the consent of the Minister to engage consultants, meet departmental officials to work out a budget for consultancy and outside expertise, a budget which is adhered to, generally speaking. I assure the Senator that this provision is not intended to hamstring the pensions ombudsman and that a similar provision is made in other legislation in which the office of an ombudsman has been created. I will examine this section before Report Stage as I would not like it to be seen as a restriction of the role of the pensions ombudsman. As the person ultimately responsible for funding the administration of the pensions ombudsman, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, with the Secretary General of that Department, will have to <Col N="242" /> account for the distribution of funds at the Committee of Public Accounts. The provision referred to by the Senator is intended to ensure that outside expertise is not employed endlessly and without restriction. The ombudsman is independent of the Minister, but funding for the office of the ombudsman will be provided by the Exchequer.</P>

      <P>Those who negotiate with various Departments often feel that they are not dealing with a single Department, as the hand of the Department of Finance is always evident. I accept the Minister's argument in relation to the independence of the ombudsman and I suspect that the hiring of consultants will not be central to the role of the ombudsman. The pensions ombudsman will have to say that certain practice is right or wrong, following investigation. The hiring of consultants may be important at times and I am worried that we cannot strengthen the role of the ombudsman in that regard. It may be that the Department of Finance will call the final shots on this matter.</P>

      <P>This is a technical change to substitute the meaning of &ldquo;scheme&rdquo; regarding preserved benefit. Section 15, which deals with a defined benefit scheme, provides for the extension of the preservation requirements to include pre-1991 service where the member leaves service after 1 January 2002 with an entitlement to preserved benefit with the new vesting rule.

      <P>Section 29(1) of the Pensions Act, 1990, defines &ldquo;scheme&rdquo; as the defined benefit scheme for the purpose of that section so that section 29(7) only provides preserved benefit in respect of transfers from other defined benefit schemes. Amendment No. 86 changes the reference to &ldquo;scheme&rdquo; in section 29(7) to occupational pension scheme. The effect of this amendment is to ensure that the preserved benefit will apply to transfers from occupational benefit schemes.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 86 proposes to correct an inconsistency in existing legislation. Section 29(2) of the Pensions Act, 1990, decrees that the preserved benefit is to be provided in respect of long service benefit. Extra retirement benefit secured by a transfer payment is a long service benefit and, under this section, could give rise to a preserved benefit. However, section 29(7) stipulates that where a transfer has secured extra retirement benefit, a further benefit was to be provided to early leavers in addition to the preserved benefit under section 29(2). This arguably implies a double provision of benefit for early leavers or, more seriously, that the benefit provided to an early leaver in respect of a transfer payment was not a preserved benefit, as defined.</P>

The Bill involves a number of net issues such as the Ombudsman, the time and so on. There are also minor technical amendments. Before Report Stage we may be able to provide some facility for Senators who are interested in participating in a small briefing by my officials so that at least the Opposition side of the House will understand the reason for the amendments. Many of these amendments are technical, but simple, while others are technical and difficult to understand. We can arrange a consultation with Pensions Board personnel if necessary.

      <P>This amendment relates to the commencement date for the re-valuation of preserved benefits. Section 18 provides for the application of different re-valuation requirements to elements of preserved benefit in respect of pre- and post-1991 service. This proposed amendment is a policy change to amend the commencement date for re-valuation of preserved benefit from 1 January 2007 to 2002. However, this is a holding date and I will revisit this and other dates on Report Stage with a view to fixing a date, following enactment of this Bill, as the appropriate date from which proposals should be effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of this is that the re-valuation of pre-1991 benefits will be introduced immediately, but the funding obligation will remain as it currently stands. This will be of benefit to members of pen<Col N="247" /> sion schemes who leave. In effect, the re-valuation obligation will be introduced immediately and, as for any other obligation, will be recognised immediately in the current funding standard. However, the existing period of ten years before all obligations are required to become fully funded will remain unaltered. Under section 33 of the principal Act, a member of a defined benefit scheme who leaves service with a preserved benefit in respect of post-1991 service is normally entitled to re-valuation of that benefit from 1996 or, if later, the year in which the member left service.</P>

      <P>I understand that the transfer amount is decided by the Society of Actuaries in Ireland.

It provides for the Minister's being allowed to prescribe that transfer values be calculated in accordance with professional guidance issued by the Society of Actuaries in Ireland and specified by the Minister, or with any other applicable guidance specified. The section allows for the adjustment of transfer values to reflect the funding condition of the scheme making the transfer and allows for adherence to the society's guidelines for the calculation.</P>

      <P>In cases where the valuation is more difficult, such as defined benefit schemes, there have been instances where valuations have fluctuated enormously. I have seen differences of more than 100% in valuations and in many instances the trustees may involve people closely associated with the relevant company who may <Col N="248" /> have an interest in ensuring that the transfer value is kept to a minimum. This is in order to ensure adequate funding for the future. Often the interest of the member whose fund is being transferred is not fully protected. This should be looked into, particularly when present annuity rates, which are unprecedentedly low, are taken into account. There should not be any difference between valuations. It should be much more definitive. I am not sure how this can be achieved but the variances I have heard of do not reflect the thrust of this Bill, which is to protect people and protect their pensions.</P>

When the Bill was published, representations were made that a number of schemes already provide an indexing of pensions.</P>
      <P>Section 36 provides for a review of occupational pension rates payable in defined benefit schemes by the trustees of the scheme for the purpose of considering index-linked increases in rates. This amendment provides that schemes which are currently providing guaranteed non-discretionary pension increases at the rate of 3% per annum have complied with the requirements of the provisions in the Bill on indexation. Such schemes would then be exempt from the requirement to go through the process outlined in this section, which I consider to be a reasonable approach. The intent of section 36 is to increase the number of schemes which provide indexation of pensions and payments and these schemes already do this.</P>
      <P>The amendment also means that there will be no requirement to produce a report on the cost of indexation more frequently than every three and a half years, even where the scheme normally has annual valuations.

The Minister should accept this because it is a valuable suggestion that comes from the pensions industry.

This part of section 40 deals with the changes in scheme rules and the exercise of discretionary power to augment members' benefits to be null and void in certain circumstances. The concern has been expressed that the provision as drafted could lead to a situation where scheme members might be required to consent to rule changes that are merely procedural and to those that do not materially affect their benefits provided under the scheme.

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross:</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 47 deals with appointments to the board and we dealt with this matter on Second Stage. I have long had difficulties about political appointments to boards of this sort. I also have had difficulties about particular Ministers, although I am not referring to Deputy Dermot Ahern, who is an excellent and honourable Minister. I am talking about a principle because we have to legislate for bad Ministers, not good ones.</P>
      <P>I have real difficulties with this section, not just because members of the Pensions Board will be politically appointed, as they will be, but also because of subclause (<i>g</i>) which states that &ldquo;one shall be a representative of consumer interests&rdquo;. It is absurd that only one member of the Pensions Board should represent consumer interests. It is my view &ndash; which is, I suppose, somewhat extreme on the other side &ndash; that all 15 board members should represent consumer interests because the only people who matter in the Pensions Board are the pensioners. They are the people who have to be looked after.</P>
      <P>It appears that other groups have certain in-built rights, not least our old friends the social partners to whom the Minister has already referred with great deference, as Ministers tend to do. I see no reason why the great powers in this land should be represented on every State agency board. The Government, however, takes every opportunity to doff the cap to the trade unions and to IBEC in order to give the impression that they are taking notice of what they say. It is a bit of a game that goes on between the Government and the social partners, including the trade unions, giving the impression that they are indeed involved in some sort of mutual conversation of respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has a political payback for the Government because the unions and IBEC come into line and do not cause as much trouble. In return they get recognition, which is unhealthy, because power certainly does not lie with the Seanad or the Dáil, <Col N="257" /> or as much with the Cabinet as it used to. The Cabinet is used to appointing representatives of these groups to State boards in order to keep them happy and buy them off with prestige but not much money. There is a political dividend because the Government gets their co-operation in other areas. That is a widespread principle in Irish life and applies to every State board.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the result often is that we have well recognised party political names being appointed to boards, whose qualifications with regard to the appointment are limited but whose allegiance to a certain political party is well known. That has happened in the case of Aer Rianta, Aer Lingus and the VHI. All political parties do it, but on an issue such as the Pensions Board it is in some ways even more serious. If unqualified people, whose primary qualification is their allegiance to a political party, are supposedly representing pensioners then they are worse than useless on that board. In fact, they will damage it because they will do what those who appointed them wish and will look to them for approval.</P>
    <P>Pensions represent a sensitive area and if the Pensions Board comes under political control it is not in the interests of pensioners. In this instance, we have a token gesture towards consumers which is quite farcical. It is the worst of all worlds. The Bill gives to consumers only one nominal place out of 15 on the Pensions Board, which is derisory. That one place, however, is qualified by subparagraph (7A) which states:</P>
    <P>The member of the board representing consumer interests shall be a person nominated for appointment thereto by the Minister or such organisation or organisations as the Minister considers to be representative of consumer organisations.</P>
    <P>It is damnable that the Minister should decide who represents consumers because that person will be answerable to the Minister himself and not to consumers. People appointed to State boards must be accountable to the interests of those whom they supposedly represent. Because of the workings of the political system, a representative of the consumers will now be answerable to a political party for their actions on the Pensions Board. It is nonsense.</P>
    <P>It is quite possible to devise a way of having someone who purely and simply represents consumers and who will be accountable to them. Why not ask the Consumers' Association of Ireland to nominate someone? Nobody represents consumers more obviously than that organisation. Why not ask one of the multiplicity of consumers' groups to become involved? It seems that the Minister and the Government are terrified of letting the Pensions Board out of political control. If the Minister was genuine about this matter he would set up a new structure &ndash; and there are other structures in existence which are, at least, at arms length from the Minister &ndash; which will not have this extraordinary system <Col N="258" /> whereby it will be Buggins' turn to sit on the board of this important body and, thus, it will change as political parties change in Government.</P>
    <P>It is a great pity that there should be such an extraordinary sting at the end of a Bill in which there are so many good elements. The Minister referred to them earlier when he said that the legislation leaves pensions in people's hands. It is a wonderful principle and he has done a great job on it. However, there is a sting in the tail whereby the Pensions Board will be in the hands of whichever political party is in power. Even then, some sort of camouflage will be placed on top by appointing people who are in charge of consumer interests.</P>
    <P>I would not make this point except that the record of political parties in making appointments to State boards is deplorable. Let us make no bones about it. There is absolutely no doubt, but if there is any argument about it I will start listing them and provide evidence. If the Minister says, &ldquo;That was in the past but it won't happen this time,&rdquo; I will list the occasions on which those words were used in this House, yet the opposite occurred. This is one of the worst cases, however, because consumer interests are being represented by a political appointee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Ross on this point, but he has done such a good job that I will attempt to explain my point by telling a little story about East Berlin. When the Berlin Wall came down, the taxi drivers in East Berlin had always driven Trabants, a cheap German car, while taxi drivers in West Berlin drove Mercedes. In the following weeks, they found that the East German taxi drivers were getting no business. I know the Minister wonders where this story is leading.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to tell it for Senator Ross. I did not know that the Senator had heard it before, but I am glad he knows the answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a good story.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I tell this story is because the East German taxi drivers very quickly came to the authorities and said that they had a problem and needed a solution to it. The authorities in the city council of the now united Berlin asked them for their solution to the problem. When this had been thrown to various others &ndash; Senator Ross is perhaps the only one who has not heard it &ndash; everybody came up with different solutions. The authorities assumed that the solution from the taxi drivers would be that they should be given Mercedes cars or that the others should be forced to drive Trabants. However, the solution the East German taxi drivers suggested <Col N="259" /> was that they should be allowed charge higher rates. We all wonder why anybody would think that way, but it is amazing how few people understand the workings of the marketplace. The workings of the marketplace, free and unfettered if possible, decide how business succeeds and, therefore, how money is made and lost.</P>
      <P>If anybody is to sit on the Pensions Board, it must be somebody who does not have a vested interest other than doing what is right for consumers who are pensioners. If there is only one representative for consumer interests and one representative for each of the social partners, as Senator Ross said, it seems that nobody should be there except those who represent the interests of consumers. They should be people who understand the benefits of the market place and who understand what will happen if anything goes wrong with these pensions.</P>
      <P>We saw what happened in Enron, how Enron pensions were enthusiastically invested in Enron itself. We saw that happen in Ireland in the past in one case where pensioners' money was lost because it had been invested in the organisation itself. If there is to be any representation on this board, it should be solely that of the consumers. It seems derisory that one member shall be appointed to represent consumers interests and, as Senator Ross said, he or she will be appointed by the Minister. The Minister will even select the body by which those consumers are to be represented. I suggest all members of the board should represent the interests of consumers. This method would be much more likely to succeed in the long term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. D. Cregan Mr. D. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Cregan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Some very important points have been raised by the Senators regarding who should represent consumers on the board. We must ask whether it should be a former banker, for instance, or a person with a background in the credit union movement and how that person should be defined. I ask the Minister if it would be possible to appoint a representative from the Office of the Ombudsman to the board in order to keep the Ombudsman informed of any problems that arise. Such an appointment would benefit everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>With all due respect to Senator Cregan, I would not envisage appointing a representative of the Office of the Ombudsman to the board because the Ombudsman must be totally independent. There should be no connection between that office and the interests of another body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not accept the premise that the appointment of persons to boards by political parties has been a disastrous practice. I inherited a board that was, by and large, appointed by the outgoing Government. I worked well with the board and I went as far as to re-appoint the chairperson of the board. I did that also with another board. In <Col N="260" /> the three bodies under my aegis I re-appointed people as chairpersons who were appointed by the previous Government. In my five years of dealing with the Pensions Board I have not put on my political hat.</P>
    <P>I assure the Senator that, in relation to this board, there is no party political game-playing or looking after the interests of political parties. Just because somebody is not from one political party, as opposed to another, does not mean that they are only there to represent that political party and that they are not representative of consumer interests. In my view, a member of any political party would be more than capable of representing consumer interests than perhaps some of the nominees from some of the representative bodies. I do not accept what the Senator said in that respect.</P>
    <P>Before this Bill was introduced, I appointed somebody who was clearly representative of consumer interests to this board. This was to show cause in relation to the amendment I introduced to specifically appoint a representative of consumer interests. At present, no organisation comes to mind from which to choose representatives of consumer interests. I would rather appoint somebody who, perhaps, is not a member of an organisation even in the area of consumer interests. I would rather appoint somebody who has a genuine consumer interest without any baggage.</P>
    <P>The membership of the board consists of two representatives of the trade union movement, two from IBEC, one from the Irish Association of Pension Funds, one from the pension lawyers area, one from the Society of Actuaries, one from the accountancy profession, one from insurance companies, the Minister's three nominees, one from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and one from the Department of Finance. It is a broad spread of representation. There must be people with expertise in the area on the board; it cannot consist of 15 people without any idea of pensions or the way in which pensions work.</P>
    <P>While people may criticise the make up of the board and wonder why pension lawyers or accountants should be represented, the expertise of these professionals is availed of by the board in circumstances where it might otherwise have to seek that expertise elsewhere. Whatever fears, jaundiced or otherwise, someone may have in relation to political appointees, I assure Senators that it is not the case. People on the board have been card-carrying members of political parties other than my own but they were excellent representatives and contributed highly to the board. I have not packed any of the boards within my remit with card-carrying members of my party, even though I might be criticised for not doing so. If individual Senators have any suggestions as to how we can accommodate consumer interests, let them suggest names, even confidentially, to me for inclusion on the board as representatives of such interests. Ultimately, somebody must <Col N="261" /> decide. All political parties in office have been even-handed in their approach to the board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross:</NameTxt>
      <P>I reject what the Minister said. He responded in the same manner as all Ministers who say they have appointed people from different political parties. The Minister has three months left in office. It is unlikely he will be in his current position thereafter. He may be the Minister for Finance when he would still be in a position to make nominations to the board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross:</NameTxt>
      <P>We shall see. The Minister has not answered my point. This legislation will affect his successors. I should not have allowed him the opportunity to say he is purer than other Ministers in this regard because they are not pure.</P>
      <P>The Minister and his successors will appoint people to the board as a reward for political or other work they have done. That is what State boards are for and it is one of the reasons State and semi-State bodies are in such a mess. Board meetings of Aer Rianta resemble meetings of a Fianna Fáil cumann. Board members include a member of the Fianna Fáil national executive, the party's campaign manager for Dún Laoghaire and the campaign manager and close associate of a former Taoiseach. I could go on. I will not detail the position on Aer Lingus. Everyone knows the story. Well-known friends of the Taoiseach are on the board. God knows what they know about aviation. They are board members not for incredible reasons about which we know nothing, but because of the old pal's act. We must guard against the old pal's act impacting on appointments to the Pensions Board, although it is bound to happen.</P>
      <P>The Minister asked for suggestions on alternatives. Why does he have to make appointments concerning consumer interests? Why not allow the trustees select a nominee or why not allow the pensioners, who contribute to these pension schemes, decide by way of election? Will the Minister explain why they should not be allowed select the people on the board to represent them?</P>
      <P>It is no good for the Minister to say that appointments to the board should cover people from professional bodies who know about pensions. Are pensioners incapable of deciding? This is typical of a Government paternalism that says because pensioners do not know who to appoint, the Government will make the appointments for them. Pensioners do not want Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael hacks on the board. They want people who will represent their interests as consumers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may be correct that there is no consumer body that could represent pensioners. Why does he not establish a system where all the pensioners who contribute to these schemes democratically elect the people on the board? Are they so ignorant that they will not be able to do it? Is the Government proposing a benevolent <Col N="262" /> dictatorship that tells them what is good for them? These people have their own interests at heart. They are the consumers and they should elect the 15 members of the board, who should not be patsies from political parties, IBEC or the unions who are getting a pay off from the Government for work they have done elsewhere. We should democratise this process. What is wrong with that?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened attentively to Senator Ross, whose views I mostly respect. He has enhanced the deliberations of the House, especially when business matters are debated. However, in this instance, he is wrong because the vast majority of pension holders possibly do not understand where they have invested their pensions. If they did, they possibly would not make such investments. They are advised by financial advisers across a range of financial institutions.</P>
      <P>I have never been appointed to any State board but I know that most appointments are voluntary. Those appointed give of their time and expertise voluntarily to serve the best interests of the boards to which they have been appointed. The Senator's contribution reminds me of God speaking to God; be that as it may provided he is infallible, but I do not consider that he is.</P>
      <P>Senator Ross expressed strongly held views. However, he should know that many decent and honourable men and women have been appointed to boards by various political parties because of their expertise in their line of business. I appreciate the work they have done. On occasion, appointees to boards have misused their positions or have not served in the manner expected of them but 99% of those appointed have served honourably, loyally and well without any remuneration.</P>

      <P>The vast majority of appointees to State boards of which I am aware take up their post from a sense of public duty. The Senator has privilege in the House and if he knows of instances to the contrary, he should identify them.</P>
      <P>This is a specialised board. On the point of democratising it, it would be impractical to have to find out all the members of the thousands of pension schemes around the country. Would one have to get the vote of each of them for the purpose of democratising the Pensions Board? Given what would be involved, I am of the view that the present method is the best.</P>
      <P>In respect of any of the nominees of the Ministers, including myself, irrespective of whatever discretion we have in terms of the Pensions Board, even if the members were card carrying members of a political party, by and large they were sufficiently experienced. There is no way a Minister would appoint a person to such a board who would not have some knowledge or interest in the area of pensions. To do so would be unfair on the person because they would have to discuss matters such as defined benefit contributions and would not have a notion what they were talking about.</P>
      <P>In regard to the appointment of a consumer representative to the board, there is already one such person on the board who, apart from other representatives, would validly represent consumer interests. I do not accept that members representing trade unions are not representing consumer interests. A good balance has been achieved. To a certain extent the Pensions Board is getting better value for money out of representatives from some of the interests. That is my experience, having attended a few meetings of the Pensions Board during the past few years. I can put the case no more strongly. I will not convince the Senator and neither will he convince me.</P>

It is utterly wrong that they <Col N="264" /> should not have some say in who, ultimately, looks after the regulation of their pensions and that all these people are politically appointed. At the very least they should have a majority and be seen to have a majority on the board.</P>
      <P>To say it is impracticable to give every one of them a vote in their future and the future of their funds is absurd. There are several structures which could be set up to do that. The trustees who are elected by them could easily be the persons who then nominate or elect persons to the board. A few trustees from each pension fund could get together and nominate and elect persons to represent the pensioners of Ireland on the Pensions Board.</P>
      <P>What we have now is a system which is directed from the top. The good and the great in the Irish Republic will decide what is good for the little people. That is typical of IBEC, ICTU, the Minister for Finance, the Minister present and the Government as a whole. That comes down through a political party.</P>
      <P>The Minister did not answer my question about Aer Lingus. It is an irrelevant question here but the principle is the same. The board of Aer Lingus has people on it whose main qualification is that they are friends of the Taoiseach. A large number of the members of the board of Aer Rianta are card-carrying members of Fianna Fáil. That is their primary qualification.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister reaffirm that he will seriously consider on Report Stage a different way of representing the consumer interest element on the board rather than their appointment by him and his successors?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot agree with the sentiments expressed by the Senator in relation to Aer Lingus or any other board. The Senator did not ask a question. He posed the example of the board of Aer Lingus. Those on the board of Aer Lingus are entitled to be on it. They are as representative of any outside interest as any other person. In that respect I do not accept what the Senator has said.</P>
      <P>In regard to democratising the issue, we are talking about a board that does not meet often during the year but which would have the role of overseeing the executive of the permanent employees of the Pensions Board. There were 86,348 schemes as of 31 December 2000 and by all accounts there are 629,801 members of these schemes. I do not know how one can democratise that to choose a few people for the board. It would be a logistical nightmare. The Senator suggested it might be done through the trustees. My experience is that there is severe mistrust of the trustees in the implementation of the pension scheme on the part of the ordinary contributors to the scheme who have no confidence&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Senator knows the trustees of the pension schemes of which he is a <Col N="265" /> member, or those in which he has an interest. I hazard a guess that if the Senator were to go out to Kildare Street and ask the first person he met if he or she was a member of a pension scheme and, if so, if they knew its trustees, he or she would answer in the negative. Neither would they be able to say how many schemes there are or who is on the Pensions Board.</P>
      <P>I do not accept what the Senator has said. If he is saying there has been political involvement in the board, he has chosen one of the worst examples on which to base his case. The Pensions Board has not been politicised either under this Government or the previous Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. D. Cregan Mr. D. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Cregan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a final point on the board and on pensions generally. It must be readily admitted that during the past ten years there has been more interest in pensions for later life. Irrespective of what Government is in office, the first incentive regarding AVCs was given to the self-employed. That is now being broadened to include the PAYE sector, while a person over 50 years of age will be allowed to contribute 30% of his total income to an AVC scheme, which is enormous. This is long overdue.</P>
      <P>Not all boards are perfect. We cannot stand proud and say Aer Lingus boards were good. Irrespective of what Government appointed them, they were not good and have cost the taxpayer a small fortune. The question is whether they were on top of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree that the proper people should be appointed to the Pensions Board because it is important to those who have personal investments. A young person should be appointed to the board to ensure pension provisions are promoted among younger people. I welcome the incentive to put 15% of salary into AVC schemes <Col N="266" /> which is long overdue. This should ensure that more people would take out a pension.</P>
    <P>Whom should one appoint to the board? I cannot say that those involved in pensions schemes in the past were the best people. There have been many failures in regard to pensions. The losses following the AIB crisis last week were mentioned in the <i>Irish Independent</i> this morning. It is imperative to ensure there is a person on the board who represents the under 40 age group. Even though I am a staunch trade unionist, I do not think they would be the best to represent that group. Whether the person is a political appointee or a young Fianna Fáil person does not matter; a person of the right calibre should be on the board.</P>
    <P>It is also important to emphasise strongly that the Pensions Board is accountable, not only to the Minister, but also to the ombudsman. People woke up when we appointed ombudsmen in other sectors. We should probably have appointed ombudsmen for Aer Rianta, Aer Lingus and CIE. We would have been way ahead by now and would have avoided half the losses of these companies. We cannot claim that Aer Lingus or its boards, irrespective of who appointed them, have done us proud. They have not and the same applies to Aer Rianta and CIE. Let us look at the real losses of Aer Rianta, likewise CIE. The fact that I am a politician does not mean I am willing to state we did well with regard to these two companies for which millions of pounds are unaccounted. We do not want the same to happen with the Pensions Board. I know it will not and I am not suggesting otherwise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a technical amendment. Section 49 sets out the distinct elements of preserved benefit to be calculated in the case of a defined benefit scheme and the formula to be used to calculate preserved benefit in respect of both pre-1991 and post-1991 services. The amendment inserts an additional paragraph into the definition of &ldquo;preserved benefit&rdquo; the effect of which is that the definition is extended to include preserved benefit in respect of additional long service benefit provided by a transfer of accrued rights from another scheme.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;5.&ndash;(1) Any preserved benefit payable under a defined benefit scheme shall be revalued annually at the end of each revaluation year, by adding the appropriate amount to the amount of preserved benefit as at the last day of the previous calendar year (or as at the date of termination of relevant employment in any case where a member's relevant employment has terminated since the last day of the previous calendar year), such preserved benefit to include any previous revaluation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a technical amendment to do with the calculation of revaluation of preserved benefits. I propose to take these three related amendments together. Section 50 confines the anti-franking provision to persons who leave service before 1 January 2002. For persons leaving service after 1 January 2002, all benefits will be preserved and cannot be reduced. Under the existing section, revaluation would no longer apply to the partial year from a member's date of leaving to the end of the calendar year. This reduces the value of the preserved benefit to the member.</P>
      <P>This amendment arose because an amendment was inadvertently dropped when amendments were introduced in the 1996 Act. This amendment restores the original intended amendment and it will increase the member's preserved benefit arising from his or her leaving before the end of a calendar year.</P>

I would like to signal that the Government intends to make amendments to Part 4 of the Bill on Report Stage, to update references to dates and PRSA providers, to redraft parts of various sections and to make a number of specific additional proposals. It is proposed to make amendments to section 8 in relation to sectionalised schemes. I will bring forward an amendment to section 8 to give the Minister power, with the consent of the Minister for Finance and the approval of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, to make regulations in relation to matters covered by the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act, 2001. It is intended that such regulations will be made as soon as possible after the enactment of this Bill.</P>
      <P>Similarly, I intend on Report Stage to bring forward an amendment to Part 4, after section 8 and before section 9, to address proposed pension schemes for the North-South bodies under the Good Friday Agreement. This new section will give the Minister the power to make regulations to exempt these schemes from any of or all the requirements of the Pensions Act, as it is envisaged that they will be administered in the North. The legislation will provide for a pension scheme for the bodies, with the approval of the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Finance and Personnel in the North and the North-South Ministerial Council. We understand that it will be a statutory, dual approved, unfunded scheme, which would not be set up under trust. Benefit levels and contribution rates, which will be based on those in the Northern Ireland civil service scheme, were approved by both Ministers and the council. The pensions table under the scheme will be financed by the Exchequer from voted moneys and by the Northern Ireland Assembly. The scheme will have members in both jurisdictions, but it is envisaged that it will be administered in Northern Ireland.</P>

    <Title>Beef Industry: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor:</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann condemns the failure of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development to address the crisis in the beef industry; to bring forward proposals to rid the national herd of remaining cases of BSE; and his utter failure to simplify the application documentation for the various premia and income support schemes which has given rise to the disproportionate and unjust penalty system.</P>
      <P>There is a slight misprint on the Order Paper regarding the motion, but I do not know whose fault it is. The motion refers to proposals to rid the national herd of &ldquo;remaining&rdquo; cases of BSE, but should refer to proposals to rid the herd of &ldquo;recurring&rdquo; cases of BSE.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Davern. I would have been delighted if the Minister, Deputy Walsh, had come into the House as most of my comments are directed at him. However, I do not wish to take from the work of the Minister of State. I have little criticism to make of the Minister of State as most of my criticism is directed at the Minister.</P>
      <P>This debate is timely as agriculture remains one of the pillars of the economy and continues to face difficulties. We are on the eve of the mid-term review which arose from the Berlin summit in 1999. The last set of CAP reforms included a mid-term review to begin in 2002 which has to be completed by early 2003. Therefore, it is timely that this House makes an input into the position to be taken by Ireland regarding the crucial mid-term review. The general outlook is that the review will result in more cuts in, and pressures on, the CAP.</P>
      <P>Irish farmers are among the lowest paid in Europe. The average farm income in Ireland is about &euro;13,000 or &euro;14,000. One of the three issues which I have identified for the purposes of this debate is the situation faced by beef farmers. On average beef farmers earn less than &euro;7,000 per annum, an income which would keep one just above the poverty line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to deal first with the critical issue of beef. There is much talk on the part of the Department and the Minister regarding the reopening of markets for Irish beef. Our main market is the UK. Our current situation is similar to that of the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s, prior to our entering the <Col N="272" /> EU, in that the vast majority of our beef has to be sold to the UK. All of our international markets are closed. There has been much talk of the reopening of the Egyptian market. Technically speaking that market has reopened, but not one ounce of Irish beef is being exported to Egypt which was one of our best markets.</P>
    <P>Commissioner Fischler and the Minister promised that when the Egyptian market opened there would be a move to increase export refunds, but this has not happened. Why has there been no move to increase export refunds to third countries as promised by the Minister and the Commissioner? Such an increase would improve access to the Egyptian market where we face difficulties competing against cheaper beef from India and Brazil. There has never been a more opportune time to address the problem of export refunds. I would ask the Minister of State to address this issue first. It is a pity the Minister is not here because there is a beef management meeting in Brussels this week and I want to know whether this issue will be raised.</P>
    <P>The Minister is fond of, and has confidence in, Bord Bia. According to the board, in the coming year we will need markets to take an additional 100,000 tonnes of Irish beef. This year we will not have the slaughter scheme which took a significant amount of beef off our market last year and we have no international markets, other than Russia. We had profitable markets in Indonesia, the Philippines, Algeria and South Africa which took 100,000 tonnes of beef from the Irish market. However, all of these markets are now closed, except Russia.</P>
    <P>If Russia takes 30,000 tonnes, at best, this year, what will happen in August, September and October when there is a glut of cattle on the market? What provisions are being made for new markets in these countries which are closed to us? They are closed due to BSE to which I will come in a moment, but something must be done to ensure that the international marketplace in which we had several customers and where we have several potential customers is opened to us.</P>
    <P>We do not want a repeat of what happened last August. In three weeks of that month when the Minister was on holidays and Brussels was closed, the price of beef over 30 months old went into free-fall, dropping by 15p or 16p per pound. Thousands of farmers were ruined by those events because there was a large number of cattle over 30 months old in the herd at that time. They were fetching reasonable prices throughout June and July, but in August when a glut suddenly appeared, they suffered the brunt of it. Nothing was done. The price fell, on average, by £100 to £120 per head. The Minister was away on holidays, Brussels was closed down and nobody cared. Everyone had their backs turned. That is not acceptable and it should be an election issue.</P>
    <P>That kind of thing cannot be allowed to happen in the autumn of 2002. Prices are currently reasonable or even good because of the pick-up in trade in the UK as a result of the slaughter that <Col N="273" /> took place during its foot and mouth crisis. This will not last when the cattle start to come off grass feeding in August, September and October and maybe a couple of weeks of November.</P>
    <P>The critical issue of the beef market must be addressed in the coming six months or so. I would like the Minister to provide some answers in his reply this evening &ndash; not just a banal spiel written by his Department officials, but direct answers to our specific questions. The main problem in the beef industry is BSE, which is a very serious matter. Other than a policy of saying as little as possible, no policy exists.</P>
    <P>I obtained some figures for BSE incidence today from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and they are quite worrying. In January 2001, 19 cases of BSE were reported. For the next few months everything was all right but come August, 41 cases were noted. In September there were 33 cases, in October 26 and in November we had the highest figure ever at 53. In December, leaving Christmas aside as cases are only noted during slaughter, there were 22 cases. In January of this year there were 42 cases and at least ten cases have been reported in the first half of February.</P>
    <P>Something must be done about this. We have never addressed the question. Enormous damage is being done. These figures will leap up and bite us later this year. The excuse that will be used by our customers, the Saudis, the Indonesians and the South Africans, is the huge number of BSE cases in the national herd.</P>
    <P>Has any thought been given to a targeted cull of cattle in certain areas, for example where farmers were customers of the seven or eight feed compounders who were the biggest offenders in manufacturing the product which gave us BSE? We should be able to identify them. Female animals are the most numerous victims of BSE. I am not sure what percentage of animals in the dairy herd are over five years of age &ndash; perhaps Senator Kiely, who is a dairy farmer, could advise us on that. It may be as high as 50% or it may be less. A major problem is that a total cull over six or seven years of all the animals at risk, with full compensation, would be extremely costly, to say nothing of the huge disruption which would be inflicted upon the dairy industry and on milk production.</P>
    <P>However, something must be done. We must introduce a targeted cull of animals of a certain age, or animals in certain herds which have been particularly at risk from infected feed. We know that the feed was manufactured by six or seven compounders and these are only the worst offenders. Not a hand has been lifted against any of those compounders, but there should have been. Later in the debate we will talk about the penalties placed on farmers who make simple errors in application forms and so on. No penalties have been imposed upon these people, no more than in respect of the wrongdoing uncovered by the beef tribunal. These people have done enormous damage to this critical sec<Col N="274" /> tor of the industry which is still the largest in the country.</P>
    <P>We must find a new approach to the problem. Perhaps radical solutions are called for, but statistics show that more than twice as many cases of BSE showed up in January 2002 as in the same month in 2001. The amendment to the motion states that we are putting in place a better set of detection controls and so on. However, this is not the point. Our international customers will be reading these statistics. We must end our policy of shushing and saying nothing, because it is simply not enough.</P>
    <P>The level of frustration and anger boiling up among farmers about bureaucracy and penalties is quite something. We will all get it in the neck during the election campaign but the Government will deservedly get quite a roasting from the farming community. An opportunity has been missed. An agreement on integrated controls was reached in December between the European Commission and this country, but nothing was done during those talks to simplify the application system or to alleviate the draconian nature of the penalties. Farmers bring these upon themselves by the simplest human error of not ticking a certain box or answering a question. The questions are not simple. The application document is convoluted and deliberately complicated. The form of words used is different for each question. Phrases such as <i>force majeure</i> are used. An ordinary farmer may never in his education have been exposed to phrases such as this. I do not know what it means. A phrase such as &ldquo;in circumstances beyond your control&rdquo; could be used instead, but the Department puts in something like this to confuse people. It is totally unnecessary and is typical of the abstruse and inscrutable nature of the wording used. The Minister is smiling, but this is a serious problem. I can assure him the smile will be wiped from his face during the election campaign</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with great pleasure that I am here to second the motion proposed by my colleague, Senator Connor, on behalf of the Fine Gael Seanadóirí. I am here not just as a Member of the Seanad but as a member of the European Parliament, of the European Parliament's agriculture committee and of its environment, public health and consumer affairs committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the European Parliament, food issues and public health issues related to food are separated from agricultural issues, which is not how things are done here. I have been proposing discussion <Col N="275" /> on this issue in Ireland for many years and the next Minister for Agriculture, whoever the Fine Gael Minister may be, must consider it seriously. At this point in our development, consumer-related food issues must be separated from farmer-related agricultural issues because there can be conflicts of interest. One Minister must be master of two sectors. Even if there is no conflict of interest there is perceived to be one by the public and that in itself is a problem. The food brief must be separated from the agriculture brief.</P>
    <P>I concur with all my colleague has said about the crisis in the beef industry. The continuing importance of beef production to Ireland and the Irish economy must be underlined. The figures have been rehearsed many times on the Seanad record. The bottom line is that we must export up to 90% of the beef we produce. Virtually every market is still closed to us because of the tragedy not only of BSE but also of foot and mouth disease, which came and went in the meantime. During that outbreak, BSE took a back seat but although it was no longer on the front pages it was always there. Due to these crises, the only markets still open to us are Russia, as has been indicated by my colleague, and &ndash; in theory &ndash; Egypt, although nothing is going to the Egyptian market.</P>
    <P>Having promised an increase in export refunds, the Minister, Deputy Walsh, supported their gradual phasing out at a recent Council of Agriculture Ministers. I am not sure whether we can have a rational debate on whether that is in Ireland's long-term interest, a short-term gain for long-term interest, or whether the Minister is speaking with forked tongue. Perhaps we are not fit to have a rational debate on that in this House because the Minister's Department will put a spin on it to justify his vote and the stance he took.</P>
    <P>He was gung-ho here to the IFA and the farmers before he went, saying that he would protect the future of export refunds, yet he voted for the gradual phasing out of refunds at a Council of Agriculture Ministers. As a country that depends to a large extent on exporting to third countries, until we can increase our markets within the EU, that is a serious blow and a concern, in the medium term, to Irish exporters and beef producers. We need an explanation of the Minister's behaviour in relation to that and to how he let the farmers down on that occasion.</P>
    <P>He also let them down in December at the Agriculture Council of Ministers in relation to the whole review of the sheep regime. I know our focus tonight is beef but I will explain how he let them down. It is all right that he failed to deliver the &euro;30 fixed premium. We knew he would not be able to deliver that as he did not have support from the other agriculture Ministers on that issue. Farmers generally have not trusted or seen the power of the European Parliament. The agricultural committee and the full plenary of the European Parliament voted by a large majority on <Col N="276" /> what to give our sheep producers. These producers had a miserable time up to 2001 and they only benefited then because of the foot and mouth disease crisis. They have had ten years of appalling income returns. The Minister did not deliver on the &euro;30, unlike the European Parliament. He failed the sheep producers by not being able to stand up to his colleagues for a reasonable fixed-rate premium and he failed to look after rural people with what is now to be called a supplement premium with the &euro;7 that is on offer.</P>
    <P>I ask him now in the mid-term review to be sure that when we get to the point of beef extensification, which is under the microscope for the mid-term review, the first 15 livestock units of sheep are excluded from calculation of beef extensification. The sheep are counted in but not paid for in calculating extensification. That is driving people out of production of sheep &ndash; there is underproduction in that area in the European Union &ndash; and into production of beef where there is over-production because farmers are paid extensification on beef. They are paid on a product where there is surplus, yet are not paid to stay in sheep production, a product in which there is a deficit. The logic of that escapes me.</P>
    <P>The lack of logic from Commissioner Fischler, the Minister and the Council of Agriculture Ministers in cross-referencing between the different agricultural regimes to be sure that we are not driving people out of a product in under supply in Europe into a product in surplus is further depressing the price for our hard-pressed beef producers. This is an important issue for Ireland because we rely on exports. Most other European Union countries are not dependent on agriculture to the degree we are. It is an Irish issue and we depend on the Minister to support our beef producers and to look after them around the table.</P>
    <P>The mid-term review is imminent. Commissioner Fischler's noises in recent months, when speaking about the mid-term review, have been largely in reference to excessive production in the beef sector. This is an area where excluding the first 100 ewes from calculation of beef extensification will keep people in production of sheep and not push them into beef production. The Minister must tell us exactly what line he supports on behalf of the Irish beef and sheep producer, the dry stock sector. What is happening in this area is a worry for the people.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government is looking for consumption to return to its former levels to prevent the Commission from introducing cuts in relation to excess production in the mid-term review. If there is not an all-out drive here and in Europe to increase consumption, procedures will be put in place to cut production. That is not in the interest of the Irish beef sector, an important contributor not just to the agricultural sector but to our GDP. What has the Government done and what is Bord Bia doing to market beef, our healthy, safe meat? There should be an all-out drive to promote it and if necessary prices should be reduced. The farmer is not getting paid but the housewife has <Col N="277" /> to pay a lot for the prime product of the limestone grasslands of Ireland. I call on the Minister to do all he can to increase consumption of beef as a way of helping our beef producers and of stopping Commissioner Fischler from cutting production. There will be cuts if we do not get it right.</P>
    <P>There is nothing to fear with enlargement of the European Union in relation to agricultural payments but there is something to fear if we do not get right the switch from direct payments to area aid payments, particularly for the beef farmer. I do not have time to develop that issue but perhaps the Minister will explain how the country is handling that.</P>
    <P>In relation to BSE in our cattle herd, our TSE &ndash; transmissible spongiform encephalitis &ndash; legislation has us in the second category. For obvious reasons the UK is in category one. How close are we to moving to the next category and to being safer still? Our product is safe. The problem in Ireland is an historical one but we are not getting that message across. The Minister has failed to open the export markets, resulting in a crisis with over-production and an income crisis in our beef sector. The new beef labelling has been in operation for the past few weeks and should not cause a problem. We should be proud to label and indicate the source and origin of our beef.</P>
    <P>I rest my case. The Minister has a lot to answer for. He said one thing to our beef producers and then went to the Council of Agriculture Ministers and voted otherwise.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Seanad Éireann commends the Minister for Agriculture Food and Rural Development, for introducing a range of special measures to support the cattle and beef industry; for implementing comprehensive and enhanced BSE controls and for achieving major progress in the simplification of payment applications and in the efficiency of delivering payments, while respecting EU requirements to account for annual payments to farmers of over &euro;1.5 billion.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am pleased we are having this debate. Any debate on agriculture is useful and this one will, I hope, be constructive. Agriculture is a vital industry to the economy. I commend the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, who is present tonight, for the wonderful work they have done for agriculture since 1997. I was often critical of the Minister's predecessor and was justified in that criticism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has done great work, despite what <Col N="278" /> was said here, in his negotiations at EU level and he got increased premia for beef producers. Ireland has to depend on an export market as 85% or 90% of our produce is exported. We must be more diligent in the manner in which we produce our beef because we must satisfy consumers abroad as well as our own consumers. There was a bleak start to 2001 for a number of reasons, particularly because of confirmation of BSE outbreaks in the EU where there had been no outbreaks. That meant that consumption in a number of European states fell by 30% &ndash; in Germany it fell by 80%. That had an effect on prices. Third world countries terminated contracts because of BSE and consumer confidence was affected. Consumer protection had to be increased and consumer confidence restored.</P>
    <P>The beef producers also had to be protected and I compliment the Minister and Minister of State on introducing schemes that helped producers to maintain their incomes in the beef trade. The introduction of the purchase for destruction scheme and its successor, the special purchase scheme, was valuable and very much appreciated by beef producers. It did not add to the beef mountain and led to the export of more beef for which there was not a market elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The cattle under 30 months scheme is important in improving confidence in foreign markets. We must ensure that cattle are free of disease. Cattle under 30 months have definitely a lower incidence of disease than older cattle. Farmers must be made more aware of the need to finish cattle younger to ensure a better export market for beef.</P>
    <P>There was trouble getting cattle into factories at the end of August last and there is a case for saying that factory managers take advantage of beef producers and farmers in such situations. Frustration was caused, especially among farmers with cattle near the 30 months point. When cattle are accepted after age 30 months, the farmer gets less money per animal.</P>
    <P>We have enjoyed a good price for beef since Christmas and the factories are looking for cattle because there is a scarcity. However, it would be best if we could have a system where factory management is more considerate towards farmers. The factories are inclined to make it a seasonal rather than a year-round market.</P>
    <P>Export markets must be restored as the Egyptian market has been. Cattle should soon be exported to Egypt again. There have been veterinary inspections from third country markets and the inspectors who visited were satisfied with the results.</P>
    <P>The increase in the incidence of BSE has been mentioned in tonight's debate but it should be recognised that progress has been made in that area. Animals born since 1996 have not shown signs of the disease; all animals diagnosed with the disease were born before that year. The dairy herd has many older animals and it is often dairy cows that get BSE. However, the age of cattle has decreased and farmers are becoming more con<Col N="279" /> scious of the problem and are anxious to cull and replace diseased animals.</P>
    <P>Regardless of the compensation they get &ndash; and it varies widely &ndash; farmers dread a BSE outbreak in their herds because they must then depopulate. I would like to see a system introduced where a farmer who has a BSE outbreak could put his own value on the herd. The valuation that gets the farmer the most compensation should be the basis of the price the farmer gets. From talking to farmers who have had outbreaks of BSE, it is a most frustrating experience and whatever financial compensation they receive is no real compensation.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister and Minister of State on the programme they introduced to ensure the outbreak of foot and mouth disease would not spread to this country. There was one outbreak caused by a careless or rogue dealer who imported sheep from Scotland into the Six Counties, and from there to the Republic. He was penalised and is in jail, but any penalty would not be severe enough for a man who does such a thing. He put the entire beef industry in jeopardy.</P>
    <P>Beef production in the UK will be 12% down again this year as the herd is rebuilding. That will offer additional market opportunities for Irish beef which should ensure a good price.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development on the great work he is doing, especially in relation to the Agenda 2000 negotiations where he got a great deal for Irish agriculture despite terrible opposition from other speakers. I also congratulate him on yesterday's launch of a booklet on direct payments which will make that subject easier for farmers. An animal event recording book can be very useful. One hour working on that is time well spent and the facts can then be sent off. It is important and is not time wasted. When I started farming, I spent about two or three hours going to the creamery. That is not needed now and time can be better spent ensuring that farmers get what they are entitled to and avoiding the penalties that have been mentioned in the House today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern:</NameTxt>
      <P>That would mean that the influence of some Irish MEPs is not as great as they assume it is.</P>
      <P>The motion proposed for this debate demonstrates in a stark manner a complete lack of appreciation or understanding of what has been achieved by the Government, especially as regards the beef sector in Ireland. It is understood that, over the past few years, the beef sector in Europe faced an enormous challenge when BSE was discovered in late 2000 in a number of continental member states. The action taken by the Government here, in particular the operation of the destruction schemes at a cost of &euro;200 million to the Irish Exchequer, insulated the beef sector from the effects of the overall market disturbance and has left it in a relatively favourable position today.</P>
      <P>For the benefit of those not familiar with the beef market, I will spell out the situation. It is easy to forget that, prior to these scares, the EU market was in excellent condition. Unfortunately, the favourable market situation was completely overturned by the BSE scares which led to a substantial reduction in beef consumption in many member states and to the closure of all major third country markets except Russia to beef from the European Union. The fall in consumption in some member states, such as France and Germany, was quite dramatic, and consumption remained at about 30% of normal across the EU generally for a considerable period of 2001.</P>
      <P>In view of the importance of export markets to the Irish beef sector, these developments were potentially very damaging to the industry. For that reason, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development played an important role in ensuring that speedy and effective action was taken at EU level to deal with the situation. The strategy adopted at EU level was to attempt to increase consumer protection and to restore consumer confidence in beef, to protect producers' incomes through the introduction of the additional market support schemes, and to ensure that every effort was made at political, diplomatic and technical level to secure the re-opening of those markets which had imposed an import ban on EU beef as a result of the BSE scares.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department, together with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Bord Bia, has been working intensively over the past year to demonstrate to the authorities in our export markets the level and effectiveness of the controls in place in <Col N="281" /> Ireland and to emphasise the guarantees in relation to food safety we can offer. In view of the importance of export markets to the Irish beef sector, these developments were potentially very damaging to the beef industry.

    <P>The strategy adopted at EU level was to attempt to increase consumer protection and to restore consumer confidence in beef.

    <P>My Department, with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Bord Bia, has been working intensively over the past year to demonstrate to the authorities in our export markets the level and effectiveness of the controls in place in Ireland, and to emphasise the guarantees of food safety that we can offer.</P>
    <P>Our ability to provide these assurances is underpinned by our computerised CMMS cattle traceability system. We can also demonstrate considerable success in our handling of BSE based on the shift in age profile of BSE cases to animals of an older age category. No animal has turned up that was born in 1997. That is tremendous progress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern:</NameTxt>
      <P>This strategy proved successful with Egypt. Our sustained efforts culminated in a visit to Ireland by a technical delegation, headed by the Egyptian chief veterinary officer. In the course of this visit, our controls were fully accepted and this provided the basis for the re-listing of Ireland as a country from which Egypt would accept beef imports. All the technical details have been agreed with the Egyptian authorities and it is now a matter for Irish exporters to contract for business with Egypt. Unfortunately the price of cattle is high and we cannot sell there because beef costs 91p per pound. The people who went on strike last year were looking for 87p per pound.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="282" />Given our success in regaining access to the Egyptian market, I am confident that this success will be repeated with other important markets worldwide. No effort will be spared to achieve this outcome. We held discussions with representatives from Indonesia recently and have invited them to visit the country. The Minister visited South Africa last year and invited a specialist team to assess the position on the ground. The Gulf region, where there are crucial third country markets, is also receiving top priority and every possible channel is being used to have the bans in those countries lifted. In many cases, however, the ban relates to the EU as a whole which, given the different stages of BSE among member states, can be a problem. Nevertheless, we were able to convince Egypt that we were in a different category and I am confident we can repeat that.</P>
    <P>Looking back over the past year, there is no doubt that the measures introduced at EU level dealt effectively with the situation and helped to protect Irish beef producers from the worst effects of the crisis. Consumer confidence in beef has been restored, as evidenced by the gradual recovery in beef consumption across Europe from 30% below normal at the beginning of the year to 5% below normal at present. The beef market has been effectively supported, particularly in Ireland where approximately 500,000 cattle, or 28% of beef production, was removed from the market under these schemes in 2001. This cost approximately &euro;400 million, of which some &euro;200 million is covered by the Irish Exchequer. The level of Exchequer support is a clear and unambiguous indication of the commitment of the Government to protecting producers' incomes. I attended the beef fair in Germany where a Green Party Cabinet Minister ate Irish beef in front of the television cameras. That was a major achievement.</P>
    <P>These measures helped to sustain cattle prices in Ireland last year at a significantly higher level than normal relative to EU prices. For example, average steer prices increased from 90% of the EU average price for young bulls in 2000 to 99% in 2001.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern:</NameTxt>
      <P>This contrasts sharply with previous BSE scares, such as in 1996 when cattle prices in Ireland fell by more than the EU average, and is clear proof of our effective management of the beef sector through this crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle:</NameTxt>
      <P>Those are creative figures. The average had decreased. We had increased to 99% of a lower figure. Very clever scripting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern:</NameTxt>
      <P>These measures not alone supported beef prices but kept the processing sector functioning at a high level of activity and thereby protected jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Developments in cattle prices must be seen in the context of Agenda 2000, which provided for <Col N="283" /> a 20% reduction in prices over three years with compensation through increased premium payments. In the current year, the maximum premium payable on steers is 160 cent per kilogramme &ndash; 57p per pound &ndash; or &euro;540, that is, £420 per head.</P>
    <P>Agenda 2000 also provided for substantial increases in the suckler cow premium and for the inclusion of heifers in the premium system. The increase in these premiums substantially offset the fall in cattle prices in 2001, with the result that the majority of beef producers in Ireland enjoyed stable incomes last year in spite of the enormous market disturbance arising from the BSE crisis.</P>
    <P>One of the side effects of more recent BSE scares is that the market demand is much stronger for beef from younger animals and this is reflected in the development of significant price differentials between under and over 30 month cattle in the course of the past year. The importance of moving to under 30 month beef to meet this market demand has been emphasised on a regular basis throughout 2001 by my Department, Teagasc and Bord Bia. I stress this point once more. Our producers have no choice but to produce what the consumer wants and it is abundantly clear that the consumer wants under 30 month beef.</P>
    <P>There is no evidence, however, that farmers are experiencing difficulties in getting over 30 month cattle into factories. Judging by the increased prices now available for such cattle, factories are more than happy to accept them. The market for steers and heifers is quite strong and this is reflected in a substantial increase in prices in recent weeks. Steer prices have increased by over 15% since last November and prices of over 260 cent per kilogramme &ndash; 95p per pound &ndash; are being paid by many meat factories for under 30 month cattle. Even higher prices are being paid for heifers. Prices for over 30 month cattle are also strong and are now over 250 cent per kilogramme &ndash; 90p per pound.</P>
    <P>The market outlook for 2002 is favourable for steers, heifers and young bulls but, unfortunately, less so for cows. Demand on the UK market remained strong in the second half of 2001 because of the scarcity of beef there arising from FMD outbreaks both in the UK and in Argentina. Beef production in the UK is expected to fall further again this year as herd rebuilding begins, and this should offer additional market opportunities for Irish beef exporters.</P>
    <P>There are also signs of recovery in some of the continental markets, particularly Italy. Russia is our second major market and should continue to absorb significant quantities of Irish beef this year. The veterinary agreement with Egypt is in place and it is now a matter for the traders to conclude commercial contracts with Egyptian importers.</P>
    <P>The element of the motion dealing with the eradication of BSE from the national herd surprises me as it questions the very stringent BSE <Col N="284" /> control and eradication measures which have been in put in place since 1990. Those controls have the highest reputation among experts throughout the world and, according to the EU's scientific steering committee, have been &ldquo;optimally stable&rdquo; since 1 January, 1998. While constructive criticism is always welcome, criticism which fails to recognise the effectiveness of controls which have been in place for some considerable time can only cause concern to consumers and damage to the beef industry and the very many farm families who depend on it for their livelihoods.</P>
    <P>It is important, therefore, to set the record straight on this matter. Since 1989, Ireland has taken a proactive approach to the control and eradication of BSE. Measures adopted since then include the compulsory notification of the disease; a ban on the feeding of meat and bone meal to ruminants in 1990; the depopulation of herds, and the tracing and slaughter of birth cohorts, progeny and UK animals; a significant enhancement of feed controls in 1996, comprising a comprehensive licensing system which, <i>inter alia</i>, prohibited mills producing feed for non-ruminants using meat and bonemeal &ndash; similar measures were only introduced in many member states at the end of 2000; and a ban on the use of specified risk materials in the food and feed chains in 1997.</P>
    <P>These measures are underpinned by a comprehensive cattle movement monitoring system and are supplemented by ante-mortem examination of all animals at all abattoirs; detailed post-mortem checking of all beef carcases and ongoing audits by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, an authority that is entirely independent of the Department, at abattoirs and meat retail outlets.</P>
    <P>In addition, following the European BSE crisis in autumn 2000, the Council of Agriculture Ministers introduced a series of horizontal measures designed to further protect consumers, to address problems arising principally in other member states and to avoid unilateral actions which might adversely affect trade. These included, in addition to a range of market support measures, a ban, from 1 January 2001, on the feeding of meat and bonemeal to all animals for food production; increased active surveillance among at risk animals; and testing of all slaughtered animals over 30 months of age, resulting in almost 630,000 tests being conducted in 2001.</P>
    <P>Up to 1 million cattle will be tested in this manner in 2002. Senators will be aware that the number of BSE cases identified increased last year. This is fully in line with predictions by, among others, the scientific steering committee and our own veterinary experts and arises because of additional active surveillance. Of the 242 cases in 2001, 119 were identified under the active surveillance programme and most were identified in fallen animals which would not in any event have been destined for the food chain. Therefore, 123 cases were identified through passive surveillance, a significant decrease on the total of 145 cases identified in 2000. In addition, it remains <Col N="285" /> the case that BSE has not been confirmed here in any animal born after 1996. This demonstrates that the enhanced controls introduced in 1996 and 1997 are having the desired effect.</P>
    <P>It is also noteworthy that the age profile of cases has changed dramatically despite the higher number of cases over the last two years. In this regard, animals aged five years and under constituted 53% of those confirmed with BSE in 1998, while by 2001 this figure was down to 16%, despite the fact that more than 654,000 BSE tests were undertaken that year. This demonstrates that the control measures in place are working. These figures must be compared to a total national herd of 8 million animals.</P>
    <P>There has been some speculation in recent months in relation to the possibility of a targeted cull of older animals in certain circumstances. This approach warranted consideration and, to that end, my Department, in conjunction with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, recently conducted a feasibility study of cull options. Their conclusion, following this exercise, was that there was no scientific basis for proposing a targeted cull and that no significant additional health guarantees would be provided by such a strategy, providing that the existing control framework remained in place. I understand that this outcome has been accepted by the CJD advisory committee. My Department will, nevertheless, keep this option under review.</P>
    <P>It is easy to put forward radical solutions for the elimination of BSE. At one extreme, slaughtering the entire national herd would undoubtedly eradicate the disease. Other options have been advanced and considered but they do not represent solutions, in particular because they would not provide any significant public health guarantees and would be extremely expensive. In this regard, significant numbers of cattle would have to be slaughtered under any scenario for very marginal benefit, particularly in a situation where all animals over 30 months of age are, in any event, tested before entering the food chain.</P>
    <P>Thus, there is no quick-fix panacea for the eradication of BSE which stands up to detailed analysis. The measures we have in place, and which have been developed, introduced and effectively implemented by successive Administrations over the past 13 years, are working. These have as their primary aim the protection of human health and have also stood the test of time in terms of their credibility among potential customers for our beef.</P>
    <P>The Department continues to keep abreast of the latest scientific developments through its participation in the standing veterinary committee of the European Commission and its liaison with the EU's scientific steering committee. Neither the Department nor myself is inextricably wedded to a particular view of how best to tackle BSE. However, any changes in the existing policy must be on the basis of a proper analysis which is supported by the latest scientific data. Account <Col N="286" /> would also have to be taken of the alternative uses to which public funds can be put.</P>
    <P>The evidence to date is that the measures in place to control and eradicate BSE are proving effective and that BSE will be reduced and eradicated as older animals leave the system. At this point, I do not propose to introduce any radical changes to the existing policy unless there are sound, science-based reasons for doing so. I admire the Department's policy of openness, transparency and traceability with regard to BSE. We provide the figures and when decreases occur, it will stand to us on export markets.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the premium arrangements. The motion again demonstrates a lack of understanding of the real position and the efforts made to assist the small number of farmers whose applications incurred penalties, mostly due to late submissions. In excess of 1.4 million payments, valued at &euro;1.1 billion, were issued to farmers during 2001 under the various livestock premia, compensatory allowance and arable aid schemes. Following the successful outcome of Agenda 2000, the rates of payment under the various schemes will reach their highest level this year. Taken together with REPS, these payments represent 120% of farm incomes of cattle and sheep producers and approximately 75% of the income of tillage farmers. Given the scale of the moneys received from the European Union for these schemes, there have to be controls and regulations; otherwise, the funds will not be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the need to simplify documentation and I have made it clear that our documentation should be kept under constant review with the aim of keeping it as clear and straightforward as possible. In recent years, my Department, in consultation with farm bodies and with the progressive use of information technology, has made major progress in simplifying the application procedure under the various schemes. The changes introduced include: pre-printing of personal details, including name, address, herd number and, in the case of area aid, land parcel identification numbers on application forms; use of bar coding on bovine animal passports &ndash; in most cases there is no need to list tag numbers on applications; provision of CMMS herd profiles to assist farmers in completing extensification census forms; automatic processing of entitlement to slaughter premium without the need for farmers to submit an application; and the removal of certain notification requirements. Such information is now taken from the database.</P>
    <P>There is a widespread perception that many farmers were unfairly penalised under the various schemes, but this is not borne out by the facts. For example, under the 2000 schemes, some 169,000 applications were received under the special beef premium scheme. Of these, 4,088 or 2.42% attracted a penalty.</P>

      <P>Of the cases penalised, 742 or 18% arose because of the late submission of an area aid application. Believe it or not, some people did not even sign the application forms. The forms then had to be returned to them for signature but were still not returned in time. Under the 2000 suckler cow premium scheme, 71,078 applications were received. Of these, 2,695 or 4.12% attracted a penalty. Of the cases penalised, 1,165 or 40% arose because of late submission of either the area aid application or the suckler cow application. A similar pattern prevails in so far as the 2000 ewe premium scheme is concerned. Some 41,210 applications were received and of these, 2,110 or 5.12% attracted a penalty. Of the cases penalised, 1,311 or 54% arose because of late submission of the application.</P>

Nevertheless, we have been to the forefront in raising the question of simplification of the rules surrounding the penalty regime at the Council of Agriculture Ministers. A new EU regulation was published on 12 December last. It is of the utmost importance that farmers fully understand the rules governing these schemes so that they can maximise their entitlements. The Department has published an information booklet which is being sent to every farmer in the country.</P>

      <P>The outlook for 2002 is quite good. The market for steers and heifers is quite strong with an increase of 15% since last November. The price is approximately 95p per pound across the board.

      <P>Our UK market is very successful at present and I hope it continues to be so.

      <P>The truth hurts and corrections to misinformation and misstatements also hurt. An all-Ireland approach is desirable. The Minister and Ministers of State are in daily contact with the authorities in the Northern counties. That should be expanded and a one country approach should be taken to the control of animal diseases. The foot and mouth disease crisis illustrated the benefits of working together. Farmers, North and South, the industry as a whole and related industries would gain enormously from a one country approach.</P>
      <P>There are future challenges, including the expansion of the European Union, and there is a need to ensure that competent people are placed in charge of the industry. In this regard, even the Opposition seems to be of the view that it is desirable for the Minister and Ministers of State to continue in office after the general election. Their competence is especially needed to deal with the forthcoming review of the CAP to ensure that what emerges will be of best advantage to Irish agriculture. The WTO talks are ongoing and negative results could ensue for this country in the absence of competent people in charge of agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The foot and mouth disease crisis was the greatest challenge to the country in many years. We must recognise the enormous competence of those involved in agriculture. Their prompt and <Col N="291" /> decisive action and the successful implementation of wide-ranging and stringent control measures ensured that the one outbreak that occurred in Proleek, County Louth, was contained and the threat to the national economy averted. A recent estimate put the net direct cost of the outbreak of the disease in the UK at Stg£2.7 billion. It indicates what could have happened in this country had the virus achieved a foothold. As it was, the net cost to the Department was approximately IR£30 million.</P>
    <P>The foot and mouth disease crisis overshadowed difficulties in the beef market. The disclosure of BSE cases in some European Union member states this time last year impacted adversely on all beef markets. The purchase for destruction scheme, which operated from January to June 2001, and the special purchase scheme, operated by the Department from July 2001, supported the market for Irish beef. Some 278,025 cattle were removed from the market under the purchase for destruction scheme, while 153,838 steers, 87,290 cows, 34,226 heifers and 2,671 bulls were also removed.</P>
    <P>The reopening of the Egyptian market is to be welcomed. It is for the industry and those in the trade to negotiate and sell good quality Irish beef. I am pleased with the documentation provided by the Minister of State. I support what he said. Coming from a rural constituency, he has displayed his competence on many occasions, as has the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, especially with the various programmes he has introduced. We in rural Ireland will do well from their efforts and the Opposition will also benefit.</P>

What is the Department and the Minister doing to address this? We have heard nothing about the opening of further markets.</P>
      <P>Almost every farmer in the country is baffled with the form filling requirements. This problem goes back many years when other Governments were in office. There must be a way in which this process can be simplified. Severe penalties can be imposed for even the slightest mistakes. For example, Department inspectors can decide to deduct &euro;500 or &euro;600 from a payment due to a farmer for an incorrect detail. Despite this, the Department can make any mistake and nothing can be done about it. Will the Minister have a look at the simplification of forms for farmers?

      <P>I would welcome it if the Minister of State said the filling out of those forms would be simplified. I hope this will help farmers so that they will not be penalised.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke:</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not far away. Many people are worried about water quality and there were heated exchanges between fishermen and farmers. This issue will have to addressed. Everyone is concerned about water quality. In the Crossmolina area, there is the Deel River, and many lakes such as Lough Conn, Lough Cullen and so on. The farming community is blamed for the increased levels of phosphates in the lakes. The fisheries board has said that despite the drafting of the Lough Conn report by Mayo County Council and other groups in 1993 the level of phosphates has increased, even with restrictions on farmers in regard to the spreading of slurry. Given that restrictions have been imposed on farmers in regard to the building of houses, septic tanks etc. it is a matter of concern that phosphate levels have increased in the lakes.</P>
      <P>When a tank is full the farmer has no option but to spread the slurry. The Department should ensure that farmers have extra storage capacity. The Department has said in most cases it would allow only the minimum requirement for slurry to farmers. Farmers should have extra storage capacity and they should be grant-aided. They are put in a precarious position when they have to empty tanks in wet weather in areas such as the Moy catchment area which includes Lough Conn, Lough Cullen and Lough Gara.</P>
      <P>I am pleased the Minister of State has seen the light in regard to the simplification of the forms and I hope he will look at the issue of grant-aiding farmers for extra storage capacity for slurry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and the opportunity to discuss this important subject. Having said that, I am a little confused. While Senator Connor addressed the subject in great detail, Senator Doyle did not. She gave us a long dissertation on her work in Europe in the European Parliament but did not address either the motion tabled by Fine Gael Senators or the amendment tabled by Senator Cassidy. I was disappointed because I thought with all her knowledge, Senator Doyle would have been able to contribute something constructive to the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The one thing people tend to forget is the complexity of the BSE problem. From day one, when it was first discovered, the biggest difficulty people faced was a lack of knowledge of the disease. Because of that we are only feeling our way through it. The knowledge is not available anywhere. The only knowledge we have is that scrapie, a related disease, is known to have been in the sheep herd right across Europe for many years. If Fine Gael was in Government I would say exactly what I am about to say, because I have <Col N="294" /> strong views on this issue. We are feeling our way through this problem. The scientists do not know all the details. The foot and mouth disease last year was also complicated but scientifically we knew a good deal more about it than we know at this stage about BSE.</P>
    <P>The first thing that has to be borne in mind in adopting any measures in regard to BSE has to be the safety of human health. That has driven not only our approach to dealing with it but the approach of all other countries in Europe. All the European export markets for beef suffered hugely as a result of BSE, but it hit us far more heavily than any other country, simply because we export so much of our beef. I ask Senators to put matters in proper context when referring to this issue.</P>
    <P>I read an interesting article by Dr. Mark Rogers of the department of zoology in UCD on the strategies for the control of BSE and scrapie in which he outlined factors that must be considered in designing an effective control strategy. These include better understanding of the epidemiology of the disease; developing rapid and reliable tests for the disease; introducing a suitable surveillance system for both BSE and scrapie; minimising the consequences for farmers that have BSE infected animals; and implementing and monitoring legislation to prohibit the spread of potentially infectious material.</P>
    <P>If one looks at the measures implemented by this Government and all Governments since the late 1980s and early 1990s, they have followed all those procedures extremely effectively. The areas in which we are deficient are in gaining a better understanding of the epidemiology of the disease from somebody working in the area and developing rapid and reliable tests for it. That is where our deficiencies lie. If we could go out tomorrow morning, test an animal on the spot and get a recording <i> in vivo</i> from an animal we would be in a much stronger position, but that cannot be done.</P>
    <P>With regard to the BSE figures about which my colleagues on the Fine Gael benches are concerned, the reason they are increasing is simple. It is due to the surveillance system that is in place. Last year, more than 650,000 cattle were tested for BSE, which is a huge increase. Furthermore, many of the cases concern fallen animals and, consequently, the number of cases will rise. In these circumstances, one cannot expect the figure to fall.</P>
    <P>It should also be borne in mind that, although the surveillance mechanism for scrapie has been in place for several years, the number of annual tests will rise from 8,000 to 60,000 this year. This is the way we must go. One can only conclude that the measures being implemented by the Government are effective and are helping to develop a knowledge of the disease. In terms of human health, which has to be the ultimate objective, we have all possible guarantees that our meat products are safe.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="295" />A further issue to bear in mind is that the original outbreak of BSE was connected to a change in the process for rendering meat and bonemeal, which lowered the temperature at which rendering took place. Many scientists believe this was the cause of BSE. Regardless of whether that is the case, this potential source has been eliminated and the likelihood of the disease spreading has been minimised to the extent to which current scientific knowledge allows. It is imperative, therefore, that we try to take a strong scientific approach to the problem.</P>
    <P>The beef industry will recover from BSE, but it will take time. The Egyptian market is evidence of this &ndash; it is open, but nothing is being bought because of a latent and understandable fear. We must continue to convince people that our products are safe and develop the current system throughout our food production industry. The House would be much better off focusing on these matters rather than attacking the Minister and his Department. Given that we are in the run-up to an election, it is, however, understandable. What more can one expect?</P>
    <P>The motion refers to the &ldquo;utter failure to simplify the application documentation&rdquo;. There is no question that this has been a problem. The amount of documentation required is enormous and has caused huge difficulties for many farmers. I welcome the new booklet which will help people fill in the forms and reduce the number of farmers who are penalised. Having said that, the system is providing an extremely important bank of information and knowledge about our herds and the situation at farm level. It must, therefore, be maintained.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the level of penalties for people who make errors filling out forms. This matter should be addressed because, as the Minister of State pointed out, many of the errors are relatively minor. People are penalised, for example, for forgetting to sign forms. We need to take a more humane attitude. While I welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue, I would prefer to have a more constructive debate, based on the presentation of the facts, so that we can move forward together.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Davern, to the House and compliment him and his colleagues, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh, and the Minister of State at the <Col N="296" /> Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Ó Cuív, on their work.</P>
      <P>I listened with great care to the points made by the Opposition, but the amendment has my strong support. Last autumn we addressed the predictions made by experts with regard to beef prices, one of the main sources of income for farmers. They all stated that the maximum price was 86p a pound, which is around &euro;1.09. Even cattle of over 30 months, which they argued would not be required, are now making prices far in excess of that figure. Great credit is due to the Minister, his staff and Bord Bia, which took Opposition flak this evening, for their work in ensuring that there is an outlet for our produce at a favourable price.</P>
      <P>Sometimes it helps to examine the position in one's county to find out what is happening in the country at large. In my county, Offaly, we have approximately 4,000 farming households. Last year direct payments for livestock and crop enterprises in the county amounted to &euro;33 million, a significant sum which reflects the underlying strength of our farming sector. Since many of the payments reflect numbers of livestock and hectares of crops, this figure indicates that farming is adjusting successfully to the many challenges created by the various policy and market regimes.</P>
      <P>Further support for the rural economy of County Offaly includes some &euro;6 million annually for participants in the REP scheme, more than &euro;2 million annually for farmers participating in the early retirement scheme and a further &euro;1.6 million annually to farmers who have planted land. When these figures are extrapolated across the country, one realises that a substantial sum of money is arriving in the form of subsidies. This must be welcomed.</P>
      <P>Offaly is a small county, much of which is currently under water as a result of flooding. A &euro;43 million annual input to a rural economy of its size is significant by any standards. These figures augur well for the future and illustrate the healthy state of farming which is attributable, at least in part, to the major steps taken by the Government to ensure that farming is maintained as the backbone of the rural economy.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State and other speakers referred to several problems and outlined areas where improvements have occurred. Among other things, the difficulties associated with filling out forms were raised. Despite these difficulties, change is necessary. As the Minister of State stated, the expertise of Teagasc is available to the farming organisations to ensure problems are rectified, mistakes are not made and payments are made on time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speakers complained about calf registration. As matters stand, a completed calf registration will be dealt with practically by return of post. This is progress. The Opposition knocked the system when it commenced, claiming that calves would be weanlings by the time the registration process was completed. This is no longer the case. <Col N="297" /> In Bandon, for instance, there is a fast turn around. Most schemes now send farmers the list of their stock and the numbers, with the age profile on it. The system is being simplified month after month by the Department officials to whom great credit is due, and I have no doubt the process will improve further.</P>
    <P>We are not dealing with small numbers. There are approximately 130,000 to 140,000 cattle holdings in the country and perhaps 40,000 sheep holdings. Those are not small numbers, yet the system is working well and it is wrong to come into this House and criticise the Minister and the Department in this motion.</P>
    <P>I was always against paying beef subsidies for Holstein cattle, but that is a matter for another day. On the percentage of stock in the dry heifer scheme, we may have to change that. Our numbers may decrease to such an extent that we may have to examine that again.</P>
    <P>Great play was made of the BSE crisis and the testing process but, as the Minister of State said in his contribution, the numbers have increased because he introduced testing for old and fallen stock. Prior to that, many of those fallen animals were being dumped and we did not know about it. All fallen stock is now tested, which is a welcome development. We now know that feedstuffs are being tested regularly so that we can ensure that animals are being fed the very best and that there is no danger of a risk of BSE.</P>
    <P>We must have great confidence in agriculture. Prices are substantial at present. One pound per lb is the current price for cattle. Who would have thought in the September-October-November period that would be the case? It was all doom and gloom at that time, but with the great work done by Bord Bia, the Minister and the Department, farmers are getting a proper price for their stock.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle is here this evening at enormous expense to tell us how bad matters are elsewhere, but if she talked to farmers in Wexford she would know they are very happy. Everything is going well in Wexford and throughout the country.</P>

I am intrigued by Senator Moylan's comment about a pound per lb for cattle, or &euro;1.27 per lb. It is only a day since I bought a lb of mincemeat for &euro;1.89 in my local butcher, and that is the leftover bits they get rid of.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I remember a Wednesday afternoon in July about three years ago when a delegation led by the leader of the IFA, now the Progressive Democrats candidate for Laoighis-Offaly, came in to talk to us about the woes of agriculture. That was before the single currency. As was his wont, he made a very eloquent, well-prepared and effective presentation. Among other matters he said that if the country were to be divided, as it subsequently was, into two regions for European support, farmers should get the same level of support regardless of the region in which they lived, unlike everybody else, because they were special. We know they are special. Having spent half an hour addressing a committee of the two Houses of the Oireachtas, the IFA forgot to mention either consumers or the marketplace. I do not know of any other business, including the trade union movement, that could talk for half an hour about the interests of members and forget to mention the marketplace, food quality, etc. Having said that, the country under-invests in everything that can sustain a vibrant community in rural Ireland but the way that is done is a matter with which I and most Members of this House would take issue.</P>
      <P>I have no problem with sustaining a rural lifestyle by State supports. I am a socialist. I believe in the use of the State to redistribute resources but I have a problem with an industry &ndash; I am not sure if that is the correct term &ndash; in which the primary producers now get approximately half their income from other than the sale of produce, which amounts to approximately &euro;1 billion per annum.</P>

      <P>Apart from the top 15% of farmers who should not be subsidised, that is not a bad idea. I have no problem with subsidising a lifestyle that has so many positive contributions to make, particularly when it is linked to environmental performance. What I have a problem with is that we expect somebody else to pay for it. The two Government parties believe in lowering taxation all the time, and we got eloquent testimony of that from the Progressive Democrats last weekend. They do not want taxation, but they want farmers to get &euro;1.5 billion from somebody. From whom will it come? It will come from the poor misfortunate taxpayers in the rest of Europe who have to pay reasonable levels of tax that we are avoiding. That is unsustainable and profoundly unjust. To suggest that people in other <Col N="299" /> countries should pay taxes so that our farmers and Irish society should avoid paying taxes is wrong.</P>

      <P>I wish to make a short contribution. My success in convincing the Minister of State to put down an amendment relating to sheep tagging to the Diseases of Animals (Amendment) Bill, 2001, has encouraged me to get involved in agricultural matters once more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Minister is familiar with Eurovet, a good method of animal traceability which has been developed in this country. The system, which can be used for all animals, has been tried in some countries which are candidates for EU membership, but I am disappointed that it has not been brought forward here. Perhaps the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development will look more favourably on it now that I have raised it. I have been in contact with the Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development in the North, Bríd Rodgers, and I encountered a great deal of enthusiasm about Eurovet. This ideal method of traceability should be introduced on an all-island basis, especially given the difficulties we faced during the foot and mouth disease crisis last year. I encourage the Minister of <Col N="300" /> State and his Department to make a concentrated effort to examine this proposition. I do not think it would be expensive and it would certainly be worthwhile.</P>
    <P>While I appreciate that it is sometimes difficult to implement the findings of research which is at an early stage, it may have been an advantage for us last year if, rather than having to resort to the destruction scheme, we could have used a new urine test which can identify prions in animals infected with BSE. I hope the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development's immediate goals lie in such areas, as the destruction scheme cost the taxpayer an enormous amount of money last year. It will cost even more when we begin to dispose of the carcases.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Department has many things to do, but it should keep an eye on research developments so that they can be put to practical use as soon as possible. It is particularly important that we progress on an all-island basis, as our island status gives us an advantage not shared by European countries with large land borders.</P>

      <P>I want to deal with the Minister of State's speech as, unlike Senator Norris, I found it far from satisfactory. The first issue I raised this evening was the beef market and I cited information I have received from Bord Bia, a body in which the Government and I have great confidence. Bord Bia has said there will be a price collapse similar to that last autumn if we cannot find a market for 100,000 tonnes of beef later this year. I asked the Minister of State to outline what <Col N="301" /> is being done to improve the market to absorb the additional supply of meat.</P>
      <P>Senators on the other side of the House have made a great deal of the fact that the price of beef is buoyant at present, but that is because sales are at a trickle, as is always the case at this time of year. The annual pattern of beef disposal in Ireland is that 90% of disposals take place between August and December. We face the same pattern as last year, when there was a 20% drop in the price of certain animals within three weeks in August, while the Minister of State was on holiday and while Brussels was shut down.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Moffatt, to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, for being here this evening. He will recall that last June I raised this matter on the Adjournment and that I was deliberate and sustained in the points I made on that occasion. I will not reiterate every one of them as I take it the Minister is aware of them. I refer specifically to the debate we had in the House on that occasion.</P>
      <P>The Minister was relatively generous in his response last June. However, he said that the report of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland's scientific sub-committee on any risks associated with the reconstitution of infant formula with fluoridated tap water would be published in September. He also indicated a certain acceptance of the need to prioritise this area. I am speaking to the Minister not only in his capacity as a politician, as I am, but also as a medical doctor with a particular interest in this area.</P>
      <P>We know the statistics. The British Medical Association has very clear views on the safe limit for fluoride concentration in infant formula. This limit is 0.15 ppm. The average load of fluoride in public sector tap water in this country is many times this, at least 0.5 ppm. A neonate drinks a pint of reconstituted infant formula per day in the first three months of its life. Medically, scientifically or nutritionally, fluoride is not necessary in any amount &ndash; even a trace amount &ndash;  in our diet. Some 40 or 50 years ago there was some justification, given the level of scientific knowledge and the major problem with dental caries and oral hygiene generally, for embarking on a policy of mass medication of the public water supply.</P>
      <P>My feelings are extremely strong about the risk to neonates and young children from having to ingest such quantities of fluoride, a totally non-essential nutrient, in their infant formula. It is a specific risk because we have a special duty of care to children. Apart from that risk, I ask the Minister whether it is still ethically sustainable to mass medicate the people with a totally unnecessary nutrient that has long since proven to do more harm than good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The original defence was the need to reduce the rate of dental caries. Since fluoridated tooth<Col N="305" /><Col N="306" /> paste &ndash; it is almost impossible to buy non-fluoridated toothpaste &ndash; and the compulsory fluoridation of the public water supply, there is no doubt that there is over-ingestion of fluoride by the 75% of the Irish public dependent on the public water supply.</P>
    <P>Is it ethical to continue compulsory medication with a totally unnecessary element such as fluoride? I ask the Minister to look at the issue. How much longer do we have to wait? Since we spoke in June, almost eight months ago, two or three generations of neonates have been reared. The first three to six months of life are the critical period in terms of infant formula as that is before infants move on to solids or alternative sources of nutrition.</P>
    <P>What is our response to the crisis? What is the Minister's response as a Minister in the Department of Health and Children and a medical doctor who understands the implications of what I am talking about? What is his response to the fact that one in three of our children shows evidence of overdose and fluoride toxicity by fluorosis in their teeth? We can read the evidence of overdosing by fluoride and of the damage done to those children through fluorosis. How do we know the damage done to the unborn child, to the neonate or to those with no alternative but public water?</P>
    <P>There is a well accepted principle, the precautionary principle, in scientific and environmental circles. That principle means that there must be political regulation of scientific uncertainty. The scientific jury is out on the issue of fluoridation but there is a growing body of evidence from around the world that it is an unsafe practice. At the very least, while the scientists differ and the jury is out, the Minister should invoke the precautionary principle and cease an unnecessary practice. Fluoridation is unnecessary medically and nutritionally and is a dangerous practice because of the unscientific source of fluoride we are using, the lack of testing by local authorities, despite what the FSAI says, and the arbitrary manner in which our public supply is fluoridated.</P>
    <P>The Minister should please put on the FSAI hat and invoke the precautionary principle. He should not wait for the formal fluoridation report. Why has that been delayed yet again? Will we see a report this side of the general election? I apologise for being somewhat cynical but I must put the point bluntly. I asked for an update on the delay in publishing the report of the FSAI and the Department of Health and Children. There is also an Eastern Regional Health Authority report which is not due until mid-2002. How much longer must we prevaricate and how much longer must we wait for a responsible Minister to invoke the precautionary principle in this area of mass medication?</P>
    <P>Will the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, note that if there have been problems for this and the previous Government in relation to the anti-D hepatitis C tragedy those problems will be only <Col N="307" /> an introduction to the class action that is likely to result, unless there is an immediate precautionary action by a responsible Minister, in the area of fluoridation and mass medication of our public water supply? Some 98% of Europe and almost all the developed world have abandoned fluoridation so why have the Irish authorities a monopoly of wisdom on the issue notwithstanding the global experience?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Doyle for raising this issue. I addressed the Seanad on 19 June 2001 and set out the initiatives being undertaken to consider the safety of infant formula reconstituted with fluoridated water. I welcome this opportunity to update this House on developments since then.</P>
      <P>In June I pointed out that the issue of infant formula reconstituted with fluoridated water had been raised at the forum on fluoridation. In response, the Food Safety Authority, which is represented on the forum, requested its scientific sub-committee on additives, contaminants and residues to conduct a risk assessment in relation to this issue. The group was due to report by September 2001. I am informed by the authority that the primary reason for the delay in publication of the report on risk assessment of potential hazards of using fluoridated water for reconstituting infant formula is that the issues involved are complex and are still under discussion by the scientific sub-committee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt:</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a large amount of scientific literature under review by the scientific committee, which is a voluntary committee made up of members with full-time commitments outside the Food Safety Authority. However, the authority is keen to produce a balanced report taking into account all available scientific facts and evidence. I am informed that the key issues under discussion relate to how to define harmful effects, what levels of fluoride cause harmful effects and what is the scientific and real evidence that these levels actually cause harm. The Food Safety Authority expects that a final report will be referred from its scientific committee to the board following the meeting of the committee on 6 March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>International consensus on the issue of infant formula and risk of over-exposure to fluoride causing dental fluorosis is not established. While dental fluorosis is recognised as an increasing problem in the United States of America, a <Col N="308" /> recent report of August 2001 from the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention on fluoride use does not advise reconstituting infant formula with water low in fluoride. A 1997 report from the UK comes to a similar conclusion.</P>
    <P>I am advised that dental fluorosis has not been observed to be a problem in baby teeth in this country. Nonetheless, because of increasing interest in the amount and pattern of fluoride ingested by infants up to the age of six months, my Department has commissioned research on the prevalence of enamel fluorosis and of infant feeding practices.</P>
    <P>When account is taken of the age at which the formation of enamel of the crowns of primary and permanent teeth commences, the level of fluorosis in primary molars is regarded as a good indicator of the amount of fluoride ingested during the period up to six months of age. The main aim of the research which has been commissioned is to measure the prevalence of dental fluorosis in primary teeth in five year old residents of fluoridated and non-fluoridated communities and to relate these findings to the pattern of infant feeding. Until this research is completed we will not have a definitive picture as to whether and to what extent infant feeding practices, including the use of infant formula, contribute to dental fluorosis in baby teeth. Studies have shown that children under five years of age living in fluoridated communities have much better dental health than children living in non-fluoridated areas.</P>
    <P>The second part of Senator Doyle's motion refers to the publication of the report of the forum on fluoridation. Lest there be confusion, I stress that the publication of the forum's report is not dependent on the report of the Food Safety Authority. The forum was originally to report in September 2001. As a result of foot and mouth disease precautions, the March 2001 meeting was cancelled and on foot of this a one month extension was approved to October 2001.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the chairman of the forum on fluoridation that a number of complex issues arose during finalisation of the report which caused a considerable additional and unexpected workload and further delay. I understand that the report's editor suffered a serious illness over the Christmas period from which he is only now recovering. A final draft of the report will be considered at a meeting of the forum scheduled for tomorrow and I presume it will be published in the near future.</P>
