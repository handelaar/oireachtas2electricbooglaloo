      <P>I have received notice from Senator Taylor-Quinn that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands to outline the urgent situation regarding the provision of passenger and cargo services to the Aran Islands and to ensure the services provided comply with the conditions laid down by her Department.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Costello of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to ensure that St. Joseph's primary school, East Wall, Dublin 3, obtains the staffing ratio and resources to which it is entitled.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>I take this opportunity as Leader of the House, on my own behalf and that of the Fianna Fáil Party, to offer our sincere condolences to the families and friends of the two brave gardaí, Garda Tony Tighe and Garda Michael Padden, and Private Peadar Ó Flaithearta, all of whom lost their lives while on duty serving the public interest. The whole country has been immensely moved by the tragic deaths of the two gardaí who died just half an hour after coming on duty in the early hours of Sunday morning last. The nation was just learning of the awful circumstances of this terrible tragedy when we were further shocked by the news of the death of Private Peadar Ó Flaithearta in the service of the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a nation, we rightly take pride in the professionalism with which members of both the Garda Síochána and the Army carry out their <Col N="1638" /> duties in various jurisdictions where they have served. They have done much to bring honour to the country. This tragedy brings home to us all the true nature of public service and the sacrifices and risks undertaken for us on a daily basis by members of the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces. Garda Tighe and Garda Padden were the 40th and 41st members of the force to die on duty. Like so many before them, they knew they were exposing themselves to risks when they responded to the call for help on Sunday morning last, but they put the safety and defence of our community before their own.</P>
    <P>In paying tribute to their courage and bravery, we also pay tribute to the force as a whole. Such events bring home to us all the nature of their job, the dangers they face on our behalf, the risks they regularly face and the injuries, including death, which they sometimes sustain. On behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party and on my own behalf as Leader of the House, I offer my wholehearted condolences to the families, relatives and friends of the three unfortunate men who have lost their lives in recent days. Go ndéana Dia trócaire orthu.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of my party, I join the Leader of the House in paying tribute to the three men who lost their lives in the public service during the last week. I express to the families of Garda Tighe and Garda Padden and Private Ó Flaithearta deepest personal sympathy at this very difficult time in their great loss. All of us feel their loss and send our deepest sympathy to them.</P>
      <P>In the case of Garda Tighe and Garda Padden, they were simply doing their duty. They were acting in the best traditions of the Garda Síochána, a force that has served the country very well over the past 80 years. It is at a time like this that we realise that, whatever difficulties the Garda may have in certain areas, it has always been an honest, upright and public spirited police force and that in the Garda Síochána we have one of the best police forces in the world. When we see the simple devotion to duty which resulted in the two men concerned making the supreme sacrifice last Sunday we realise how often just how close doing their duty can be to serious injury or even, as in this case, death. In that and every other sense I send the sympathy of my party to their families and the police force.</P>
      <P>In the case of Private Peadar Ó Flaithearta, he too represented one of the finest public traditions of this country, devotion to peacekeeping, which has been the characteristic of the Army for almost half a century. He died serving humanitarian causes and peace, among people who probably did not know or appreciate what he was doing. When we consider the intervention of the Irish forces in recent years we realise the major contribution they have made. To his family, the Chief of Staff and the Army, I send the sympathy of my party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>We, on the Independent benches, wish to be very much associated with the expressions of sympathy we have heard. Coming from a garda's family, I understand the shock waves that go through, not only the immediate family, but the Garda force on such occasions which, unfortunately, are becoming more and more regular. It was something about which we knew very little growing up. The death of a garda on duty was such a rare occurrence. However, we are now seeing more and more gardaí being injured and paying the ultimate price in such situations.</P>
      <P>A death at any time is something with which it is very hard to come to terms, but especially so when it is sudden. It is even worse when it happens when somebody is going about the course of his or her work. The idea of somebody dying in his or her workplace or in the course of his or her work, as in this case, is utterly unacceptable. It becomes even more unacceptable in the situation about which we are talking. The two men concerned were protecting the community. It is the supreme irony that in that work they should be killed by the irresponsibility of a few in the community. This is something with which their families will have extraordinary difficulty in coming to terms.</P>
      <P>It is important to say at this time that we have often been quick to raise questions and queries about the behaviour of gardaí in the course of their duties. It behoves us on this occasion to remind ourselves that the right balance should always be borne in mind, that the vast majority of gardaí go about their work quietly and efficiently on a daily basis. Thankfully, we do not hear of injuries to and accidents involving members of the force, but they take a risk on our behalf in parts of the community in various parts of the country. This is something we, as Members of the Oireachtas, should recognise. The gardaí concerned were quietly and efficiently going about their duties with a huge sense of commitment, a growing sense of responsibility and their only objective was to make our community and society safe for us, our children and other generations. Ar dheis Dé go siad.</P>
      <P>In the case of Private Peadar Ó Flaithearta, we have always felt a closeness with those members of the Army who have gone abroad on duty. It is certainly the case that when somebody is killed by accident in the course of his or her duties it becomes more difficult to understand how situations of life could arise, but they do. We must also feel for the person who caused the accident. There is a huge double loss in this situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel a certain closeness to the events here because I spent every summer in Lettermore where my father was born. Private Ó Flaithearta came from a very small community and our hearts must go out to that small community and also to Garda Padden's community, family and extended family in Belmullet. That community will have been rocked as well by what happened. I have met the extended family of Garda Padden <Col N="1640" /> on many occasions and they are held in high regard. It is extraordinary to see young men lose their lives on our behalf. Ar dheis Dé go raibh siad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I express my sympathy and condolences to the families of the deceased gardaí, Tony Tighe and Michael Padden, and the member of the Defence Forces, Private Peadar Flaherty, who died on service with the United Nations in East Timor. It was a terrible shock to hear of the three deaths and the circumstances in which they occurred made it even more shocking. We heard that the son of Tony Tighe, himself a garda, came upon his father following the collision when his father was dying. It must have been a horrible trauma and we can imagine the impact it has had on their families, friends and neighbours.</P>
      <P>It brings home to us what it means to be in public service and at the cutting edge. The Garda Síochána daily face crime which is becoming more violent. Our Defence Forces are doing a wonderful job abroad on peacekeeping duties with the United Nations. Both forces, the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces, have, in many cases, suffered the ultimate sacrifice. Large numbers have died in the service of their country at home and abroad. We, as legislators and Members of Parliament, should be particularly appreciative of that and should, as we are doing today, offer our sincere sympathy and condolences to the families of those who have died and who are the real heroes on this island. We hear talk of other heroes but these are the real heroes &ndash; the people who give their lives, the ultimate sacrifice, in the service of their country. Ar dheis Dé go raibh siad.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats and on my own behalf, I join in this expression of sympathy to the families of Garda Tony Tighe, Garda Michael Padden and Private Peadar Flaherty. It is perhaps only on these occasions we realise the great task the Defence Forces and the Garda undertake on behalf of the people. They are the custodians of our democracy and that is something to which we perhaps do not pay enough attention often enough. It is on occasions such as this that we pause and think about the jobs they do. The gardaí and the members of the Defence Forces know they are taking risks, but I do not think anybody could have imagined that two gardaí would be killed in such appalling circumstances. It was quite beyond belief. There are matters which arise from it. However, they are not matters for today but for another day when we consider some of the issues which surround these events. I do not think it could have been imagined when the two gardaí went on duty that they would have met their deaths in such a sudden and violent fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to Private Peadar Flaherty, the Cathaoirleach and the House will be aware that we have taken a very keen interest in East Timor <Col N="1641" /> over an extended period so we feel a certain affinity with events that take place there even though it is so far away. It was a matter of considerable satisfaction to us that Ireland was involved in the peacekeeping taking place there. It was an appalling and tragic accident and one feels for the private's colleagues serving in the area. In the cases of the two gardaí and of Private Flaherty, we feel for their colleagues throughout both services and, in particular, for the communities from which they came and for their families. We extend our deepest sympathy to them.</P>

      <P>I compliment Senator Farrell and Senator Moylan on their appointments. They are both very straight and decent and we have no difficulty doing business with them &ndash; although for how long is another matter. The Leader would be the first to admit there has been a great deal of uncertainty about our business over the last week or two and into next week. Does he expect that there will be any legislation taken by the House other than that already indicated by the Whip for this week &ndash; the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal (Amendment) Bill? Does he expect any more legislation or is he aware of any other legislation to be taken by the House before we break while the other House has its general election?</P>
      <P>Does the Leader know when the House will adjourn for the general election? As the Leader of the House, he is in constant communication with the leader of the other House and will have an intimate knowledge of what the leader of the other House is thinking on these matters. He might share that information with the rest of us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise a matter that would have been inappropriate during the expressions of sympathy. Reports of the accident which killed the two gardaí indicate that the two young people driving the car had been refused admission to Oberstown House. The staff at Oberstown House operate according to the law. There is no question of their having discretion and they act as they have to do. They are over-stretched and any suggestion that they were responsible for not taking in those children is wrong. There is a lack of structure to deal with these cases. Centres such as Oberstown House are working beyond their limit and do what is required of them and no more. Many issues are flying around at present. This morning's report on this issue was bad as it seemed to indicate that this incident would not have happened if someone at Oberstown House had taken a different decision. That is not the case and it is grossly unfair to the staff.</P>
      <P>Le tamall anuas tá ráitis ag teacht ó Airí Stáit mar gheall ar an tuarascáil atá le foilsiú ag Coimisiún na Gaeltachta. This House has discussed this time and again, ach níl teacht ar an tuarascáil ag an bpointe seo. Ní thugann sé cothrom na Féinne dúinne, Baill an Oireachtais, ná do mhuintir na Gaeltachta nach bhfuil an tuarascáil seo ar fáil. An bhfuil an tuarascáil foilsithe nó cathain a foilseofar í? Tá cearta mhuintir na Gaeltachta ag brath ar a foilsiú. Ceapaim féin go bhfuil a lán gearán sa tuarascáil a chuireann i gcoinne mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus gur mar gheall air sin nach bhfuil deifir ar an Rialtas í a cur i gcló roimh an toghcháin. Níl sin cóir. Ba cheart go mbéadh an tuarascáil foilsithe agus díospóireacht uirthi sa Teach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1643" />I ask the Leader to bring as much pressure as possible to bear so that copies of the report of Coimisiún na Gaeltachta are made available to Members and we can discuss it. Many Members will feel vindicated about their comments regarding policy towards the Irish language and the lack of support for Gaeltachtaí over the years. I would welcome the publication of this report. The current situation is wrong and unfair to Members. Members would be furious if Ministers debated any other issue to which they had no access. The entire report was almost published in the Tuarascáil section of yesterday's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> and Members are being denigrated by not having access to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps we should refer to her new promotion. I also congratulate Senator Moylan on his appointment as assistant Whip. I am sure they will do an excellent job in the period which remains.</P>
      <P>I wish to follow Senator O'Toole's comments regarding the recent tragic events, but I did not wish to make the point during the tributes. The Labour Party's Road Traffic (Joyriding) Bill has been before the House since 1998, but for four years it has been voted down by the Government. It took the death of Veronica Guerin before we introduced appropriate legislation regarding the Criminal Assets Bureau and so on to deal with the serious drugs problem. In the current circumstances it behoves the Government to begin producing appropriate legislation and places of detention. Senator O'Toole pointed out that Oberstown House and Trinity House operate within their remit. These young lads would have been in an appropriate place of detention and not out joyriding if such places were available. This is a moot point, particularly given the fact that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform speaks about zero tolerance all the time.</P>
      <P>Some time ago the House had a comprehensive debate on the interim report of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board. The final report indicates that the interim findings were close to the reality and points out that profits in Ireland are ten times those in the UK. There are significant issues regarding the insurance industry, particularly concerning vulnerable people at the lower end of the scale and young and elderly drivers. We have not been getting all the facts about the motor insurance industry and I ask the Leader to make time available to debate this report.</P>

      <P>I have lived all my life in Donnybrook where I have had a great relationship with the Garda Síochána during the years. Last Sun<Col N="1644" /> day I called to the Garda station at 10 a.m. to offer my deep sympathy. I found the staff very distressed having lost colleagues who were with them at 6 a.m. but gone at 6.30 a.m. Their colleagues lost their lives not just carrying out their duties, but trying to protect other road users from danger.</P>
      <P>I have been impressed, as must the families and colleagues of the men concerned also, by the deep outpouring of grief shown by the community. There has been a continuous queue at the Garda station in Donnybrook to sign the book of condolence and both the station and the scene of the accident have been decked in floral tributes. People have great respect for the Garda Síochána because they know the risks its members face in carrying out their duties. I offer my deepest sympathy to the Garda, the families of the men concerned as well as to the family of Private Ó'Flaithearta.</P>

      <P>I continue with a question raised by Senator Manning. Does the Leader of the House know of other legislation that may be proposed in the House other than what we see on the schedule before us? There may be a situation where we need to amend the Electoral Act, 2001, if the decision in the case currently before the High Court goes a certain way. It has to do with the capping of expenditure in elections, including elections to this House. A case has been made to the High Court which seriously queries one of the sections which relates particularly to Members of the Houses.</P>

      <P>I agree, but it is a serious issue and we ought to be prepared for it. We live in the real world. Has the Leader received any indication that we will be back dealing with this issue if the decision in the case goes a certain way?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I again raise the desperate situation in the Middle East, which is getting worse. Any fair-minded person must realise that the Government led by Mr. Sharon has decided to eliminate the Palestinians from the face of the earth. The International Committee of the Red Cross, UNWRA, the Secretary General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, the Security Council and everybody but Tony Blair have come out against what is happening to the people of Palestine. Watching the scenes from Jenin refugee camp in recent days reminded us of the horrors being perpetrated on these people. Médecins sans Frontières doctors and nurses have gone in to help, including one Irish nurse, but have been berated and sent out by the Israelis. There is a smell of death, but people are not allowed to deliver food or bury the dead. They are not allowed provide any of the humane treatment necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Leader of the House send a strong message of support, not only to the Palestinians, <Col N="1645" /> but to the international bodies and individuals trying, in difficult circumstances, to alleviate the difficulties? We cannot stand by. If the world stands by, this war against &ldquo;terror&rdquo; will escalate and no minority will be safe from the excesses and incompetence of the United States Government which will not allow in any humanitarian aid because of the fear of losing seats in the next election. While we, too, are facing an election, we must be cognisant of what is happening in the world.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I endorse Senator Costello's remarks about the insurance industry. We will debate the Constitution today, a debate which will indulge Members and involve a certain amount of navel-gazing, but a damning report by the Motor Insurance Advisory Board will be published today on motor insurance and the insurance industry generally. The House should be aware that we are witnessing the exposure of one of the greatest rip-offs of consumers since we exposed the banks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>We exposed the banks in the Oireachtas, the very place where it should be done. The insurance industry is being deceitful and dishonest to the consumer because, as is clear from the report, it is disguising its profits in a way that the ordinary person cannot understand.</P>
      <P>Senator Costello referred to the stark fact that the insurance industry in Ireland is making profits nine or ten times greater than those in the United Kingdom on this rip-off which is causing damage. If we do anything in this House, it should be to stand up to big business when it is behaving dishonestly.</P>

      <P>My understanding from the media is that the Coimisiún na Gaeltachta report is now with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1646" />I also support Senator Lanigan's call for us in the remaining days of this session to express our absolute horror at what is happening in the Middle East. We have all endeavoured to be responsible in this matter and strike a balance, realising there have been excesses on both sides, but Israel's aggression, as we see it, against the Palestinians is a war crime. There is an onus on America to play a more proactive role given that Mr. Colin Powell was humiliated on his recent visit. Several weeks ago America sent the wrong messages to Mr. Sharon which were used by him to conduct unbridled aggression against the Palestinians. In the coming weeks and months we will no doubt be calling for a tribunal to bring him to book for these war crimes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Senators Costello and Ross in asking that we debate the report of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board prior to the closure of the Seanad. The House will recall that when we discussed the interim report spokespersons for the motor insurance industry scoffed at it claiming it had no basis in fact. However, the truth is out and has pulled the rug from underneath it by showing the extraordinary high costs with premia often four times higher than those in the United Kingdom. Senator Costello also pointed out that total profits in Ireland are nine times higher than in the United Kingdom. An extraordinary amount of money is being made.

      <P>I formally second the amendment of my colleague, Senator Ross, on the insurance industry. It is important that it is debated. I look forward to the opportunity to congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, on establishing the board which produced this report. Another cogent argument for taking the debate is the disgraceful event we dealt with some years ago when the insurance industry effectively sidelined the then insurance ombudsman, Pauline Marrinan-Quinn, to such an extent that she had to withdraw. I compliment the Minister of State not only because he called for the report to be produced, but also because he has established an implementation body which will begin taking action within three months. That is the type of political action we need.</P>

      <P>I express my heartfelt sympathy to the Garda, but I wish to comment briefly on the manner in which this matter has been reported subsequently in the press. There were attacks on politicians. The word &ldquo;parasite&rdquo; was used about 15 times in a radio programme yesterday. It was laid at our door that these circumstances had arisen partly because it was impossible to use stingers. This was because we had been derelict in our duty in not introducing amending legislation to avoid a secondary crime being committed by the use of stingers. Five years ago this House and the Dáil passed the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1997, which rectified the position. As a politician, I am tired of being accused of being in the wrong.</P>
      <P>I am sad about the resignation of Deputy Molloy as Minister of State. While I have disagreed fundamentally with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, and battled with him repeatedly in the House&mdash;</P>

      <P>Has the Leader any update for me on the Education (Welfare) Act? I ask because it is acknowledged that there is a drop-out rate from school of 20% in the areas from where these young, marginalised people come. If school attendance officers were in place, these young people might not take to a life of crime. We are irresponsible in not providing for this. On the previous occasion I asked about this I was told it would be taken care of shortly. I await a positive response from the Government to its obligations in this regard and an acknowledgement from it that not having school attendance officers in large urban areas is almost a crime.</P>

      <P>The issue of crime is frequently raised in this House. Some 50% of indictable offences are committed by people aged 17 or less. This figure may be somewhat out of date but it is the most recent one I came across. We have under-responded to its causes and to the legislative, custodial and other areas that are necessary to deal with it. The recent incident we witnessed is a particularly horrific example of that and we need to look again at where the resources in crime prevention, detection and custodial care are directed.</P>
      <P>Since it appears that we may be here for a few weeks yet, I suggest to the Leader that there is a great need for a debate on the issue of freedom of the press and democracy. We perceive Israel as a democracy but the suppression of free investigation of what it was doing in the West Bank makes it unqualified to hold that classification. I am uncomfortable that the Israeli Labour Party is a member of an international organisation to which my own party is affiliated, as I do not believe it currently meets the requirements.</P>
      <P>Another issue of concern is what happened to the international media last Saturday when there was a popular uprising against a coup in Venezuela in which 40 people were killed. The international media appears to have closed down for the day and ignored what was happening there. Indeed, I was hard pressed to find anything on the Internet either. This is an extraordinarily sinister state of affairs. I am not suggesting there was a conspiracy but there was serious indifference to the attempted destruction of democracy. One's views on President Chavez are not relevant in this case.</P>

I was very sorry not to be present on the day that tributes were paid in the House. It was a bolt out of the blue for us all. I had the opportunity to pay a brief tribute to him on Radio Kerry.</P>
      <P>I invite the Leader of the House to comment on the amazing climb-down regarding the SRA. Was this forced on us by the European Union? We received a famous report from the Attorney General, Michael McDowell, which described at length the twin pillar approach to the preventive and supervisory roles of the Central Bank. At the time I thought it was another attempt to scapegoat a very good State servant, another Kerryman, retired Governor Maurice O'Connell, who is out of the equation. I would like the Leader to indicate when it is intended to bring forward the new Financial Services Bill before the House. What caused the change of heart and climb-down in view of the previous Government decision?</P>
      <P>The Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business has often dealt with the matter of insurance during this Parliament and at long last the MIAB report has been published. To add to what Senator Ross said, not alone is it deceitful, it is downright disgraceful. The House should debate the issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The publication of the Seventh Progress Report of the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution deals with the Houses of the Oireachtas. Its treatment of the functions and composition of Seanad Éireann marks an advance in debate conducted with increasing intensity since the publication of the 1996 report on the Constitution Review Group, a report which raised the sunrise issues of whether the Seanad should continue to exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1653" />The seventh progress report and the second progress report on the Seanad which preceded it came, resoundingly, to the conclusion that the Seanad was an important element of our constitutional institutions but that it needed reform to ensure its progressively more significant and vigorous role. The 61 Bills initiated in the Seanad in our time, a Chathaoirligh, have changed our function. The taking of Committee Stages of Bills in committee confirms the important new role played by the Seanad in the passing of Bills under the current Administration.</P>
    <P>The foundations for an organisation's significance and vigor derive in the first instance from the quality of the tasks undertaken by it. The O'Keeffe committee considered that Seanad Éireann should be a consultative body where people with knowledge, experience and judgment over the spectrum of public affairs should be available in a broadly non-partisan way to help the Dáil to carry out its functions more effectively and efficiently. It saw the scrutiny of EU legislation and the carrying out of examinations of the work of Government Departments as new and important functions which should be entrusted to the Seanad. However, it tended to take a limited view of the Seanad's legislative role. In debates on the role of the Seanad, Senators identified the scrutiny of EU legislation, statutory instruments and the investigation of the operation of the public services as areas in which the Seanad should take a more effective role.</P>
    <P>The new report also recommends these additional functions for the Seanad but emphasises that the Seanad's key role as prescribed in the Constitution should remain the processing of legislation. In a debate on the role of the Seanad in December 1999, Senators expressed widespread satisfaction with the increased volume of legislation being initiated in the Seanad and at the more frequent attendance by the Taoiseach and Ministers during debates on Bills.</P>
    <P>The seventh progress report also suggests that the Seanad might develop a particular interest in developments in Northern Ireland and in the North-South and British-Irish institutions established by the British-Irish Agreement. Everybody will agree that a Seanad carrying out the functions now identified could contribute immeasurably to the deliverance of services which the Oireachtas provides for the people. One only has to reflect on the value that a sustained focus maintained by the Seanad on EU legislation and business would add to Ireland's political debate.</P>
    <P>The hard work and dedication of those honoured and privileged to serve as Members of Seanad Éireann since 1937 has been immeasurable. The wealth of experience and the cross-section of society represented by the membership of this House have played a major role in the quality of legislation passed by the Oireachtas. The composition of this House has been debated many times. An organisation also derives its sig<Col N="1654" /> nificance and vigor from the quality of those who carry out its functions.</P>
    <P>The committee's second progress report presented a scheme by which the composition of the Seanad might be derived. The current Seanad is formulated as follows: directly elected members, 15; indirectly elected members, 28; university/third level representatives, six and the Taoiseach's nominees, 11. The seventh progress report presents a different scheme for consideration: 48 of the 60 Senators to be elected by proportional representation on a national list system on the same day as a general election to the Dáil; 8 to be nominated by the Taoiseach and a further four members to be nominated also by the Taoiseach in accordance with a procedure specified by law to represent citizens resident in the north of our island.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that schemes for Seanad Éireann could indefinitely engage the attention of political theorists. I profoundly disagree, in principle, with the proposal by the seventh progress report that 48 Members of the Seanad should be elected on the same as election to the Dáil by way of proportional representation on a national list system. The current formulation of the Seanad is and has proven to be very successful. The old saying should apply &ndash; if it is not broken, do not mend it.</P>
    <P>Next Wednesday, I will have served 20 years as a Member of Seanad Éireann. I can honestly say one will not find finer people, more qualified, more experienced or committed to serving the interests of the people of Ireland in a more dignified, respectable, courteous and meaningful way than the women and men who have served as Members of Seanad Éireann for the past 20 years. In a unitary State such as ours there is a major problem with how one derives the membership of the second Chamber. If both Houses are returned by universal suffrage they have an equally valid mandate from the people and, inevitably, issues about the respective powers of each House will arise. The seventh progress report seeks to overcome this difficulty by providing a different mechanism for election to both Houses. However, what is being transferred by each mechanism is the right to represent the people. Since that right comes directly from the people in both cases there cannot be a difference in the character of the right.</P>
    <P>I believe, therefore, that membership of Seanad Éireann must be returned by indirect elections. The obvious electorate for indirect elections is one already used, namely, members of local authorities, members of the outgoing Seanad and Members of the newly elected Dáil. Members of local authorities are the product of election by the people. The recent referendum formally recognising local government in the Constitution will ensure its democratic mandate is always lively and fresh.</P>
    <P>Local authorities have always been the keystone of the electoral system for the Seanad. It seems prudent and sensible to maintain that key<Col N="1655" /> stone. The local authority members of Ireland, who have served the people since the foundation of the State in a voluntary capacity, know the problems of all the people whether in the towns, cities or most rural parts of the country. They are the experienced politicans who elect the membership of Seanad Éireann. Who is more qualified to assess and judge the ability of those placing themselves before the electorate for their approval than the experienced electorate of the local authority, the newly elected Dáil and the outgoing Seanad?</P>
    <P>Under this system over the years, local authority members have served voluntarily every Monday, whether on Westmeath County Council or any other council. They have placed themselves at the disposal of the people of their parish who were possibly first to instigate their nomination for council elections. It is they who make a judgment on those whom they wish to have as their representatives in the Upper House.</P>
    <P>The seventh progress report proposes that provision should continue to be made for the appointment of a certain number of Senators by the Taoiseach. It is clear that a unitary State, the House to which the people's representatives are elected, should have the exclusive power to hold the Government to account. It appears reasonable that the head of the Government, the Taoiseach, should have the power to appoint a sufficient number of Members to the Seanad to ensure a majority there for the Government. I am sure Senator Manning will agree with those sentiments as he presided, very successfully, over a Seanad where he did not have full and outright control of the membership. This can create enormous problems with legislation with which the Government wishes to proceed. It follows that there is no problem in principle in providing capacity for the Taoiseach to appoint representatives from Northern Ireland or representatives who can cater for groups such as our emigrants. All Taoisigh, certainly all those since I became a Member, including Charles J. Haughey, Garret FitzGerald, Deputy Albert Reynolds, Deputy John Bruton and the current Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, have recognised and acknowledged the importance of appointing representatives from Northern Ireland. They include former Senators John Robb, Seamus Mallon and Bríd Rodgers, Senator Maurice Hayes, the late Senator Gordon Wilson, who served honourably and well, Senator Edward Haughey and many others who have served on behalf of Northern Ireland and made a big contribution to life as it existed in that part of our island.</P>
    <P>University representation is a more difficult issue. The second progress report of the all-party committee proposed that six seats should continue to be allocated to third level representatives. It recommended that all graduates of the institutions that fell within the remit of the Higher Education Authority and the then National Council of Education Awards should <Col N="1656" /> form the electorate for the six seats. In the debate on the report in this House on 30 January 1997, most Senators agreed with this recommendation. The seventh progress report of the all-party committee shares the general view that the university Senators have played and continue to play a distinctive and valuable role in the working of the Seanad. I wish to salute their outstanding and valuable work which they are carrying out and have carried out over many years. However, the all-party committee goes on to say that in a root and branch reform of the Seanad it would not be possible to justify continued representation for graduates. The very practice is rooted in historical British political experience which gave representation in the House of Commons to representatives of Oxbridge graduates. The practice is no longer followed in Britain.</P>
    <P>University representation in the Seanad derives from that experience and it aimed particularly to give representation to predominantly Protestant graduates of Trinity College, Dublin. In view of the composition of Trinity graduates today, that disposition has lost political validity. While it is difficult in theory to defend university representation, in practice the university representatives in the Seanad have contributed out of all proportion to their numbers. They have made an enormous and valuable contribution and are much appreciated by parliamentarians, Members of the Dáil, local authorities and organisations throughout the land for the good work they carry out.</P>
    <P>I thank all those who served on the committee under the chairmanship of Deputy Brian Lenihan and on the previous committee under the chairmanship Deputy Jim O'Keeffe. There never was a more opportune time for the Seanad to be proud of its achievements and the hard work it has done in recent years. I see an opportunity for more EU legislation to be deliberated on and reports discussed here.</P>
    <P>The role of a Senator today, compared to that of a Senator up to 15 years ago, is practically full-time, three days and sometimes four days per week. Taking that into account, the extra workload will have to be looked at. I look forward to the time when we can start at 9.30 a.m. and conclude at 7.30 p.m. As many Senators have said on a number of occasions, sitting late into the night until 11 p.m, 12 midnight or 1 a.m. is not good for family life. Perhaps we can have a look at that in the review process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leader for making time available today to discuss this report. I compliment him on his very thorough analysis of it. I do not intend to follow him to the same degree of detail. I pay tribute to the committee on its seventh report. Given that seven reports are available, all of which are very readable and contain much material, one begins to wonder whether this will be a process of indefinite research and publication by the committee or whether at the end of some particular day it is <Col N="1657" /> intended to act on the reports or put them into active debate to see if decisions will be taken. Otherwise the exercise, while it will have added greatly to our knowledge and provided many other options to us, would lack a certain amount of point.</P>
      <P>I wish to put the debate in an international context. A century ago there were 35 parliaments in the world. Some of those that existed at the beginning of the 20th century did not survive. Today there are over 200 parliaments. Parliament in the 20th century has been a growth industry. The way in which people look at parliament has changed. There was a great burst of enthusiasm in the early 20th century and a feeling that, once a country got its parliament, all its problems were over. That was in a sense the embodiment of sovereignty, the realisation of independence.</P>
      <P>In many countries that did not become a reality. We saw parliaments go into decline for much of the 20th century as governments grew stronger and imposed more controls on parliament. That was very much true of our Parliament, which has always been dominated by the Executive. We have not had a lively or difficult Parliament for Governments to handle during much of our lifetime. That was the case in many countries, but the position is changing significantly. It is changing because there are many more parliaments. Their members are learning from each other, from talking to each other a great deal. They are trying to assert themselves against the power of the Executive. They are trying to find new roles for themselves.</P>
      <P>All of us who travel find that when we arrive at other parliaments we tend to talk about common problems and how we can better do our business. There has been a great deal of learning. This debate should take place in that context. The Scandinavian and German Parliaments are ones from which we can learn a great deal as opposed to the British Parliament from which perhaps we cannot.</P>
      <P>Another important point about this report is that many of the reforms we would like to see in Parliament can be made quite easily without constitutional change. The ones that require constitutional change are in a minority. In one sense we have no excuse for not bringing in the reforms which we believe are in the interests of Parliament and of all of us. There has probably been more reform of Parliament in the past ten years than in the previous 70 years. We have a committee system which will be the template for many years to come. We are almost there. Perhaps there are too many committees. They need to be beefed up with research facilities and better secretarial, administrative and clerical services, but we are on the way to having a proper committee system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A detailed examination has been carried out of what a 21st century parliament would need. That benchmarking review will be published shortly. I was on that committee. I think Members will be pleased that the problem of resources is being <Col N="1658" /> tackled and there is an attempt to leapfrog over 20 to 30 years of inertia to having proper structures in place. When we discovered how well resourced the parliament of Northern Ireland was compared to what we have here, we were surprised and realised how little has been done.</P>
    <P>The Commission of the Oireachtas Bill has been published and, irrespective of who will be in power, it will come on to the Statute Book fairly early in the first session of the next Dáil. It will hand control of the running of the Houses of Parliament back to the Houses away from the control of the Department of Finance. We will be forced, if we are lucky enough to be here, to make hard decisions about our future. All of that is the context within which this report is published.</P>
    <P>There are aspects of this report which do not deal with the Seanad. There is the question of electoral reform. In many ways electoral reform may be as big a question as that of Seanad reform. Twice in the past the people were asked to replace the current PR system, but on each occasion they were given a take it or leave it choice &ndash; they could have PR or the British system. It was a case of either/or. There is no worse electoral system in the world than the British one. It is a form of disproportionate representation whereby with 40% of the votes a party can have a majority of 200 in the House of Commons. It is interesting to remind ourselves that Mrs. Thatcher imposed a major economic and social revolution on Britain having never got more than slightly over 40% of the popular vote. Whole parts of that country were up in arms against her &ndash; she got no seats in Wales or Scotland. It is a bad system. When we asked the people to choose, we gave them that black and white scenario.</P>
    <P>There are other systems. I applaud the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and Dr. Garret FitzGerald, both of whom have been pressing us to consider seriously other possible systems. I would like the committee to do more work &ndash; it has done some already &ndash; on the possibility of changing the electoral system. That will be difficult, but we saw last week that excesses of clientelism can have consequences which nobody foresaw or wanted and which can be very serious for the people concerned. Some of the competition between people in the same party is totally out of proportion and control. It leads to a madness and to some politicians doing things that demean their calling, which can bring all of us into disrepute. There are good reasons for examining the electoral system.</P>
    <P>As to the Seanad, there is a basic rule of thumb. If we agree there should be a second House, how can we add value to it? We can learn a great deal from what happened in the UK. They have not had a happy experience in their attempts to reform the House of Lords. What they are moving to is a system whereby large numbers of Members will be nominated directly not only by the Prime Minister but by the leaders of the parties. All of us should be suspicious of a House where a majority of Members are nominated and <Col N="1659" /> owe their position to only one person, whether it be the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition or the leaders of the other parties. That places too much power in the hands of any one person. It also puts too great an obligation on the person elected. Having regard to what happened in Britain, it is clear that certain areas could be found where the House of Lords could do new things very well, especially in areas such as Europe and science and technology, in respect of which neither House here is particularly well equipped. There are also other specialist areas where the House of Lords could add value. When it came to deciding how the House of Lords would be elected, the real problems arose. What is happening now is pleasing nobody and may not end up with a better House of Lords than the one that was replaced where the life peers, in particular, could make an honest and consistent intervention.</P>
    <P>I am not arguing to defend much of the current system on the basis of self-interest. If there was a list system, I would probably be very high up on my party's list and elected more easily than by touring the country. I am not sure that having a list system is the answer. A system of indirect election from a body of people who are elected has a democratic legitimacy. The French Senate is elected in that way, as are the senates of two or three other EU member states. We could argue forever about what sort of electoral system we should have and suddenly we would be into a morass of gender balance, quotas and questioning whether vocational groups should directly nominate people. In my view we will not get something better than we have because everyone will have their particular veto on what happens and the compromise may not be any better in what it produces than the very imperfect system by which Members of this House are elected. That applies to the university Senators as much as to the Senators elected from the panels. None of us can defend with total enthusiasm the system which elects us, but when one looks for a better system, one will find there is very little agreement or consensus. Everybody has his or her idea as to what it should be and generally it is what would suit him or her, but that is life.</P>
    <P>In terms of where we should be going, this House should concentrate more on how we can improve the way we do our business. We have not done that. We have not had a commission of Members of this House to examine seriously how the role of this House can be enhanced. We have amended Standing Orders here and there, but that is not what I am talking about. There is a role for this House in examining European legislation. There is a crying need to make this House the &ldquo;European&rdquo; House of the Oireachtas with a right of audience and access for members of the European Parliament, where we could have far more of the hearings we had with Commissioners and so forth.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1660" />There is certainly a role for us in examining statutory legislation. The way in which statutory legislation goes into effect without any scrutiny is a scandal. This House should equip itself, as a matter of seriousness, to examine every statutory instrument and report back here, where necessary, to ensure there is proper and detailed scrutiny.</P>
    <P>There are other ideas. These are just two of the ones I have on how we could enhance our role. The focus of our debate &ndash; I hope those of us who run for election are re-elected &ndash; should be on how we can enhance, add value to and do our job in a more effective way. We should be radical and daring. If re-elected, the first thing I would do is ask that a small commission be established, not the Committee on Procedure and Privileges which is the wrong body to do this sort of thing. We could bring in people from outside, if necessary, and should decide how the House should be reformed and enhanced.</P>
    <P>We have a great deal to learn from the situation in the second Houses in other European countries. I will not praise anyone or say we are great; we are not, as we are in serious need of reform and radical reappraisal. I do not find much in the report which adds a great deal to what we know already or would make this a better House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to make a contribution on the kind of reforms we could suggest for this Chamber. I admit I did not read the report, but scanned it. That is the reason it is a pity this debate is taking place today at the tail-end of the session. I would like to think we could have such a debate when the new Seanad is formed, of which I hope I will be a Member when I would welcome a detailed discussion. Senator Manning said it well when he suggested that perhaps some other committee should be used, which would include Members of the Seanad, which would have knowledge and give this matter serious thought. I would welcome something like that. I have ideas which I have not yet thought through very well.</P>
      <P>At times I get very frustrated at the way in which business is done in the House. Given the way the Order of Business is shaping up, I am not convinced we get the best out of Senators. When it comes to a debate on an issue or legislation drafted by this or the other House, I am not convinced Members are used properly to get the best from them in what is being debated. I often have a lot more to say on an issue when my time runs out. We should not hop up to speak on every issue just for the sake of it. On the Order of Business I often feel Members stand up to speak purely to capture media attention, something I do not like. If I have something to say and I am committed to a particular issue, I would like a platform on which to speak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see nothing wrong with the way in which the Seanad is formed. Our electorate comprises local authority members, Members of Seanad Éireann <Col N="1661" /> and Members of Dáil Éireann. One could not get a better electorate and one which knows what is expected. Local authority members are very professional. They may not all have third level degrees, but sometimes third level degrees do not get one anywhere. Sometimes the best brains are those who have educated themselves, not those with letters after their names. When I met my electorate and spoke to councillors throughout the country, I was amazed at how bright they were and the way they grasped situations no matter what the topic. They have not learned from books, but from life. They are intellectually bright and good at what they do which is reflected in the membership of this House whom they elect to do the work for them.</P>
    <P>I do not know about this national list mentioned in the progress report. I am not knowledgeable enough to say whether it is good or bad. Whatever reforms take place, we must have freedom to express ourselves. This Chamber needs to endorse such thinking. It is important we have the five panels &ndash; cultural and education, administrative, labour, agricultural and industrial and commercial &ndash; with the six university Members to whom I always listen intently when they have something to say because they say it very well and give it thought. It is great to have the university group, the members of which have made great contributions during my time in the House. Both Chambers have become a little removed from the world outside. We must remember we are here to reflect the views of the people and talk about the issues. Sometimes we get too comfortable in our surroundings and forget the reason we are here.</P>
    <P>We have spoken about using this Chamber as a platform to link up with the European Parliament. We had many discussions at the forum on the Nice treaty on the reform of the Seanad and how it could be used as the link between the European Parliament and the public. This is a golden opportunity. We are just scratching the surface today. I hope I am returned with those listening to the debate. We should put this issue on the agenda early in the next session as we are only touching on it today. I do not know enough about it and would like to know more. I would like to be able to make a better contribution than that which I have made today. I have ideas which I am not expressing very well. Those of us who are present could do a lot for the future of the Seanad, of which I would like to be part.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to share my time with Senator Ross. I had originally proposed to share my time with Senators Ross and Quinn, but it appears Senator Quinn has got a slightly better deal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an important debate. I very much agree with what Senator Ormonde said, that is, that it would be very good for us to have a more extensive, inclusive detailed debate at the opening of the next session of the Oireachtas, of which, like Senator Ormonde, I hope to be a part. It is by no means guaranteed that any of us will be here. <Col N="1662" /> Anybody who takes their seat for granted is well on the way to losing it. I have seen this happen many times in the past, particularly if one is in the unenviable situation in which I find myself in that I topped the poll fairly spectacularly the last time and everybody now thinks I am as safe as houses. There are some malign influences around spreading this as hard as they can to their own advantage.</P>
    <P>We have been well served by the Constitution. It has been a very useful, democratic and organic constitution which did not stop in 1937. Due to the interplay between the citizen, the courts and the Constitution, it has been possible for a large number of citizens to articulate the unenumerated rights which resided in the 1937 Constitution, of which I have been one of the beneficiaries.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to former Senator and President, who is now a UN High Commissioner, Mary Robinson. She was extraordinarily active in many of the cases which made our Constitution live. However, time passes. It is now 65 years since the 1937 Constitution was passed and it is time to look at it again. As Senator Manning said, this is the seventh report and reports are all very well in their place, but they lack what the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, included in the movement governing the establishment of the insurance advisory board &ndash; an implementation group. When we have come to the end of all these reviews, let us have an implementation group and put at least some of these proposals into practice. Obviously I do not agree with all of them and there are certain gaps, but let us start at the top with the President of Ireland.</P>
    <P>This is a very important role. We have been extraordinarily lucky in having outstanding Presidents in every generation. We can be proud of the men and women who have served this country so well but a seven year term is much too long. It is ridiculous and one former President is on the record as asking what he did to get 14 years hard labour. One does not get that for murder. We should look at other countries &ndash; France had the same provision until last year when it reduced the term to five years. That is tolerable but seven years is much too long, particularly if one can go for a second term and get 14 years. I wrote to the commission about this issue and while I got an acknowledgement, it did not deal with the issue at all. If we want people of the calibre we have had traditionally, we will have people resigning, as President Robinson did, a year or so before the end of their term. People will be inhibited from putting their names forward or we will go back to the Presidency being a nice retirement pay-off.</P>
    <P>We must look at how the report affects the Seanad and a glaring issue that strikes me is the fact that President de Valera, because he got such a rough ride from Fine Gael in the Seanad up to 1936, decided to clip its wings extensively and at one stage thought of abolishing it altogether. He brought it back in a weakened form which <Col N="1663" /> included the addition of the Taoiseach's nominees. That is an arguable feature, but most people now accept it.</P>
    <P>However, I do not accept that we are not grown up adults. We are not allowed to have anything to do with the spending of money, which is a ridiculous limitation because it affects the way in which we table amendments. How many times have sensible amendments in the Seanad been ruled out of order because they involved a cost on the Exchequer? That needs to be looked at.</P>
    <P>This issue also affects us in another way. I was one of the people who worked for the creation of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and I have been a member of it since it was formed. I am a bureau member of the committee and I have attended every single meeting except on those occasions I have been abroad on business for the committee. However, I am not entitled to attend, let alone vote at, meetings of the select committee which determine matters such as budgets. This is because under the Constitution we are not entitled to spend money at all. That is very insulting, particularly in light of the fact that I have almost a full attendance record while there are two members of the committee I will not name, who are also members of the principal parties, who have not attended once in five years. They can go to the select committee meetings but I cannot, even though I was one of the founders and architects of the committee and I have attended virtually every meeting. There is something fundamentally wrong with that situation.</P>
    <P>I compliment the committee on its work. It also addressed the abortion issue and did a good job of the hearings, providing a menu of three alternatives, one of which was chosen by the Government. The committee did good work with its hearings and in providing information for the Seanad.</P>
    <P>I thank the Leader for the gracious way in which he and other speakers referred to the university seats. I say this in the full knowledge that sometimes we can be very irritating, but that is part of our purpose and function. To a certain extent, we are the gadflies of political life and a ginger group. We play an important role in that but it was most gracious of my colleagues to pay us that tribute as we have put much effort into our work. It is heartening to know it was appreciated.</P>
    <P>One reason there are generally good and energetic representation from both major university systems is because the ordinary membership of the nominating body is enfranchised. That is a good principle but I am not as extreme about it as I was when I came bouncing into the Seanad on my first day. I was then rather inclined to deride the method of election of some other Members in a way experience taught me was not fully correct. I say so because I have witnessed people coming in through the other electoral system and making significant and useful contributions; I often instance Senator Tom Fitzgerald <Col N="1664" /> in this regard. The first time I heard him in the House was when he was talking about a fishing Bill.</P>
    <P>It is also useful for the Seanad to have the experience of people who have been in political life in a major sense, such as former Cabinet Ministers who lose their seats. That is the other side of the coin of the more radical view I used to take, which was that the Seanad was turning into a nursing home for failed politicians. There is an element of that of which we must be aware, but we must also honestly recognise the fact that the House is enriched by having people of wide experience and talent. If it is not too complicated an exercise, there should be some degree of loading of the vote so that perhaps 50% of the vote comes from local authorities and the Members of both Houses, but a proportion of up to 50% of the vote comes from enfranchised ordinary members.</P>
    <P>It is ridiculous that a couple of elections ago the president of the Royal Irish Academy, a nominating body, was nominated but did not receive a single vote. There is something absurd about that. One has to raise questions about a situation where a nominating body nominates its own president but does not manage to get a vote at all. Does that raise the question of enfranchising all ordinary members or does one say the whole nominating procedure is a nonsense when nominating bodies are powerless and do not get the right people elected? It raises serious questions about this issue.</P>
    <P>Regarding the existence of second Houses, the Seanad has proved its worth in a number of ways. For example, when the Competition Bill was introduced here a few weeks ago, a significant number of Seanad amendments were accepted by the Minister either directly or in principle. Many of them were put down by me and Senator Quinn. There was also a huge battle here on the Disabilities Bill. There was outrage and I honour those on the Government side who, even though they could not vote against their own party, expressed their hesitations. At the end of the day, Senator O'Toole and Senator Burke, with some assistance from me, got the Bill amended in such a way as to make it satisfactory. That would not have happened without the Seanad.</P>
    <P>I visited the Czech Parliament some years ago when they were reviewing their constitution and looking at whether to have a second House. To my absolute delight, they said one of the cogent reasons which led them to decide to have a Senate was their reviewing of the proceedings of the Irish Seanad. They decided we did valuable work. That is the view of an impartial, neutral and practical observer. They did not say that to plámás us; they said so because they decided to have a second Chamber in their Parliament on the basis of our experience. I wish that fact was more widely known. It is a great pity the media does not just cover the sexy bits. I get lots of coverage <Col N="1665" /> because I am a cheeky sort of individual and I like having fun on the Order of Business.</P>

However, the proceedings after 4 p.m. are not covered, nor are any technical matters. That is a real shame which does a disservice to the democratic instinct.</P>
      <P>I am also a journalist and I speak from within the profession, but I plead with journalists to stop suggesting that when a Minister rises to his or her feet, only four Members are in the House and that taxpayers are being cheated. Taxpayers would be cheated if the Chamber was full as we would not be doing our work. We spend much time in our offices handling constituency work, reading legislation, preparing properly and appropriately for debates and watching the monitor to identify the appropriate time to come to the Chamber. Most reporters, particularly the political correspondents, know this so I do not know why they continue to push this notion.</P>
      <P>The existence of the university seats is a privilege, a fact of which graduates are well aware. Even though the postal register by which they vote is complicated, the rate of voting in Trinity College is, I think, about 60%. That is amazing and shows how much the graduates value the system. I am glad that my colleagues feel that we play a useful role in the House. We should not abolish the university seats.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to a suggestion made by an academic. I know that the word &ldquo;academic&rdquo; more or less means something which is irrelevant. I hope that comment is not reported as it will have an impact on my chances in Trinity College. On the north side of Dublin it would be said, &ldquo;Ah sure that's only bleedin' academic&rdquo;. One knows from where people who make such comments are coming. It is a theoretical model, but we need the experience of practical politicians.</P>

      <P>The abolition of the Seanad is a founding principle of my party. However, as a Progressive Democrat, it is important to state that I am of the opinion that this Chamber does valuable work which is of enduring, long-term importance. This House has the capacity and the potential to do much political work which remains undone.</P>
      <P>The debate which preceded the referendum on the Nice treaty highlighted the ever-widening gap between the European institutions and the institutions of this State. It also highlighted the urgent need to narrow that gap and to enable Members of the European Parliament and European institutions to address the Irish people and policy makers in the Houses of the Oireachtas. This is the ideal opportunity to create such conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1667" />This House received an interesting contribution from Commissioner Byrne which was helpful to us all. On that occasion we were able to ask questions and receive answers. That was an example of what could happen. We should not just offer the right of audience to MEPs, the Council of Ministers or members of the Commission. We should also have an opportunity to make an input into their thinking. That would be one of the badly needed ways in which we could narrow this gap and fill the democratic deficit which has bedevilled the attitude of Irish citizens towards Europe and European institutions.</P>
    <P>There is a lack of communication and engagement. There is plenty of information, but it is so unintelligible that people just put it in the bin. We have to invite Europeans to decommission their language and to talk to the citizens of Europe in language which will involve, engage and interest them. That is the kind of thing which can happen in this Chamber in a more meaningful way than in the Dáil. One of the changes I would like to see in this House is the creation of conditions to enable this kind of communication to take place.</P>
    <P>I spent ten years in the Dáil and five years in this House. There are areas of public life which do not receive the level of detailed discussion by elected representatives which I would wish. One such area is arts and culture which is so important to the development of the intellectual capital of this country. We have new insights into education as to what triggers intelligence &ndash; what gets people to think and to make decisions. This area needs to be brought into mainstream education. It is difficult to create the conditions for such a debate in the Dáil. However, there is plenty of expertise and time in this House to begin this debate from which young people would benefit. We should allow more time for education and other issues which can be debated with great skill in this House. Some Members have much expertise which remains untapped.</P>
    <P>The initial idea of vocational panels was good. It was a good idea that people would be drawn from different sectors who would bring their insights and direct experience on the ground to public debate and policy making. We should seek to revisit, strengthen and restructure this idea.</P>
    <P>What worries me is the strength of the lobby brigade, unelected people with a huge influence on the making of public policy. I want to see democratic values upheld and the elected people who have the expertise having an input into the making of public policy. When we consider changing the method of election we should revisit those principles and bring that kind of expertise on board. Then expertise, experience and ideas will come from people who are answerable to the public who elected them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Manning for the opportunity to speak and also the Acting Leader <Col N="1668" /> whom I congratulate on his new position as Chief Whip.</P>
      <P>The meat in this report is in the chapter on the Seanad. Most of the other recommendations are more concerned with technical matters. It is gratifying that there now seems to be a strong political consensus that the Seanad should stay. I am delighted to hear Senator Quill speak about it and to learn that even the Progressive Democrats are having a rethink about it.</P>
      <P>On the last occasion we discussed reform of the Seanad I put forward a possible role for the Seanad as a forum in which legislation could be discussed, even before a Bill was written. What I sought was to bring back to where it belongs the consultative part of the legislative process. I am concerned that there are too many done deals. A deal is struck and all the consultative work is done before something is brought to the Seanad. This is an ideal role for the Seanad and would be possible without any change to the Constitution.</P>
      <P>The value of such a change would be seriously diluted if we did not first address the fundamental task of establishing democratic legitimacy for ourselves. To go straight to the heart of the issue, why should university graduates have a vote when others do not have one? There may have been a solid reason in 1937 but that does not stand up now. I cannot defend it and cannot explain why a constitutional amendment of 20 years ago, which enabled a widening of the university vote, has not been covered. Whatever justification there was in the past we cannot guarantee justification for those university seats any longer.</P>
      <P>Our six seats are not the only ones lacking democratic legitimacy. The 11 Members appointed by the Taoiseach also lack democratic legitimacy but there are solid reasons for having those appointees. The Seanad has benefited from having a Government majority on most occasions, although Senator Ryan often refers to the three exciting years when it did not.</P>
      <P>As this report makes clear, the lack of democratic legitimacy applies not just to the six university seats and the 11 Taoiseach's appointees but to the other 43 seats also. We are all in the same boat. The vocational panels that ostensibly nominate candidates are just a sham &ndash; Senator Norris gave a good example earlier. The idea that this House represents a cross-section of vocational interests, as defined by the panels, is fiction. If the nominating panels are fiction then the electorate which then votes for them fails to add legitimacy to the result. To say that Members on those panels are democratically legitimate because they have been chosen by people who were elected by the public is stretching democracy too far. I am not trying to defend or offend anybody and I would not envy anybody the task of having to get elected to one of those 43 seats. Despite the work involved, the process does not gain the legitimacy it needs if the people are to take this House seriously as a democratic institution of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1669" />The recommendation of the committee is that both university and vocational seats be abolished and that the 49 seats concerned be thrown open to the full electorate on a list basis. As I understand it, the proposal is that, at the same time as voting for the Dáil, voters would mark their Seanad preferences. However, instead of voting for a specific candidate they would vote for a list. The seats would be allocated among the lists in proportion to the votes they actually achieved. There would obviously be a Fianna Fáil list, a Fine Gael list, a Labour list and also a Senator Norris list, a Senator O'Toole list and a Senator Quinn list, etc. It would obviously be a rare Independent who would command a high enough proportion of the vote to claim more than one seat but Independents could be elected under the system just as candidates from political parties.</P>
    <P>This proposal is particularly attractive because it provides all the democratic legitimacy that the House lacks at present without putting in place a duplicate constituency-based system like that of the Dáil. I am now convinced of the merits of this suggestion. I hope the next Government will be concerned about the way democracy is going in this country and will take this on board. It could be the catalyst for the process of reviving public interest and engagement with the political process. We need this and if we ignore it we do so at our peril. There is a great deal to be said for the report, particularly where it speaks of the Seanad. Let us make sure we give it the attention it deserves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The committee has put great thought into its work. The Leader has introduced substantive and significant legislation in this House on a regular and routine basis. The reason the activities of this House are not regarded as newsworthy is more a commentary on the way the world of the media has evolved than on the operation of the Houses of the Oireachtas. What is done here on Committee Stage of legislation has always been one of the fundamental parts of the role of the Oireachtas. That role is to hold Government accountable when it proposes to initiate change. Legislation is a change. Government has two roles. One is to hold together what is there and the other is to initiate change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The role of the Opposition in the Dáil is to deal with the way the Government manages the existing order in terms of what is happening at the moment and, following that, to deal with legislation. This House has taken an increasingly significant role in that area but that work is not easy to transmit to the media. An excuse given by broadcasting organisations to my own party is that many of their resources for political coverage are devoted to the tribunals and they must therefore reduce their coverage of the Houses of the Oireachtas. The logic of that escapes me. That decision is particularly unpleasant because it means that the negative side of the activities of many people in politics is hugely covered. It is <Col N="1670" /> quite correct to report it because it is disgraceful but the positive work Members do is left out.</P>
    <P>A case can be made for the two Houses meshing together better. I am not sure it makes sense to spend weeks working on legislation as we did on the Copyright and Related Rights Act, 2000, which I will carry with me to my grave. When it has been dealt with in the Seanad, legislation goes to the Dáil where it is treated as if it has never been discussed anywhere in a parliamentary forum before. That should not be the case. It must be possible to link the two Houses and have them complement each other better.</P>
    <P>Like Senator Quinn, I welcome the university seats. I have enjoyed one and hope not to have to for much longer, but there is no overwhelming reason to retain them. However, I do not think they will be abolished because I am sceptical as to whether these worthwhile proposals will be implemented. Therefore, they may be here for some time yet. Even though, as Senator Norris said, the university Members have annoyed people from time to time, they have served the House well. The proposal of a list system linked with a clearer focus on what the Seanad does is also welcome.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Quill that it is important to make the European institutions and the way in which Irish Governments deal with them more visible and transparent in allowing consultation before decisions are taken. One of the things we have learned about the European Union since the referendum on the Treaty of Nice is that the idea of European laws being used by Governments to excuse their inaction in policy areas must be dropped. Entire chunks of the never-to-be-forgotten Copyright and Related Rights Act, 2000, could not be altered because they had already been agreed in international treaties. None of us had any input into Government policy on the matter before decisions were taken. In this context, the role of the Seanad is important.</P>
    <P>There is also a role for institutionalised representation from Northern Ireland in this House, although I am reluctant to be prescriptive. It would be a good idea to have five seats in the Seanad filled by representatives of both communities in Northern Ireland in a manner to be prescribed by legislation. If we wanted to have an exercise in gender balance in our activities, the Seanad would be a good place to start. There is a possibility to explore various institutional innovations and balances to use the House better.</P>
    <P>The committee's report is very good, but we should remember that this House has served the country well. For a period in the 1970s and 1980, when this country was closed in its thinking, this House introduced the beginnings of a succession of constitutional, institutional and social policy changes. In this House, too, issues that had slipped through the Dáil were identified and disposed of through the sheer hard work of Members of this House. Members should never need to apologise to anyone for their work. As the report points out, this House is necessary for <Col N="1671" /> the effective functioning of Oireachtas committees because if they were based on a Dáil of 120 or 140 Members, they would not have enough members.</P>
    <P>When the Constitution was introduced, government was a small entity, but we are now trying to make accountable a government of a complexity unimaginable 70 years ago. It is a huge task for 226 Members to make national and European government of that scale accountable. Any suggestion, therefore, that a significant reduction in the number of Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas would be helpful to government and European bureaucracy is profoundly damaging to the idea of democratic accountability because government is now so complex one would need two teams of experts to advise every committee of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>This is a serious and worthwhile report which deserves to be considered. I will have no problem if the basic bones of the proposals are put into legislative or constitutional form.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann adopts the following code of conduct for Members of Seanad Éireann other than office holders:</P>
      <P Just="Center">Preamble</P>
      <P>The Members of Seanad Éireann other than office holders (referred to hereafter as &lsquo;Members') recognise that it is in their individual and collective interest to foster and sustain public confidence and trust in their integrity as individuals and in Seanad Éireann as an institution. To this end, Members should at all times be guided by the public good and ensure that their actions and decisions are taken in the best interests of the public.</P>
      <P>The Members of Seanad Éireann have adopted this code of conduct pursuant to Article 15.10 of the Constitution and in accordance with section 10 of the Standards in Public Office Act, 2001, the purpose of which is to guide Members in the discharge of their obligations in a manner which is consistent with the proper performance of the functions of the Office of Member of Seanad Éireann.</P>
      <P Just="Center">Code</P>
      <P>1.&nbsp;Members must, in good faith, strive to maintain the trust placed in them, and exercise the influence gained from their public office to advance the public interest.</P>
      <P>2.&nbsp;Members must conduct themselves in accordance with the provisions and spirit of the code of conduct and ensure that their conduct does not bring the integrity of their office or the Seanad into disrepute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1672" />3.&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;Members have a particular obligation to behave in a manner which is consistent with the proper performance of the functions of the Office of Member of Seanad Éireann and with the maintenance of confidence in such performance by the general public.</P>
    <P>(ii)&nbsp;Members must interact with authorities involved with public administration and the enforcement of the law in a manner which is consistent with their roles as public representatives and legislators.</P>
    <P>4.&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;A conflict of interest exists where a Member participates in or makes a decision in the execution of his or her office knowing that it will improperly and dishonestly further his or her private financial interest or another person's private financial interest directly or indirectly.</P>
    <P>(ii)&nbsp;A conflict of interest does not exist where the Member or other person benefits only as a member of the general public or a broad class of persons.</P>
    <P>5.&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;Members must base their conduct on a consideration of the public interest and are individually responsible for avoiding conflicts of interest.</P>
    <P>(ii)&nbsp;Members must endeavour to arrange their private financial affairs to prevent such conflicts of interest arising and must take all reasonable steps to resolve any such conflict quickly and in a manner which is in the best interests of the public.</P>
    <P>6.&nbsp;Members may not solicit, accept or receive any financial benefit or profit in exchange for promoting, or voting on, a Bill, a motion for a resolution or order or any question put to the Seanad or to any of its committees.</P>
    <P>7.&nbsp;Members must fulfil conscientiously the requirements of the Seanad and of the law in respect of the Ethics in Public Office Acts and, to assist them in so doing, should familiarize themselves with the relevant legislation and guidelines published from time to time by the Select Committee on Members' Interests and the Standards in Public Office Commission as appropriate.</P>
    <P>8.&nbsp;(i)Members must not accept a gift that may pose a conflict of interest or which might interfere with the honest and impartial exercise of their official duties.</P>
    <P>(ii)&nbsp;Members may accept incidental gifts and customary hospitality.</P>
    <P>9.&nbsp;In performing their official duties, Members must apply public resources prudently and only for the purposes for which they are intended.</P>
    <P>10.&nbsp;Members must not use official information which is not in the public domain, or information obtained in confidence in the <Col N="1673" /> course of their official duties, for personal gain or the personal gain of others.</P>
    <P>11.&nbsp;Members must co-operate with all tribunals of inquiry and other bodies inquiring into matters of public importance established by the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The Committee on Members' interests has placed this code of conduct before the House for its approval. The House is required under section 10 of the Standards in Public Offices Act, 2001, to adopt a code of conduct on which the committee has been working for months and, in so doing, circulated a draft code to all Members and sought their views on its content. As required by the Act of 2001, the committee also consulted the Standards in Public Office Commission. Members are well aware of the background to the demands from the public for a code of conduct and ethics in public office to be legislated for. The Act of 2001 clearly provides that the code should act as a guide to Members. It is on this basis that the committee brings this proposal before the House today.</P>
    <P>It may be asked why the code does not attach penalties for breaches &ndash; the Act does not provide for the imposition of penalties for breaches of the code, but breaches would likely come within the ambit of section 4 of the Act in relation to specified acts which provides for an investigation and the attachment of penalties. The relevance of the code is that it can be used to establish the expected standards of conduct and integrity for Members of Seanad Éireann. It is important that Members know what is expected and required of them and that their actions are transparent and in the interests of the general public, not themselves. The code should strengthen public confidence in the membership of the Seanad and the institution itself.</P>
    <P>The Committee on Members' Interests is small but hardworking. I pay tribute to the Cathaoirleach, Senator Mullooly, who, as we all know, is a fair minded man and brought that quality to the committee with his knowledge of procedure and wealth of common sense. I also thank the clerk to the committee who worked hard to ensure everything was brought before it and for assisting the Cathaoirleach and committee members to bring the code to where it is today. I commend the motion to the House.</P>

I expect this is the way most Members behave without the report. There is nothing in it which is exceptional. It merely states explicitly what we expect of ourselves and each other. I commend the report to the House. Its value is that it will be a guideline and lay down reasonably precise definitions which will be of use in future.</P>

      <P>I am impressed by the report and the proposal. I did not believe there was a need for it, but having read it, I realise there probably is a need to put this down in writing, if only to ensure it is clear.</P>
      <P>Section 8(i) is interesting. It states:</P>
      <P>Members must not accept a gift that may pose a conflict of interest or which might interfere with the honest and impartial exercise of their official duties.</P>
      <P>That is logical and I would have assumed it would have always been recognised as such. However, a difficulty was probably recognised and that has been resolved by section 8(ii) which states: &ldquo;Members may accept incidental gifts and customary hospitality.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The code of conduct is written in a sensible and logical fashion. It has given new Members and those of us who have been in the Seanad for some time guidelines by which to work. I am sure most of us work within them, but it answers some of the questions asked. I congratulate the committee for putting it together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the code of conduct. This has been a traumatic time for Members between declarations of interest and freedom of information requests on expenses and such matters. As most Members, including me, have found, the world did not come to an end nor did the sky fall in when our expenses were published. As one would expect, the media has become bored with the subject and although I am given to understand the routine request for Members' expenses is made every six months, they have found there is nothing in it worth publicising.</P>
      <P>We do not cater for our interests that well. For example, my travelling expenses when going to Switzerland were regarded as an expense payable to me and were treated as a cash benefit to me when in fact I never saw most of it. That is the way we operate and it is open and transparent. I would have expected a journalist of rudimentary intelligence to have noticed that fact at least and not to have included it as part of our expenses. The transparency aspect has served us very well, as will this code of conduct.</P>
      <P>If these rules had been in place when I was first elected to the House, I suspect I would have been in breach of them. They state: &ldquo;Members may not solicit, accept or receive any financial benefit or profit in exchange for promoting . a Bill.&rdquo;. I was assisted financially largely by the Simon Community when I was first elected to the House. In return for its support, the first action I took was to introduce a Bill on homelessness. Clearly, I would have been in breach of the rules.</P>

      <P>The Senator should read the rules. I do not believe they could be written differently. We have all learned that rules that are correct can have unexpected consequences. These are the <Col N="1675" /> rules we have now. We should bear in mind the possibility that anomalies will arise and we should deal with them honestly when they do. The vast majority of us have nothing to be ashamed of. As the media discovered, the expenses issue was a nine day wonder which has been largely forgotten.</P>

      <P>Having spent a great deal of time on this with Senator Manning, Senator Cassidy, the Cathaoirleach, the Clerk and others, it is good to see it come to fruition. While I agree with the comments made, we need to place this in context. These are the procedures. They do not deal with what happens if someone breaches them. That is the next step and is covered elsewhere in the legislation. It is an equally important matter which we must examine. The role of the committee was to get the guidelines correct.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan's interpretation is incorrect. There is nothing wrong with a Member taking a line on behalf of a group which may choose to support him or her. A breach would occur where a person requests a Member to do something for him or her in return for payment or support. That would be unethical. There is nothing unethical about a Member having coinciding principles or objectives with a group. There is a clear distinction and there is no doubt about that.</P>
      <P>This issue is more important for the Seanad than the Dáil because it is a vocational Chamber and is expected to have Members who reflect the views of the people who nominate them. They are elected to put forward those views and they are required by the Constitution to have an interest in and knowledge of their area. It would be in order for Senator Ryan to have an interest in and knowledge of his area of interest and to put forward issues and make arguments on that basis, much as I may do on the issue of education, trade unionism, etc, or much as I may bring forward legislation or amendments to it, as we all have done, on the basis of a certain view. In my case, like Senator Ryan, I have put forward legislation which has advanced the objectives of the Irish National Teachers Organisation and it has consistently supported me legally and correctly through its political fund. These issues do not create difficulty.</P>
      <P>There is nothing in the code of conduct which will prevent Members from adequately, correctly, properly and energetically progressing and advancing the viewpoint or supporting the objectives of groups in society. There is nothing wrong with that and that is the way it can work. The best example of where it can go wrong is the Hamilton case in the United Kingdom where a Member of Parliament charged people for raising issues in the House of Commons or accepted money for doing so. In Senator Ryan's case, he has had a long and consistent commitment to the same issue as the Simon Community and a link could never be made between the two.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1676" />There are a number of important issues. We are required to ensure that we do not create a conflict of interest. This a proactive imperative in the code of conduct. It states:</P>
    <P>Members must endeavour to arrange their private financial affairs to prevent such conflicts of interest arising and must take all reasonable steps to resolve any such conflict quickly and in a manner which is in the best interests of the public.</P>
    <P>It is not just a matter of being found out. It is a matter of how we conduct our business. Similarly, the Preamble states:</P>
    <P>The Members . recognise that it is in their individual and collective interest to foster and sustain public confidence and trust in their integrity as individuals and in Seanad Éireann as an institution. To this end, Members should at all times be guided by the public good and ensure that their actions and decisions are taken in the best interests of the public.</P>
    <P>Those are two strong requirements of and imperatives on Members to conduct themselves in an appropriate manner. It is not just a matter of sitting back and adopting a <i>laissez-faire</i> attitude. There is a requirement on Members to seek to ensure that they represent interests clearly and properly.</P>
    <P>Although I know there is no chance that this will get two syllables in tomorrow's papers, I would like the public to see this as the Seanad putting forward a form of self-regulation and placing requirements and imperatives on Members to conduct themselves in a manner which wins and maintains the trust and confidence of the public.</P>
    <P>The first question that will be asked by a committee which has to interpret it is what has been done in a proactive way. The second question will be whether any action of a Member is in breach of the code. One can be negligent or in breach of the guidelines, either by the omission of some action one should have taken or the commission of some action one should not have taken. This code of conduct moves the matter forward very strongly.</P>
    <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for the personal commitment he has shown to the development and evolution of this new set of guidelines for Members of the House. It would be very useful if each Member received a copy as soon as it is passed by the House, which I am sure is the intention. This will be a legal requirement as the legal advisers of any future Member would no doubt ask if it was brought to the notice of every Member. When a new House is elected, the code should be brought to the attention of new Members as a matter of priority.</P>
    <P>I concur with the points made this morning by Senator Norris regarding Deputy Molloy who is a man who acted honourably and made a mistake. An important element of the guidelines is that they recognise mistakes and allow people to <Col N="1677" /> recover from theirs quickly before issues get out of hand. In addressing this issue we need to ensure we have set ourselves on the right track to improve the image of politics, politicians and public representatives in general.</P>

      <P>resolves that it is expedient that a tribunal be established under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts, 1921 to 2002, to inquire into the following definite matter of urgent public importance:</P>
      <P>&ndash;&nbsp;the facts and circumstances surrounding the fatal shooting of John Carthy at Abbeylara, County Longford on 20 April 2000;</P>
      <P>and to report to the Clerk of Dáil Éireann and to make such findings and recommendations as it sees fit in relation to these matters; and further resolves that:</P>
      <P>(I)&nbsp;the tribunal shall report to the Clerk of the Dáil on an interim basis not later than four months from the date of establishment of the tribunal and also as soon as may be after the tenth day of any oral hearings of the tribunal on the following matters:</P>
      <P>(<i>a</i>) the number of parties granted representation by the tribunal, </P>
      <P>(<i>b</i>) the progress which will then have been made in the hearings and work of the tribunal,</P>
      <P>(<i>c</i>) the likely duration (so far as might then be capable of being estimated) of the proceedings of the tribunal, </P>
      <P>(<i>d</i>) any other matters that the tribunal considers should be drawn to the attention of the Houses of the Oireachtas at the time of the report (including any matters relating to its terms of reference); </P>
      <P>(II) the inquiry shall be completed in as economical a manner as possible and at the earliest possible date consistent with a fair examination of the matters referred to it; </P>
      <P>(III) all costs incurred by reason of the failure of individuals to co-operate fully and expeditiously with the tribunal should, as far as it is consistent with the interests of justice and the provisions of the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts, 1921 to 2002, be borne by those individuals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this motion is to enable the establishment of a tribunal of inquiry to examine the facts and circumstances surrounding the fatal shooting of John Carthy at Abbeylara, County Longford on 20 April 2000. I thank Members of the House for agreeing to deal with this matter at relatively short notice.</P>
      <P>From the outset the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has expressed the view that the tragic death of Mr. Carthy required detailed, open and transparent examination in a manner which addressed issues of public concern. Once the Director of Public Prosecutions decided that charges should not be preferred in the matter, the Minister obtained the agreement of both Houses of the Oireachtas to refer the report of the Garda Commissioner into the fatal shooting to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights for its consideration. This was done and the joint committee submitted the report to both Houses in the form of an interim report, enabling it to be published, and established a sub-committee to consider the report.</P>
      <P>Even in the immediate aftermath of this sad event the Minister did not rule out a public inquiry under the Tribunal of Inquiries Acts. He was of the view that a decision on such an inquiry, before hearing the views of the sub-committee on the report of the Garda Commissioner, would be premature. Senators will also recall that after the initial High Court ruling in this matter last November the Minister indicated his willingness to recommend to the Houses of the Oireachtas that the tragic death of Mr. Carthy be made the subject of a public inquiry under the Tribunal of Inquiries Acts in the event that further inquiries by the Oireachtas could not proceed on legal grounds. The option of proceeding with the Oireachtas sub-committee's inquiry into this matter cannot now be pursued in the light of the recent ruling of the Supreme Court and in accordance with the Minister's previous statements in the matter he obtained Government approval for moving this resolution. Last week's Supreme Court's ruling obviously has wider implications than those applying to the sub-committee's inquiry which need to be examined. The House will appreciate that the judgments were lengthy, detailed and complex and reaching conclusions in relation to what action might need to be taken will inevitably take time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is before the House today is a motion seeking an inquiry into the facts and circumstances surrounding the fatal shooting of John Carthy at Abbeylara, County Longford on 20 April 2000. It should not be taken as a view of any wrongdoing by any member of the Garda Síochána. With other Members of this House, the Minister, in the past, expressed appreciation for the exceptional service to the State of the Garda Síochána. In the light of the unfortunate events of last Sunday when two gardaí, Garda Anthony <Col N="1679" /> Tighe and Garda Michael Padden, lost their lives in the service of the State, it is timely to remember, not only their unstinting service, but also the continuing service afforded the citizenry of this State by their colleagues in the force.</P>
    <P>The fatal shooting of Mr. Carthy clearly does, however, raise serious questions which must be answered and serious issues which must be addressed. The use of firearms by members of the Garda Síochána is in itself a relatively exceptional occurrence in what remains, in general, an unarmed force. This tradition of unarmed policing has been one of the great strengths of the Garda Síochána: there are, however, occasions where gardaí must have the capacity to use firearms and the circumstances where this can occur are strictly regulated by the Garda authorities. The use of firearms is an option of last resort and any incident involving their use is regarded by the Garda authorities as a serious matter. When, as in this case, the use of firearms results in a death, it is a matter of utmost priority to determine the facts leading to and surrounding the death in order to know what happened, the reason it happened and what lessons might be learned for the future. As regards the proposed terms of reference, the Minister believes they are sufficiently specific and comprehensive to allow for a full and complete inquiry into the tragic events at Abbeylara in April 2000. In this regard, it should be noted that the proposed tribunal is being empowered to make such findings and recommendations as it sees fit in relation to the matters falling within its remit.</P>
    <P>Section (I) provides that the tribunal shall report to the Clerk of the Dáil on an interim basis not later than four months from the date of establishment of the tribunal and also as soon as may be after the tenth day of any oral hearings of the tribunal on the following matters: the number of parties granted representation by the tribunal; the progress which will then have been made in the hearings and work of the tribunal; the likely duration, so far as may then be capable of being estimated, of the proceedings of the tribunal; any other matters that the tribunal considers should be drawn to the attention of the Houses of the Oireachtas at the time of the report, including any matters relating to its terms of reference.</P>
    <P>Section (II) provides that the inquiry shall be completed in as economical a manner as possible and at the earliest possible date consistent with a fair examination of the matters referred to it. Section (III) provides that all costs incurred by reason of the failure of individuals to co-operate fully and expeditiously with the tribunal should, as far as it is consistent with the interests of justice and the provisions of the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts, 1921 to 2002, be borne by those individuals.</P>
    <P>The Minister is not yet in a position to announce who will conduct the inquiry, but hopes to make the necessary arrangements as quickly as possible. The circumstances surrounding the <Col N="1680" /> events in Abbeylara in April 2000, which have given rise to this resolution, are matters of public concern. We need to establish what happened and what lessons may be learned for the future. The tribunal, as provided for in the resolution, will be able to effectively discharge this obligation.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the Minister, who is unavoidably absent due to his attendance at the funeral of Garda Michael Padden, I thank the House for taking this motion at short notice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome the introduction of this motion in the House to establish a tribunal of inquiry into the tragic events at Abbeylara in April 2000. It is a great pity that we are here today because the sub-committee of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights was not allowed to proceed with its good work. I was a member of the joint committee when it established the sub-committee and it was felt that it could conclude its work and bring forward a very credible report. Reports of committees or sub-committees of the Oireachtas, such as that of the DIRT inquiry, are inquiries and they have proven most useful and worthwhile. They are much less costly than tribunals of inquiry conducted elsewhere, usually before a senior member of the Judiciary. One never can query a decision of the Supreme Court, but this matter will now pass to a committee appointed by the Oireachtas and answerable to it, through the report of its chairman. I have been reading a summary of the judgment by seven Supreme Court judges and what they have to say is interesting. A minority of them felt the Oireachtas sub-committee could have concluded the hearing, but we nevertheless find ourselves in the current circumstances.</P>
      <P>As a member of the joint committee two years ago, I remember reading the report of the Garda into the incident. Above all else, one was struck by the fact that the Garda had no response to events of the kind involving John Carthy, other than to employ lethal weapons. John Carthy was a very unfortunate young man with serious psychiatric problems and we all agree that made dealing with him all the more difficult. It was graphically described that on one occasion gardaí were within just a few metres of Mr. Carthy's home. They saw him through an open window, slumped in a chair and obviously asleep with a weapon across his lap. That presented an opportunity to storm the house, but that was, apparently, not appropriate. When Mr. Carthy eventually emerged from his house, nothing but lethal force was available to deal with him. There was no disabling gas, no stun guns or stun grenades or any of the other non-lethal weapons now available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Gardaí are not equipped with modern tools to deal with occurrences of this sort, but the use of lethal weapons must at all times be a last resort. While we should be thankful the Garda does not have much experience of dealing with sieges, <Col N="1681" /> training in the future will have to take this kind of incident into account to a much greater extent. We cannot pre-empt the findings of the tribunal of inquiry, but I would be surprised if it does not recommend that gardaí are trained to anticipate what might take place in incidents of this kind and are well prepared for them. They must anticipate, above all else, that an incident of this kind could happen again.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State said that he hopes the tribunal will conclude as quickly and as economically as possible and I emphasise the latter point. The legal costs surrounding tribunals of inquiry have become something of a scandal and are beyond explanation. The legal profession is very good at explaining itself, but it is beyond all credibility that the sums of money that have to be expended on legal fees for tribunals of inquiry are defensible. This money has to be provided from the public purse and some means ought to be found by which to limit or cap the amount that can be expended on fees. While one cannot in any way interfere with a tribunal and its work, some of them have taken a long time to conclude. There is one which has been sitting for almost four years, perhaps even longer. Time means money and in relation to these hearings it means much money. We need to examine the open ended time available to tribunals to conclude their reports.</P>
    <P>I fully welcome this motion, but I regret that we have to move it. Students of politics will be interested in the development of the idea of parliamentary inquires and in their success and low cost. There are wider implications to be looked at in the long term. Due to a constitutional issue raised in both the High Court and the Supreme Court, judges found that the Oireachtas does not have the power to make findings of fact against people that might be damaging to their characters. While that might be the outcome, it would never be intended in an inquiry of this kind, were it allowed to continue, by a sub-committee of a joint committee of these Houses. If I remain in the Oireachtas after the demise of this Seanad, which will take place very soon, I would be very interested in looking at the Constitution and in supporting a constitutional amendment to set aside the difficulties that have been pointed out by the Supreme Court judges in this case.</P>
    <P>I wish the tribunal of inquiry good luck. There is no doubt that it will produce a report establishing all the facts surrounding the tragic death of John Carthy. I only hope we do not have to wait an undue length of time for it. I hope too that we will not see the sort of costs incurred which we have heard so much talk about in connection with other tribunals of inquiry conducted at the behest of these Houses in recent years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion provides the Seanad with an opportunity to comment on an important matter which governs the operations of the Oireachtas at its interface with the judicial system. As the Minister of State rightly said, this <Col N="1682" /> motion is the result of matters leading to the sad episode of the death of John Carthy in Abbeylara on 20 April 2000. There has been much discussion and debate in connection with that incident.</P>
      <P>While at this stage it is probably not possible to propose a better alternative, I regret that we are passing a motion to establish another tribunal of inquiry. Senator Connor rightly pointed out the length of time and enormous costs attached to such public inquiries, which are matters of great public concern. The financial enrichment of some lawyers as a consequence of the establishment of many inquiries has brought the legal profession into some public disrepute. The Oireachtas has also been tainted by this. It is an issue which needs to be examined. Nevertheless, many of the issues addressed by the tribunals are matters of great public concern. Public accountability is essential. It is interesting that the debate which preceded this one focused on the application of high standards of conduct in this House. Hopefully, this code of conduct will be successful and will remove any future need for investigations into practices in the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>Five Supreme Court judges disallowed the appeal in the Abbeylara tribunal while two judges supported it. It is interesting to note that many of the Supreme Court judges concurred with the comments of Mrs. Justice Denham, who said that she would:</P>
      <P>grant the declaration of the conducting of the Joint Oireachtas sub-committee of inquiry into the fatal shooting at Abbeylara on 20 April 2000, capable of leading to adverse findings of fact and conclusions, including a finding of unlawful killing.</P>
      <P>She also commented that the personal culpability of any individual, who is not a Member of the Oireachtas, so as to impugn his or her good name is <i>ultra vires </i>in that the holding of such an inquiry is not within the powers of the Oireachtas. Prior to these statements, I believe that Mrs. Justice Denham also made comments to the effect that it was a matter for the Government to decide whether to initiate legislation or a constitutional referendum. She made it clear that this question was not before the court and therefore did not express an opinion on the matter. I have no doubt that there will be many opportunities for the Oireachtas to consider such matters.</P>
      <P>Mr. Justice Hardiman commented that the report did not constitute any attack upon the work of the Committee of Public Accounts in particular, nor on the power of the Dáil to hold the Government answerable to it. The Committee of Public Accounts in its report on the DIRT inquiry was a fine example of diligence, efficiency and cost-effectiveness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Justice Murphy made the point that, in his opinion, the Oireachtas had the requisite power to set up the sub-committee to conduct the proposed inquiry. It is interesting to note that he anticipated immense practical difficulties in conducting such an inquiry in accordance with the <Col N="1683" /> requirements of natural justice. It would be premature to express an opinion on whether such difficulties can be overcome. The right of any person to protect their good name is something which must be taken into account during any further debate on this matter. People should have the right of cross-examination to ensure that the findings of an inquiry are in no way prejudiced.</P>
    <P>Earlier we discussed the progress report of the All-party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution. Many recommendations have been made in respect of improving the efficiency and input of this House into various aspects of public life. Other jurisdictions seem capable of holding inquiries into matters of public controversy, overcoming many of the difficulties that we have encountered in similar areas. We in the Oireachtas must endeavour to overcome such difficulties. In the case of the Abbeylara inquiry, the Supreme Court decision will enhance our ability to ensure that all public inquiries are conducted in a manner that is in line with the Constitution. If constitutional reform is necessary, the Government must explore that option.</P>
    <P>Successive Governments have failed to address the issue of legal costs. The average person is precluded from taking a case because of the enormous and unnecessary costs involved. To pursue a relatively simple case, one must employ two senior and one junior counsel. I do not understand why this is necessary. It implies that the <i>modus operandi</i> of the Law Library needs to be examined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Public perception of the legal profession is an important part of this. We must question whether the wearing of gowns, wigs and other paraphernalia is part of a modern, republican democracy. The next Government should conduct a root and branch examination of the operation of the legal system. I would like to know why solicitors are discouraged from being advocates in the higher courts. I do not think this is necessary.</P>
      <P>The high cost of insurance has become a major challenge for businesses and individuals. Today's report shows that one of the reasons for the high cost of claims is that 40% of awards are made up of legal costs. Legal costs in Ireland are four times higher than in Britain. There are many compelling reasons that the cost of insurance needs to be investigated. It is apparent that an examination of the legal profession is necessary. Absolute competition within all sectors must be ensured. The EU imposes severe penalties on any body found to be in breach of this position. No profession should be excluded from this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is correct in his move to rapidly establish the Abbeylara inquiry. Hopefully, the progress reports and cost factors which constitute part of the motion will be taken on board and strictly observed by whoever is in charge of the <Col N="1684" /> tribunal. We have seen interminable cross-examination of witnesses at other tribunals, when the value in terms of the issues under consideration seemed to be highly dubious. Days, weeks and months of extremely expensive cross-examination took place. One hopes this tribunal will be conducted in a cost effective manner.</P>
    <P>In Northern Ireland, a police ombudsman has been instituted. That type of system ought to be considered here. We have such a system in place in other sectors and it may be an appropriate way to handle investigations of this nature. It is important that the Garda operate at all times to the highest professional standards. A major part of their function is to save lives, and we have often seen them put themselves at great personal risk in doing so. We should have a mechanism in place for investigations like this, rather than going down the route of public inquiries. I accept, however, that there is no alternative to a public inquiry in the current circumstances and I support the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing to be said about the Abbeylara case is that it was a tragedy for everybody. It was a tragedy for the family and the misfortunate man who, under conditions of extreme illness, appeared to be a threat. It was also a tragedy for the Garda Síochána. There is no question about that. I have been critical of the Garda in the past and probably will be again in the future, but we do not have a trigger-happy police force &ndash; quite the opposite. It could be argued that because we have had such a responsible use of armaments by our police force, they perhaps have not been trained in their use as fully as they should be. That is a matter to be investigated.</P>
      <P>I never believed the Oireachtas sub-committee on Abbeylara was going to make factual findings about individuals. It was possible the investigation would raise questions about the behaviour of individuals, but I believe that sub-committee was simply going to examine procedures, processes and gaps in decision-making. I read the High Court judgment on the case taken by the Garda. I have not yet read the entire Supreme Court judgment, but given that at least one of the judgments runs to 90 pages, I do not think I deserve to be criticised for that yet. I will read the rulings because I find them interesting.</P>
      <P>I will leave the investigation of Abbeylara to the tribunal. A method of investigating matters of concern and identifying the facts as far as is humanly possible is badly needed in every functioning democracy. I dispute with the Supreme Court the implied belief that there is an inherent defect in the political process which means it cannot be done that way. The Judiciary may deny this is what they said, but the bits of the judgments I have read, as opposed to the interpretations or opinions of them, come close to this implication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The courts eloquently defend the good name of individuals, quite rightly, but I find it astonishing that they seem untroubled by the fact that <Col N="1685" /> somebody who is poor or a member of an identifiable minority could well be defamed, by a newspaper for instance, or by a politician outside the Oireachtas, yet there is no redress for people because they are poor and cannot afford access to the defence about which the Supreme Court so eloquently wrote, the protection of one's good name. If the courts are to assert the right of people to vindicate their good name, and as a civil libertarian I would not dispute the principle, then the question of class ought at some stage to enter the consciousness of the Judiciary.</P>
    <P>The reality is that for a large number of people in Irish society, who can be and have been traduced in the past, there is no way of pursuing a legal challenge without putting everything they own in jeopardy. There is a fundamental and central issue here about access to justice, and it is an issue the Judiciary duck in most countries. We know this is the case in the United States, where many of those on death row, for instance, are there because they have been provided with appalling defence lawyers who are poorly funded, poorly advised and poorly equipped to do their job. If a society is divided like that, then the eloquent view of the courts that people should not be adversely affected by, for instance, the behaviour of a Member of the Oireachtas, is meaningless unless they address the fact that for many people it is practically impossible to vindicate that right because they cannot afford to take the risk to do so.</P>
    <P>The courts have a job here, which is either to instruct the Oireacthas to ensure that people are financially able to access the courts, or else to begin showing some of the judicial activism which the present Supreme Court is clearly reluctant to do, and to address the issue of class and poverty when it comes to equality before the law. Otherwise, it may make fine rhetoric, but it contributes very little to the vindication of the rights of all those people who live on salaries unimaginably small to a successful barrister or member of the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>The High Court and Supreme Court rulings on the Abbeylara inquiry and also the judgment on Cabinet confidentiality have all, in their own way, made commentaries on politics and politicians. They have implied, for instance, that if Cabinet discussions were to be a matter of public record, politicians would wilt under the pressure of public opinion. That is a judgment about members of Government made by the Supreme Court which I, as a politician, have always found offensive. This is the most robust of all professions. In every other place except in Cabinet, members of Government and the Opposition have to debate what they stand for in considerable detail and with considerable robustness and they survive.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State will remember a long and arduous pursuit of complex legislation here which we all survived. The Minister did not crumble under it. I have no reason to believe that a member of Government would find it impossible to express himself or herself freely because, under <Col N="1686" /> some circumstances, what he or she says might be a matter of public record. I find that astonishing and quite offensive and I have said that a number of times.</P>
    <P>The references in this judgment to the inability of politicians to be unbiased implies a superiority on the part of the Judiciary which omits the possibility of a different kind of bias. I am not implying a deliberate bias; I am saying explicitly that we all try to be fair in most of what we say and do. None of us can say with certainty that we are entirely fair because we are influenced by our backgrounds, experience and the class from which we come. Our judgments are influenced by all such things. In politics, many of those things are severely challenged by the nature of the business &ndash; a person from a particular background, making assertions, would be subjected to vigorous debate. The correct nature of the Judiciary &ndash; it is outside the political process and independent of it &ndash; means those possibilities are not addressed within the Judiciary with the same vigour as they are in the political process. I invite the Judiciary to reflect on the absence from their rank of anybody who has ever experienced serious social or economic deprivation. How do they address that if nobody in their ranks or those aspiring to be members of the Judiciary have ever experienced such deprivation?</P>
    <P>The record of Irish courts in vindicating the rights of poor people who come before them is, by and large, very good but they have to get there first. Increasingly, the question of cost arises. A very eminent member of the Judiciary, now deceased, suggested on occasion that it would be possible for a judge to ignore parts of the Constitution if they were in conflict with natural law which he saw as the law of God. He was an eminent member of the Judiciary and many of his judgments were wonderful, but it raises the basic idea of an inherent superiority and capacity on the part of the Judiciary to act with impartiality and without the sort of influences which influence mere mortals like me, who is neither a lawyer nor a judge. That point, which is the reason we are going down this route, deserves to be addressed.</P>
    <P>I could, if I wished &ndash; the Cathaoirleach knows I will not &ndash; traduce every member of the Supreme Court. I could make statements about their character for which the Cathaoirleach would, correctly, reprimand me and I would be punished, but I would not be accountable to anybody else because of the absolute privilege we enjoy. I read the references to this in the judgments and I believe the conclusion which the</P>
    <P>courts have drawn about the lack of an inherent right to make findings of fact about individuals does not fit very well with the constitutional assertion that Members have absolute privilege. Why do we have absolute privilege? Before the now notorious beef tribunal, many things were said in the other House about named individuals. The House chose not to punish people under Standing Order No. 58 which forbids such contributions. Leaving aside the merits of that decision, <Col N="1687" /> we had people making findings of fact without investigation. I am at a loss to know how it is possible to say that the Houses of the Oireachtas have no power to inquire about something with a view to making findings of fact when the Constitution carefully protects Members from any suit for defamation. We have the same protection as members of the Judiciary. I cannot accept that it is as clear-cut as members of the Judiciary seem to believe. These powers should be exercised with great discretion.</P>
    <P>Many things about the way in which the sub-committee on Abbeylara did its business were open to criticism, particularly speaking to the media about the issue and matters relating to its procedures. Such things were not done properly. I cannot accept that there is a logical position which says that the Constitution gives Members of this House an extraordinary power of absolute privilege but, essentially, we were never intended to use it. I accept the circumstances are limited and constrained but I cannot accept that the power and the right to use it exists but the intent is that we should never use it. Whatever is contained in Standing Orders, I believe the power was included to ensure that, in difficult circumstances, the Oireachtas would be in a position to do what needed to be done. Who is to inquire into the misbehaviour of the Judiciary if the Members of the Oireachtas do not have the right to do so? I support the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I also support the motion. The question of who shall judge the judges is older than I can remember. It was the subject matter of a full Shakespearean play. People in the 17th century scratched their heads and puzzled themselves, as Shakespeare would say, out of thought on that question and did not find answers. That question has puzzled a great many people since then. Perhaps in this, the 21st century, we might revisit that question not perhaps with the same pageantry as Shakespeare, but with intent. It is an interesting question to pursue because, in a democracy, there must be some yardstick by which every functionary is measured. Senator Ryan has posed a very interesting question. If it is to be pursued by elected politicians, it will be done in the next session. It is an interesting question which, if it was the subject matter of a full discussion and some thought, would yield a very interesting outcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the institution of this inquiry. There are times when, tragically, we are reminded very forcefully of the role of the Garda in our society. Our State grew out of violence, guerrilla warfare, skirmishing and very difficult growing pains. It is a measure of the wisdom of the founding fathers of this State that they put in place for the new State an unarmed police force. That was an extraordinary and courageous thing to do in the context of the times out of which we were emerging. Great credit is due to the founding fathers for their foresight and insight in forging the kind of <Col N="1688" /> police force they considered right for this community. That is to their credit and it should not be forgotten.</P>
    <P>Another Member said earlier that our police force is one of the most respected in the world. Part of the reason for that derives from the fact that, at its institution, it was set up as an unarmed police force. Due to that initial decision, the Garda Síochána was always seen as the protectors of the most vulnerable people in the community. That is the way we want it to remain and that is the way the Garda has always carried out its duty, which is one of care and protection of life and limb and property. It has done that, without exception, in a most exemplary way down through the decades since its foundation. That is the reason the Garda is held in such esteem and respect and long may that continue.</P>
    <P>Looking back on recent events from which we are emerging and the shellshock of the 30 years of slaughter and violence in Northern Ireland and the way that campaign impacted on the South, it is remarkable that the Garda managed to discharge its functions in the manner in which it did during those 30 years. There is no doubt that historians will advert to that fact and pay tribute to the Garda when a more detailed historic analysis of that period is carried out.</P>
    <P>What happened in Abbeylara was immensely sad and tragic. It was an accident that left its mark on the family of the young man. As a family member it is hard to take an event of that nature. It is hard to convince oneself that somehow or other this was an accident that could have been avoided. That is the way families feel. It is the same as when somebody dies in the context of an operation in a hospital. When somebody is in hospital, they believe they should not die. They think their son or brother should not have died in those circumstances. That is understandable and was, no doubt, taken into account when the Government decided to set up the tribunal. Our natural expectation and that of the family that the Garda is there to protect us has been taken into account. One of the reasons I welcome the tribunal of inquiry is that it will give reassurance to the family that those of us who make laws and public policy decisions are prepared to go that extra distance to ensure their concerns are taken into account in any procedure we put in place.</P>
    <P>As well as that, it gives protection to the Garda as a force. It has welcomed the setting up of the tribunal of inquiry because nothing eats more into the reputation of a body, such as the Garda Síochána, than a finger of suspicion and the fear that the rumour might become a reality. That suspicion could linger and people might seek to keep the suspicion alive that something untoward happened. Suspicions such as that eat into public confidence like rust into an old gate. They are very corrosive of people's confidence in the force and in public policy and policy makers. This is an important measure designed to allay the fears of family members. It is also designed to protect the <Col N="1689" /> reputation of the Garda and in that respect it is welcome and should be supported.</P>
    <P>We were reminded sharply this week of the lifestyle young men and women take on when they decide to become members of the Garda Síochána. The inbuilt risk in the job they undertake was underlined when two valued members of the Garda Síochána were killed instantly having set out in the early morning specifically to prevent an accident or death involving other citizens. In an accident prevention measure which they set out to put in place, they became the first victims and were killed. If we needed to be reminded of the role the Garda play in the community, it was illustrated strongly that they were prepared to put their own lives at risk to ensure other lives were not lost. That is the kind of force we have and that is its attitude to the protection of life and limb. That approach is valued by everybody in the House. To ensure that respect for the Garda continues to be a feature of life, it is important to have this kind of inquiry.</P>
    <P>I was extremely disappointed that what I believed to be an honest effort on the part of a committee of the House finished in such failure. It will be a matter for the next Government and the next Dáil to make whatever changes are necessary to enable the inquiry to be carried out by democratically elected Members of the Houses. That is a function elected Members would like to discharge as part of their public duty. The merits of this type of approach to investigating problems were well illustrated by the previous speaker when he pointed out that because of the composition of the Houses and the different experiences and insights we bring to a matter of this nature, we could do valuable work. However, that was not to be. Due to the way the Constitution is constructed, it was struck down by the Supreme Court. I hope the matter will be visited again and that changes will be made to enable a Dáil committee to carry out an investigation of this kind. That is a matter for the next Government.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that we now have a plethora of tribunals investigating matters of the not so recent past. They are long and expensive and it is difficult to know when there will be an outcome. It is difficult to explain to ourselves that in a country that has laid so much store on its intellectual capital and brain power that it takes so long to deliver the results of investigations carried on by tribunals of inquiry. Anything that can be done to build a system that would eliminate the need to go so frequently to public sworn tribunals of inquiry would be a move in the right direction.</P>
    <P>For that reason it is important that an ombudsman should be established in this area. A number of issues that seem to become directly the subject of a tribunal without any intermediary stages of investigation could be dealt with by such an ombudsman. I would like that to be an outcome of this tribunal. That would enable a party with a grievance to bring it to the attention of the ombudsman, which is a feature of policing in <Col N="1690" /> Northern Ireland. We must work to put such a structure in place. I hope that will be one of the results of these discussions.</P>
    <P>I suspect that a timeframe will be put on the tribunal's deliberations. The Minister of State might confirm that. I apologise for not being here to hear his contribution. Such a timeframe would be important.</P>
    <P>I started my contribution by quoting Shakespeare and I will finish by quoting him. He said, &ldquo;Sweet are the uses of adversity&rdquo;. I hope that valuable lessons will be taken from the findings of this tribunal which can be implemented in the future to ensure that it will not be necessary to have another tribunal of this nature. I hope there will not be a repeat of what happened in Abbeylara, but it would be optimistic to assume that it would never happen again. If it did, I hope we would have a different and more cost effective way of dealing with it. I support the setting up of this tribunal.</P>

      <P>I met a man the other day who told me that he had celebrated his eightieth birthday recently. He said he was born on the same week that the Garda Síochána was established in 1922. He talked with pride of the Garda and his admiration for a force that was his own age and with which he had grown up.</P>
      <P>Senator Quill spoke about our having an unarmed Garda. When one takes into account what was happening at the time, it was a brave step for those in authority in 1922 to decide to have an unarmed force. We all, therefore, regret greatly the fact that the gardaí are not unarmed on every occasion. I had an experience 20 years ago of meeting the special branch in a situation where they were armed and I spent some time in their company. I came to admire those men who knew the responsibility they had and knew that they lived with it. I came to admire their courage. We talked about the courage not only of those members of the force who are armed but of those members, such as the two gardaí who died last Sunday, who in their daily work risk their lives, as they do continually not only in that type of situation but in many others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tragedy of April 2000 was not only the death of John Carthy and that tragic loss for his family but the tragedy of the sadness and horror felt by those who were actively involved in that terrible shooting, which must weigh very heavily on them. We are all concerned about how that happened and how best to make sure it never happens again. It would be a tragedy if we lost something else, the body of law and due process built up over centuries that has protected us as citizens and that we have managed to maintain. We must make sure nothing we do damages that. When the Oireachtas committee was established, there was an investigation into whether that was the right way to proceed. It was understandable that such an investigation took place, but it was not surprising when a case went to the High Court and its judgment was challenged in the <Col N="1691" /> Supreme Court. We have had to consider if the setting up of such a tribunal is a more correct way to deal with a case such as this.</P>
    <P>I came to admire the workings of the Supreme Court. I ended up in a court case that was appealed to the Supreme Court in 1971 and I was pleased when I heard I won that case. I came to admire our law greatly and also the strength, thought and work done by those Supreme Court judges on that and on other occasions. As Senator Ryan said, one of the judgments runs to 160 pages. I will not pretend to have read all the judgments. The Supreme Court has served us well in its decision that there is a better way to investigate cases such as this. There are many issues on which the Oireachtas can deliberate apart from making decisions of fact and decisions on the culpability or the performance of individuals. We must not tamper, tinker or risk damaging the centuries of law that have protected our citizens. It is a matter for another day to consider how Oireachtas committees can handle such situations and whether there is a better way to do so.</P>
    <P>I am pleased it has been agreed that a tribunal will be set up. It will come within the law, the traditional method and constitutional system, which will protect the rights of the individual. I support the setting up of a tribunal. I believe we will look back on this case in later years and say that this was the correct way to deal with it and that this is the way we will protect our Constitution and citizens in the future.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the comments of the Senators who spoke. I acknowledge the many tributes paid to the two gardaí who lost their lives last Sunday. I want to clarify that my ministerial colleague, Deputy O'Donoghue, is attending the funeral of Garda Michael Padden in Belmullet, County Mayo. Senator Quill and other Senators talked about the role of the Garda in protecting the community. These two gardaí lost their lives while on duty trying to protect members of the community in my home area of south Dublin. It is only right and proper that so many tributes were paid by Senators to the great public service the Garda provide in very dangerous circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate the widespread desire to establish fully the facts of what transpired in Abbeylara. Mr. Carthy's family and representatives of the Garda Síochána have welcomed the fact that a public inquiry is to be established. The Supreme Court's ruling has implications which need to be considered. The parliamentary legal adviser has recently prepared for Members an overview of the Supreme Court ruling, which no doubt we will all consider carefully. A number of Senators raised the issue of whether there is a need for new mechanisms to deal with the situation where inquiries are needed in respect of the Garda Síochána. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has stated that a new Garda inspectorate will be established which will have the <Col N="1692" /> capacity to examine every aspect of Garda operations policy from the point of view of best policing practice. For the purpose of carrying out all its functions, the inspectorate will operate completely independently and its staff will be appointed by and be responsible to the inspectorate. The overall purpose is to introduce new independent and transparent procedures which reflect modern conditions in order to maintain and enhance public support for the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>Senator Connor and others asked about the progress that has been made regarding the acquisition by the Garda of non-lethal weapons for dealing with seige-type situations. A working group under the chairmanship of an assistant commissioner has examined and tested various types of less than lethal weapons which included live test firing of various projectiles. Following the submission of the working group's report, the Garda Commissioner established an implementation team to identify logistical and training requirements and to develop operational guidelines for the use of less than lethal weapons. The work of the implementation team is at an advanced stage and will be concluded soon. I am told the Minister will consider the matter fully when these practical issues have been addressed. Senators have been very supportive of what we are doing and I thank them for their constructive comments.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann resolves that sections 2 to 12, 14 and 17 of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act, 1998 (No. 39 of 1998), shall continue in operation for the period of 12 months beginning on 30 June, 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>The resolution before the House seeks approval for the continuance in force of those sections of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act, 1998, which would otherwise cease to be in operation on 30 June 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members of this House will need no reminding of the circumstances in which these provisions were enacted in 1998, that is, the Omagh bomb in August of that year. There was a determination, nowhere more than in this House, that those responsible for this mass murder would not succeed in subverting the democratically expressed will of the people on this island that the conflict should be resolved only by peaceful means and on the basis of consent. To date, one person has been convicted in this jurisdiction on a charge related to the Omagh bomb and the investigation is continuing with excellent co-operation between the Garda and the Police Service of Northern <Col N="1693" /> Ireland. The Garda Síochána will never give up the search for those responsible.</P>
    <P>Senators will recall that in recognition of the particular circumstances surrounding the enactment of the provisions of the 1998 Act, there was general agreement that the Act should be regularly revisited by the Oireachtas to see if the circumstances then prevailing justified the continuance in force of its provisions, or whether there had been a change in circumstances sufficient to convince the Oireachtas that the provisions were no longer needed. Under section 18 of the Act, therefore, as amended by section 37 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1999, and by virtue of resolutions passed by each House of the Oireachtas firstly on 20 June 2000 and, more recently, on 26 June 2001, sections 2 to 12, 14 and 17 will cease to operate on and from 30 June 2002 unless a further resolution is passed by each House authorising the sections to continue to operate for such period not exceeding 12 months as may be specified in the resolution.</P>
    <P>Also included in the Act was a requirement on the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to lay a report on the operation of the Act before each House of the Oireachtas prior to any consideration by the Houses of the renewal of the provisions. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform laid such a report before this House on 17 April. The conclusion of that report is that the renewal of the provisions for a further year is necessary. The sad reality is that those responsible for the Omagh bomb continue to pursue and plan a campaign of violence and that there is no change of substance to the circumstances which led to the enactment of the 1998 Act.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to the individual sections which this House is asked to continue in force for a further 12 months, outline their purpose and indicate where they have been utilised in the past 12 months. Section 2 provides that where, in any proceedings against a person for membership of an unlawful organisation, evidence is given that the accused when questioned failed to answer or gave false or misleading answers to any question material to the investigation of the offence, the court may draw such inferences from that failure or from the furnishing of a false or misleading reply as appear proper. This provision has been utilised on many occasions in questioning persons arrested on suspicion of being members of an unlawful organisation. Charges do not result in every case in which the provision is used but since 1 June 2001 charges were preferred in 22 cases in which section 2 was utilised. Two of these cases resulted in a conviction, while the remaining cases are currently before the courts. In addition, three persons were convicted during the period under report having been charged prior to that period in cases where this section was utilised.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Act provides that in proceedings for an offence of membership of an unlawful organisation, the accused must give notification of an intention to call a person to give <Col N="1694" /> evidence on his or her behalf, unless the court permits otherwise. This section was utilised by accused persons on two occasions.</P>
    <P>Section 4 amends section 3 of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act, 1972. The effect of the 1972 provision is that any statement or conduct by a person accused of membership of an unlawful organisation implying or leading to a reasonable inference that he was at a material time a member of such an organisation shall be evidence that he or she was then such a member. It originally defined the expression &ldquo;conduct&rdquo; as including an omission by an accused person to deny published reports that he was a member of an unlawful organisation. The change made by section 4 of the 1998 Act was to expand the definition of &ldquo;conduct&rdquo; to include movements, actions, activities or associations. This simply aligns the definition of conduct in the 1972 Act with the reference to movements, actions, activities or associations used in section 2 of the 1998 Act.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides for the drawing of adverse inferences in the prosecution of a person for any offence under the Offences against the State Acts, any offence scheduled under the Acts and any offence arising out of the same set of facts as such an offence, provided that the offence carries a penalty of five years imprisonment or more. The effect of this section is to allow a court to draw inferences where the accused relies on a fact in his or her defence that he or she could reasonably have been expected to mention during questioning or on being charged but did not do so. This section was utilised on 13 occasions in the past nine months.</P>
    <P>Section 6 established the offence of directing, at any level of the organisation's structure, the activities of an organisation in respect of which a suppression order has been made under the Offences against the State Act, 1939. While this section was not utilised during the period under report, one person remains before the courts having been charged with such an offence prior to that period.</P>
    <P>Section 7 made it an offence to possess articles in circumstances giving rise to a reasonable suspicion that the article is in his or her possession for a purpose connected with the commission, preparation or instigation of specified firearms or explosives offences. This section was utilised on 20 occasions.</P>
    <P>Section 8 made it an offence to collect, record or possess information which is of such a nature that it is likely to be useful to members of an unlawful organisation in the commission of serious offences. Two persons were convicted under this section in the period under report, having been charged prior to that period.</P>
    <P>Section 9 made it an offence to withhold information which a person knows or believes might be of material assistance in preventing the commission by any other person of a serious offence or securing the apprehension, prosecution, or conviction of any other person for such an <Col N="1695" /> offence and who fails without reasonable excuse to disclose such information to a member of the Garda Síochána. This section was utilised on 115 occasions.</P>
    <P>Section 10 extends the maximum period of detention permitted under section 30 of the Offences against the State Act, which otherwise is 48 hours, to 72 hours on the authorisation of a District Court judge. The judge must be satisfied, on the application of an officer of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of superintendent, that the further detention is necessary for the proper investigation of the offence concerned and that the investigation is being conducted diligently and expeditiously. The person being detained is entitled to be present in court during the application and to make, or to have made, submissions on his or her behalf. In the past year, 39 persons have had their periods of detention extended under this provision and five of these were subsequently charged with offences.</P>
    <P>Section 11 allows a District Court judge to permit the rearrest and detention of a person in respect of an offence for which he or she was previously detained under section 30 of the Offences against the State Act but released without charge. This further period must not exceed 24 hours, and can only be authorised in circumstances where the District Court judge is satisfied, on information supplied on oath by a member of the Garda Síochána, that further information has come to the knowledge of the Garda Síochána about that person's suspected participation in the offence and about which they wish to question the suspect.</P>
    <P>Section 12 made it an offence for a person to instruct or train another person in the making or use of firearms or explosives or to receive such training without lawful authority or reasonable excuse. The effect of section 14 is to make these new offences scheduled offences for the purposes of Part V of the 1939 Act. This means that persons suspected of committing such offences are liable to arrest under section 30 of the 1939 Act. This section was utilised on 56 occasions.</P>
    <P>Section 17 builds on the provision in the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, providing for the forfeiture of property. Essentially, the 1994 provision empowers a court, in its discretion, whenever any person is convicted of an offence, to order the forfeiture of any property in the possession of that person which was used, or intended to be used, to facilitate the commission of the offence. The effect of section 17 is, in the case of a person convicted of specified offences relating to the possession of firearms or explosives, and where there is property liable to forfeiture under the 1994 Act, to require the court to order the forfeiture of such property unless it is satisfied that there would be a serious risk of injustice if it made such an order.</P>
    <P>This information on the use made of these provisions of the 1998 Act over the last nine months is based on information received from the Garda <Col N="1696" /> authorities and is contained in the report on the Act laid by the Minister before this House. This report, together with the previous one, shows that the key provisions of the Act are taking effect. We are now seeing the results of this legislation. During the past nine months the section 2 provision regarding adverse inferences was used in 22 cases, resulting in two convictions and 20 pending charges, and two persons were convicted under section 8 in relation to information likely to be useful to members of an unlawful organisation.</P>
    <P>Of course the most significant result in the Garda's fight against subversive activity was the conviction of a person on a charge of conspiracy to cause an explosion in relation to the Omagh atrocity. The provisions of the 1998 Act were used appropriately by the Garda in this case and will continue to be used in their efforts to bring to justice all those responsible for that horrific act.</P>
    <P>At the same time it should be noted that the number of persons held under extended detention under section 10 over the past year was 39, a relatively modest number, and one which, taken together with all of the other information outlined, supports my view that the provisions of the Act are reasonable and proportionate and are being implemented by the Garda in a measured and restrained manner.</P>
    <P>There are of course some provisions which did not take effect in the context of court proceedings during the period under report, but even here the Garda authorities have informed the Minister that the provisions in question have been utilised where appropriate by the Garda during the investigation of offences. Senators will appreciate that many of the investigations at issue are, by their nature, ongoing.</P>
    <P>The Garda have had considerable success over the past nine months in combating those who would subvert through the use of violence the democratic wishes of the people on this island and the House will join me in congratulating the force on its achievements. However, the threat to life and to our democratic values which led to the enactment of the 1998 Act remains. So, too, does the determination of the House never to give in to such a threat but to provide the Garda and the criminal justice system with all legitimate means of combating it. The 1998 Act is an important part of those means that is proving its worth and I ask the House to continue it in force.</P>
    <P>In addition to these security concerns, which alone would justify the continuance in force of these provisions, there is another consideration in favour of their continuance. The Offences against the State Acts, including the 1998 Act, are currently under review by a committee under the chairmanship of former Supreme Court Judge, Mr. Justice Anthony Hederman, on foot of a commitment in the Good Friday Agreement. The final report from the review is imminent and it clearly would make no sense to allow the provisions of the 1998 Act to lapse before the com<Col N="1697" /> mittee reported its conclusions on those very provisions.</P>
    <P>Much has been achieved in the implementation of the peace process and much remains to be done but there are still those who would threaten to subvert that process through violence. The 1998 Act is part of the democratic response to that threat and I ask the House to continue in force the relevant provisions of that Act for a further 12 months.</P>
    <P>I commend the resolution to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I have little to say other than to support the continuance of these sections of the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act, 1998. I remember speaking in the debate on the Bill four years ago as I was then justice spokesperson. It is a great pity in a democracy that we need to have these draconian laws on our Statute Book and to continue with them for a further 12 months. I remember we expressed the wish in 1998 that the Act would have currency for no more than two years and that the particular problem it set out to address would have been solved or dealt with in that period. Unfortunately that is not the case, as the Garda report shows. The legislation was enacted as a direct result of the horrific atrocity in Omagh in August 1998, which was carried out by a splinter group that wanted to overthrow all the achievements of the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement. It might have succeeded but for the fact that a stronger arm had to be given to investigating gardaí in their fight against this. It remains a matter of regret that those who perpetrated that appalling atrocity have not yet been brought to justice satisfactorily. Some progress has been made in the investigation and one person was charged. This was the work of a group of evildoers who have not yet been brought to book.</P>
      <P>On the other side in Northern Ireland there remain groups on the loyalist side who will do everything they possibly can to destroy and subvert the achievements of the Good Friday Agreement. Their particular targets are the Unionist parties participating in the power-sharing Assembly and Executive of Northern Ireland. The greatest achievement they could manage would be to overthrow that and to set things back to where they were before 1997.</P>
      <P>We agree to sections 2 to 12, 14 and 17 continuing in operation for a further 12 months with a certain amount of regret that this remains necessary. We can only look forward to the day when we shall be able to deal with the business of removing those sections. Let us hope that occurs in the next 12 months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator Connor, I support this resolution. It is a pity it is necessary to have to extend the operation of various sections of the Act, given the work done both North and South to give practical expression to the peace process. Significant progress has been made but unfortunately, as the Minister of State outlined, there is <Col N="1698" /> compelling evidence from the Garda of the necessity to extend the operation of the Act. Further decommissioning of arms by the IRA was a welcome development and it was right that David Trimble called on loyalists and other organisations to follow suit and remove the threat to ordinary citizens of this island. Human life is inviolate and thankfully we have gone past the situation that existed for almost three decades. Through the efforts of many, most people on this island are looking forward to a better future, not only for themselves but for their children and future generations.</P>
      <P>It is also incumbent on the Oireachtas to provide the framework for the Garda to combat illegal activities in all their forms but particularly in this area. They have been very effective and obviously good use has been made of this Act. Closer co-operation between the Garda and the Police Service of Northern Ireland will also be very influential in combating paramilitary activity which is now branching into criminal areas, perhaps to support lifestyles and other operations which had developed over the years. Anything we can do in the areas of policy and empowerment of the Garda &ndash; working with the Police Service of Northern Ireland &ndash; to eradicate these problems is welcome.</P>
      <P>We can look beyond this measure to the establishment of the Criminal Assets Bureau. That was a particularly innovative and effective measure in combating criminal activity and has become a model for other countries. There has also been much recent discussion of public order offences and if we apply our minds to this a similar innovative approach can also be introduced. It is essential to protect people's human rights but it is also essential that the well-being of the community at large is fully protected by whatever steps are necessary to deal with those who will not comply with the rule of law.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable that these measures are necessary, but we must recognise that this is the case. I support the continuation of the legislation for another 12 months. Hopefully in the not too distant future, a Minister will have reason to advise the House that this legislation is no longer necessary as activity which threatens the lives of ordinary, decent people has come to an end.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was only reading my party's press releases on the topic which were colourful.</P>
      <P>Whatever one may think about these measures being draconian, we have to be grateful that in this country and in the neighbouring jurisdiction we operate according to the laws of basic civilisation. If we had been in the Middle East it is clear that after the Omagh bomb the British Army would have invaded at least six counties of this State in pursuit of mayhem and destruction. That seems to be regarded as the appropriate response to similar activities by what is supposed to be another member of the community of democratic nations. It is not to belittle Omagh or the horrific suicide bombings to repeat the intention to retain due process to deal with dreadful acts of violence against civilians to which the question of intent is irrelevant. Anyone who plants a bomb of that kind in an area where there is a significant risk that large numbers of civilians will be killed should not come to me or anyone else whinging that they did not intend to kill anyone, but that they forgot to make the necessary telephone call. It is their responsibility. It is murder and it should be called nothing else.</P>
      <P>After some of the rhetorical flourishes in hotels around Dublin in recent weeks we should repeat that however we may wish to move on, we do not do so by pretending that murder did not happen when it did. We may not wish for recriminations or punishment, but we are not going to have unequivocal murder turned into something else for the political convenience of people who thought they were entitled to carry it out.</P>
      <P>I will not oppose the extension of these sections. However, the decision to leave them open to regular review was sensible and temperate because it requires the Minister to produce information on how they are being used. One of my reservations regarding the possibility of these powers being used excessively has been disposed of by the statistics supplied by the Minister of State in his speech and by the reports laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. The powers are being used in a measured and sustained way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am still concerned by the astonishing provision in section 8 which makes it an offence to collect, record or possess information which is of such a nature that it is likely to be useful to members of an unlawful organisation in the commission of serious offences. Members should consider this provision. I am not averse to dealing with people in cases where it can be proved that information in their possession will be used in this way. However, the section makes it an offence to have in one's possession information which is likely to be useful to members of an unlawful organisation. This power has not been misused or abused, but it is a fairly hair-raising concept that an offence is committed because the information is likely to be of use in the commission of offences. I have pointed out that airline timetables are likely to be of use to someone who wishes to hijack a plane. I accept that such a scenario is not what was intended by the legislation, <Col N="1700" /> but sometimes in the rush after dreadful events such as the Omagh bomb things can be said or inserted in legislation which have a broader scope than was intended.</P>
    <P>This legislation has to be renewed every year and it has been used infrequently. The Garda is pursuing, and I hope always will pursue, the perpetrators of the Omagh bombing. I hope no new deal will prevent those who carried out that bombing from appearing before a court and at least being found guilty. That was a horrendous, dreadful event which was deliberately designed to undermine the best hope for peace this island had for 30 years. It is worth remembering that, as a proportion of the population, the number of people killed in Omagh was far greater than in New York on 11 September. That is not to make little of what happened on 11 September, but Omagh was far worse proportionately. The perpetrators of that bombing deserve to be pursued by civilised methods because we are better than them. That is what this legislation is about. It is on the boundaries of how far we can go, but it is within the framework of what I would regard as civilised legislation. I will escape from my dilemma by stating that I will not oppose the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion and compliment the Minister of State and those involved in drafting the legislation. This is important legislation and we welcome its extension for a further 12 months. Important points have been made regarding the sections of the legislation, particularly section 12 which deals with instructing and training people in the making or use of firearms or explosives. People got away with such activities and this must be brought to an end.</P>
      <P>A small minority of people are actively trying to wreck agreements and seeking to destroy the peace process. Senator Ryan referred to the Omagh bomb and the catastrophe on 11 September which no one will ever forget. We in this country will never forget the bombings which took place here and it was the luck of God that many more hundreds or thousands of people did not lose their lives. We welcome the visible improvements in cross-Border co-operation. I support the motion. The provision allows for the extension of these sections for a further 12 months, but the legislation must remain in place for whatever length of time is required to ensure the protection of the people of this State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter relates to a contract made with the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources in relation to the provision of a cargo and ferry service to the Aran Islands. It deals also with the details of the contract and its renewal in 1997.</P>
      <P>I have a number of questions in relation to the contract and, in particular, to its renewal. I have a specific query in relation to the Government's contract committee. In reply to various queries made to the Department it states that, in consultation with the Attorney General's office, it decided to approve the Department's proposal. Will the Minister clarify whether the Attorney General's office actually approved the proposed contract? The Department also says that following legal advice, and the approval of the general contracts committee in the Department of Finance, it was agreed to enter into the new contract. I am anxious to have details of what legal advice was given and who gave it.</P>
      <P>A query also being raised is that the company that contracted with the Department in 1992, O'Brien Shipping Limited, had difficulty making repayments. This was discussed during the course of negotiations for the new contract. In response to queries put to the Department, no reference was made to inflation as the reason given by the Department for a seven year extension. It seems strange that a seven year extension was given to a contract signed in 1992 because it was stated that the company concerned would withdraw the service if it did not get additional funds and that it would take four to five months to replace the service. That is the reason given for the extension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At that time there were other companies providing a service. There was a cargo service operating without a subsidy and Island Ferries was operating a passenger service, also without a subsidy, on a seven day a week basis. If the Department had that opinion at the time, why did it not enter negotiations five months before the contract was due to expire in 1997 instead of pay<Col N="1702" /> ing O'Brien Shipping the sum of &euro;233,000 during the four months of negotiation? Why did it not invite additional new tenders? These questions must be answered.</P>
    <P>Inquiries also suggest that the Department sought and received advice from the Chief State Solicitor. In response to a parliamentary question, the Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy Coughlan, stated that there would be a saving to the Exchequer if a seven year contract was awarded to O'Brien Shipping. However, just a day before that particular contract was renewed in 1997, a contract was also signed with Island Ferries to provide a passenger service from Rossaveal at a cost of &euro;228,0000 per annum. The then Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy Ó Cuív, was highly critical at the time of the existing service to Galway. There are a number of other issues. In reply to one query the Department states that the O'Brien service is primarily for cargo, yet there were other companies providing cargo services as well.</P>
    <P>There are fundamental questions requiring answers in relation to the contract itself and to non-compliance with the contract. For instance, the <i>Oileán Árainn</i> is supposed to have side boarding ramps off the main deck to enable vehicles to be transported. The Department states that the vessel is fitted with ramps but the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Fahey, states that the vessel is not fitted with ramps but can lift vehicles on and off. The facility being provided to get vehicles on is dubious and would not comply with EU regulations and standards of safety. The particular ramps are not fitted but are moveable and, I suggest, dangerous. The ramps should be attached to the vessel. What surveyor in the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources surveyed the vessel to see that it complied with the specifications under EU Directive L144 of 1998? The current facility is makeshift and does not comply with EU regulations.</P>
    <P>Who approved the renewal of the contract with O'Brien Shipping and who gave the advice? Who in the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources saw fit to enforce the load line regulations on competitors of O'Brien Shipping while not applying them to <i>The Happy Hooker</i> at the same time? Other vessels in Cappagh and Westport were examined, investigated and inspected by the Department whereas this one, which was operating, was not. That leaves a question to be answered.</P>
    <P>Is the Department happy that two directors of the company recently made a tax settlement with the Revenue Commissioners? Who approved the removable ramps for the <i>Oileán Árainn</i>? <i>The Happy Hooker </i>which is a standby vessel has never had a statutory load line certificate, yet the Government has contracted to do business with it. That is a fundamental breach of the contract. The <i>Oileán Árainn</i> is operating without side loading ramps for vehicles which also breaches the <Col N="1703" /> conditions of the contract because it is paid and subsidised by the Government to provide a roll-off service.</P>
    <P>These questions need to be answered but they cannot be answered until there is a thorough and full investigation into what has gone on in relation to the entire service. Will the Minister undertake a full investigation in relation to the non-compliance with the contract and regarding the discrimination in the Department in relation to the non-inspection of these particular vessels and the inspection of other vessels that operate without being provided with subsidies from the Department?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Ms Coughlan Ms Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Ms Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>My reply will be circulated but arising from what the Senator said I will move away from the text. It is often difficult for a Minister to respond to a Senator when one has only been given a broad outline of the terms of the Adjournment Debate, such as this debate which refers to the provision of passenger and cargo services to the Aran Islands.</P>
      <P>The background to the Government's policy in relation to offshore islands and the core policy goal of the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands is the promotion of sustainable development on the populated offshore islands and, in particular, the provision of adequate levels of service to these islands. My Department has, as one of its aims in a statement of strategy, the facilitation of adequate, year round access to transport for island communities. This is the first time since 1997 that the implementation of such a policy &ndash; completed by me &ndash; has led to a subsidised service being provided to all the populated islands. This is a huge expense to the State but, in the context of facilitating access for people on the islands, it is money well spent.</P>
      <P>In 1997, only four islands were facilitated by the service which included ferry services between Inishbofin, Inishturk and Clare Island and the mainland, a ferry service between Cape Clear Island and the mainland, ferry services between Sherkin, Whiddy, Bear, Long and Hare Islands and the mainland and ferry services between Tory and Aranmore Islands and the mainland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation specifically to the Aran Islands, my Department funds the following services: a passenger and freight ferry service from Galway to the Aran Islands, a daily passenger ferry service between Inis Mor and Ros a'Mhíl and Inis Meain and Inis Oirr and Ros a'Mhíl and a daily air service between the Aran Islands and the mainland. The first of these Aran Islands services &ndash; the cargo and passenger ferry service between Galway city and the Aran Islands &ndash; is operated by O'Brien Shipping Limited for the period from 1 January 1998 to 31 December 2004 at a cost of &euro;603,125 per annum. Under the terms of the contract between my Department and O'Brien Ship<Col N="1704" /> ping, this service operates three days per week during the winter months and four days per week during the summer. However, I understand that in practice the company provides a seven day a week service during the summer months by providing non-contracted sailings on the other three days of the week. The Department does not facilitate these additional services.</P>
    <P>The second of these services &ndash; the passenger ferry service between Ros a'Mhíl and the Aran Islands &ndash; is operated by Island Ferries Teoranta for the period from 1 September 1999 to 31 August 2002 at a cost of &euro;228,552 per annum. Under this contract, all three Aran Islands have, for the first time, a subsidised passenger ferry service seven days per week and all year round. While these services have improved the quality of safe access to these islands, my Department recognises that there is also a need for air access facilities to complement the ferry services which my Department has subsidised since 1970.</P>
    <P>As a representative of County Clare, the Senator will be aware that my Department has had a plethora of freedom of information requests and parliamentary questions from her colleagues in the Dáil. She refers to specific issues which I will address in the context of a written response because I do not have the exact facts to hand.</P>
    <P>I have no responsibility for the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources. All the ferry services provided and supported by this Department have been cleared by the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources and the requirements set down by the Department. The Department of the Marine and Natural Resources issues the relevant documentation to each of the operators. This forms part of the conditions of the contract.</P>

      <P>The Senator referred to that in a written inquiry a number of days ago regarding the side-boarding ramps. This is a matter for the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources rather than me, but I will ask the officials in the Department to examine that matter.</P>
      <P>The Senator also referred to the contract renewal in 1997 which was dealt with through the normal Government contract committee. It was approved and legal advice was obtained by my Department from the Attorney General. It was thought a roll-over from five to seven years would give a greater cost benefit to the Department and the State.</P>

I will advise the Senator of the other information she requested.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Matters. - School Staffing.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter concerns a primary school in Dublin Central &ndash; the Taoiseach's constituency &ndash; and relates to staffing ratios and resources. This is a disadvantaged area in the docklands. It is an isolated community bounded by the railway line on one side and the sea on the other. The area has not received its fair share of Dublin city's recent development. Surrounding schools in other disadvantaged areas have received preferential treatment compared to this school. It has not been in receipt of any of the schemes which have been forthcoming for the other schools with the result that there has been a reduction in staffing. This has meant the school has been unable to meet the needs of the community. Some six to eight young pupils who were unable to start school last September and who tried to start last Christmas were turned away because of insufficient staffing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My concern is that the school has been losing pupils and will shortly lose parental confidence. If that happens, the school could easily lose its <Col N="1706" /> ability to continue and other surrounding schools could suck up its pupils.</P>
    <P>That would sound the death knell for the community which has few facilities, even though it comprises 1,500 homes, and which, although it would be considered large in a rural area, is seen as small in Dublin. It has a post office, pub and petrol station. A road, which carries huge juggernauts, runs one side of it, which isolates it to a degree, about which I hope the port tunnel does something.</P>
    <P>The main concern about the school is the pupil-teacher ratio and the extra resources required. This has been the subject of an ongoing campaign. When I asked previously about the matter, the reply was that a proper application had not been received from the school for the schemes put in place in recent years. While I admit the principal had been ill for some time, the issue has been brought to the attention of the Department of Education and Science on a number of occasions and I would like something specific done about it. The loss of a primary school in the area will mean parents will begin to look outside the area, not only for a school, but also for other facilities. That would sound the death knell for this little community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Ms Coughlan Ms Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter and giving me an opportunity to outline to the House the current position regarding the staffing situation at St. Joseph's co-educational primary school.</P>
      <P>The Senator is aware that the staffing of a primary school for a specific year is determined by reference to the number of pupils enrolled on 30 September of the previous year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule which is determined for a specific year following discussions with the managerial authorities and the INTO.</P>
      <P>The enrolment of the school on 30 September 2001 was 208 pupils which warrants a staffing for the 2002-03 school year of a principal and seven mainstream class teachers. The school also has the services of a language support teacher, disadvantaged concessionary teacher and a shared home-school liaison teacher. The number of pupils required to retain the eighth mainstream class teacher for the 2002-03 school year is 209. Accordingly, the school will lose that mainstream class teacher at the end of the current school year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the board of management of the school believes that the enrolment of the school for September 2002 will increase substantially, it may apply to the Department of Education and Science for a post under the developing school criteria. The criteria for the 2002-03 school year are outlined in the Department's circular letter, 9/02, a copy of which issued to the board of management of the school recently. To satisfy the criteria as outlined in the circular letter the enrolment of the East Wall primary school on 30 September 2002 would have to increase by at least 25 pupils over and above the number enrolled on 30 Sep<Col N="1707" /> tember 2001. Accordingly, the school would require an enrolment of at least 233 pupils on 30 September 2002 to gain the post. If the board of management of the school is confident that the overall enrolment of the school on 30 September 2002 will be in excess of 233 pupils, it should apply to the primary payments branch of the Department for the allocation of a teaching post under the developing school status.</P>
    <P>The school referred to is included in the urban dimension of Giving Children An Even Break. It was not considered eligible for additional teaching staff, based on the level of concentration of at-risk pupils in the school, as reflected in the Educational Research Centre survey outcome. Where schools expressed concern about the outcome of the survey in their respect, they were advised to make representations to the Department of Education and Science outlining their cir<Col N="1708" /> cumstances. Schools were informed that these representations would then be referred to the Educational Research Centre for consideration, and the Department would then consider their position. The Department has received a report from the Educational Research Centre and the position of the schools which made representations is being considered.</P>
    <P>There is no record of representations having been received from the school in question until recently. Accordingly, its position was not considered. However, its circumstances may fall to be considered again in the context of any future modifications to the programme. I will, when I have an opportunity to do so, advise the Minister of the Senator's concerns regarding the specifics of the case.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 4.35 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Friday, 19 April 2002.</P>
