      <P>I have received notice from Senator Henry that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to introduce legislation to allow emer<Col N="1868" /> gency medical technicians to administer drugs to patients where appropriate.</P>
    <P>I regard the matter raised by the Senator as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>
    <P>Since today is probably the last day on which I will be sitting in this Chair, I would like to make a brief statement. It has been a great honour and privilege to have been a Member of Seanad <Col N="1869" /> Éireann for the past 21 years and to have served as Cathaoirleach for the past five years. I thank Members on all sides of the House for their friendship, support and co-operation over the years and, in particular, during the term of this Seanad. I express my appreciation and gratitude to all members of the staff of the House for their support, assistance and courtesy over the years. I especially thank the Clerk of the Seanad, Ms Deirdre Lane, and the Clerk Assistant, Ms Jody Blake, for their loyalty, efficiency and dedication during all the time that I have worked with them. They made my job very easy.</P>
    <P>I wish good luck and success to all those Senators who are looking forward to being Members of the new Seanad. They are all deserving of success. It would be remiss of me if I did not pay a special tribute to those Members who have indicated that they are not seeking re-election or will be joining me in retirement. The House and the country will certainly be the poorer as a result of the departure from public life of such distinguished colleagues as Senator Hanafin, the father of the House, Senator Cosgrave, Leas-Chathaoirleach and former Cathaoirleach, whom I thank for his co-operation and assistance over the past five years, Senator Manning, who was a distinguished Leader of the House and is current leader of the Opposition, Senator Lanigan, another former distinguished Leader of the House, Senator Farrell, an assistant Whip for a long time in this Seanad and the Whip in more recent times, as well as Senators Doyle, McDonagh, Quill and Leonard, who have also indicated that they will not seek re-election. I extend good wishes to all of them. To those retiring, I wish a long, healthy and happy retirement and thank them on behalf of the House for the huge contribution which they have made over the years to public life.

      <P>Before introducing the Order of Business, I join the Cathaoirleach in congratulating the Members who have been elected to the Dáil from the Seanad and welcome to the House and congratulate Senator O'Rourke and Senator Mackin. I am glad they gave their prior consent before the Taoiseach appointed them. I look forward to their contributions.</P>
      <P>The Cathaoirleach thanked various individuals whom I will also thank. It would be wrong if this occasion were to pass without paying particular tribute to the Cathaoirleach for the work he has done during the past five years. It would be the general consensus of the House that he has been an outstanding Cathaoirleach &ndash; always impartial, even-handed and good humoured. I do not think he has ever had cause to send anybody packing.</P>

      <P>Am I wrong in suggesting there was no division on that issue? I am pleased that if I go astray, the former Leader of the House, whom I congratulate on being elected to the Dáil, is present to keep an eye on me and guide me through this process. The House owes the Cathaoirleach tremendous gratitude. He has been a great ambassador for it domestically and internationally. We wish him well in his retirement.</P>
      <P>I also single out Senator Hanafin who is retiring after 41 years of distinguished service. I am sure he takes great satisfaction in the promotion of his daughter, which was well deserved. I congratulate Senator Farrell who is now leader of the Fianna Fáil group in the Seanad. I thank him, the other Whips and Members for their co-operation.</P>
      <P>I also single out Senator Manning on the Opposition benches for the contribution he has made, not only to this Seanad, but also to successive Seanads and Irish life, which is highly significant. He has been a marvellous representative for his party. It is a matter of some regret that he will not be back with us.</P>
      <P>I mention the Leas-Chathaoirleach, Senator Cosgrave, the work he has done and the distinguished family name he represents. I also want to single out one other person, my party colleague, Senator Quill, who is retiring.</P>
      <P>I join in thanking members of the staff, including the Clerk, Clerk Assistant and everyone else in their office. They work extremely long and hard hours. Many outside these walls do not understand the amount of work they do, particularly when the Houses are sitting. I am sure they have an onerous job with the elections taking place. I thank all the staff of the Houses for the way they look after us and members of the press for the coverage they give to the Houses.</P>
      <P>I hope everyone contesting the election or retiring will have all their hopes and wishes fulfilled. I mention Senator Tom Fitzgerald. While we saluted him in the past, it is appropriate to remember him on this occasion.</P>

      <P>The proposed Order of Business is No. 1, motion seeking the approval of the Seanad for the regulations in draft on the Freedom of Information Act, 1997 (Prescribed Bodies) Regulations, 2002, to be taken without debate; No. 2, motion on a Council decision concerning the signing of the agreement between the European Community and the Government of the Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China on the readmission of persons residing without authorisation; No. 3, motion on a Council decision concerning the conclusion of the agreement between the European Community and the Government of the Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China on the readmission of persons residing without authorisation, to be taken together with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed eight minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed five <Col N="1871" /> minutes; No. 4, motion re Council regulation on a European enforcement order for uncontested claims and matters of judgment in matrimonial matters and in matters of parental responsibility &ndash; spokespersons will have eight minutes and all other speakers will have five minutes; No. 5, Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Performance of Certain Functions) Bill, 2002 &ndash; all Stages by agreement, with ten minutes for spokespersons and eight minutes for all others; and No. 6, Electoral (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 2002 [<i>Dáil</i>] &ndash; all Stages by agreement, with ten minutes for spokespersons and eight minutes for all others.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreed. While there are many issues we would like to raise this is not the appropriate day to do so. I join Senator Dardis in paying tribute to the Cathaoirleach. I spoke in appreciation of his full contribution previously. In everything he has done he has added lustre to this House. He is a credit to Irish politics and has set a high standard for whoever follows him. Whoever that is will have to work hard to live up to him. He has been a credit to the House. I thank him and his staff for all they have done.</P>
      <P>I congratulate those Members who were elected to the Lower House. I do not know why they wanted to leave the Seanad but they did. Given the exodus from the side opposite I am tempted to call a division on the Order of Business &ndash; we might just win it &ndash; but I will not. To those who fought but were not elected, their turn will come. I congratulate Senator O'Rourke and Senator Mackin on their appointment to the Seanad. Senator O'Rourke and myself were elected on the same panel, on the same day, to Seanad Éireann 21 years ago next month. We have both been Members of Parliament since that time.</P>
      <P>I remember on the day I was made Government Chief Whip getting a bemused look from the late Senator Willie Ryan. It struck me then that to be elected to Parliament is a great privilege. Now, 21 years later, I still feel there are few greater privileges in life than to be a Member of one's national Parliament. I thank Senator Dardis for his kind words earlier. I wish all my other colleagues who are not running for election, all close friends of mine, the best for their future after politics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will say a few parting words here. To those in the new Seanad, I say, embrace change. We live in a world that is changing rapidly and this House must accept that there is a real need for change. We should also remember that there are certain distinctive values in this House which should never be lost. Among those I single out the huge sense of courtesy which exists in the House, the willingness to let people have their say as fully and fairly as possible, the respect for each other, the independence of mind which characterises many of the debates and the detailed scrutiny of <Col N="1872" /> legislation. The word guillotine is never used in this House and I hope it never will be. In embracing change I urge colleagues in the new House to see ways to add value to politics through the House especially in the larger European role for the House, in continuing a detailed scrutiny of legislation and in allowing debate on issues which are rarely touched upon in the other House.</P>
    <P>I would like to comment on the quality of Members in this House. The former Senator Joe Lee, in an interesting debate here, said how he came in expecting a low level of debate, equivalent perhaps to county council level. He realised quickly that the Members of this House, especially those who have come through local government, have to be masters of a wide range of issues. They have learned at the hard school, but they are in touch with the real problems of ordinary people and have a thorough knowledge of public administration. Their debates have a sense of reality which one often will not find, according to the comparison made by Senator Lee, in the Faculty of Arts at UCC.</P>
    <P>When the former Senator Lee compared the learned academics of UCC's Faculty of Arts to the Members of this House he found there was a much greater sense of reality and breadth of vision among the latter group. Following his examination of Deputies' performances during the last Dáil, the broadcaster Vincent Browne was surprised to discover that there was a high level of quality among our public representatives. Those of us who have served in this House will not be surprised, however, when I state Members of this House perform at a similarly high level. Perhaps the new Seanad should take care to make these facts better known.</P>
    <P>The final point I wish to make relates to Independent Senators, both university Senators and those who have been appointed by successive Taoisigh. Gordon Wilson, John Robb, Seamus Mallon, Senator Maurice Hayes, Bríd Rodgers and others have made contributions of an extraordinary quality to this House and long may it continue. The Independent Senators who sit on the Opposition benches are elected by a discerning electorate and are genuinely independent. They are not elected as single issue or grievance candidates. The quality of their contributions makes this House quite distinctive and gives it a cutting edge. I know this is a controversial matter at the moment, but I believe independent Senators deserve to be elected because of the contribution they make to this House.</P>
    <P>This is the final occasion on which I will address the House on the Order of Business. I know I will see the Cathaoirleach again, as with Senators Liam Cosgrave, Joe Doyle, Mick Lanigan, Fintan Coogan and me, he is part of an equine enterprise which embraces both Houses and almost all parties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>It behoves me to welcome the two new Members of this House, Senator Mackin and Senator O'Rourke. I have not worked closely with Senator Mackin, but look forward to doing so in the future. Senator O'Rourke and I have been through the eye of many storms together, sometimes on the same team and sometimes coming from opposite directions. We learned how to work together during that period of time and I await further such endeavours. I wish both Senators well and look forward to hearing their contributions, which I know will be worthwhile and add significantly to the quality of debate in the House.</P>
      <P>At the last meeting of this House I outlined my views on the extraordinary and effective work of Senator Brian Mullooly during his time as Cathaoirleach of the Seanad. Those of us in the ranks believe he has acted with integrity, honesty, absolute commitment, fairness and equity. I reiterate the comments I made on 25 April &ndash; that I am proud of him as Chairman of this House, as a teaching colleague and as a fellow member of a certain organisation. I wish him well in his retirement. His work is appreciated by the organisation and the teaching profession as a whole. He has brought his many qualities to bear on this House with much distinction.</P>
      <P>I would also like to remark on the fact that this is Senator Des Hanafin's last day as a Senator. Our relationship has been defined in many ways by our differences of opinion, but also by the closeness of our discussions since I became a Senator. I have always found him to be a fair and honest man. As I have said to him on many occasions, he broke a rule I held for many years. While I may not have liked his friends, I like him very much. I remember my grandmother saying, &ldquo;Show me your friends and I will tell you what you are.&rdquo; I saw Senator Hanafin's friends before I saw him and he is not what they are &ndash; he is a far finer man than any of those with whom he associates. I cannot give him a greater compliment than that. I thank him for his contribution to the House.</P>
      <P>It is appropriate to mark the passing from this House of former Leaders. I have worked very closely with Senator Mick Lanigan during the years. He has made a solid contribution to our business, particularly when he brought his own perspective to foreign affairs matters. Some may say it is a broad perspective while others would argue that it is narrow, but one cannot argue that he will not be remembered for it. Similarly, Senator Donie Cassidy, as outgoing Leader of the House, deserves to be mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not doubt that he will regale us on many occasions with his record of 105,000 new pieces <Col N="1874" /> of business which were brought before the House in his time as Leader. This is a record for which he wishes to be remembered. His tireless hassling of Ministers to ensure legislation was brought to this House is something we valued highly and for which I thank him. On his last day I thank Senator Farrell for his contributions. He was always available when someone was needed for committees. When someone was needed to make a contribution, he was never found wanting and had total commitment to the House.</P>
    <P>The House will be pleased to hear that I met Senator Tom Fitzgerald at a very sad funeral in Dingle last week. He is in the best of health and is very active.</P>
    <P>The Leas-Chathaoirleach, Senator Liam Cosgrave, was also very approachable. He did his work with diligence and it is sad that he is the last in that family, the third or fourth generation, to make a contribution to the State and we wish him well.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by making reference to the Fine Gael leader in the House, Senator Maurice Manning. During my 16 years in this House he is the person with whom I probably worked most closely. I regret that he will not be a Member of the next House. His contribution was continuing and long lasting. It is also a fact that his contribution may be very well recorded in the annals of the House in terms of what he said. However, what will not be recorded is his contribution to a myriad of committees. I can think of long summers spent going through boring sessions on Standing Orders, questions on ethics and questions on changing the approach of the House. He was open to new ideas, committed to making the Seanad work and he was of the view that we should be topical, responsible and make progress. His diligence is a model to all of us. He has brought some style as well as some service to the House and his commitment is there to be marked.</P>
    <P>Among other things, because of the way the House has worked, particularly in dealing with each other &ndash; we often do not keep records of conversations and so on &ndash; during that 16 years, I never once had reason to contradict what Senator Manning said. He has always been honest, straight and direct, which is the mark of him as a politician and as a man. I always found it so easy to do business with him both on the opposite side of the House as leader and on this side as leader of Fine Gael. It has been a pleasure to work with him and I hope he will continue to contribute to public life. I cannot imagine him not doing so. He will be a loss to the House and I thank him.</P>
    <P>It would be remiss of us on this side of the House to agree to take all Stages of a Bill and not to take a stand on this issue. We would never agree on this occasion, particularly as we have the summer to deal with the legislation. I do not know what hurry is on the Government at this stage and I ask the Leader of the House to give <Col N="1875" /> a commitment that the House will resume next Tuesday.</P>

      <P>There are three reasons for this &ndash; two extraordinary publications and the continuation of today's business. I do not think today's business should be rushed. People have much to say in regard to the Electoral Bill, not just the narrow business but the broader issues which need to be discussed. The benchmarking report will be published next Monday and I know that my colleague, Senator Ross, would find it very unusual if he was not in a position to stand up and support improvements for members of the public service. The Ansbacher list will be published on Tuesday morning. Both these publications are tied together because the people who were not paying their taxes will be the same as those who say we should not pay our civil and public servants. I would like to have that broad discussion next Tuesday afternoon. The benchmarking body's report is something on which everyone is going to have a word and a classic example of the kind of thing we need to address to maintain the relevance of this House.</P>
      <P>These are the two most topical issues that will be in the news over the next fortnight and we should be present to deal with them. There is much criticism of the Seanad at the moment. We have had sexist and ageist abuse of all types hurled at us. This is an occasion on which to put things on the record and deal with issues. Next week's two publications will allow us to express a different view on Irish life. I ask that the Leader make a commitment on the basis that we do as much business as possible today in order not to rush to force conclusions on these matters.</P>

      <P>Tá mé ar aon aigne leis na Seanadóirí eile fút féin agus faoin tslí inar chomhlíon tú na dualgaisí a bhí agus atá ort mar Chathaoirleach ar an tSeanad agus mar bhall de Choimisiún an Uachtaráin, nuair ba ghá duit sin a dhéanamh. Is trua go bhfuil an cinneadh déanta agat. Is cailliúint mhór í do Sheanad Éireann agus don Oireachtas go bhfuil tú chun imeacht uainn.</P>
      <P>Apart from those who have chosen to do so, we will not know for another few weeks whom among us will leave the House. I note that the Cathaoirleach arrived here 21 years ago at about the same time I did, which perhaps gives new emphasis to the &ldquo;sean&rdquo; in &ldquo;Seanadóirí&rdquo;. I have to agree, however, with Senator O'Toole. One example of the election literature I received quoted the average age of the three NUI Senators. Knowing Senator O'Toole's and my own age and unless I am wrong by about 20 years regarding Senator Quinn's, the person whose literature it was cannot do her sums. It put Senator Quinn's age at about 75 at least. Not only was it ageist, it also was wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1876" />I would again like to go through the list of my colleagues who are retiring and say, contrary to what is written about us and politicians and politics generally, I have always been treated honestly and honourably in this House. While I have had major rows with Members of the House, I do not recall anybody ever telling me something and doing the opposite. That is a very basic standard, but not one I am used to in my dealings with, for instance, sections of the media or many other areas of life. I have found Members of the Oireachtas to be mostly wrong about most things &ndash; I have tended to be in a minority &ndash; but also to be honourable and decent people who have treated me honourably and fairly, something that needs to be said over and over again.</P>
    <P>The politics in which we are involved is the most honest kind. The rules are in the open, as is the competition and its framework. Media, academic and medical politics have no rules and are not conducted openly. In ecclesiastical politics, which has even less rules, people are supposed to pretend they are not in contention for anything and advertise their modesty. There is a level of competition is according to rules most of us would find quite appalling.</P>
    <P>The Members who are leaving have every reason to say what they did in this House was honourable, right and decent. I mention only one of my colleagues by name, because he and I were on differing sides of a number of issues. Senator Hanafin did a great service to causes with which I disagreed due to the honourable way he conducted his campaigns. I have said in the House before that never in all of the contentious issues did he say a bad word about his opponents. He was able to debate issues without attributing unworthy motives to others. I wish him well in his retirement.</P>
    <P>I also wish well the outgoing Fine Gael leader in the House, Senator Manning. I do not think I ever had a serious disagreement with him, although I annoyed him on many occasions. It is beginning to trouble me that I have a capacity to annoy people.</P>

I wish commentators would read the debates and look at the work before they start making silly comments about the role of Seanad Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To be true to myself, a Chathaoirligh, we in the Labour Party are not very keen on the idea of having a regulation on the Freedom of Information Act passed without debate, as proposed in the Order of Business. It is a bad idea in principle and, second, this morning's newspapers announced that the benchmarking body will be excluded from the Freedom of Information Act. The submissions it receives and the information <Col N="1877" /> it assembles are all of extreme importance both to trade unionists and to many academic researchers, but this enormous amount of information will be kept secret, presumably until the documents arrive in the National Archives and are released in 30 years' time. I know that I am testing the patience of the Cathaoirleach but he is very good at having his patience tested. If that body holds commercially sensitive information, there should be an appropriate occasion to discuss that in the context of the regulations on freedom of information. Therefore, I wish to propose an amendment to the Order of Business, that No.&nbsp;1 be taken with debate. I suggest ten minutes for spokespersons and eight minutes for other speakers.</P>

      <P>It is always with a sense of sadness that people retire from what may have been their life-time job and I feel a sense of sadness as I leave this House today. I have not been in good health for some time so I am looking forward to retirement. I wish to pay a special tribute to the Cathaoirleach not alone for the knowledgeable way in which he performed his duties, but also for his dignity which is very obvious to everybody in the House. I wish him many years of retirement.</P>
      <P>Seán Lemass was asked on one occasion if the Seanad could be dispensed with and he said: &ldquo;Yes, we could do without the Seanad, but we could not do without the Senators.&rdquo; That makes a lot of sense. As Senators we have always played a strong political role in our constituencies on behalf of our parties. If I was asked to describe myself, I would say that I am a very proud Fianna Fáil man and I know other people hold similar views about themselves and their parties. When I was elected to Seanad Éireann, I took my place on the backbenches and that is where I am still.</P>

      <P>About 47 years ago I was elected to the county council and the following year I was elected chairman at the age of 23 years. I say with great pride that people like Dan Breen canvassed for me. Seán Lemass came to north Tipperary and spoke from the platform about the great future he foresaw for me in politics. Seán Lemass was seldom wrong, but he got it wrong on that occasion. I am not sure what I have achieved in my years in politics, but I have survived. Perhaps that is the big achievement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was nominated and elected by Fianna Fáil over 30 years ago when I was at a very low ebb. I was helped by some families which will go down in history, such as the Lenihan family, father and son, who gave me great help. Without them, perhaps I would not have been nominated on the first occasion. I contested the election for the Chair once with the then Senator Doherty. It was a draw and settled by drawing names out of a hat. My name did not come out and he became <Col N="1878" /> Cathaoirleach. I never wore a hat from that day to this.</P>
    <P>I had the great privilege of working very closely with Jack Lynch who was a great man. I am very proud to have worked closely with him in the party. He was a good, kind and charitable man who did a lot to maintain peace on this island. Perhaps he never got the full recognition he deserved; he got some, but never as much as he should have received.</P>
    <P>I have had proud moments in this House, of which one was a particular source of pride to me. A Minister of State was speaking on a Bill one day when someone mentioned that I was father of the House. I remember thinking at the time that there was nothing unique or unusual about being father of the House. There have been fathers of the House in the past and will be in future, but I wondered if a future father of the House would also be the father of the Minister. That was my proudest moment &ndash; when the Minister of State concerned spoke to us.</P>

      <P>Without being parochial, I pay a warm tribute to the Chair on his retirement. He and I come from the same part of the country and served locally together in public life. At times we have had debates and arguments, but we have always been good friends and respected each other's point of view. I pay tribute to him for his work over the last five years as Cathaoirleach. He has brought nothing but respect and dignity to the House in the way he has carried out his work. I say that genuinely because he has done an excellent job and whoever replaces him will have a huge act to follow. I pay him every tribute and give him every thanks.</P>
      <P>I also join in the welcome given to the new Members, Senators O'Rourke and Mackin. Senator O'Rourke often came to the House as a Minister and though we often had clashes, of all the Cabinet Ministers who came to the House over the last five years she was the one who paid the greatest attention to what Members had to say. She dealt in great detail with the amendments we brought forward whether she agreed or disagreed with them. She always engaged in the debate in a real way for which I thank her, though we often disagreed. I said publicly at the time that it was a matter of great regret that she lost her Dáil seat, but she is very welcome to this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the other retiring Members, one can get into an invidious situation when naming people, but I have been deputy leader under <Col N="1879" /> Senator Manning for the last five years and he has made a most distinguished contribution to this House. He has been articulate and spoken eloquently on a range of issues. He was well informed on every piece of legislation that came before the House and made some wonderful contributions. It is a matter of regret that the House is to lose somebody of his calibre and character. I wish him well as I do all the others who are leaving us on this occasion. Each one of them made an excellent contribution.</P>
    <P>We are often the subject of criticism. Recently I listened to a radio programme in relation to this House when a not only misinformed but downright ignorant comment was made about the House by people I have never seen in the press gallery or in the Visitors Gallery. That is taken as gospel because it is put out on an important current affairs programme by the public service broadcaster. We are not good enough at standing up for ourselves. I am a veteran of 20 years in these Houses, ten years spent in the other House and ten years in this House. The quality of debate and the level of participation by Members here is much greater than in the Lower House. The proportion of Senators who contribute in a meaningful way to legislation is much greater than the proportion of Members in the other House who make a contribution to legislation. Often we draw back from making that point about the role we play. The level of debate and analysis of legislation is much greater here than in the other House. We ought to say that a little more often about ourselves and not be ashamed to say it.</P>
    <P>I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for the opportunity to make these points. I wish you well and thank you for the contribution you have made.</P>

      <P>I welcome Senator O'Rourke and Senator Mackin to the House. I join in the tributes paid to the Cathaoirleach. You have been a brilliant Cathaoirleach but you have also been a brilliant Member of this House and your advice was always good. I thank you particularly for nominating me as one of your assistant chairmen of the House. It was an honour to sit in that chair and referee the debate. As others said, debate in this House is brilliant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As one who left national school at 14 years of age and spent two years in a local tech in the village of Grange, I was pleased to achieve the honour of coming here as an elected Member. I have not calculated the figures but I do not think that more than 200 or 300 people have been Members over the years. It is a great honour to walk up the 36 steps from the main hall to this room and take one's seat as an elected Member. I thank all the county councillors and the electorate who supported and voted for me over all those years. To those who voted for me and who are, I hope, in a brighter place I say, go ndéana Dia trócaire <Col N="1880" /> orthu. I made great friends in this House and as far as I know I made no enemies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to say that about this House.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to Deirdre Lane and Jody Blake, who were always helpful and did wonderful work, and all their staff. I pay a special tribute to Senator Maurice Manning. It was an honour to know and work with him. I met many of his past pupils who would always ask if I knew him because he was a wonderful lecturer and great teacher. He taught everyone here a lesson also. He was brilliant and easy to work with. When I became Whip, with Senator Paddy Burke, we could arrange the work and the votes. As Senator Ryan said, there is honour in this House and if the Members said they were calling a vote, it was up to us to have the numbers here. If they said they were not calling a vote, they would honour that.</P>
      <P>As Senator Ryan also said, we do not talk often enough about the honourable people in politics. There is nobody in politics today who has not been elected by at least 9,000 or 10,000 people. What mandate do those on quangos, journalists and others who criticise us have? They write articles about this House and think they are an authority on it, but we were elected by the people.</P>
      <P>I was elected in 1967 and I am always pleased to say I never left this country to earn a living. In 1967, when I joined the council, my priority was to set up regional water schemes, promote tourism in the west and create jobs. Long before we had these organisations which purport to save the west, county councillors like myself were working in the council chamber on the provision of services and infrastructure and creating jobs in the west. I have seen men going around in Jaguars and Mercs with chauffeurs and PR people trying to get elected to this House while I was going around in my little Citroen Dyane, which was all I could afford to run. If money could have got the people concerned elected, the likes of me and many of us here would not have seen this House except on a postcard or passing Kildare Street. The electorate are honourable people who vote for us on our merits and what we have to give to society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1881" />I pay tribute to two great men standing in the hall, Paddy Behan and Tony O'Reilly, and offer my sincere thanks to all the ushers. They were always courteous and could not do enough to help us. We thank them sincerely.</P>
    <P>I also pay tribute to Don Rice and the restaurant staff on a job well done. I particularly thank the self-service staff because as many Members know, as a pioneer who does not drink, I came up to Dublin on the train for safety one time, walked over to Store Street, tripped, fell and broke my remaining good hand. For a few weeks I was practically handless. I pay tribute to the staff in the self-service restaurant who literally fed me for those three or four weeks.</P>
    <P>I thank the secretary in the Whips office, Ellen Byrne, who did a great job, my own secretary, Audrey Eager, and all my secretaries during the years. I thank the Taoiseach, who appointed me Chief Whip. It is a great honour to leave as Chief Whip and leader of the Fianna Fáil group, even if it is only for one day.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputy Cassidy, who is present in the Visitors Gallery. It is unusual to see him there as he should be here beside me. He did a mountain of work. A total of 67 Bills were passed in the House during his term as Leader. He elevated the House in a big way. He did great public relations work with the media in order that the House received more coverage than ever. The House rarely featured in &ldquo;Oireachtas Report,&rdquo; but through his good offices, as communications spokesperson, he got us more publicity than ever. He did a wonderful job and will be missed. I wish him every success and hope he will go further because he has the ability, intelligence and initiative to do so.</P>
    <P>I am reminded of a story. There was a man from my county whose brother was a superintendent in Wexford. The brother died suddenly and a telegram was sent to the local Garda barracks. A girl arrived at the man's house and asked him if she should go into the house and break the news to his mother. He said he would do it himself. There were no telephones at the time, but the brother used to regularly write to the mother. The man walked into the house and asked the mother if she had the last letter his brother, Matt, had written to her. She said it was on the mantelpiece. &ldquo;Ah well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it was the last.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Cassidy, during his time as Leader, gave me an opportunity to debate alcohol abuse on two occasions. It is the greatest curse in this country today. Everybody is talking about it, including the media, but voluntary organisations should stop seeking more money and get at the root cause. I would like a Minister to introduce a law to make alcohol abuse as socially unacceptable as smoking. There was a time when Members smoked in the House, but one dare not light a cigarette in it today or at any other gathering. Anyone who smokes can be seen on the streets because they must leave their offices and shops, for example, to do so. However, unless alcohol abuse becomes as unacceptable as smok<Col N="1882" /> ing, we will have serious troubles. I thank Deputy Cassidy and Opposition Members, particularly Senator Manning, who facilitated two great debates on the issue.</P>
    <P>I wish those Members who are also retiring today every success and hope we will meet from time to time through the retirement club of the House. I also wish those on the road doing the 10,000 mile circuit of Ireland in four weeks every success and hope many of the number ones remain because all of them think they are winning, but only a handful win at the end of the day. I wish them well and ask them to drive carefully in order that they are not involved in accidents. I am driving since 1948 and pleased that I have not marked a car yet, touch wood. I hope those campaigning for Seanad seats drive around Ireland safely and soundly. I thank my colleagues in the Fianna Fáil Party, those who have worked with me and the Progressive Democrats' Members, particularly Senator Dardis, who have supported me since I was appointed Chief Whip. It was a great pleasure to work with them for the past 16 years and I look forward to retirement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it very kindly, a Chathaoirligh, that you have summoned me to speak because I feel rather abashed. I do not feel worthy to follow in the footsteps of St. Brendan Ryan, but I am probably one of those terribly stupid people by whom he is surrounded, who form the vast majority of the Members of the House and leave him in lonely isolation being right all the time. Therefore, I take it very kindly that you permit me to speak on this occasion.</P>
      <P>I join other Members who have paid tributes. I will not repeat what was said because it might get a little bit close to the Oscars, but would like to pay tribute to you, a Chathaoirligh. You have shown great forbearance, a great sense of humour and great wisdom in your judgments. I do not think you have alienated a single person in this House from the position you preside over and that is a great tribute to you.</P>
      <P>I also join in the tributes to Senator Manning. He gave great dignity to this House and he increased its calibre through his distinguished contributions. He is a most eloquent speaker with a superb command of rhetoric. One thing I very much like about him is that he has never used notes. He is able to produce a perfect, balanced sentence without reading it off a page. For that reason I regret very much that he is not a candidate. I think Fine Gael made a disastrous and possibly mischievous mistake in withholding a nomination from him. That is a disgrace and I will find it very difficult to give votes to my friends and colleagues in Fine Gael because of it. It really shows a very low standard in Irish political life and it is most regrettable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned that Senator Manning did not use notes and I welcome the former Minister, Senator O'Rourke, who is another person who did not use notes. What was delightful about her was the banter between us in this House. She is the intellec<Col N="1883" /> tual equal of anybody in this House. She was always fully in command of her brief and never had to turn back to her civil servants. She was right on target. I am delighted she is in this House and I look forward to her continuing the wonderful work she did for the transport network, particularly in helping us on this side of the House in pushing for the metro to go underground and to get it built as rapidly as possible. She at least understands all the arguments. I am sorry Senator O'Rourke had that unfortunate accident in the other House but I am glad she is here and I hope she enjoys her time with us.</P>
    <P>I almost forgot to say that another thing I like about Senator Manning is his characteristic honesty. He told the plain, unvarnished truth and he did it in such a way that it did not raise protest. If I had said, as he did today, that there was a low level of debate in county councils, I can imagine the howls from the other side of the House, but I agree with him. He is absolutely right&mdash;</P>

      <P>That reminds me that Nice is pronounced &ldquo;Nice&rdquo; and not &ldquo;nice&rdquo;. I wish to propose an amendment to the Order of Business to take No. 23, motion 15, in the names of the Independent Senators, first. We are supposed to advise Government &ndash; we are a kind of advisory Chamber. If we are only brought back in September, it will be much too late to advise the Government and it is showing clear signs of getting it wrong again on Nice.</P>
      <P>Why will it not put in a Danish-style protocol? There is no reason not to do so. The little advertisement the Taoiseach is talking about does not matter a damn; it has no validity whatsoever. He started calling the &ldquo;No&rdquo; campaigners whingers and this will alienate the voters also. The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, thinks neutrality should be put into the Constitution, but this is a recipe for disaster as it was in the case of abortion.</P>
      <P>Rather than leaving it until September we should come back earlier to discuss this matter so that we will be in a position to carry out our constitutional function of advising the Government. There is no point advising it when it is too late, as it will be in terms of the Nice referendum by September. I propose my amendment to the Order of Business and I understand that my colleague and friend, Senator Ross, will second it.</P>

      <P>I had an opportunity on the last day to express opinions about various Members of the House and in particular the Cathaoirleach <Col N="1884" /> and the staff of the House. I will let the comments I made on that occasion stand, but things have changed since then. We heard today from Senator Des Hanafin, who has been here for 41 years. In the annals of this House, it will be recognised as the longest service of anybody past or future. I do not think it can happen again and we should congratulate him on the stamina he has shown, but also on the amount of goodwill that has been shown towards him throughout Ireland over many years. When we look at one brand new Senator and one reformed Senator back in the fold, Senator O'Rourke&mdash;</P>

      <P>The difference between one and 41 in terms of days and years is massive. Regarding the comment made by Senator Norris about reading from notes in the House, when I first came into this House in 1977, it was forbidden to read from scripts. Members had to extemporise, to stand on their feet and say what they felt from their hearts. In other words, they had to do the work outside and bring it into the Chamber, but that changed. I remember former Minister, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, one day speaking about a particular Bill. He suddenly discovered he was speaking on the wrong Bill. All the papers ended up all over the place, but he just continued on. He moved from speaking about the wrong Bill onto the right Bill and, as usual&mdash;</P>

      <P>He did himself and the House justice. Regarding the position of Senator Manning, it is not for us on this side of the House to suggest what Fine Gael should do or what they have done, but it has been a privilege to work with the Senator. The comments that were made by Senator Farrell have to be acknowledged also. Three of my family went to university and were lectured by Senator Manning. They all suggest that he was the best in his field of academia. He should be congratulated on making the transition from academia to this House because many people have come from academia into this House but have not succeeded. He has been able to do that and we thank him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Toole said I was narrow and broad in my views. I will not let myself or my cause down by not mentioning the situation of the Palestinians. I could not leave today, on my last occasion in the House, without suggesting that what is being done to the Palestinians is totally wrong. What Israeli Prime Minister Sharon has preached to the President of the United States is totally wrong. The invasion by the United States into what might be the outcome of an election in Palestine is absolutely wrong. It is up to the Palestinians to decide who will lead them. It is up to the Palestinians to decide what sort of state they will have and when they will hold their next elections. Israel is wrong, but it knows it has <Col N="1885" /> might on its side. I could not leave this House without saying what I feel &ndash; what is happening in Palestine is a disgrace to society in Europe as well as the rest of the world. I ask the Deputy Leader to suggest to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who is sympathetic, to act as strongly as possible at EU level to ensure that fairness comes into the Israeli-Palestinian conflict because there is a need for peace in that area. There is undoubtedly wrong on both sides, but we must see that the Palestinians get their rights.</P>
    <P>I never over-step my time limit. I have never annoyed you, a Chathaoirligh, and, unfortunately, I will never annoy you again in this situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I second Senator Norris's proposal that No. 23, motion 15, be taken first.</P>
      <P>I know this is something of a lap of honour, but it is difficult for people to allow Members like you, a Chathaoirligh, to depart without paying tributes. As one of only two Members you have had to remove from the House, you are forgiven. Indeed, it took you an unseemly length of time to do it and you left us at our wits' end as to what to do next to get ejected. I thank you for that and for all that you did for the House. The whole House genuinely appreciates it. It was difficult to remember sometimes that you belonged to a party, which is the highest tribute that I can pay to you for your actions.</P>
      <P>Former Senator Cassidy was also extremely generous to the Opposition. He often wanted something back, but that is the nature of politics and he always got something. However, his interest in the House was for its own good.</P>
      <P>Many of us are losing good friends. Senator Lanigan and I, in former days, got into unmentionable scrapes which I will remember for many years, although I will not tell the House about any of them. Nevertheless, I will miss them and him.</P>
      <P>Senator Hanafin is a man of enormous integrity, crusty but great nevertheless. One admires his honesty so much sometimes that one identifies with him and is in danger of identifying with his causes. I never succumbed to the temptation, but his beliefs are never in question. He is a beacon of honesty which all sides of the House must admire. I will also greatly miss Senator Cosgrave, who has decided not to carry on, signalling the end of a great dynasty in Irish politics.</P>
      <P>I welcome the former Minister, Senator O'Rourke, who, despite our differences on many matters, was one of the finest Ministers, if not the finest in the last Government, and its loss is our great gain. She brings experience, political astuteness and a sense of humour, which will be welcome. We are lucky that people of her experience want &ndash; and publicly express their desire on defeat in the elections &ndash; to come to this House, which is a credit and compliment to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have served in this House for nearly as long as anybody, with Gordon Wilson, Jim Dooge, Seamus Mallon, Mary Robinson and many others who are regarded as great, but say without doubt <Col N="1886" /> that Senator Manning is the finest Senator with whom I have served. His commitment is unmatched by anyone. It must be said it is an appalling tragedy that some back room cabal in Fine Gael decided that he should not be nominated.</P>

      <P>I do not mean to be sensational and hope it is not picked up by anyone. However, this House was served so superbly by Senator Manning that those of us who turned on the television at night hoping to see ourselves would inevitably see him, since he was either the leader of the Government or Opposition side. Occasionally we might have wished that it was us instead of him, but I always felt great pride that at least he was the Seanad's face for almost 20 years and we could identify with his innate dignity, elegance and eloquence. We have lost possibly the finest Senator we ever had. He had the greatest commitment, politeness, sense of humour, knowledge of Northern Ireland and balance. It is a tragedy for this to happen. He will continue in politics in some capacity and I hope he may return here in a representative one. We should examine ourselves, and if we, or any party, think we can afford to lose someone of his calibre, we are wrong.</P>

      <P>I second Senator Ryan's motion for an amendment to the Order of Business regarding the proposal to take the freedom of information regulations without debate. We did this before and it is not good practice. Freedom of information legislation is extremely significant and has major consequences in all areas of public life. Media reports state some Government backbenchers want it reviewed. No regulation should be passed without debate in either House.</P>
      <P>I also add my words to the tributes paid here today. It is a privilege to be a Member of Seanad Éireann, particularly on a day like this when so many historic words are being spoken. It is important to have such a day. I listen with awe to the words of retiring Members, in particular. I thank the Cathaoirleach for his help and support to all Members, but also to myself for the last five years. I wish him every happiness in his retirement, and all other retiring Members also. I heard with regret through the media that Senator Manning would not be joining the new Seanad. As others said, he will be a great loss, not only to the House, but also to the Oireachtas and public life. I also pay tribute to the work of that great Tipperary man, Senator Hanafin, and wish him and his wife, Mona, every happiness in retirement. I thank him and all other retiring Senators for their contribution to this House, public service and political life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of us were stung by remarks made in the media recently about this House. Some were misinformed, but others reflected something that we must take seriously, that is, the need to change. We must examine and embrace change as it is <Col N="1887" /> inevitable. In doing so, I hope we embrace it collectively in a manner which ensures our basic principles and values will always be preserved. That can undoubtedly happen. I hope it will as I hope to be here and be part of it.</P>
    <P>I support the calls for the Seanad to give time soon to debating the Ansbacher report, due to be published next week, and also to ensure the extremely important issue of our future in Europe and the future of the European Union through the Treaty of Nice is debated here. As Members of the Upper House, we should be allowed to give our views to the Government on the treaty, the debate and the referendum. I appeal to the Government to allow this in order that we can make, as usual, a considered, valued contribution.</P>

Should it be a prerequisite for any future Cathaoirleach to have been a primary school teacher, as it appears to be the ideal training for managing an institution such as the Seanad? I also add my words to the tribute paid to Senator Manning. I was proud when he asked me to sign his papers and appalled to discover that he was not going to run due to a foolish decision. I was impressed that he asked me to support another person who also asked me to sign the papers as he would not like us to withhold votes from any of the excellent people seeking election because of what happened to him.</P>
      <P>It is a great honour to be here with the former Minister, Senator O'Rourke. I welcome her and Senator Mackin.</P>
      <P>It was a privilege to serve with Senator Hanafin. The two of us were never on the same side of any issue, except in practical matters. During one of the numerous referenda on which we were on different sides our opposing groups were to meet at the gates of Leinster House and it was raining. I remember that Senator Hanafin and I shared an umbrella on the way out to the gate, but by the time we got there the two groups were fighting <i>mano à mano</i> and had to be separated by the ushers. We decided to act together again and did a circle and came back around and up to Leinster House. Sometimes it is advisable to co-operate with those who support a different side of an argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Leader of the House to add another matter to the Order of Business. There has been appalling trouble in the Irish Blood Transfusion Service again, which is causing great dismay among the general public. The medical director of the Cork institution was removed and reinstituted while the chief executive officer was removed and reinstituted by the courts. That is a serious situation in such an important institution. Will the Leader ask the Minister for Health and Children to make a ten minute statement on the position at the end of business today to give reassurance to the general public and, I hope, ensure we will not have a repeat of the problems we had earlier <Col N="1888" /> this year and in previous years regarding the number of donors coming to the clinics? If that is not possible, I ask the Leader to take up Senator O'Toole's suggestion that we meet again next Tuesday and that this matter be added to the list of subjects he suggested we should discuss.</P>

      <P>I also pay a special tribute to the former Leader of the House, Deputy Donie Cassidy, who did a tremendous job in getting many Bills through this House, for which we are indebted to him. I wish him well in the other House.</P>
      <P>I also pay a special tribute to my opposite number, Senator Tom Fitzgerald, with whom I worked as Government Whip and Opposition Whip. It was great to work with him and Senator Farrell. They were easy to work with and very co-operative. They gave great assistance, irrespective of whichever side one was on, whether in government or opposition.</P>
      <P>I wish Senator Cosgrave well in his retirement. He played a significant role in this House over many years. His retirement marks the end of a dynasty in both Houses. He deserves that I wish him well.</P>
      <P>I pay a special tribute to my leader, Senator Manning, who played a significant role as leader on the Government and Opposition sides of the House. He can be best summed up by referring to his achievements during the two and a half years he was Leader of the House during the minority rainbow Government. He steered that Government through without losing a single vote in this House. He had a good Whip at the time. That was a tremendous achievement and showed his strength. It was probably the only minority Government in the history of the Seanad. His steering that Government through without losing a single vote in this House is a major achievement that will go down in history as a mark to him.</P>

If I was creating a world, I would ensure people would go through various phases. They would be a student, a warrior, a Senator and at the end of their term, their friends would gather and say goodbye and praise them, and then they would go to Heaven.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today is one of the joyful days in being a Senator. One of the traditions of this House is that we pay tribute to former Senators on their passing. Perhaps they hear us wherever they are. This is one of the occasions on which we have the opportunity to thank those who have put such effort, commitment and hard work into the work<Col N="1889" /> ings of the House. Senator Farrell talked about counting the 36 steps up to this House. Senator Manning spoke of the pride he experienced on being elected to one of the Houses of Parliament of this State. All of us have had the opportunity to do so, but we have not had the opportunity too often in the past to thank those leaving us. I will not follow through on this with many words.</P>
    <P>I had a meeting with Lord Williams, the Leader of the House of Lords, with whom the Cathaoirleach also had a meeting. He came to talk about the running of this House. It was rather late in the day when I met him by which time he had learned a great deal about this House from the Cathaoirleach and others. The amount of respect, recognition and understanding this House deserves, but does not always get, is due in no small way to the work put in by those who have been referred to today. I refer particularly to the work the Cathaoirleach has put in in recent years.</P>
    <P>I became a Member of this House nine and a half years ago. I telephoned Gordon Wilson when I knew that he would also be a Member. I think I was the only Member he knew when he came to this House. Like a baby taking his or her first steps, I came through the doors of this House to learn my way around.</P>
    <P>The Cathaoirleach, who has served here for 21 years, is receiving the key to a door that is different from the key one normally gets after 21 years. He is entering another phase of his life. I know he will show the same interest and commitment in that phase as he has shown in the past in the workings of this House. We were honoured to have him as Cathaoirleach, to have benefited from the effectiveness with which he did his job and the humour and great style he showed. That has been greatly appreciated.</P>
    <P>I add to what has been said about Senator Manning. He will continue to do a great deal of work. He leaves behind not only the words he spoke, but also the amount of literature he has left in the form of his publications, which I am sure he will continue to turn out in the years ahead. Those of us who know the work he has put into efforts to reform this House, to make sure it becomes even more recognised and respected for the work that it is possible to do in the future, are aware that such drive comes from a dedication and love of this House and a love of parliamentary democracy that he has shown. From our point of view, we have gained a great deal from this, and will continue to gain from it with his work in the future.</P>
    <P>I also wish to say goodbye not to all those leaving this House &ndash; I will not repeat all the names &ndash; but to two families. Senator Burke talked about dynasties. I speak of Senator Hanafin and Senator Cosgrave. Everyone did not always agree with Senator Hanafin, but it is great that the family tradition is being maintained. Senator Cosgrave is leaving this House and politics after the work of at least three generations. We will miss that interest and the work put in. Family traditions are strong in both Houses.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1890" />On that basis, I welcome Senator Mackin and, particularly, Senator O'Rourke to this House. When former Minister, Senator O'Rourke accepted one of my amendments to one of the first Bills on which I spoke when I became a Member, another speaker said she is a listener. I was impressed that she listened to us and without notes was able to mention, say, points one to four that a Senator made. We do not have the benefit of enough of that type of work. We have not had such success on every occasion in terms of Ministers putting in such an amount of work. This House will benefit from the arrival of Senator O'Rourke. She comes from a tradition of families and generations that continue in the other House.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole mentioned something and I, too, am puzzled by it. If we are trying to gain respect and recognition from the nation, why are we meeting for only one day? Next week we will have the Ansbacher report, yet we are not due to meet again until September, for just two weeks which are allocated for the debate on the Nice treaty. The nation and the people query our commitment. We have sat for only 23 days this year despite all the work done. Allowing for the two weeks allocated for the debate on the Nice treaty we will have sat fewer times this year than last year. I would like a commitment from the Leader that it is intended when we come back &ndash; I hope next week but even if it is not until September &ndash; that there will be no break from then. I know it is being suggested that there will be a two week recess after the debate on the Nice treaty. I suggest that we should continue to work through until Christmas to gain the respect and recognition that the Cathaoirleach and others leaving the House strove to ensure for the future of the House.</P>

      <P>Aontaím go hiomlán leis an méid atá ráite ar do shon agus ar son na Seanadóirí atá ag éirí as oifig inniu. I join in the welcome to Senator O'Rourke and Senator Mackin, valuable additions to this Chamber who will make good contributions in the future.</P>
      <P>Today is really a day to pay tribute to declared outgoing Members &ndash; many of us are hoping not to be outgoing Members, but nobody knows who will or not be here. There are many distinguished Members who will not be Members of the next Seanad. Chief among them is the Cathaoirleach who has graced the Seanad for many years. One could not but be impressed by the manner in which he conducted his duties both inside and outside the Chamber. He was a tremendous ambassador for the Upper House and always conducted business in a fair and impartial way which brought credit not just to himself, but also to the Seanad and the Houses in general. I join all those who wish him well for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pay tribute to the outgoing Leader who has been relegated to the Lower House and his successor, Senator Farrell, who has taken over for one day. He has had a long worthwhile career in <Col N="1891" /> Seanad Éireann and been a friend of many of us for a long time.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning has received well deserved tributes from all sides of the House. His contributions which were always incisive, articulate and constructive enhanced the Seanad. He will be sadly missed and difficult to replace.</P>
    <P>I have served with and known a number of the others for a considerable time. My neighbour, Senator Lanigan, has been a friend for many years. He has been a strong advocate of fairness for parts of the world where fairness has not always pertained. His contributions on the Middle East were valuable at sensitive times internationally. I wish him well for the future.</P>
    <P>Senator Hanafin has been the champion of many fine causes and was never afraid to articulate his strong and sincere beliefs. He gained a reputation for his courage in many areas and his contribution is a legacy that will stand the test of time.</P>
    <P>Today may not be the day to raise this, but I know people are looking for debates on the Ansbacher accounts and other issues. There is no better way of feeling the pulse of the nation and knowing the issues important to it than through a general election campaign. The one issue which struck me throughout the campaign was the series of difficulties arising from increased costs in the insurance industry. Many small businesses will find it increasingly difficult to sustain themselves and remain viable unless this issue is tackled. I hope the Seanad will ventilate it at an early stage. Whether it is addressed by phasing awards, which are excessive in some instances, or whether the Government will face up to the issue of legal costs, this House has a role to play in leading the campaign to ensure businesses do not suffer or are not forced out of business by the prohibitive cost of insurance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. D. Cregan Mr. D. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the new Senators, particularly Senator O'Rourke. I was thrilled that on the day she was defeated she could say she was not prepared to step down. She is coming to this House as a fine and solid person. She did not have an easy year. First she lost someone dear to her and then her seat. She is very welcome and I know she will do us proud.</P>
      <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach, in particular. Someone said he sat in the Chair like a person who was not a party member but an independent person. He is independent, kind, sincere and loyal. When the chips are down he is well able to handle the matter and put people in their place. I congratulate him on this and wish him well. I do not think he is retiring from politics but just stepping down &ndash; no politician retires.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to all my friends, on all sides of the House, who are retiring, particularly Senator Farrell. He is unique. He is a fine person who can speak without briefs or notes. I wish him well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1892" />I also wish Senator Lanigan well. He spoke well on foreign affairs. To look at him one would not think he had a word to say on foreign affairs, but he could speak for a month on the topic. I was always surprised at this. As a spokesperson on Kilkenny, he always found Kilkenny was best, but in listening to him speak on foreign affairs one could only say he knew his business.</P>
    <P>My friend, Senator Joe Doyle, is unique in many ways and I wish him well. I also wish all other friends who are not standing again well. In particular, I wish Senator Manning well. I could not believe he was not nominated. As a backbencher, I always felt proud of him. I was privileged to be able to sit down and listen to him. He was always prepared to tell others they had done well. I do not understand the reason he is not standing for the Seanad or was not nominated. He is one of Ireland's finest. My family and I could always listen to him. He has done Ireland and this House proud. Many pointed out how good he was. It is sad to think that he will not be a Member of the next Seanad. We need people of his character and ability. He puts things across in such a way that one would never think he was an academic. He is well able to say things in a way that the ordinary person can understand. Those who were taught by him say he treated them well. I wish him well and know he will do well. I do not read many books, but have read some of his fine and unique work. It is a sad day when we lose people of his calibre.</P>

      <P>I welcome Senator O'Rourke and Senator Mackin to the House and I look forward to working with them.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to the Cathaoirleach for looking after me when I became a Member of the House in 1992 and explaining to me its electoral system and various procedures. I pay tribute to him for the fair and loyal manner in which he performed his duties as Cathaoirleach. He showed integrity in the manner in which he ensured all our views were reflected. As others have mentioned other aspects of this, I will not elaborate on it any further.</P>
      <P>I am sorry to learn that Senator Manning will not be part of the next Seanad, as I have always worked well with him. He was always helpful and gentlemanly when I asked him for advice on particular issues I was trying to tease out. He makes one feel that the point one is making is a good one. I am sorry to see him go, but I hope our friendship will persist. A fine man like him should not be out of politics.</P>
      <P>Senator Des Hanafin's connection with the Ormonde family goes back to the 1960s when he and my father were candidates in an election. He often telephones me when I am travelling around the country to ask after me and ensure I am not breaking the speed limit. I will miss that protective instinct, at least in this House, when he retires.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am well acquainted with Senator Mick Lanigan from the Waterford and Kilkenny areas of <Col N="1893" /> the south east. Our families go back a long way and I hope we will remain friends. I wish him well in his retirement.</P>
    <P>I got to know Senator Willie Farrell very well when I was elected in 1992 and have worked closely with him since that time. I admire his interest in all issues, as he expresses a heartfelt view on everything and his thoughts are constructive. I hope he enjoys his retirement.</P>
    <P>My thoughts are with those of us running in the Seanad elections. I hope we are all elected.</P>

      <P>Although this is a great Chamber in which to work, there is great scope for its reform, as Senator Manning has said on many occasions. The next Seanad should strive to ensure reforms are implemented, as the systems in place do not work as they should. Certain Members can talk at length on any subject, but some observers have the impression that the House is merely a platform from which to jump off, or a place where people can settle down. That is a pity as it is not fair to those of us who would like to make a huge contribution on many issues. The many issues involved in the Nice treaty, for example, could be discussed in this Chamber. I hope reforms will be put in place in the next Seanad to reflect the points of view I have expressed. I wish health, happiness and many years of public life outside the Chamber to those Senators who are retiring.</P>

      <P>I would like to be associated with the many genuine and warm tributes which have been paid today, all of which have been deserved. I welcome Senator O'Rourke and Senator Mackin to the House. It has been pointed out that Senator O'Rourke was very attentive to the interests of this House when she was a Minister and was associated with a great deal of the legislation initiated here.</P>
      <P>Even when we were trying your patience, a Chathaoirligh, you demonstrated a kind and even-handed manner, although I should point out that all my contributions were brief. I respect the fairness and respect shown to Members in a kind and jovial manner. I wish you many years of happy retirement. Similarly, I wish Senators Mick Lanigan, Willie Farrell, Ann Leonard and the father of the House, Des Hanafin, a happy retirement. Although we will miss them as Senators, we will retain them as good friends whom we will meet on an ongoing basis.</P>
      <P>On this side of the House, I pay tribute to Senators Joe Doyle, Liam Cosgrave and Maurice Manning. Senator Cosgrave has given distinguished service as Cathaoirleach and Leas-Chathaoirleach. Senator Doyle, as Fine Gael's spokesman on finance, always displayed a great touch and mixed it well with the Minister, Deputy McCreevy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been pointed out that it is a matter of some regret that Senator Manning will not be <Col N="1894" /> standing again, but I think it is more than that as he is far too young and fresh for retirement. He has always been greatly helpful to us, particularly with his advice and encouragement when we were first elected. As we know, he is a distinguished academic and historian and we greatly admire his flow of words. I have no doubt that he will continue to make an important contribution to national life as he is a man of the Irish scene. I hope important work will be found for him to do. As Senator Dardis said, he has been an honest and straight politician. I wish all Members of the House well in their future endeavours.</P>

I sincerely say you have been kind and wise, a Chathaoirligh, even if you did once mistake me for a nun. I forgive you for the error and wish you well. I once had quite a robust debate with Senator Farrell and wish him well also. I welcome the feisty Senator O'Rourke. It is good to see another woman in the House.</P>

      <P>I reserve my final remarks for my dear friend and colleague, Senator Manning, who is a superb man. I am reminded of the story of the final seat at the round table, which was won by the noblest of all the knights.

      <P>While I do not wish to be repetitive, I join in the tributes to the Cathaoirleach and Senators on both sides of the House who are retiring. They deserve our sincere thanks for the contribution they have made in this Chamber during the last five years. I can honestly say some of them, including Senator Manning, are irreplaceable. We all admired him for the strength, vitality and integrity of his contributions and the judgment he showed on every occasion, sometimes in difficult circumstances. He will be irreplaceable and this Chamber will be the poorer for his going.</P>
      <P>You, a Chathaoirligh, have been the essence of impartiality. Any time speakers stepped out of line, you reluctantly reined them in and conducted the business in an exemplary fashion down through the years. All Members join in paying you a special tribute.</P>
      <P>I will not name individual Senators who are leaving the Chamber, except to say that a fellow countyman of mine, Senator Willie Farrell, is also leaving. I wish to pay a special tribute to him because we travelled together to many funerals in Sligo and throughout the area. I always found him most co-operative and a very fine Senator.</P>
      <P>I welcome the new Senator O'Rourke and Senator Mackin, who I am sure will play a major role in the new Seanad. I hope all of us who aspire to be here in the future will be here to join them and listen to them. As spokesman on public enterprise during the last few years I battled with Senator O'Rourke on many occasions. It was not a very vigorous battle on many occasions but I always admired the way she accepted sensible and well thought out ideas and contributions on legislation.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to delay the House, but I reiterate the sentiments of the other Senators and wish the retiring Members every success and good health in the future.</P>

      <P>I wish to say to the Cathaoirleach that his patience has endured to the end, even though it may have been tested. The one thing you and Senator Manning have in common is an enduring modesty. They might be tempted not to recognise themselves in some of the things that were said but I assure them they were very well merited in both cases.</P>
      <P>On the Order of Business, Senator O'Toole spoke about taking all Stages of Nos. 5 and 6. The Senator will be aware that I am very reluctant to go through all Stages and it is certainly not the practice in the House to guillotine a Bill.</P>

      <P>It has lost a section in its passage through the Dáil. It is now two sections and it is something the House can dispose of quickly. In the spirit of the occasion, I ask Senator O'Toole to accommodate the Government side this time.</P>
      <P>I do not dispute the comments he made in regard to the importance of the benchmarking report and the report on the Ansbacher accounts. These are two highly significant events. However, I cannot give a commitment that the House will sit to consider them, but I am sure they will be widely debated in the wider society.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan spoke about the freedom of information regulations and taking No. 1 without debate. A Chathaoirligh, you will be aware that when the Bill was debated, it was a very long debate. There were many contributions from Senators in their capacity as county councillors and otherwise. It got tremendous debate and the regulations were discussed by the Committee on Finance and the Public Service. Therefore, I ask that the matter be taken without debate.</P>
      <P>Senator Farrell spoke about his qualifications. I think we can all learn from his experience in the university of life. He could probably teach the academics a thing or two when it comes to the university of life.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris proposed an amendment to the Order of Business with regard to No. 23, motion 15. Unfortunately, there will not be time today to debate that matter. There will be a very extensive debate in the incoming Seanad on the Nice treaty and the legislation in regard to the referendum.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge what Senator Lanigan said with regard to the Palestinian issue. I will bring this issue to the attention of the Minister for Foreign Affairs. It is significant that the European Union has taken a different line from the United States on this matter. He is correct that it is a matter for the Palestinian people to decide who their leader should be and that should be done without interference. Listening to the radio this morning, I understood that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, intervened with the president of the Palestinian state following the events of 11 September with regard to the response of the Palestinian Authority. What he did in that regard was very helpful and it is something with which he is well acquainted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I reciprocate by endorsing the messages I have heard in the House over a long period of time of sentiments of warm cordiality towards you, a Chathaoirligh, having completed 21 years of public service, for your patriotism, commitment and involvement in the democratic process. On behalf of the Government, I thank you for all your efforts on behalf of Seanad Éireann and Irish democracy. I echo the warm sentiments expressed in relation to a number of Members of Seanad Éireann who have indicated that today's proceedings probably mark their last day as Members of the House. I thank them most sincerely for all they have done in the interests of democratic life.</P>
      <P>I thank the House for making time available to discuss the exercise by the State of the option under the Fourth Protocol to the Treaty of Amsterdam on proposals for Council decisions regarding the signing and conclusion of a readmission agreement between the European Community and the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China. As this is my first time appearing in Seanad Éireann as Minister, I take the opportunity to point out the importance of the role of the Oireachtas in the scrutiny of European Union business. I look forward to the contribution which this House makes to proposals such as these.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The subject of the agreement with the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region is the <Col N="1900" /> readmission of persons residing without authorisation. This is a matter which arises under Article 63 of the treaty establishing the European Community and is part of Title IV of the treaty which was added by the Treaty of Amsterdam in 1999. Title IV deals with measures in the area of visas, asylum, immigration and other policies related to the free movement of persons. The Amsterdam treaty conferred powers on the Community in the field of readmission.</P>
    <P>The application of Title IV to Ireland is subject to the provisions of the Fourth Protocol to the Treaty of Amsterdam. Ireland is not automatically a participant in measures under Title IV unless we exercise an option provided for in the protocol. Under the terms of the protocol, Ireland has three months from the date of presentation of a proposal to the Council to exercise the option to take part in the adoption of the proposed measure. It may also exercise the option at any time after a measure has been adopted by the Council. Article 29.4.6 of the Constitution provides that in order to exercise the option, the prior approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas must be obtained and I am here with a view to seeking that approval.</P>
    <P>There are two Council decisions proposed and therefore there are two motions before the House. One decision concerns the signing of the agreement and the other concerns the conclusion of the agreement by the Council. As the subject matter of both these proposals is the same, I propose to deal with both matters together.</P>
    <P>Readmission agreements are a significant feature of international co-operation in the field of immigration. A readmission and return policy is recognised internationally as an integral and vital element in the fight against illegal immigration. Ireland has been aware of the need for such agreements and in recent years has negotiated a number of bilateral readmission agreements. To date such bilateral readmission agreements have been signed with Romania, Poland, Nigeria and Bulgaria. The proposed Community readmission agreement with the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region which is before the House today is the first such agreement to be negotiated to a conclusion by the European Commission on behalf of all member states. The exercise of the option in the motion will allow Ireland to be a party to the agreement.</P>
    <P>Community readmission agreements form part of the European Union's broader aim of developing a balanced, coherent and common approach towards immigration and asylum. Apart from Hong Kong, to date the European Commission has been authorised to negotiate readmission agreements with Russia, Morocco, Pakistan and Sri Lanka and the Special Administrative Region of Macau. The readmission agreement with Hong Kong will be the first to enter into force.</P>
    <P>I fully support the view that the return and readmission of third country nationals who are illegally resident in the EU must be an integral <Col N="1901" /> part of our common immigration and asylum policy. Readmission agreements involve reciprocal undertakings by the European Union and third country partners to co-operate over the return of illegal residents to their country of origin.</P>
    <P>The comprehensive approach which has been put forward focuses on the adoption of common procedures for the legal admission of third country nationals. However the European Commission has emphasised that these policies must be accompanied by measures to combat illegal migration and in particular smuggling and trafficking of humans and the return of persons who are illegally present in the EU. In its recent Communication on the Common Policy on Illegal Immigration, the European Commission underlined that the return and readmission of third country nationals who are illegally resident in the EU must be an integral part of the common policy.</P>
    <P>I will outline the principal features of the agreement and it should be noted that the readmission obligations set out in the agreement are drawn up in a fully reciprocal way. Article 2 states that Hong Kong shall readmit its permanent residents and former permanent residents provided that they are validly shown to be so. Article 3 states that Hong Kong shall readmit persons of another jurisdiction under certain specified circumstances. The obligation to readmit persons of another jurisdiction arises where at the time of entry into a member state such persons held a valid visa or residence authorisation issued by Hong Kong or having entered the territory of Hong Kong, they proceeded to enter unlawfully the territory of a member state. Article 4 deals with the readmission by member states of the Community of their own nationals. Proof of nationality or former nationality is required and, if necessary, the member state concerned shall issue a travel document. Article 5 provides that a member state shall readmit persons of another jurisdiction in specified circumstances and shall provide, as necessary, a travel document.</P>
    <P>Articles 6 to 11, inclusive, contain the necessary technical provisions regarding the readmission procedure &ndash; readmission application, means of evidence, time limits, etc. Articles 12 and 13 concern transit operations. Articles 14 to 16, inclusive, contain the necessary rules on costs, data protection and the non-affectation of other international rights and obligations applicable to the parties. Article 17 states that a readmission committee shall be set up to, among other things, monitor the application of the agreement and implementation procedures. Article 18 empowers member states to conclude bilateral implementing protocols with Hong Kong. The relationship between such implementing protocols and the agreement is clarified in Article 19. Articles 20 to 22, inclusive, contain the necessary rules on entry into force, duration, termination and the legal status of the annex to the agreement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1902" />Ireland has a long history of legal migration from Hong Kong and from China in general and the number of people coming here has been increasing in recent years. There were almost 12,000 Chinese nationals resident in the State in 2001, almost double the number in 2000, while the number from Hong Kong was approximately 500 in 2001. Chinese nationals come here mainly as workers and as students and they make a significant input to the economy. In this regard, almost 1,000 work permits were issued in respect of Chinese nationals in 2001.</P>
    <P>In recognition of the significant number of Chinese nationals who seek to enter the State, my Department has recently posted visa processing staff to the Irish Embassy in Beijing. This will improve the service being provided to Chinese nationals who wish to come to Ireland. The existence of the proposed readmission agreement with the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region is not expected to have any significant effect in Ireland where the incidence of illegal immigration from Hong Kong is low.</P>
    <P>It should also be noted that the existence of a readmission agreement does not affect the consideration of the merits of any claim from an individual for leave to remain in the State. In any individual case where deportation is being considered, the provisions of section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999, will apply. This section sets out a range of factors which the Minister must consider before a deportation order is made. The return of an asylum seeker would also be subject to the provisions of section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996, as regards the prohibition of <i>refoulement</i> or the return of the person to possible persecution.</P>
    <P>I commend these motions to the House. The development of a return policy, of which readmission agreements form an important part, is a vital element in the development of a common immigration and asylum policy at European Union level.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister on his first visit to the House. It is my last day here and although our political careers have criss-crossed a number of times, we are here today for a parting of the ways.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister for outlining the protocols behind these motions. It is interesting to note the number of Chinese nationals now residing in the State. It is remarkable that ours has become an international state given the large number of Chinese and other nationals living here. I am fully in agreement with these motions and I thank the Minister for outlining them to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1903" />
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Doyle for sharing his time and I welcome the Minister. It is splendid to have him in this position, which was a most imaginative appointment by the Government. He can only do good for a Department which needs his attention urgently.</P>
      <P>I have some problems with these motions, which the Minister would probably expect from me as a wet, woolly liberal. The Minister mentioned 12,000 Chinese nationals in the State in 2001, almost double the number in 2000. By simple mathematics that means 6,000 Chinese came here in one year. That is a significant number and makes them one of the principal contributors to our immigrant population. Many of them work very industriously here and have made themselves at home in our society, but the Minister has not said how many are present legally and how many would be contemplated under this provision. The Minister should give us some information on how many people out of this 12,000 are likely to be returned.</P>
      <P>This may not be directly relevant to these motions but I express serious concern about the housing afforded to these people while their cases for staying here are being processed. A number of the places where these people are housed break every possible by-law, fire regulation and health and safety provision. That is appalling and the Government should not stand over it.</P>
      <P>I am also concerned by the situation of Dae Dong Xhue, a member of the staff of Trinity College, who returned to China and was grabbed by the authorities there because he is a practitioner of Falun Gong. People in this country do not realise the extent to which the Chinese Government has hammered the Falun Gong adherents. My understanding is that over 400 have already been killed. Does the Chinese Government accept and admit that fact? The real figures are probably considerably greater. Given that the ethos of Falun Gong is about spreading moderation, tolerance, peace and so on, a government which is seriously concerned about it and regards its members as terrorists has many questions to answer. I am concerned about this fact.</P>
      <P>I do not like the idea of the creation of a fortress Europe but I know this is the way the European Community is going. I am glad that it was recently persuaded not to impose severe penalties on some of the most impoverished Third World countries. I understand that Ireland played a role in persuading the other European countries that making the situation worse in these countries creates further ways of justifiable and understandable migration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said: &ldquo;Articles 14 to 16 contain the necessary rules on costs, data protection and the non-affectation of other international rights.&rdquo; I am curious to know if that is a legal term or, perhaps, it is a usage with which I am not familiar. The word &ldquo;affectation&rdquo; strikes me as only slightly different. Perhaps it means that it does not affect these other rules and demonstrates that they are <Col N="1904" /> immune from contamination in some legal sense. It may be a perfectly justifiable and proper use of the word &ldquo;affectation&rdquo;, but it seems a slightly strange use in that sense. Although I oppose this legislation and would certainly wish to raise strong queries about it, I am glad we have someone of the fine intelligence and legal wisdom of the Minister to guide this and other legislation through the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister, congratulate him on his appointment and wish him well in what will be onerous duties. I am sure he will distinguish himself in this Department as he has done throughout his political career.</P>
      <P>I welcome the protocol. It is essential that this area be regulated and that there is a balance, as Senator Norris has said, by way of ensuring that people have certain rights and access to the asylum seeking process. Ireland has a long history of emigration. Countries that welcome their immigrants have, to some extent, set an example for us. As a small nation we are glad to be in a position, economically, to play our part in this regard. That is one of the reasons Ireland is an attractive location. This type of international co-operation is essential. Given that there appeared to be little control some years ago on the refugee issue, we have initiated these bilateral agreements which have worked well for certain countries, particularly those in the former eastern bloc and Nigeria. In this regard it was a step in the right direction.</P>
      <P>We have a developing relationship with China and our trade imbalance is being addressed. That level of co-operation, with the exchange of embassies, is further advanced by means of this agreement. An area that should be looked at is the cost aspect implied in certain instances because of the return of some refugees. I presume it is incumbent on the Department to ensure return procedures are in place which will stand a greater cost effectiveness test than may have been the case in some relatively recent high profile cases. Notwithstanding that, it is not an easy area with which to deal. Therefore, I understand certain issues will arise which may give rise to excess costs and if they are not dealt with, and seen to be dealt with, firmly, there is an open invitation to breach the regulations.</P>
      <P>The number of Chinese nationals in the State per thousand, to which Senator Norris referred, seems high. The Chinese community, as has been rightly acknowledged, has played a significant role in the catering and other areas of the economy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure it will continue to do so. I welcome the protocol. This Minister has flagged that it is probably the first of a number of protocols that will come before us regarding other countries from which there are a growing number of immigrants in our midst. It is good that Ireland <Col N="1905" /> is becoming multicultural but it is essential that it is done in a controlled way. Given that the global economy is changing it is imperative from the racism point of view that it is regulated and does not give rise to anti-racist sentiments which would be unwelcome and must be avoided at all costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join my colleagues in welcoming the Minister. He is a significant figure in Irish politics and one I respect enormously, but I am not sure I agree with him about much. There are certain areas where we would agree. He is somebody I like and somebody for whom I have great regard. He is a person of considerable ability but I suspect that over the next five years, if I am still here, we will have more disagreements than agreements. However, it will be a pleasure to debate with him because he is a figure of substance whose absence was not good for Irish politics. I say that genuinely as one who would disagree with him on most things as he will discover in the next two minutes.</P>
      <P>I have no objection to the principle involved in this protocol, but if we have illegal immigration there has to be a sensible and efficient way of returning these illegal immigrants to the countries from which they came. Nobody could disagree with that. In any political debate about this issue it is extremely important to talk about the immigration hysteria which is gripping Europe. The fact that there is much talk about immigration and that certain parties have used particularly offensive language about it, is no reason to do what those parties wish.</P>
      <P>A political representative from my constituency in Cork disgraced his reputation, that of his party and politics by some of his comments during the past six months. This may have saved his seat but it did not do much for politics. To the credit of his party colleagues he was left alone on the issue and was criticised fairly bluntly by others. That was the right thing to do. People like that need to be dealt with and confronted because the issue is not immigration <i>per se. </i> The issue is the perception that the poorest in society are losing out because of the presence of immigrants in their midst. We must begin by making it perfectly clear and doing what is necessary to ensure that is not the case because that eliminates the single biggest cause. Many of those I know in Cork who would be inclined to talk about immigration, particularly over a few pints, would be the first to complain if their local Chinese takeaway was closed when they were going home from the pub.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>They want Irish Chinese takeaways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Such people can quite happily contradict themselves in the one sentence about foreigners taking over the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The political parties all over Europe are quite different from each other. Pim Fortuyn found Jean Marie Le Pen to be among the most repulsive for, among others, his attitude to the homo<Col N="1906" /> sexual community because Pim Fortuyn was an active and vocal gay person. Therefore, it cannot be done.</P>
    <P>The second point I want to make about immigration is that I am astonished that much of the hysteria politically about immigration &ndash; I am not talking about the Minister &ndash; comes from parties on the political right. The fundamental force driving illegal immigration is the force of the marketplace. Most of those on the political right would tell me I am naive to believe that one can buck the market. What is actually creating illegal immigration throughout the world is the fact that there is a surplus of labour in one country and an increasing shortage in many others. Unless we get a balance in the labour market worldwide, we will not deal with the fundamental causes of the problem. That is the reason I am glad that the nonsense my colleagues in the British Labour Party were coming up with about threatening to reduce development aid further was not pursued because the real remedy is to provide opportunities at home.</P>
    <P>We have always found that we do not have to perform as well as the United States. All we have to do is give people the opportunity to make a reasonable living at home and the flood of immigration will stop. In the 1960s we were moderately prosperous, but wages here were spectacularly below those in the United States. Once we have some prospect of work here our levels of emigration drop dramatically because people do not want to leave home. The fundamental issue we need to address is the hysteria and the pressures created by the one-sidedness of the world labour market.</P>
    <P>In my period as a member of the Joint Committee on European Affairs I met the parliamentarians of a number of applicant countries and asked each of them about the areas of greatest difficulty in terms of negotiating their accession agreements. One was the issue of the free movement of labour and the fact that the European Union was attempting to negotiate long transition arrangements before their populations would be allowed to move freely within what are the current boundaries of the European Union.</P>
    <P>It is about time that issue was dealt with, not on the basis of fears, prejudices or the nonsense of Herr Haider in Austria, but on the basis of the evidence of significant other cases, particularly in Spain and Portugal, where the mass migration about which many were talking once Portugal joined did not happen. There was no dramatic change. We are creating bad feeling in the populations of countries like Poland and the Czech Republic by telling them we are afraid to open our borders to them in 2004 because they will flood the labour markets of Germany, Austria and the other countries on the margins of the area to which we will expand.</P>
    <P>The very fact that Governments collectively in the European Union are negotiating from a position of hostility to the movement of labour is a further affirmation of the hysteria about <Col N="1907" /> migration with which we should be dealing. It is possible to work out whether there is serious evidence for that hysteria, but I expect that those countries will prosper economically once they join the European Union because of the various access they will have to markets and also the assistance the European Union will give them. There will not be a huge flood. Not only will the European Union's insistence on making their membership conditional on a long transition period not do any good, it will also do harm by feeding the hysteria that we are near to a flood of huge numbers who will work for virtually nothing throughout Europe. That was said about us in the past and it is being said intermittently about us on the neighbouring island. It was said intermittently about the Portuguese and the Spaniards when they joined the European Union and now it is being said again. That is creating the climate in which the extreme right attitude to immigration can operate. I invite the Minister, with the influence he now has, to ask people to at least be balanced on the question of the free movement of labour in the accession countries because I know from listening to parliamentarians from most of those countries that it is both a nuisance, an irritant and one they regard as quite offensive.</P>
    <P>I would welcome this motion except for the fact that I am uneasy about the climate, culturally and politically, in which matters like this are being dealt with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the motions before us, it is essential that agreements of this nature are in place, on a bilateral basis or otherwise, because the absence of such agreements feeds some of the misinformation and xenophobia that is becoming increasingly prevalent. Neither the Minister nor I, or anybody in the House, would subscribe to some of the statements made before and during the course of the general election campaign. An essential element is that there is not a limbo period after due process, in other words, when all the procedures have been gone through there is then a formal system whereby <Col N="1908" /> people can be repatriated to the countries from which they came.</P>
      <P>With regard to the remarks made by Senator Norris on the Falun Gong, they fall into a different category. It is important that we distinguish between refugees, asylum seekers, illegal economic immigrants and so on because they are different categories, yet they appear to be lumped together into the one group. That feeds the misinformation and the xenophobia to which I referred.</P>
      <P>I had the good fortune while at university to share a room with a citizen of Hong Kong who held a British passport. When the colony was being returned to China he regarded it as desirable to leave Hong Kong and came back to live in Ireland. He received all his secondary school and third level medical education in Ireland, yet found it extremely difficult to get citizenship. I accept that citizenship is a totally different matter from the matters before us today, but given his circumstances &ndash; they were eventually taken into account by the Department of Foreign Affairs &ndash; it would have been desirable to facilitate him to a greater degree than was the case. It would be wrong for somebody in that circumstance to find himself or herself in a situation where he or she might have to return to his or her country of origin, particularly given his or her educational background here.</P>
      <P>I want to ask a question about Article 2 which states Hong Kong shall readmit its permanent residents and former permanent residents provided they are validly shown to be so. Article 3 goes on to deal with visas and so on. I am interested in knowing if there are ways, other than through visa travel documents, whereby the validity of their permanent residency in Hong Kong can be shown? Perhaps the Minister will elaborate on that. I believe fundamentally that the absence of agreements of this nature contributes to hysteria, xenophobia and misunderstandings, which can be used to feed organisations and individuals who have wrong motives and do not wish to see individuals of another ethnic origin or colour residing in our midst.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, for those remarks. I refer to Senator Doyle's remarks. We have criss-crossed on occasion but we are rarely in the same place at the same time. This is one of those occasions where we will be together for a few minutes. I pay tribute to him for his service to the State in this House, the Lower House and in municipal politics over the years. I wish him and his wife, Peggy, who are good friends of mine, every happiness in the post-parliamentary phase of his public service life. May the rest of his public service long continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1909" />I share Senator Norris's worries about the Falun Gong and the way they have been treated. One of the disturbing features of this is that up to recently they were given freedom of action in the Hong Kong special region but there is evidence of pressure from the remainder of the People's Republic of China, which has resulted in arrests and repression in Hong Kong. That is a matter about which I am concerned.</P>
    <P>The Senator questioned the use of the term &ldquo;non-affectation&rdquo;. I defer to him on matters of affectation but the term &ldquo;non-affectation&rdquo; is not of my making as it is to be found in the text of the document. It derives from the <i>linguis juris</i> section of the European Council. It is a term of art in European law. &ldquo;Non-affectation&rdquo; means that somebody is not adversely affected.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan made a number of points which deserve a response. I agree it is important that we should not contribute to an atmosphere of hysteria. The figures I mentioned earlier show there are more than 12,000 Chinese nationals resident in Ireland, but this must be balanced against the fact that a handful have claimed refugee status here. Only one person claimed refugee status a year ago while the figure is now 25. It is, therefore, wrong to view the Chinese presence in Ireland, which is so enriching of our community, in the context of seeking asylum or refugee status. The great majority of Chinese nationals or Hong Kong residents are here legally, whether as students or workers, and they play an important part in the life of the country. I agree with the Senator, therefore, that it is important to avoid urban myths. Chinese nationals do not deprive anyone of anything and they play an important part as students or workers or both in our economic and social life. They should not be looked upon in an adverse or negative way.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis asked how it can be proved that individuals are nationals or permanent residents in the EU or Hong Kong. <i>Prima facie</i> evidence of proof for Hong Kong residents comprises either a Hong Kong Special Administrative Region passport, Hong Kong certificate of identity, Hong Kong permanent identity card or official documents indicating permanent residence. This will not be hidebound in legalities. The agreement contains sophisticated methods for resolving disputes that may arise about an individual's nationality.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators who contributed to the brief debate on this measure. Many people may not consider it to be of major importance but if we do not have a system of repatriation of people who are in Ireland unlawfully, it will feed the very myths to which Senator Ryan referred. Remarks such as there is no way of getting rid of them when they are rejected or similar terms which are the coinage of loose, ill-informed and damaging conversation generate an atmosphere of resentment.</P>
    <P>I thank Members for their kind remarks about myself and for their support for this measure. I assure those who are worried that repatriation is <Col N="1910" /> not being put at the top of agenda to lead public opinion towards repatriation as an end in itself, but because if we believe in the rule of law and according asylum seekers their rights under national and international law, we must also uphold and introduce effective laws for those who, when they are afforded due process, are found not to be entitled to remain in our territory.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senator for moving the motion. The motion relates to the exercise by the State of an option, which we must have, to take part in the adoption and application of the proposals for a Council regulation creating a European enforcement order for uncontested claims and a Council regulation concerning juris<Col N="1911" /> diction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and in matters of parental responsibility. These measures were presented by the European Commission on 13 May and 15 May last respectively.</P>
      <P>Senators will recall that these are measures to which the fourth protocol of the Amsterdam Treaty applies. Under that protocol we have a three month period within which to notify the President of the Council of our intention to opt into discussions from the beginning. Those periods will expire on 14 and 16 August respectively and it is, therefore, essential if we are to opt into the negotiation process leading to those regulations coming into effect that we should signify our consent and obtain the approval of both Houses before the summer recess.</P>
      <P>I apologise to Senators who feel they have not received adequate notice of the motion or who would have preferred a longer debate, but the sequence of events which led to this time limit coming into effect was beyond my control. I consider it highly desirable that the Houses of the Oireachtas should have an enhanced role in scrutinising measures such as those before us. I am, therefore, more than willing to facilitate the Houses in looking again at these measures when the negotiations on them have advanced. The modalities for such scrutiny can be worked out later when the Houses of the Oireachtas have organised and established a committee system to give life to the process of parliamentary scrutiny. I want to put on record the Government's firm commitment to giving the Houses a full part in the vital process of democratic accountability in EU matters. When exercising options under the EU treaties, especially options which have a potential constitutional dimension such as this afternoon's business, it is vital that the Houses of the Oireachtas should be fully involved and fully aware of the implications of the proposals.</P>
      <P>As part of a new, inclusive approach to EU affairs, the Government is committed to strengthening parliamentary scrutiny both by debates in each House and by ongoing interaction and information at sessions of Oireachtas committees on EU affairs. We will not push far-reaching measures through the adoption and scrutiny process &ldquo;on the nod&rdquo;. To do so risks fuelling a sense of alienation and hostility based on a public perception of a democratic deficit in Ireland's approach to EU affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today's debate marks a clear statement by my Department and the Government that we are determined that these matters should be approached in the future on the basis of positive partnership between the Executive and legislative organs of Government established under our Constitution. The particular measures which we are discussing have to be seen against the background of the development at EU level of measures geared towards the enhancement of judicial co-operation in civil matters. The overrid<Col N="1912" /> ing aim of this development is that of making access to justice easier for the individual litigant.</P>
    <P>In that context, a programme of measures to implement the principle of mutual recognition of decisions in civil and commercial matters was adopted in November 2000 by the Justice and Home Affairs Council. It aims ultimately at the abolition of the current system where, in order for a judgment given in one EU country to be enforced in another, a declaration of enforceability must be first sought from the courts of the country where enforcement is to take place. In very broad terms, what this means is that a judgment obtained in Ireland ultimately could be enforced in Madrid in much the same way as a judgment obtained in Dublin can now be enforced in Donegal. It should be noted that a number of measures which link in with the programme have already been brought to the attention of the Oireachtas and have already been adopted.</P>
    <P>The first is the proposed Council regulation for a European Enforcement Order, EEO, for uncontested claims. One of the proposed regulations which we are considering today creates an EEO for uncontested claims. The EEO is intended to facilitate the rapid recovery of outstanding debt which is essential for the proper and effective functioning of the Internal Market.</P>
    <P>The proposal focuses on the elimination of intermediate measures which at present are a prerequisite for enforcement in one member state of a judgment that has been obtained in another. The proposal addresses the incongruity of delaying, for administrative reasons only, enforcement of a judgment concerning a claim that has not been disputed. Claims, for the purposes of the proposal as presented, are limited to pecuniary claims for specific amounts, irrespective of the amount at issue. In Irish legal terms that would be called liquidated damages. The term &ldquo; uncontested claim&rdquo; is also defined in the proposal.</P>
    <P>Before a judgment on such a claim can be enforced it is proposed that it must be the case that either no appeal is possible against the judgment or that the debtor has not made use of the possibility of lodging such an appeal within the time limits for doing so. The text proposes that an enforceable judgment on an uncontested claim must be certified as an EEO at the request of the creditor. For this to happen the claim must meet certain requirements such as no appeal being possible and the documents must have been served on the debtor in such as way as to guarantee a fair trial.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that the EEO certificate will contain a transparent and standardised summary of all the facts that characterise and individualise the content of the judgment and which are indispensable for enforcement. The certificate will also contain comprehensive information to the effect that the requirements for eligibility for certification as an EEO have been met.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that an appeal against the grant of a certificate itself will be excluded under this <Col N="1913" /> proposal. The reasoning behind this is that if the debtor wants to prevent a EEO certificate from coming into existence, he or she has to contest the claim and thus remove it from the scope of application of this proposal. If the claim remains uncontested, upon application by the creditor, it is up to the court of origin to examine the judgment to ascertain if it fulfils the requirements for certification. In this context, the court will be aware that there will be no possibility to appeal against the resulting decisions.</P>
    <P>Before a judgment becomes enforceable, that is, while an appeal is still possible, it is proposed that the judgment may be enforced provisionally. Such an enforcement certificate is reversed if the judgment is overruled on appeal. The system of granting provisional enforceability strikes a delicate balance between the interests of the creditor in swift enforcement and the interest of the debtor in avoiding potentially irreparable damage if the loss incurred due to provisional enforcement cannot be recovered.</P>
    <P>It is considered to be a major advantage of the process which is being proposed that certification of a judgment as an EEO is done by the court of origin familiar with the case at issue and the procedural rules that have applied and that no judicial or other authorities of the member state of enforcement need to be involved.</P>
    <P>In relation to the proposed Council regulation on judgments in matrimonial matters and in matters of parental responsibility, this proposed regulation is in fact a consolidated text which combines three other proposals which have already been the subject of motions before both Houses. Thus, there is nothing of substance in the scope of the current proposal which was not in those into which we have already opted.</P>
    <P>The first such proposal, commonly referred to as the Brussels II regulation, came into force on 1 March 2001 and sets out rules on jurisdiction, recognition and enforcement of judgments on divorce, separation and annulment as well as judgments on parental responsibility for the children of both spouses given on the occasion of such matrimonial proceedings. In July 2000, France presented a proposed regulation aimed at dispensing with the need to go through any specific procedure in the state where enforcement is to take place in the case of a decision on parental responsibility that concerns rights of access to children.</P>
    <P>The scope of this initiative was confined to decisions covered by Brussels II. The narrow scope of this proposal led to criticism on the part of many member states, including Ireland. Subsequently, the Justice and Home Affairs Council decided that work on this initiative should be pursued in parallel with the extension of the scope of Brussels II so as to guarantee equality of treatment for all children. This led, in September 2001, to the presentation by the Commission of a further Council regulation dealing with jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments on matters of parental responsibility.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1914" />This proposed regulation has two elements. First, it takes over, unchanged, the provisions on matrimonial matters from the Brussels II regulation and Brussels II is, in consequence, proposed to be repealed. Second, it integrates into a complete system of rules on parental responsibility the provisions on parental responsibility of Brussels II, the Commission proposal on parental responsibility and the French initiative on rights of access. The Commission's justification for this approach is that having a single instrument in this area will facilitate the application of the law by judges and practitioners and will serve to promote the simplification and coherence of community legislation.</P>
    <P>The main provisions which concern parental responsibility are as follows. The regulation is to apply to all civil proceedings relating to parental responsibility taken by the courts and administrative proceedings authorised under national law. The definition of &ldquo;parental responsibility&rdquo; is broad and relates to the person and property of the child. In particular, the term includes rights of custody and access. A child shall have the right to maintain contact with both parents, unless this is contrary to his or her interests, and shall have the right to be heard on matters relating to parental responsibility in accordance with his or her age and maturity.</P>
    <P>As is the norm in international measures of this kind, jurisdiction is based in the first place on the child's habitual residence, but this is qualified in certain cases. The aim is to attribute jurisdiction in all cases in a way that serves the best interests of the child. In the case of child abduction, jurisdiction will change from the court of the original habitual residence only where all holders of parental responsibility have accepted the new situation or where the child has resided in the new location for at least a year and is settled in his or her new environment. Where this does not happen, the court in the new state must order the child's return. However, in urgent cases, the courts of the state where the child is present will be able to take temporary provisional measures to protect the child, but the final decision on the child's future is taken by the court of the child's habitual residence.</P>
    <P>Grounds for non-recognition and non-enforcement of judgments are set out, including where this would be manifestly contrary to public policy in the member state in which recognition or enforcement is sought, taking into account the best interests of the child. Judgments granting a right of access to a child shall be recognised and enforced in another member state without any special procedure being required.</P>
    <P>Central authorities are to be established by member states to exchange information, co-operate with each other and to arrange any necessary legal proceedings. Among their functions will be the promotion of agreement between holders of parental responsibility through mediation and other means. It can be expected, the House should note, that a good deal of negotiation will <Col N="1915" /> be required on the draft regulation before it is acceptable in full to member states. I will take account of any points that may be made by Senators on any aspect of the proposal. As I have said before, I welcome a full debate before any committees are established by the Houses of the Oireachtas to deal with EU matters in order that Members can be briefed on developments arising from the negotiations and express their views on any issue that arises.</P>
    <P>It has been the view of successive Governments that it is important that we opt into measures such as these in order that through the process of negotiation we can attempt to ensure through our input at an early stage any concerns we have are dealt with adequately. I emphasise that these measures can only be adopted on the basis of unanimity, meaning that if our concerns are not met, we can decline to adopt the measure. I hope Senators will support the proposal that Ireland opts into the discussions on these instruments. I look forward to hearing the comments of Members on both proposals and commend the motion to the House.</P>

      <P>I again thank the Minister for explaining these instruments to the House. I can understand his anxiety to bring them before the House today since we must notify the President of the Council by 14 and 16 August, respectively. I am grateful that the Minister gave a guarantee that the Houses of the Oireachtas can examine them again later before they are processed and that matters relating to European law will be discussed by committees of both Houses.</P>
      <P>Listening to the Minister on the first instrument reminds me of a similar fear regarding the small claims court system, which works extremely well in our jurisdiction. I welcome its extension to other countries to make it easier to deal with uncontested claims. The second measure relates to matrimonial matters and is based on the principle of guaranteeing equality of treatment for all children, which I support.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister raised the important issue of the scrutiny of European measures by the House. He is to be commended, first, for taking these items with debate as past practice was not to debate such measures. If we are to defend the openness and transparency of European measures, we must give them proper consideration in the Houses and this one can be used advantageously for that purpose. I note his saying he was willing to facilitate the House in looking at these measures when the negotiations had been advanced. I hope the Government will consider ways in which the committee system or the Houses themselves can more <Col N="1916" /> closely scrutinise European matters. This issue came up at the National Forum on Europe in relation to reforming the Houses, particularly committees. Those who will return to the Seanad must consider this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem is that the Minister does not succumb to it. Flattery never made him change his mind about any matter.</P>
      <P>I welcome that we are beginning a process in which the views of the Oireachtas are being sought early rather than it being presented with <i>faits accomplis</i>. I would be foolish to pretend that was the reason that people voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; to the Treaty of Nice, but the sense of remoteness, of not being involved, persuaded many to stay at home on the day. The idea that the European Union is controlled by others made it seem unimportant. I hope this type of scrutiny will counterbalance this.</P>
      <P>On the notification of claims, the Minister refers to the court of origin which seems, although I may be wrong, to mean that someone in Greece could take a claim against somebody in Ireland without that person being aware of it. What procedures will be required to notify the person in Ireland that such a claim is being made? I do not disagree with the principle that there should be no appeal as that would make it very unwieldy, but the necessary condition is that the person has a guarantee that claims will not appear out of thin air after being decided on by the court of origin, that is, in the country in which the claim originates. This could be difficult for people such as holidaymakers who might find claims being made against them because of alleged damage to an apartment in Greece. People might discover six months after the event that a claim had been agreed by a court in Greece. What guarantee is there that they will be notified before the claim becomes enforceable and thus incapable of being appealed against?</P>
      <P>I do not object to the second instrument on the enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters, but in the context of the debate on the European Union, was the possibility of the Commission initiating European-wide legislation relating to matrimony or child custody ever raised during the debate on the Treaty of Amsterdam? I am one of the liberals, but we were assured that the European project did not involve any areas which were particularly sensitive, such as divorce, marriage, contraception or abortion. I do not recall when the Treaty of Amsterdam was being debated that this kind of area would be covered by the Fourth Protocol &ndash; a phrase I love because of its dark implications. We must be more open. If something like this is covered by an EU treaty, the people should be informed of the implications before they vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1917" />While I do not object to this measure, I am concerned about the reference to a child's habitual residence in a custody dispute. Are we saying if a child has been abducted, the issue will be conducted in the courts of the state of the abductor, if that has become the child's habitual residence? If so, it is not a good idea. Another matter is that, almost by definition, the person who has the resources and organisation to carry out an abduction will be the wealthier of the two, although there may be exceptions. If that is contested, the person from whom the child was abducted may have to travel to another country. How will his or her legal expenses be dealt with? In a child abduction civil case here, a parent who was short of money would probably be entitled to at least apply for free legal aid.</P>
    <P>If it will be conducted in Luxembourg, Germany, Greece or Bulgaria in the future, what will be the financial implications if the case is conducted in the child's new habitual residence to which he or she has been taken on abduction? I can understand from the child's perspective why that would be the case, but I am concerned about the cost implications of whoever would be seeking to have the abduction overruled or overturned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not, although I understand I have used the correct terminology.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform put forward the Council regulation creating a European enforcement order for uncontested claims and a Council regulation concerning jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and in matters of parental responsibility. Like Senator Ryan and the Leader of Fine Gael present, I do not disagree with either Council resolution. I will speak generally about them in terms of the matters alluded to by the Minister when he spoke about the need for accountability. In doing so, I am compressing all he said and putting it in its starkest form. When my party was in Government previously, there was much talk of this, but the matter has been given added potency and there is a need for significant momentum in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When one goes to Europe as a Minister, one is confronted with a <i>fait accompli</i> in that the mysterious group, COREPER, has been hard at work on our behalf, and I wish it well. I have always called it a mysterious group. It presents its findings to which the Minister concerned is supposed to gracefully acquiesce and put forward the script <Col N="1918" /> provided for him or her. I never put forward the script provided and I always mentally fought against COREPER which reaches a high level of agreement in a conclave on a matter before it comes to the Minister. There is no way out of the matter. It is then signed, sealed and almost delivered.</P>
    <P>Whether it is the Nice referendum, the fear of Nice referendum number two, the demands of the people or whatever, I am glad there is added momentum for the need to show accountability before that point is reached. I recognise the generosity of spirit of the Minister who said he is willing to come back to this matter if there are aspects of it we wish to further scrutinise.</P>
    <P>On a general note, all matters relating to the EU with regard to directives or legislation should be debated before the Minister responsible goes to Europe, not when he or she returns. Irrespective of how equitable and proper such proposals are, it is daft that we consider them post-event rather than pre-event. Deputy Durkan did a good deal of work in this regard when he chaired the Joint Committee on European Affairs during the previous Government, but that is only tipping the iceberg. If we introduce a law governing group water schemes or electoral advancement, it is heavily scrutinised in both Houses where amendments to it may be taken. The legislation is then debated again and there may be fights, roars and shouts, but it is debated in order that the legislation that emanates from both Houses is seen to have been consultative in the widest sense. Any Minister worth his or her salt would consider amendments to a Bill and, if they are good, he or she would accept, say, one or two of them to add texture to what is put before us as a measure, to give due recognition to the civil servants. I am of the opinion that no Bill is sacred; there is no Bill that cannot be amended to improve it.</P>
    <P>Irrespective of the lateness of our wake-up call for the need for greater scrutiny prior to the event, I urge the Minister and the Government to bear in mind that this is nothing compared to what will wash over us if we do not do that. I know Senator Mackin shares my view on this issue. Why should we allow a group of people, COREPER, who are not elected, to sit in solemn conclave and bring a measure to a point from which there is no departure and no going back? I strongly endorse the general tone and tenor of the Minister's remarks. There is momentum behind this measure. Whether it is brought about as a fear of this, that or the other, it is plain common sense. If we are to introduce Bills, directives and laws which affect us in our daily lives, they should be debated here before the relevant Minister. I think it is Denmark&mdash;</P>

The Parliament knew <Col N="1919" /> nothing about what I was going to do regarding those measures until post the event. That practice is irrational, nonsensical and does not make for good legislation. In time it will give rise to a sullen electorate who will feel that their rights are being bargained away in Brussels or Luxembourg by people whom they do not know and acquiesced to by a Minister who is presented with a <i>fait accompli</i>. I urge the Minister to maintain his new pioneering spirit in this regard and to bear in mind that all citizens of the country are better served by ensuring that measures are brought to these Houses prior to the event. I agree with the two measures presented.</P>

      <P>I agree with Senator O'Rourke's comments. We have far too many problems here in terms of discussing regulations<i> post hoc</i>. It is too easy to say it is faceless bureaucrats in Brussels who have brought a measure upon us whereas one of the most important things we can do is to ensure that we have discussed this important type of regulation long before we get to this stage. It is not the Minister's fault that we have got to this stage.</P>
      <P>Having had some experience with Mary Banotti, MEP, who is the rapporteur for the European Parliament on abducted children on an international basis, I realise the importance of this type of regulation. The Minister referred to how important it is that it is the court of the child's habitual residence that has jurisdiction over the case, but he also said that the jurisdiction can change to a new location if the child has been in that new location for a year and is settled in his or her own environment. Frequently it takes at least a year to trace children. Therefore, there is a great deal of work in this area which we need to discuss. I hope the Minister will bring forward all this work again when we reassemble, and God and the Trinity electorate willing, I will be there to help him with it.</P>

      <P>I thank the Senator for that. This is an important area. The personal grief that can be caused by disputes in the courts cannot be underestimated.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan is right in pointing to the situation regarding the costs of travel for the aggrieved party who may have had custody of the child. I know of one case where custody was given in Germany and the child was taken to Western Samoa. That was incredible. One party is likely to be wealthier than the other, which was the case in that instance. In this case it is the child of a wealthy businessman and the child's mother has far less means. These cases are extraordinarily difficult.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am impressed by the fact that the French proposals were reconsidered following discussion in Ireland and other countries. We underestimate <Col N="1920" /> how important an effect the discussions we have here can have on the input to such regulations. I applaud the Minister for saying he will bring this back in the autumn. It is a step in the right direction. I remember when former Deputy Nuala Fennell was Minister for Women's Affairs and tried to start this work. Great progress has been made. This is good and I support the passing of the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Members for their interesting and thought provoking contributions. I will deal with Senator O'Rourke's contribution first. On the whole area of justice and home affairs, it has long been my conviction that the potential of Title IV, in terms of domestic law changing and the effect on Irish society, is huge. To some extent we have been sleepwalking in this area. If the public gets the sense that we have been sleepwalking, the European project, democracy and respect for the Houses will suffer.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Brussels II issue, during the first debate on the Treaty of Nice, the former Attorney General, John Rodgers, made a considerable impact on public opinion by drawing the public's attention to the extent of the changes to Irish law which were made in a manner which, in his view, had not been adequately considered by both Houses of the Oireachtas. There was some debate on these matters, but it was not as significant as one might expect.</P>
      <P>In the area of justice and home affairs, there is huge potential for change in our society in the form of civil law and framework decisions on criminal law. I assure the Members of the House that, as far as I am concerned, this is a serious matter. I do not regard it as something in which the Executive arm of Government pulls a fast one or steals a march on public representatives. I believe that the process must be rethought to be one in which the Executive and the Legislature, as partners, consider the whole impact of European law making in the Irish context.</P>
      <P>I also want to be realistic. Not every directive or proposed regulation is of huge interest to legislators in this House or the Dáil. There will need to be a sifting mechanism where those that require scrutiny are separated from those which are of no interest to legislators. That sifting process requires effort. I notice that in the other House today an Oireachtas commission on legislation was put in place. The resources necessary to address these issues in a serious way will have to be put in place so that the committees of both Houses will be in a position to be assisted by expert staff in the process of sifting and researching the significance of proposals coming in the form of draft legislation from the Commission and the Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There should also be an early warning system connecting the Houses of the Oireachtas with what is happening in the European Parliament where draft directives are being considered. We should be aware of the input of interest groups, <Col N="1921" /> NGOs, economic interests and the like, which is felt in Brussels when proposals are being generated, discussed and elaborated. We should have, effectively, political intelligence about what is happening and what is coming down the tracks. It should not, like a stealth bomber suddenly appearing on the radar screen, just suddenly appear at the last minute when virtually nothing can be done about it.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Rourke referred to COREPER which is staffed by diplomats of the member states.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Under current arrangements they have a significant role in preparing, prior to Council meetings, the business of the Council. They effectively adopt, subject to a reversal out of it which can sometimes be politically embarrassing, a position for their state. Whether that is inevitable is arguable but the Danish Minister for Justice and Home Affairs recently visited here and explained to me her desire to put a period of time between COREPER meetings and Council meetings. That would enable some degree of reflection on the outcome of the COREPER meetings. The case at the moment is that some COREPER meetings happen on the night, day or morning of a Council meeting, leaving the Minister with little room to manoeuvre or to exercise separate judgment on the issues.</P>
      <P>When I say that the Government is determined that the democratic deficit should be addressed, I mean that there must also be reciprocation. The effort must be made by Members of both Houses. There is no point in Government Ministers and public servants committing to a process in which the effort required to bring matters to the attention of committees of the Houses is not reciprocated by preparation, albeit with expert resources, by Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas. There is no point in a one-sided process where the Minister holds all the cards, the Department knows everything and the House knows little or nothing and only asks questions in a dismal process which is not assisted by adequate research and political intelligence gathered from the drafting process of the European legislative proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ryan raised potential misgivings about the effect of the child abduction provisions. I argue, and the Senator might find the same on closer scrutiny of the proposed regulation, that it has the exact opposite effect of that which he fears. If one gives the courts of the country of origin a <i>prima facie</i> right to make a binding order in respect of a child it means that, for instance, in a family resident in Ireland which has a child here, the person who is left behind, the victim of the abduction, can go to his or her local court as of right and seek a binding order requiring the return to the <i>status quo ante,</i> the court where the child lived. That is more just towards the weaker party than towards the person who went to the <Col N="1922" /> trouble of absconding with the child. That is the fundamental principle. With certain exceptions, it is the court of habitual residence of the child, and presumably the parent who is frequently the mother, which exercises the right to require the child to be returned on a &ldquo;no questions asked&rdquo; basis to that jurisdiction. Where the original abduction took place from becomes the venue where validity of the child's interests is determined.</P>
    <P>Mention was made of the question of legal aid. Applicants who have benefited from complete or partial legal aid, or exemption from costs, in the member state of origin will be entitled under the procedures, if this measure is accepted, to benefit from the most favourable legal aid or the most extensive exemption from costs and expenses provided for under the law of the member state. In effect, there is a built-in entitlement to the best legal aid regime available in the circumstances. There is also a proposal for a framework decision at an early stage in respect of the provision of legal aid in cases of cross-border dispute.</P>
    <P>One of the implications of increased freedom to travel is the increased potential for taking a child from the parent in whose custody he or she should be. We should not say in such cases that we are only concerned with sovereignty issues and should not refuse point blank to recognise the orders of other courts. Injustice is visited on the parent or guardian on whom the surprise abduction is perpetrated, as well as the child. Sovereign states involved in the promotion of freedom to travel owe it to parents, who rely on them to uphold the law, to establish a coherent system whereby a clear set of rules applies when child abductions take place or issues of parental responsibility or access are at stake. Such a system should be understood by all, involve minimal expense and protect adequately the weakest members of society. It should ensure freedom of travel is not abused in order to deny people their rights as parents, whether such rights are constitutional or recognised by natural lawyers. Parents' rights should not be frustrated by the removal of a child from one jurisdiction to another.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators for their thoughtful reflections. I look forward to discussing the points made by Senator Ryan, Senator Henry and others if a committee is established to examine matters such as this. If I am asked to do so, I will make it my business to give to whoever is interested an update on the progress of the negotiations. This is a serious process which will affect the lives of real people. It is not a process with which we should engage in legislation by default. All of us, both in the Executive and the Legislature, have a duty to take a full and active role in the interests of the people of Ireland and other member states. We must address the concerns of ordinary people that far-reaching legal changes, relating to their lives and those of their children, are taking place by stealth or a process which is not the subject of democratic scrutiny.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to come to the Seanad, for the first time as Minister for the Environment and Local Government, to present to the House the Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Performance of Certain Functions) Bill, 2002. When he announced the composition of the new Government on 6 June, the Taoiseach placed strong and renewed focus on environmental sustainability. The fact that he has mandated the Department of the Environment and Local Government with the additional responsibility of protecting our natural heritage and heritage policy generally is consistent with this approach. It is a timely move, particularly in the light of the recent publication of the national heritage plan which my Department will implement, in line with a commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is widespread understanding of what is meant by our national heritage. It includes the natural environment like flora, fauna, wildlife habitats, with the built environment such as monuments, archaeology, streetscapes and more. Heritage is valued by the people not only for its intrinsic value, but also for its economic, cultural and recreational benefits. The recent publication of the first national heritage plan signalled a new and more coherent approach and provides a comprehensive strategy and framework for the protection and management of heritage. The Government policy statement on heritage, contained in the plan, states &ldquo;it is an objective of Government to ensure the protection of our heritage and to promote its enjoyment by all.&rdquo; This underscores the recognition the Government accords to heritage, which is complemented by <Col N="1924" /> transferring responsibility to my Department, which retains its responsibilities for the complementary areas of protection of the environment, the planning system and local government.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate that the Department with responsibility for local government will also take responsibility for heritage matters. Over the past decade the planning process, which is administered by local authorities, has become a central element in the protection of heritage. Amendments to the planning code in recent years, especially the provisions on protected buildings, have seen significant advances in the protection of heritage. The national heritage plan envisages local authorities taking a more proactive role in protecting our heritage, especially in broadening involvement at community level. The planning system is an important instrument for the delivery of sustainable development.</P>
    <P>The division of the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs &ndash; formerly the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands &ndash; for which I will assume responsibility is referred to as Dúchas &ndash; the heritage service. I will also be responsible for general heritage policy. I will use the term Dúchas to avoid any confusion in relation to names and responsibilities being transferred. Dúchas is that part of central government with overall responsibility for preserving the national heritage and promoting public interest in Ireland's rich store of national monuments, protected buildings and ecologically valuable sites. It has developed a body of expertise which has been put at the disposal of local authorities, An Bord Pleanála and the Environmental Protection Agency. Under EU and other international law, Ireland has certain legal obligations to ensure the protection of our natural and built environment. Dúchas and my Department have key roles in meeting these obligations.</P>
    <P>As the pace of development has increased in recent years, the role of Dúchas has become increasingly important. If we are to achieve sustainable development, this role must be carried out in an efficient, open and transparent manner. Senators are aware that Dúchas is involved in the planning and environmental licensing processes in a number of ways. It is a statutory consultee when a local authority is preparing its development plan and has particular responsibility under the Planning and Development Act, 2000, in respect of recommending structures of special architectural interest for protection through the development plan. This function is one that will dovetail with the traditional function of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government in overseeing the development plan process.</P>
    <P>In addition, Dúchas is a statutory consultee in relation to planning applications which may impact upon protected structures, national monuments or other objects of archaeological, geological, scientific, ecological or historical interest, or which may have significant nature conservation effects. Planning applications for the relevant developments are assessed by Dúchas officials <Col N="1925" /> who have specific heritage expertise. It is not practical to expect each planning authority to develop the necessary expertise in these matters, as it is more sensible to have the expertise available centrally. This specialist service provided by Dúchas for local authorities, An Bord Pleanála and the EPA in relation to the protection of our heritage is vital. The purpose of the Bill is to ensure such advice is available from my Department as an input to planning or other licensing processes.</P>
    <P>The Bill will amend the Planning and Development Act, 2000, the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, and the Waste Management Act, 1996, to provide for the performance by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government of the functions transferred from the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, formerly the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. The Bill makes an identical technical amendment to one section in each in these Acts.</P>
    <P>Section 30 of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, precludes the Minister for the Environment and Local Government from exercising any power or control in regard to any particular case with which a planning authority or the board is, or may be, concerned. Similarly, section 79 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, and section 60 of the Waste Management Act, 1996, preclude the Minister from exercising any power or control in regard to the performance, in particular circumstances, by the Environmental Protection Agency or a local authority of the functions assigned to it by those Acts.</P>
    <P>The principle that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government must not intervene in individual cases before An Bord Pleanála was enshrined in the planning code at the time when the board was established and the Minister's functions in determining planning appeals were removed. The Minister was, however, given power to issue general policy directives to the board to which the board must have regard. However, it was specifically provided that he or she could not exercise power or control with regard to individual cases coming before the board. This was intended to underline the independence of the board in dealing with individual appeals while operating within a general policy framework set out by the Minister. This principle regarding An Bord Pleanála was extended to the determination of planning applications by local authorities in 1982 and was restated when the planning code was generally revised and consolidated into the 2000 Act. On the establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency in 1992, and when its functions were extended to include responsibilities with regard to waste management in 1996, the same provision was included in the legislation to ensure the independent operation of the EPA.</P>
    <P>This policy of non-intervention and the legislative restriction on involvement by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government in indi<Col N="1926" /> vidual cases, which all of us would agree has worked well, would not, however, permit the giving by the Department of specialist advice on the natural and built heritage which is such a vital part of the planning and environmental licensing processes. I am advised that in order to permit the continued exercise of the statutory consultative functions with regard to the built and natural heritage in planning and environmental licensing matters which Dúchas has, new legislation is necessary to disapply the above-mentioned sections with regard to the transferred functions only. This is the reason for bringing forward this urgent legislation; otherwise the functions could not have been transferred now or else Dúchas would have to suspend its involvement in planning and environmental licensing until this enabling legislation was passed.</P>
    <P>Section 1 of the Bill replaces section 30 of the Planning and Development Act, 2000. It restates the restriction on the Minister for the Environment and Local Government exercising power or control with regard to any matter that is, or may be, before a planning authority or An Bord Pleanála. However, with regard to the functions transferred to the Minister from the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs by way of the Government order under the Ministers and Secretaries Act, and only to those, the section disapplies the restriction. As a result, specialist advice on wildlife, built heritage and national monuments protection functions will continue to be available to An Bord Pleanála and the local authorities when the functions are transferred to the Department of the Environment and Local Government.</P>
    <P>Section 2 amends section 79 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, which contains a power for the Minister to issue general policy directives to the EPA regarding its environmental licensing functions. Subsection (3) sets out that this power cannot be construed as enabling the Minister to exercise power or control with regard to the exercise of the EPA's functions in particular circumstances. The new subsection (3A) will disapply subsection (3) in so far as it relates to the transferred functions. The same amendment is made in section 60(3) of the Waste Management Act, 1996, which contains a power for the Minister to issue general policy directives to the EPA or local authorities regarding their functions on licensing and managing waste.</P>
    <P>By referring to those powers specifically transferred under the Government order, it clearly delimits the areas where the Minister is empowered to intervene in the planning and environmental licensing processes, that is, to the newly transferred powers. I look forward to assuming the new functions, integrating them within the Department of the Environment and Local Government and giving effect to the Taoiseach's wish for a renewed focus on environmental sustainability. In accordance with the Public Service Management Act, my Department will be preparing a new statement of strategy. This will give us <Col N="1927" /> the opportunity to set out our enhanced goals for this strengthened Department of the Environment and Local Government which we are creating to promote sustainable development and improve the quality of life for all. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>This is a short technical Bill to facilitate the transfer of heritage functions to the Minister's Department. He was kind enough to refer to Dúchas, otherwise matters could get complicated. If this legislation was not brought before the House, Dúchas would not be able to exercise its power with regard to the conservation of our national heritage. I welcome the measure which will allow Dúchas to fulfil its role. I welcome the fact that responsibility with regard to our national heritage, which needs to be strengthened, has been transferred from the former Department to the Minister's Department. Given his role in the Office of Public Works, I believe the Minister will give this matter his full support. Our national heritage will be much improved as a result of the proposals in the legislation. From that point of view I welcome the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and the Minister, Deputy Cullen, to the House. I regret that I am not sitting around the Cabinet table with him. He and I have had a friendship over many years and I have no doubt he will be very successful in the position conferred on him.</P>
      <P>This is one of the Government changes which makes good common sense, even though I do not agree with all of them. The changes make plain common sense in that there was always perceived to be friction between Dúchas and the Department of the Environment and Local Government. This was odd given the title of the Department. There always appeared to be conflict as to how far one could go and how far the other would heed the advice of Dúchas.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that in the modern world in which we live sustainability makes sense. We can build, amend and alter as much as we like but the world is a finite place. Therefore, if we are to preserve all that is good and right about the country, not just for ourselves but for future generations, the work of Dúchas must be allied to the work of the Department of the Environment and Local Government. This makes great common sense and many perceived conflicts will disappear following this merger.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that changes in Departments take time. Civil servants by their nature must move and learn their briefs, likewise the Minister in his new position. However, the speed with which the legislation has been introduced, and the need for Dúchas to begin the integration process within the Department, giving effect to the Taoiseach's <Col N="1928" /> wish for a renewed focus on the environment and sustainability, indicates that they are anxious to move things along and bring about the bonding, to use a cliché, which will be necessary for these two entities to get together. It will never be a fully harmonious relationship but it will be a marriage where good ideas from both sides will merge into what, I hope, will be a better future for sustainability in this country.</P>
    <P>There is a significant responsibility regarding Kyoto. Given that life is so complex and hurried there is an emphasis on getting things done now and wanting things done immediately, and there is, sometimes, a lack of emphasis on the future and what would be a proper future for all of us. This may seem a small step but it is a large step in ensuring the potential conflicts are teased out. Dúchas has built up huge expertise, of which the Minister will be aware, and I have great admiration for its work having come across it on several occasions with regard to local matters. I have always found it to be very far-sighted and to have a sense of mission about its job. Its very nature is that it looks to the past and seeks to preserve it for the future in a proper way.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill. We are all being very brief because some of us are new and some reborn. I welcome what the Minister is doing and wish him luck in his Department. I have no doubt that he will give it the attention and commitment it merits. While this is a purely technical Bill, at the same time it gives words to a vision shared by Dúchas and the Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a technical but very important Bill. As Senator O'Rourke said, it seems very sensible to move Dúchas to the Minister's Department. The Dúchas project is about the sustainability of our habitats, monuments and historic houses, the importance of which we came to recognise very late in the day. Therefore, I wish the Minister the very best of good luck with it.</P>
      <P>Section 3 of the Bill amends section 60 of the Waste Management Act, 1996, which contains a power for the Minister to issue general policy directives to the EPA or local authorities in relation to their functions on licensing and waste management. Given that the Minister described how he looks forward to assuming the new functions, it seems that he has not been reading much about waste management which appears to be a nightmare for those who have to deal with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is one of the hottest issues around and if I were the Minister, I would try to start dealing with it as fast as I could. The former Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, introduced the plastic bag tax which has been an incredible success. There is less litter around and the funniest thing is the general attitude of the public to being seen carrying a plastic bag. Recently I met a male <Col N="1929" /> friend coming from the supermarket who said he felt much the same as if he had been found beating women and children in the street or saying he was in favour of killing whales. I saw two young men coming out of the supermarket the other night, who were obviously having a barbecue or something, and they had two huge packets of minced meat clutched to their chests rather than use a plastic bag. Certainly, the message has hit home.</P>
      <P>I am a great believer in reuse and recycling. The Minister could push such projects more, even within the Houses. Large brown envelopes are reused to a certain extent, but it could be done far more. If we led by example here, it would be of great help. One of my great achievements within the Houses of the Oireachtas was getting recycled paper used in photocopiers. I want to know the reason all speeches are not printed using both sides of the paper. Doing so would cut our use of paper by half. It would be great if the Minister were to bring it forward. I proposed this once before when I congratulated a Minister on coming before the House with his speech printed on both sides of the page. Senator Dan Kiely who spoke after me said he had just been about to complain about the same thing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>While there are differing views, we should try to cut down on the production of waste. Just down the road, Holles Street Hospital made a huge effort in recent months to cut down on hospital waste, which it reduced by 40%. That is unbelievable. When we failed to provide for a toxic waste incinerator some of the pharmaceutical and chemical companies tried doing the same thing and discovered they could reduce the amount of toxic waste they produced dramatically. We have to urge such efforts forward.</P>
      <P>I spoke once before in the House about an article I read a few months ago on children born within 3 km and 7 km of a dump. It was found that chromosomal and non-chromosomal abnormalities were higher in children born within 3 km of a dump than in those born within 7 kms. The dumps in question were of the old style. I refuse to call them anything other than that because that is what they are. We have decided that we will have very expensive landfills. We have a lot of land and while no one wants superdumps near them, landfills are very expensive to put in place. We have to come around to the idea that waste reduction is very important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The glass bottle factory at Ringsend is to close and will not even stay open until 5 July, up to which point it was hoped it would continue to take waste bottles. That is another problem on the Minister's hands. The general public had been influenced to return bottles, 40% of which were being sent for recycling, yet we are now without a facility of our own. I met someone from Quinns, the large bottle factory in Fermanagh, who said their company would be interested in being con<Col N="1930" /> tracted to do the job. All these issues are extraordinarily important and it would be good for the Minister to tackle them at the beginning of his five years in office rather than wait for the end.</P>
    <P>We talk about incinerators as though they are the only things we should discuss, but they are not the whole story. I was filled with admiration for Kilkenny County Council when it organised a &ldquo;real nappy&rdquo; week. Apparently, disposable nappies constitute 4% of household waste, a staggering amount.</P>

      <P>Recycled paper has to be used. At the moment, however, there is nowhere to take paper because people are not using it. We should start here with the Minister ensuring all photocopying paper is recycled, as I believe Cahills does in its production of Order Papers and Bills. It is very important that we in the Houses of the Oireachtas show the way with waste minimisation. If the National Maternity Hospital is leading the way, we should go there to get a few hints as to what can be done, though I am sure the Minister's officials will have plenty ideas of their own.</P>

      <P>The Minister also has responsibility for local government and the environment and it is appropriate that he should bring this short but important technical Bill before us to ensure the provisions which previously applied with regard to the consultative role of Dúchas will continue under his aegis. It is also important to continue the preclusion of the Minister with regard to individual cases adjudicated on by the Environmental Protection Agency and An Bord Pleanála which is well maintained in the Bill.</P>
      <P>I welcome the legislation and agree fully with Senator Henry's comments in relation to waste management and minimisation. A concerted effort by all could significantly reduce the disposal of waste.</P>

      <P>I thank Senators for their good wishes on my appointment. I hope I can live up to their expectations. The Department of the Environment and Local Government is a large Department which deals with a wide range of issues. The addition of the heritage functions and, in particular, Dúchas, will be challenging. I am pleased that the House has universally welcomed the addition of Dúchas and the general heritage policy functions to the remit of the Department and that Senators see it as a good mix. I thank Senator Doyle for his opening remarks and I appreciate his views. He recognises that the Bill is technical in nature but that it is important in the context of future developments. I thank Senator O'Rourke for her nice and warm compliments on my appointment and I wish her well in Seanad Éireann.</P>
      <P>Some Senators referred to the fact that we have moved quickly to bring this Bill before the House which is evidence of my desire, and that of the Department, to integrate these matters as speedily as possible. Senator Henry spoke at much length about the requirements for waste management. I accept her point that it is a challenging issue. We have had much discussion and have made progress and the issues have been well aired. I have strong views on these matters and all Senators were correct in identifying the need for a cultural change and a change of mindset in the domestic sphere and in the business sector. Landfill and recycling of waste are valuable but they will not resolve all the issues. I wish to investigate another element and begin to make some decisions about it. I hope that the leadership being shown on all sides of the House will be forthcoming at local level from all our colleagues in all parties. Councillors have an important leadership role to play in the area of waste management. When people play to the gallery and use misinformation, then our ability to deliver on these important issues becomes more complicated when there is a lack of leadership at local level. I thank Senator Walsh for his welcome and his remarks. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
      <P>I wish all the retiring Senators every success. The words spoken about many of them were well merited. They have made a contribution to public life for many years.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill arises from the judgment in the case entitled Kelly<i> v. </i>the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Ireland and the Attorney General, concerning certain exemptions to election expenditure set out in paragraph 2 of the Schedule to the Electoral Act, 1997. It is a short Bill to provide for an extension of the period for furnishing statements of election expenses to the Standards in Public Office Commission by candidates at the recent general election. The period is being extended for the recent general election only pending the outcome of an appeal to the Supreme Court, following the High Court case to do with the constitutionality of certain exemptions from election expenditure of the services and facilities provided by the Houses of the Oireachtas to outgoing Members.</P>
      <P>The High Court judgment delivered on 16 May 2002 found that part of paragraph 2(<i>a</i>) and paragraph 2(<i>c</i>) of the Schedule to the Electoral Act, 1997, which exempt publicly-funded facilities such as postage, telephone, fax, photocopying, etc, for outgoing Members of Dáil Éireann who are candidates at the Dáil election, for the purposes of election expenditure controls, are invalid, having regard to the provisions of the Constitution. While election expenditure limits do not apply at Seanad elections, the High Court judgment has implications for Members of the Seanad who stood for election to Dáil Éireann, whether successfully or unsuccessfully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matters referred to in part of paragraph 2 (<i>a</i>) are payments, services or facilities provided <Col N="1933" /> to a Member of the Oireachtas, a Member of the European Parliament, the holder of an elective or other public office, a political party or political group and a member of, or delegate to, an international organisation. This exemption was included in the Act as enacted in 1997.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 2(<i>c</i>) was inserted by the Electoral (Amendment) Act, 2001, and provided that &ldquo;any expenses in respect of any property, services or facilities so far as those expenses fall to be met out of public funding&rdquo; would not be regarded as election expenditure.</P>
    <P>The provision of these services was also considered by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges in the last Dáil, following correspondence with the Standards in Public Office Commission. I understand that the Standards in Public Office Commission was also in contact with the Seanad Committee on Procedure and Privileges concerning services and facilities provided to Members of the Seanad.</P>
    <P>These exemptions were intended to cover the cost to outgoing Members of the Oireachtas for their duties as public representatives which do not stop on the dissolution of the Dáil. Indeed, there is a duty on Members to finalise any outstanding business.</P>
    <P>The problem arises from the difficulty in distinguishing parliamentary duties from electioneering at election time. The view was expressed that such matters were so interrelated and intermingled that it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to rigidly separate them. The arguments were made in the High Court and the judgment must be respected. The State has lodged an appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the High Court and in such circumstances I do not wish to restate the arguments or other matters which could arise on appeal.</P>
    <P>It was hoped that an appeal hearing would be held at an early date so that the extension to 90 days of the period for furnishing election expenses statements to the Standards in Public Office Commission would have sufficed but the appeal will not be heard until October. The Bill was amended in the Dáil to extend the 56 day period to 167 days &ndash; 31 October next &ndash; or 21 days following the pronouncement by the Supreme Court of its decision on the appeal, whichever is the longer period. We hope the appeal will be determined early in October.</P>
    <P>The question of election expenditure limits was discussed extensively on a number of occasions both in the last Dáil and the Seanad when the Electoral Act, 1997, was debated. It is not necessary to repeat the debate again except to say that in a democracy political parties and candidates should have an opportunity to present their policies and programmes to the electorate. An appropriate level of expenditure is required to provide against extravagant spending as in the intensive competitive atmosphere of an election parties and candidates can be drawn into a spiral of competitive spending which can serve no real purpose. It is in everyone's interest that expenditure <Col N="1934" /> limits be clear and set at sensible limits which permit the launching of an effective campaign but at the same time will not push the expenditure norms out of reach of small parties and independent candidates.</P>
    <P>The administrative requirements for implementing the Electoral Act, 1997, have become very cumbersome for candidates, political parties and the commission. I intend to review the operation of the Act later in the year with a view to simplifying the procedures and requirements imposed on candidates and political parties. I would welcome any views and suggestions from Senators in this matter. Senator Mackin is general secretary of my party. I would welcome his views, in particular, as well as those of the secretaries general of all political parties, who will have important contributions to make when I undertake the review. This has become almost unworkable for almost everyone, including the commission.</P>
    <P>Section 1 of the Bill provides for the extension of the period for furnishing election expenses statements to the commission by substituting 167 days for 56 days or 21 days after the Supreme Court pronounces on the appeal, whichever is the longest, in subsections (1) and (6) of section 36. Section 2 is a standard provision providing for the Short Title of the Bill, its construction and collective citation.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is simple and straightforward. It extends the time for furnishing election expenses statements to the Standards in Public Office Commission for the recent general election only. The Bill is considered necessary as overspending of the specified expenditure limits could lead to prosecution. Up to the time of the High Court judgment candidates would have been acting in accordance with the legislation as it stood. Section 43(6) of the Electoral Act, 1997, provides that it is a defence to a prosecution to show that a person did not know or could not reasonably have known that he or she incurred election expenses above the specified limit. The agreement of the Director of Public Prosecutions must be obtained to proceed with a prosecution.</P>
    <P>The Government considers that in these circumstances the period for furnishing election expenses statements to the commission should be extended in order that candidates, their election agents, national agents of political parties and the commission will have the relevant matters clarified following the determination of the appeal. No change has been made in the 56 day period for furnishing donation statements by unsuccessful candidates at Dáil or Seanad elections to the commission. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for introducing this Bill, which arises from an action taken by Mr. Desmond Kelly, a candidate for Fianna Fáil in the constituency of Dublin Mid-West in the last general election. He claimed that existing legislation discriminated in favour of candidates who were already Oireachtas Members or MEPs and <Col N="1935" /> his case was heard in the High Court. It is important to remember that judgment was delivered on 16 May on the eve of the general election. The High Court found that paragraphs 2(<i>a</i>) and 2(<i>c</i>) of the Schedule to the Electoral Act, 1997, which exempt publicly funded facilities such as postage, telephone and office accommodation for outgoing Members of the Dáil for the purposes of election expenditure controls, are invalid having regard to the provisions of the Constitution. The judge went on to state no such cap existed on electoral expenses and that such facilities enjoyed by outgoing Members were unfair and discriminatory regarding candidates standing for the first time. This fine judgment of Mr. Justice Liam McKenchie shows the layman the extent to which judges go before making a judgment &ndash; the issues they deal with and the matters they look into.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to comment on the judgment as it is the Government's intention to appeal it to the Supreme Court, but refer to an affidavit submitted on behalf of the applicant by a senior political scientist who argued that incumbents enjoy a built-in advantage over non-incumbents when it comes to competing for votes. He based his argument on a module produced by a colleague of his which studied the results of general elections since 1980 and which concluded that incumbents had a benefit of approximately 1,400 votes over a candidate standing for the first time.</P>

      <P>When the matter goes before the Supreme Court the results of the last general election should be taken into account because many incumbents, particularly from my party, were displaced by people standing for the first time. The incumbents did not seem to have any great advantage.</P>
      <P>The value of postage and telephone facilities as well as office accommodation and so on has been overstated. If an incumbent has an advantage over a candidate standing for the first time, that is due to the work and service the Member has done for his constituents since the previous election.</P>

      <P>The High Court found it impossible to differentiate between electioneering and one's obligations as a Member. This should be <Col N="1936" /> addressed by the review the Minister mentioned, which I welcome.

This should be taken into account in any future legislation dealing with this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mackin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an honour for me, as a party official for over ten years &ndash; an unelected party official, as I was reminded many times by Members of both Houses &ndash; to be here today. I hope my new colleagues are not uneasy about a Mount Street staffer being present in the Upper House. Some party headquarters are among the most unloved institutions in politics, but I hope Members appreciate what a great honour it is for me and my family to participate in the business of the Seanad.</P>
      <P>Wearing my other hat as general secretary of my party, discussing the Electoral Act is opportune because in 65-66 Lower Mount Street, as in other party headquarters, we have spent much time dealing with this legislation from its inception to its application in the recent general election. There was co-operation between the various party headquarters as we collectively tried to unlock some of the mysteries of the Act. While annual returns are already in place and we had dry runs through various by-elections, the recent national campaign was our first chance to see the Act in its full application. Bearing that in mind, I heartily welcome the Minister's commitment today to undertake a full review of the Act's provisions, which is very timely.</P>
      <P>The recent general election saw the first full application of the Act at a national level for which we prepared over a lengthy period of time. It was often a tortuous process as we tried to communicate not just to our candidates and election agents, but also the 3,000 units in our organisation that there had been a very substantial change in the political culture and in the way we campaign. For a large national political party, those difficulties are greater. In that regard I thank the Standards in Public Office Commission for the assistance provided, for attending our seminars and on more than one occasion putting the fear of God into everybody, not least our election agents.</P>
      <P>I thank our election agents and the election agents of all the political parties because they had to carry the burden of implementation of the Act in each of the 42 constituencies. That was no easy task when dealing with organisations and candidates who were not familiar with the Act. Senators will be aware of the stresses, strains and pressures of the campaign. Election agents were at the epicentre of this process and had to work through difficult times to ensure the Act was implemented. In many ways, the election agents of the various parties are the unsung heroes of this process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1937" />The Minister indicated that the purpose of the legislation before us is to allow for an extension of the returns to the Standards in Public Office Commission to allow for, in turn, the appeal to the Supreme Court to take place. The High Court made its judgment on 16 May, the day before polling day. At that point many candidates, successful and unsuccessful, had factored into their budgets that they did not have to take account of the services or provisions allowed for by the Houses of the Oireachtas. Many are now confused as to what will happen from this point onwards. While it is important to make some effort, we must await the Supreme Court judgment and then look at the Minister's review for clarification for election agents, candidates, the parties and those who do not go to the people under a party banner. The current situation only serves to add a layer of confusion to what is already extremely complex legislation. Anyone who believes we know the full impact of the Electoral Act is foolish given the way it impacts on so many of our basic rights as citizens in a democracy. It was almost inevitable that there would be a court challenge to the Electoral Act and there may be others.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil supports the inherent principles behind the Electoral Act, those of transparency in expenditure and limitations on expenditure. On the transparency issue, I do not want to go into the details of all the events. We have gone through a cathartic phase in politics recently. I do not wish to go over that ground except to say there probably remains a need to restore public trust in politics and the value of public life and to take on collectively across the political spectrum the corrosive and unfair cynicism about politics and public life.</P>
    <P>Capping expenditure is an important matter. In terms of the competitive and fruitless expenditure in which candidates and parties get caught, the spiral of expenditure does not lead to benefits for any side. However, in supporting spending limits, those spending limits have to be realistic. Having listened to some commentators on the issue of election expenditure it is clear they do not know the price of a corruboard poster. Some may not even know the price of a pint of milk. Clearly there is much ignorance about the cost of running a campaign. Regardless of whether we like it, we are living in a time of almost perpetual campaigning. The old Lemass dictum that the campaign starts the day after the count has never been more true.</P>
    <P>One of the frustrations my colleagues and I had, and I suspect other parties had, was the occasional wilfully absurd interpretations people tried to put on the Act. At one stage it seemed child care was going to be considered an election expense which was crazy. Nobody could agree that that would be legitimate in any sense of the word. Without going into the minutia of it, one difficulty parties would have had was in the area of cross-canvassing where a candidate produces a <Col N="1938" /> canvass card and, as is right and proper, includes the names of his or her running mates.</P>

      <P>That has to be accounted for in the returns of the other candidates. One is literally reaching a situation where one could end up measuring with a ruler the size of a font on a leaflet when digging up budgets and expenditures. Despite the inherent importance and good intentions behind the Electoral Act, if it serves to generate a quagmire of bureaucracy for candidates and parties, it will devalue itself in time and obscure the real purpose behind it.</P>
      <P>Given that we are post the general election &ndash; many others are still at the height of an election campaign &ndash; and in the process of the appeal to the Supreme Court it is an appropriate time to stand back and take stock of the application of the Act in practice. The Minister's review is welcome. I hope a forum can be found within this House to allow for an open minded debate on the Electoral Act and its implications and its application. My experience of it and that of my colleagues is that it is tending to generate a Kafkaesque style bureaucracy where people may end up measuring the thickness of a corruboard poster or what it costs to laminate a piece of card. I do not think that was the original intention of the Act. The Act is important and represents a significant innovation in terms of how public life is carried out here. There is ample scope for review. Any legislation that underpins how public life is carried out has to be appropriate and proper, but it also has to be practical and sensible in its application.</P>

      <P>Every time we discuss this issue I express reservations. I congratulate the Minister on his elevation and appointment and I know he will do a good job. I look forward to engaging with him during the course of his Ministry. What we have here is a cowardly run before the media <Col N="1939" /> mob, the begrudgers and the politically correct. That is what gave us that legislation. People in both Houses were running over each other to welcome it. The few of us who expressed reservations did so for the reasons we are looking at now.</P>
      <P>I support the Bill and understand the reasons for it. I believe we got this legislation all wrong. We tried to cover every angle and to ensure nobody could question anything. Senator Mackin spoke about the trust of the general membership in the head office of any organisation and having spent ten years running a head office, I know what he is talking about.</P>
      <P>I agree with the points made by previous speakers, including the Minister, on the Standards in Public Office Commission. Its attempts to interpret the Bill were faultless and it understood it from every point of view. It faced an impossible task but it has done its job in a superb manner.</P>
      <P>In one of the electoral Bills there is an entitlement to have the support of an office; Senator Quinn and I have discussed this matter on a number of occasions and I am sure he will make reference to it also. What is an office? An office is not actually defined in the Bill. Is there a difference between an office and a room, or an office and a space? When can a space be called an office? These are common sense questions but in speaking to the Standards in Public Office Commission, it is not a matter of being right. For those of us who are in the position of being open to challenge, we are dead in the water the day after the challenge and nobody will wait around to find out whether &ldquo;office&rdquo; was intended to mean something else.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Mackin's sentiments about child care but it could easily be argued that child care is a cost which should be included because that is the way the Bill is written. I agree it is nonsensical but that is another reason I welcome what the Minister is saying.</P>
      <P>There are people in different parts of the country canvassing for me tonight and there is a cost involved in that. I realise the Standards in Public Office Commission has interpreted this in a very broad way but there are other aspects such as the silly limit on the amount of spending one can do. That is impossible to implement also. There is no limit in regard to Seanad electoral expenses. That came about because of an examination of the panels but our panel, which is very expensive to run, was not examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have long held the view that the simpler the legislation, the more effective and transparent it will be. When this legislation first came before the House, I listened closely to what my colleagues in the Labour Party in particular said about the importance of a spending limit. I understand the arguments in its favour, but proper audited accounts are more important than a limit. People should be able to indicate how every penny was spent and it should be properly aud<Col N="1940" /> ited. That is more important than a limit. People could then see that Senator Joe O'Toole got money from the trade union movement or Senator Shane Ross got money from IBEC, although there is no chance of that happening, and they could make distinctions as to where they were coming from. There is nothing wrong with that. It is open and transparent and people learn a lot from it. The argument in favour of limits would overwhelm my arguments against it. I accept that limits are probably necessary but in some ways they do not work.</P>
    <P>There is a significant difference in regard to the question of incumbency which I know the Minister is aware of but which he did not allude to in his contribution. There is an obligation on outgoing Members to ensure that all their work is brought to closure, even after an election has been called, but those of us in this House continue in full operation until the day of the next general election. We are making a huge judgment on this election. This is the first election of which we had notice. That will never happen again. Those of us who are incumbents can ensure we do our business in such a way that it will not be open to challenge and that raises again the nonsense of this legislation.</P>
    <P>A member of my election campaign team, Austin Corcoran, goes to bed every night with the Standards in Public Office Commission's outline of the requirements for Seanad candidates. His only brief is to ensure compliance at all levels and that expenses are properly audited and presented. That is important. We can all comply with the requirements but in my discussions with Members in the Independent seats, we were more concerned about challenge than non-compliance. We were more concerned about somebody taking us to the High Court on an issue about which we knew we were compliant but on which a strong argument against our position could be made and we might suddenly look like damaged goods. That is what I am most concerned about.</P>
    <P>It would make sense to set up a committee of Members of both Houses to examine the way we do our business because everybody has a clear interest in getting this right. It is not a case of people bouncing off each other. Why not set up a committee made up of five or six Members of the Dáil and three or four Members of the Seanad which could examine the Bill, perhaps with the Minister's officials, and come back with a clear brief? That has to be done by people who have been through it because we must get it right. We will not be told what to do by the media or people who are interested in politically correct language. We want to get this right so that we can say to our constituents and to the voters that this is how we do our business, this is the way we fund it and comply with the law and these are the requirements and regulations under which we work. I would like to see that done as simply and clearly as possible and there should be sensible limits.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1941" />There is a clear understanding by everybody that certain things are impossible to measure. It is a bit like goodwill. Goodwill might appear to be immeasurable until somebody puts a price on it. In the same way somebody could put a price on levels of commitment but it would be madness to try to put a price on a group of people who meet two nights a week or who have given up a half day's work. We need to get away from a situation where we would be open to the question of child care costs or the cost of buying a round of drinks for people who spent three hours knocking on doors.</P>
    <P>I have seen the Minister deal with issues in his last brief and defend the correct decisions in terms of buying the gaff in Phoenix Park, the importance of doing things right and taking a stand on that position. We should ask the people in both Houses what they think and then see if Government can live with the result. The Government will live with whatever comes from professional politicians because of their experience and it could be tested outside these Houses. If we are to win back trust and confidence in the noble profession of public representation and political life, we are the ones to do that.</P>
    <P>I have long opposed the idea of having an outsider coming in and running the roost in terms of how we do our business, as happened in Westminster, but that will happen if we are not seen to do our business properly. We need to have a proper enforcement procedure in the Houses to take strong action against Members of both Houses who step out of line and we must be seen to do that in a non-party way and in a way that people outside these Houses understand.</P>
    <P>I support the Bill and welcome the Minister's commitment to have a review of it. I ask that he would do that in the context of the Committees on Procedure and Privileges of both Houses which might put together a joint committee to examine it thoroughly to see if different arrangements are needed for the Dáil and the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with much of what Senator Mackin and Senator O'Toole said. When the primary legislation was debated in the House, I said somebody would innocently get into difficulty under its provisions. Unfortunately, I still believe that will be the case. It is important that the democratic system is vigorously competitive, accessible and open to those to promote themselves as suitable candidates for election. It is difficult to argue with the High Court decision regarding a level playing pitch for non-sitting candidates and sitting Members. Those of us who have contested elections during the years will agree that incumbency confers an advantage, for example, through name recognition. Therefore, it is important that people can promote themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree with Senator O'Toole that there is a necessity for expenditure limits. That issue should be examined in a review of the legislation. The amount spent on election campaigns by candidates during the years has not been excessive <Col N="1942" /> because money has not been available. However, during the recent campaign candidates called to houses to collect canvass cards to make sure they would not exceed the expenditure limits. That is not good for democracy. Candidates running within the party system must allocate a proportion of their election allowance to the party. I question the wisdom of this provision. I am not convinced about the argument in favour of expenditure limits, but if they are implemented, they should be of a magnitude that does not cause difficulties for candidates genuinely trying to promote themselves through printing extra posters or canvass cards.</P>
    <P>In the current environment more and more people are becoming detached from the electoral system and the democratic process, which is a danger to democracy. Local authority members in Britain say the maximum turnout percentage they expect in elections is in the low 20s. That is unrepresentative of society. We should examine this significant problem in our electoral system in order that people can be encouraged to vote and turnout will increase. The razzmatazz associated with elections, which is generated through expenditure of funds under the Act, generates interest and promotes the importance of democracy. Expenditure limits should facilitate such promotion rather than doing the contrary.</P>
    <P>A strong distinction must be made between expenditure limits, on the one hand, and the disclosure of donations, on the other. It is absolutely imperative that donations should be publicised and transparent because this ensures people are accountable in our democratic system. Where the sources of funding have not been revealed, flaws have appeared in the system.</P>
    <P>I refer to the provision in the Bill to file returns 21 days after a decision on an appeal by the Supreme Court. Is that sufficient time? An individual can prepare his or her accounts and so on, but he or she could be away on holidays. Given that it is not predictable when the decision will be made by the court, this issue should be examined. These provisions are so technical that individuals could innocently contravene them, which is not the intention of the Houses. Perhaps the Minister will examine this provision and extend the time limit to ensure nobody gets caught out because they are away when the Supreme Court announces its decision. I concur with the support for the legislation, which is essential for our democratic system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and congratulate him on his elevation. I wish him well for the future. I also welcome Senator Mackin, whose maiden contribution was well researched and presented and knowledgeable. I have no doubt he will make a great contribution to the House. I also wish him well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Toole referred to the possibility of a review of the legislation in the future given the experiences during the general election campaign and the potential problems during the upcoming <Col N="1943" /> Seanad election. There are so many holes in the primary legislation that things will get through and no matter how many are plugged, more will appear.</P>
    <P>For example, Senator Mackin refers to the expenditure incurred by a candidate who uses a child minder while he or she is campaigning and asks whether that must be declared as expenditure. If a candidate wanted to change his name to Joe Abba in order that his name would be at the top of the ballot paper, should that be included as expenditure given that it would provide him with an electoral advantage? However, the incumbents are the net beneficiaries of the legislation and are at an advantage at the beginning of an election campaign. My colleague, Senator Doyle, pointed out that research had been conducted which indicated that incumbents received approximately 1,400 votes by virtue of being the sitting candidate.</P>
    <P>Under our system, an incumbent has five years to promote himself or herself. However, a candidate's work over the years determines whether he or she is elected, not his or her expenditure on posters and so on. Many candidates decide not to promote themselves but instead spend a number of years knocking on doors to make themselves known to the public. A number of new Members in the Lower House were elected as a result of such hard work. That is how one can be elected or re-elected.</P>
    <P>I refer to the application of the legislation to this House. I was nominated by the General Council of County Councils. My duty and responsibility, therefore, are to the members of that body. I must continually write to the members to keep them up to date with developments. If the legislation was applied to Senators, it is possible that I would have to cease writing letters and fail in my duty and responsibility to update councillors. I do not canvass for votes in these letters, but because my name is on every letter, it may be perceived that I am at an advantage in comparison to other candidates.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers referred to potential flaws in the legislation. It is impossible to draft a watertight Bill. I ask the Minister to consult Members of both Houses through a joint committee, as Senator O'Toole proposed, in order that a Bill is drafted that cannot be contravened by candidates by chance or through ignorance, which is totally unfair. The legislation could be less technical. I know of a number of people who were more confused having read it. It should provide for a simpler system in order that candidates do not find themselves before the courts because of a simple error. We do not object to the Bill which we commend to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. He proved to us during the previous Administration when he wore a different hat that he was prepared to meet challenges. I am sure he will do the same in his new brief. It was a joy to <Col N="1944" /> listen to Senator Mackin's maiden speech as he exhibited great determination and knowledge about this topic. The legislation reveals a fundamental flaw in our parliamentary system and, even worse, in us, as legislators. We should have foreseen this problem. This legislation passed through both Houses and none of us noticed this potential difficulty. If we had asked the relevant question, we would have seen the problem.</P>
      <P>Senator Doyle is not correct. One is at a fundamental advantage if one has a seat and is able to use the benefits that entails. It was likely that the legislation would be challenged in court on this issue and we did not notice. Shame on us. We all have to say, &ldquo;<i>Mea culpa</i>&rdquo;. We did not succeed with it.</P>
      <P>Now that we have a chance to re-examine this, I accept entirely Senator O'Toole's suggestion to the Minister that he convene a small group from both Houses and says to it: &ldquo;Let us have open ears, let us hear what you have to say and let us come up with a solution to this.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I have some difficulty with some of the suggestions which have been made during this debate. On the question of spending limits, I listened carefully to the comments of Senator Walsh, but I also remember what happened in the case of Ross Perot, one of the wealthiest men in America. I cannot remember the figures but he spent huge sums to run a big campaign. A second example is Mayor Bloomberg of New York, but I cannot remember the figures in his case. They did not have to accept any donations as they were wealthy enough to use their own funds.</P>
      <P>The balance of the Bill was reasonably well thought out as to the objectives. If there is no limit, a very wealthy person, in American history, can buy votes with large sums of money. Disclosure does not solve this because someone who is wealthy does not have to disclose the amount of money he or she has spent. It is worthwhile considering that point.</P>
      <P>I wish to move on to the other topic which focuses upon a more fundamental crisis we face &ndash; the outrageously low turnout, not just in recent elections, but going back 18, 20 or 30 years. There has been a significant drop in the number of people voting in general elections. One only has to examine the excuses offered and the statements made after the Nice referendum vote. It was suggested that this was not a fair comparison because only a third of the electorate voted in the referendum. What would happen if only a third of the electorate voted in general elections? How could any Government stand up and claim a mandate to hold its authority? This issue threatens the survival of our parliamentary system so we have to do something to ensure that people vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would suggest one action in this regard which I know the Minister would wish to grab. We have gone to great pains to ensure that personation does not take place and, consequently, we have made it difficult to register for elections. Is there is a possibility that those we have deterred from voting outnumber those who might have person<Col N="1945" /> ated had we not done so? If people want to register to vote they have to go to a Garda station, provide photographs, identification and so on. This seems to inhibit a large number of people who might otherwise have voted. Maybe we are making it too difficult in some cases for people to register.</P>
    <P>I wish to place this issue in the context of the Seanad, and, in particular, the election for the university seats. One might have views on what they should be and what we should do about them. However, there is a significant difficulty in that a large number of people who should be entitled to vote are not registered because we do not have a supplementary register for that election. One does not vote if one is not registered before February of the year in which the election takes place. Those of us who are candidates in that election know of a large number of people who say: &ldquo;I graduated ten, 20 or 30 years ago. How do I go about registering?&rdquo; In reply we state: &ldquo;Sorry, too late, you cannot do it.&rdquo; Therefore, we have also disenfranchised such people. We have to, and can, do something about this issue.</P>
    <P>As regards the Dáil election there is, at least, a supplementary register which can be added to. We do not have that facility regarding the Seanad election and, therefore, there is a serious danger that we are weakening our opportunities to do what we can to ensure that the Oireachtas is better recognised and appreciated. We have only ourselves to blame for low turnouts, whether in elections to the Dáil or Seanad, because we have not made it attractive enough for people to vote.</P>
    <P>Some colleagues take the trouble to hand out application forms for registration when people receive a degree in our particular case. I am not sure if that happens in Trinity, but I gather that one can register as one walks down with one's cap and gown. It does not happen in NUI. To the best of my knowledge one is sent something in the post and one is not registered if one does not return it. There are many things we can do.</P>
    <P>Let us talk about the university seats in this Seanad election. We passed an amendment to the Constitution in, I think, 1979 enfranchising those who are in DCU and the University of Limerick, but we have still not passed the legislation to give effect to that amendment. We have also examined the constitutional changes that can take place, regarding which a great deal of work has been done. I urge the Minister to do something about this issue.</P>
    <P>Before the general election, we discussed in this House the seventh report of the Oireachtas All-Party Committee on the Constitution. That report made radical suggestions as to how a future Seanad might be elected. I am on record as an enthusiastic supporter of those proposals which were a breath of fresh air. I hope that during the lifetime of this new Dáil, the Minister will grab hold of this issue and ensure that these proposals are put into effect. Whatever about that, there is no excuse for doing nothing to clear up <Col N="1946" /> the current system. We have a Minister who has come in like a breath of fresh air to do something in this particular case. This debate gives us the chance to initiate this process and to see if something can be done. I urge the Minister to accept Senator O'Toole's recommendation that we move on this issue, that we get the views of Members of both Houses and see if we can come up with a better system as regards this interesting debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>One should never put it past the Department of the Environment and Local Government to deliver on time. I welcome the contributions of Senators during this debate which has been refreshing and good. The knowledge, quality and different perspectives that have been brought to bear on the debate have certainly shed light on the issue of the Act and how it has been &ldquo;operating.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I join Senators in congratulating Senator Mackin and applaud his appointment to this Chamber. I agree with his comments because one's first day as a Member of either House is a special occasion. The point was well made by the Senator.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Bill, I think everybody has accepted it and the technical necessity for it, so I will leave it to one side. I specifically wished to prompt a debate by my Second Stage speech and signalled clearly to Members of this House, as I did in the Dáil last night, that there is no doubt that we need a full and major review of the Electoral Acts. That goes without saying. For those who were not here when I spoke, I also mentioned Senator Mackin's role as secretary general of the Fianna Fáil Party. I went beyond that and said I hoped to talk to the secretary general of each political party. The perspectives of Members are important, as are those of people who fought the elections to the Dáil or Seanad. Equally, however, I am sure that those who had to try to administer the structure of the Electoral Act from within the party or independent structures, their supporters and election agents have much to contribute to this debate.</P>
      <P>While I take on board Senator O'Toole's comments with regard to committees of both Houses and, perhaps, using the Committee on Procedure and Privileges as a method of doing that, I do not wish to commit to anything specific at this stage. However, Members can be assured that it is my intention to directly involve, in whatever methodology I can find, the Members of both Houses. However, there is a wider view that I wish to take into account also, which I have outlined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1947" />One of the things that struck me about the difficulties all outgoing Members faced with regard to the particular judgment &ndash; and I do not wish to get into making arguments, it is not my role on this occasion as the matter is before the Supreme Court &ndash; but, as an aside, when one looks at outgoing Members who fought in the election, one would think that anyone who fought the election who was not a Member of either House must have been living in a field for the three weeks and had no access to phones, offices or technology of any sort. I am sure that, in many cases, those facilities were provided by their companies or whatever.</P>
    <P>A range of issues has emerged regarding the specifics of the electoral legislation. My instinct, and it seems to be that of the Senators, is that the simplest way is often the best. We do not need a tome of discussion, debate or intricate analysis. I could nearly write the new electoral Bill on the back of a match box because there are only a few, simple key points which will cover what everyone does. There must be transparency and accountability and the public must understand what goes on. We can achieve that without the morass of complication that has arisen. The original legislation was passed in good faith in 1997, but it was reactive and there was no dissenting voice in either House. I was a Member of the Dáil at that time and was party to it. It proves the point that reactive legislation is often poor.</P>
    <P>Interesting points were made about limits really meaning accountability in terms of providing accounts and the way in which one conducts the business. There were interesting ideas on the way forward and what we are trying to achieve. I would wrest back something from the moral arbiters of today's society for the politicians, to which many speakers also referred. Politicians must do a lot on trust and are expected to act in good faith and all do so today. It is like playing golf alone when no one else is there to see that one obeys the rules; a person is on his or her honour. No matter what parameters of behaviour are set, there must be an element of trust, which can be judged transparently by the public or anyone else who wants to examine an election campaign or any aspect of public life. There is no need to set complicated parameters in which neither participants nor guardians can operate. I referred to the Standards in Public Office Commission, which was given an impossible task interpreting the legislation, but manfully tried to do so. This evening all Deputies, and I presume Senators also, were issued with a letter from the Oireachtas requesting a breakdown on a unit cost basis of office space, secretaries and possibly even square footage so as to put a monetary value on these facilities. That was never the intention of those who formulated the legislation.</P>
    <P>Senator Walsh referred to the 21 days. It is open to anyone to submit their returns at anytime once the election is over. I am not suggesting that people do nothing until the 21 days after the <Col N="1948" /> Supreme Court finding is up. People should collect all the details now that the commission needs. Then a decision can be made based on the Supreme Court judgment so that people can adjust their accounts accordingly. It is 167 days at least, which is more than enough time to get the accounts sorted out.</P>
    <P>I thank the Chair and all the Senators for their contributions. It will be an interesting debate and I am determined to involve all the Members of both Houses through the appropriate mechanism. My message is that the simplest way is the best. We do not need to complicate matters through months of analysis. We need to establish the parameters so that the commission is not an external police force but that trust is placed in the individual to make the returns. We will all be winners, including the public, if it is clear and simple.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House on the first occasion since his appointment on which I congratulate him. I hope that, God and the Trinity College electorate willing, I will be back here to discuss other topics with him.</P>
      <P>I was at a function in Wicklow recently at which another guest collapsed and there was a call to see if a doctor was present. I came forward to give medical assistance but in such circumstances, a doctor can do little more than anyone else with first aid experience so I sought an ambulance which came within 17 minutes from Arklow. That was an exceptional time, but it was even better that the two ambulance crew were very efficient and well equipped. The status of ambulance workers has changed considerably and they are now referred to as emergency medical technicians while the ambulances have very good equipment, particularly cardiac equipment.</P>
      <P>Soon my short-term patient was taken to hospital where he recovered. It occurred to me that he may have required drugs and at present the legislation does not cover such emergency medical technicians giving drugs to patients even though they are highly trained. This is important for patients throughout the country but it is causing confusion in Border areas because in Northern Ireland medical technicians are allowed to give drugs. As the Minister of State is aware, we are trying to encourage co-operation in cross-Border activities, particularly emergency services. It is wasteful and hard on patients if personnel cannot respond to the nearest emergency. For example, Craigavon could cover parts of County Monaghan if that was better than waiting for an ambulance to arrive from Drogheda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1949" />I contacted the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council to get its views on this matter. It stated there was a great will for team effort in caring for patients and that the medical profession did not require the person concerned to come to hospital before anything happened to him or her. It also stated everyone on the medical advisory board to the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council was in favour of increasing the role of emergency medical technicians, EMTs. They included emergency medical specialists and general practitioners. The council believed it was appropriate that drugs should be given by the people concerned under strict protocols.</P>
    <P>The types of drugs about which I am talking are: glucagon for a person in a diabetic coma; glucose, intramuscularly or intravenously, if that is what is required; glyceryltrinitrate under the tongue for a person with angina; hydrocortisone which may be needed in many types of instances; morphine sulphate if a person has a very bad pain; salbutamol for a person with asthma which is given through a nebuliser; and possibly the most important currently, because of the emphasis put on trying to improve coronary care, the giving of thrombolytic drugs which break down clots intravenously as soon as possible to someone whom the technicians know has had a coronary because of what they can see on the electrocardiographs they are taking.</P>
    <P>It is extremely important for patient care that this legislation should be brought forward. EMTs are not included in current legislation and regulations on the administration of medications. It is imperative to address this. This was highlighted in reports such as Building Healthier Hearts, 1999, and by Dr. Emer Shelley, the chief heart adviser from the Department of Health and Children who has spoken publicly about the need to change the legislation.</P>
    <P>The construction of the Misuse of Drugs Regulations, 1998, would probably allow the administration of controlled substances, including narcotics such as morphine by EMTs, whereas the Medical Products (Prescription and Control of Supply) Regulations, 1996, cannot be interpreted to allow the administration of nitrous oxide gas used for pain relief or glyceryltrinitrate to be given under the tongue for angina. Thus, all public sector and many private sector EMTs in Ireland are currently in an uncertain position regarding the administration of medications.</P>
    <P>The Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council has developed within its medical advisory group and clinical care committees a collaborative practice framework that could be implemented by amendment with proposed clauses of exemption that would ratify current medical practice of EMTs; ratify practice of other pre-hositpal care personnel, for example, mountain rescue services; and ratify proposed additional authorisations required by EMTs.</P>
    <P>The clauses of exemption may be as simple as the following. On page 5 of the Misuse of Drugs Regulations, 1998, under the heading &ldquo;Admin<Col N="1950" /> istration&rdquo; and in respect of Article 4 (1)(<i>b</i>), the following could be added: &ldquo;The holder of a national qualification EMT certificate can administer to a patient in accordance with the directions of a registered medical practitioner or standard operational procedures and protocols approved by the Minister on the recommendation of the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council.&rdquo; On page 15 of the Medicinal Products (Prescription and Control) Regulations, 1996, under section 2 which states &ldquo;The provisions of articles 5 and 6 of these regulations shall not apply as respects&rdquo; the following could be added: &ldquo;(<i>d</i>) the supply of medicinal product to the holder of a national qualification EMT certificate for use in accordance with (i) the directions of a registered medical practitioner or (ii) standard operational procedures and protocols approved by the Minister on the recommendation of the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council.&rdquo; The format and terminology of the draft clauses are entirely consistent with the existing regulations and Statutory Instrument No. 109 of 2000 establishing the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council. I suggest this legislation should be brought forward as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I thank the Senator for giving me the opportunity to clarify the position on emergency medical technicians administering drugs to patients. By way of putting this matter in context, I point out that Government policy on the development of emergency services in Ireland is set out in a number of key documents, including the report of the review group on the ambulance services; the cardiovascular health strategy, Building Healthier Hearts published in 1999; and the recently published strategic review of the ambulance service, 2001, which was undertaken by the chief executive officers of the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1951" />Considerable progress has been made in the development of the ambulance service in recent years. Funding in excess of &euro;57 million has been provided since 1993 which has facilitated developments in such areas as improvement in the fleet replacement programme; upgrading of communications equipment; upgrading of equipment in ambulances; training existing and new staff in the new EMT training programme; and the phasing in of the elimination of on-call.</P>
    <P>It is the intention of the Minister to build on the progress made to date. In this regard, the recommendations contained in the strategic review of the ambulance service will form the basis for the future development of the service. The review's recommendations fall under a number of key headings, including improved national co-ordination and direction; separation of patient transport service from emergency medical service; elimination of on-call from emergency rosters and implementation of other measures also identified to improve response times; reduction in the number of control centres and the introduction of standardised despatch systems on a national basis; development of an integrated ambulance service for the Eastern Regional Health Authority region; strengthening of clinical direction and audit; and continued emphasis on staff training and development, including the introduction of the EMT-A programme. I am pleased to inform the Senator that development funding of approximately &euro;3.8 million was pro<Col N="1952" /> vided to facilitate the implementation of the review's recommendations in the current year.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Senator is aware of the establishment in 2000 of the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council, the primary function of which is to develop appropriate standards in pre-hospital care. The council has responsibility for the development of professional and performance standards for ambulance services and personnel. It also has responsibility for the accreditation of institutions providing training for emergency medical technicians.</P>
    <P>In line with its responsibilities in the area of training, the council has developed proposals in regard to the creation of an emergency medical technician-advanced, EMT-A, training programme. Regulatory change will be required to permit EMT-As to administer medications. Discussions are taking place between the council and the Department of Health and Children to identify any necessary amendments required.</P>
    <P>The Government will continue to pursue a policy of investment aimed at improving key aspects of the emergency medical service to ensure those calling on the service continue to receive timely and appropriate care. The Minister is committed to the further development of this vital service in the context of the recommendations of the 1993 report and the recently published strategic review, with the continuation of the implementation of the cardiovascular health strategy.</P>
