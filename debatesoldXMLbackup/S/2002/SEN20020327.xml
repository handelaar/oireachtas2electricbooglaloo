      <P>I have received notice from Senator O'Meara that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to expedite the building and refurbishment programme at Littleton national school, Thurles, County Tipperary, and to ensure that the additional teacher assigned to the school last year is retained for the coming year as this school is in a disadvantaged area.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Connor of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to refurbish the O'Conor Don national school, Cloobonniffe, Castlerea, County Roscommon.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is No. 1, motion re Friendly Societies (Amendment) Regulations, 2002, to be taken without debate; No. 2, Road Traffic Bill, 2001 &ndash; Committee and Remaining Stages; No. 3, Arramara Teoranta (Acquisition of Shares) Bill, 2001 (<i>Certified Money Bill</i>) &ndash; All Stages, with the contributions of spokespersons on Second Stage not to exceed 12 minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed eight minutes and Senators may share time; No. 4, Gas (Interim) (Regulation) Bill, 2001 [<i>Seanad Bill amended by the Dáil</i>] &ndash; Report and Final Stages; No. 5, Immigration Bill, 2002 &ndash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage, with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes and Senators may share time; No. 6, Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill, 2002 &ndash; Committee and Remaining Stages; <Col N="1254" /> and No. 7, statements on Campus Ireland, to be taken between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m., with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed ten minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed eight minutes and Senators may share time.

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I indicated on the Order of Business yesterday that I realised this was not a normal time and, as Leader of the Fine Gael group, I would do everything I could to be reasonable, even though the amount of business proposed and the way in which we are being asked to do it is something to which I would object strongly in other circumstances.</P>
      <P>I cannot agree to today's Order of Business. I cannot agree specifically to taking No. 6. Second Stage of this Bill, which was published yesterday, took place last evening and we are being asked to take remaining Stages today. I believe it is the intention of the Minister to try to get all five Stages through the other House tomorrow, which is a matter for that House.</P>
      <P>It is very clear that while the intentions in the Bill are good it is deeply flawed. Already all the major organisations involved have complained about the lack of consultation and serious deficiencies in the Bill. It is clear it requires time and detailed committee work. This subject matter has ended up in the courts in major constitutional cases on a number of occasions. It is certain that if the Bill goes through as it is now it too will end up in the courts. Some of the groups involved have already indicated they will go to the courts because of their concerns about certain provisions.</P>
      <P>This is an important Bill. It is no way to do business to rush through a Bill like this, including 40 sections of very complex subject matter, absolutely pregnant with the possibility of legal challenge, as is being proposed. There is no time for reflection, consultation or to table proper amendments. Published only yesterday, if the Leader has his way, which he will, it will be out of the House by this evening.</P>
      <P>We will be opposing the Order of Business and the taking of No. 6. In the words of Senator O'Toole, the Government may very well find this Bill will prove to be a time bomb because of the way in which it is being rushed through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business yesterday morning we indicated on this side of the House our inclination to be as helpful and co-operative as possible with the remaining business of the House. We discussed this with the Leader and indicated that we would be prepared to meet next week, if necessary, to deal with business in order that matters could be given proper and due process. I do not blame the Leader in this regard because I understand the decision was made elsewhere. However, we have to order our own business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1255" />What we are doing by railroading this legislation through shows a cynical disregard for the rights of people with disability. I appeal to the Leader to go back to the Government on this matter. It should not be on the Order of Business today. By shoving this through we are alienating the people to whom we are trying to reach out. It is parliamentary practice going backwards and bad political thinking. It has succeeded in alienating every group.</P>
    <P>There is something wrong with this Bill which has not involved any co-operative or partnership approach. It will cause more difficulties. The Bill set out to do good and has objectives with which we all agree, but it needs a detailed Committee Stage to address the issues in it. I am asking for that. Last night we finished late with this and had to rush through amendments. It is unfair on Members that they should have to try to deal with this complex legislation without a detailed Committee Stage and without time to consult and talk with people. It is wrong. I am opposed to it and cannot co-operate with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Manning and Senator O'Toole. Yesterday, we raised the issue of the amount of legislation going through when there were four substantial Bills to be dealt with as well as motions. Of all legislation this particular issue, special education and the rights of people in relation to education and training, has been the subject of public controversy and has been an issue in the courts. We are all concerned about it and Senators have been lobbied about it. We want to get it right. The ill-fated legislation that had to be withdrawn recently indicates that people with disabilities and the groups representing them will not sit idly by until it is right.</P>
      <P>There are good things in this legislation but the process is wrong. It is good that it is going through this House first, but it should be respected and Senators should be given the opportunity to discuss it and put forward the amendments required. Unfortunately, I was unable to speak on the Bill last night because I could not be here but there are a number of issues I want addressed through amendments. I cannot see how we can deal adequately with the Bill and push it through all Stages today. We need to consult with the groups and representatives who want a role in ensuring that the legislation is the best possible for the people they represent, the most vulnerable in the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator O'Toole concerning the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill. It is a shame the debate took place so late yesterday and that there was no coverage of it. It was the most important debate of the day and serious issues were raised. The public should have been informed of what lay beneath the surface of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1256" />Yesterday, I raised the question of Irish aid to Uganda. The Leader indicated he would have a foreign affairs debate where this could be a central issue. The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell, stands behind government to government aid but I think she is badly advised. She acknowledged there was a degree of corruption, spoke of the accountability to both Houses and indicated that she was in receipt of a report from Deloitte &amp; Touche. In the light of the accountability to which she referred, the report she has received and recent events in Uganda, it is urgent that the Minister come to the House to explain and give an account of the government to government aid with which this country is involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to add my voice to that of previous speakers in regard to the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill, 2002. Will the Leader remind Government that its U-turn on the Disability Bill, because it had not examined it properly, was as a result of the intervention of the national disability association? These same people want an input to this Bill and they want the time for that. This pushing through of legislation is bad and will result in another challenge. It is ridiculous that we are here today knowing that will happen. It is not the Leader's fault, but will he ask the Government to reconsider and allow proper and full debate on Committee Stage of the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I support my colleagues in objecting to the way this Bill is being processed. I accept this process is not the Leader's fault but we should have learned a lesson as a result of what happened with the Disability Bill. The issue needs to be addressed urgently but unless people concerned are directly involved we will not have the type of legislation people with disability want and need. We must deal with this legislation in a more considered way so that the needs of people with disabilities are properly addressed and their voice is heard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I too agree with the points made by my colleagues. The Leader often said that we would not behave in this manner. Was it just lip service when the House stated that it would not order business this way? Have we now, because of some exigency, decided to abandon all good practice? We saw yesterday what happened in another area when good practice was abandoned. The House should not behave like this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to add to the Order of Business that business will resume after 8 p.m. after No. 7, statements on Campus Ireland, for which Fianna Fáil has forgone its Private Members' time in response to Members following the Attorney General's report yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the concerns of Senators Manning, O'Toole, Costello, Norris, Keogh and Coghlan on <Col N="1257" /> No. 6, there will be no time constraints in relation to Committee and Report Stage as has been the practice for the past five years. People can express their views and the legislation will not be rushed through. It is an important Bill and has been requested on many occasions here over the last three years.</P>
    <P>I thank the leaders and the Whips for their understanding and co-operation this week, when we are in the wind-down to the general election, in regard to the various Bills to be processed and put before the House. This House has had about 400 Bills before it in the last five years, 61 of which were initiated here. This is one of those Bills and I take Senators' views on it into account. We are having a meeting of leaders and Whips this morning to discuss the remainder of business and to get views in relation to tomorrow's business. It looks as if we will sit on Thursday next week. Be that as it may, we will see how we can make progress. I have been asked to order the Remaining Stages of this Bill and that is how it is and must remain on the Order of Business.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1258" />I take serious account of the views expressed this morning. We all want to be associated with doing the right thing at the right time. We welcome this long awaited Bill and want to ensure everything contained in it is proper and right. I fully agree with the sentiments expressed.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris has again called on the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of State at that Department to address the issue of Government aid. As Senators know, the Government is one of the world leaders in terms of contributions, as a percentage of GDP, to Third World countries for which all parties can take credit as well as for the ambitious targets we have set ourselves for the future which I hope will be achieved. I will pass the Senator's request to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and, if we sit next Thursday, I will see if time can be made available to have the matter debated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 8, before section 8, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;8.&ndash;The Principal Act is amended by the insertion of the following section after section 11;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1259" />&lsquo;11A.&ndash;Without prejudice to section 11 of this Act, a person shall, when using windscreen wipers, drive a vehicle in a public place with the dip head lamp illuminated.'.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the Minister has already dealt with this amendment in the Lower House, but I had hoped that by the time the Bill reached this House he might have seen the light, so to speak. There is no doubt that one obvious way to reduce the number of traffic accidents is for people and vehicles to be more visible. Cyclists make sure they wear reflective clothing and have proper lights on their bicycles. It would seem reasonable that a country such as ours, in which there is a long twilight period in addition to inclement weather, should follow the example of some Nordic states where drivers of motor vehicles are obliged to use dipped headlights day and night. A number of car manufacturers have produced vehicles for the northern climes, the lights on which work automatically once the ignition is switched on. This has been done by order of some Nordic Governments. Amendments Nos. 1, 2 and 11, to the Schedule, deal with this matter and are both reasonable and sensible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Given our climate and looking out the window today, there would appear to be no need to have headlights on. We tried this in the case of the vehicles of Wexford County Council, but it was discontinued. However, the Senator may have a point where twilight is concerned where some do not turn on their lights as early as they should. While that is certainly hazardous, it may have to be dealt with separately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Like every simple proposal made in the area of road safety, there are two sides to it. It was subject to detailed debate on Committee and Report Stages in the other House. This is a complex issue, although it appears simple and straightforward and everyone's immediate reaction would be that it sounds like a good idea to make people more visible. Despite the fact that it has been given detailed consideration over a long period, the European Commission has been unable to adopt a definitive position on it. It has recognised the importance of the issue by including daytime running lights, DRL, as a road safety priority to be progressed at EU level. I have no doubt this will lead to further significant debate on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The messages and signals from international research literature are mixed. There are different perceptions as to the effectiveness of the measure. The lack of empirical support on the impact of daytime running lights creates significant difficulties in assessing its potential effects in this country. At the heart of the discussion is that, while daytime running lights can have certain safety benefits which the Senator outlined and no one would dispute, there is a converse problem <Col N="1260" /> that it could lead to additional deaths and injuries for more vulnerable road users, such as pedestrians and cyclists, because they are relatively less visible when vehicles use daytime running lights. By making cars more visible, there is a danger, according to research, of making others less visible during daytime.</P>
    <P>As well as this, the Motorcyclists Action Group firmly opposes the introduction of daytime running lights on a mandatory basis for all vehicles. It believes such an arrangement would reduce the benefits of its many members voluntarily using daytime running lights on their motorcycles. There is some evidence to support the group's contention that, if everyone uses daytime running lights, motorcyclists will become less visible.</P>
    <P>I accept the spirit of the amendment and it is not something I would dismiss. To determine whether there is a basis for establishing a definitive position on it in this country, Dublin City Council with the support of the road safety high level group is finalising its arrangements for a pilot programme on daytime running lights. It will carry out an assessment of its effects on safety which it will use to inform decisions on whether a statutory basis would be appropriate. For this reason, while I accept the spirit of the amendments and it is something which must be considered carefully, it would not be prudent to include them in the Bill. If specific positive proposals emerge as a result of the research work and discussion being progressed both at EU level and here, we will revisit the issue. Adequate legislative powers are available under the Road Traffic Acts to address it. An amendment is unnecessary. For this reason, having highlighted the issue, I ask the Senator to withdraw the amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a slight distinction between amendment Nos. 1 and 2. Amendment No. 1 relates to the continuous use of daytime running lights whereas amendment No. 2 relates to using them in inclement weather or when it is raining. A number of cars are sensitive to rain and automatically turn on the wipers. It should be possible for daytime running lights to be turned on automatically at the same time. The Minister has the advantage of being driven, but those of us who must drive ourselves will be aware that trucks which do not use skirts in inclement weather are one of the greatest dangers on the road. This is a hobby horse of mine and, if I had my way, they would be obliged to use skirts down the side panels as well as the back. In inclement weather a truck driver cannot see a car overtaking if it does not have its lights turned on until it is halfway up alongside the truck. If the lights were to come on automatically at the same time as the wipers were turned on, it would increase visibility and reduce the danger.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This would deal with the difficulty to which the Minister referred whereby some people become less visible as a result of certain vehicles becoming more visible. I understand this in the case of <Col N="1261" /> motorcyclists. It is good to be able to see the headlight of a motorcyclist coming behind because one knows when he or she will overtake. One can see him or her coming. I would hate to affect this. The idea of using daytime running lights when it is raining should be considered. Another idea for consideration is that lights be turned on one hour before lighting up time and kept on for one hour after street lights are turned off.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 12, before section 10, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;10.&ndash;Each local authority shall, within 6 months from the passing of this Act, make bye-laws prescribing a speed limit of 20 miles per hour in the vicinity of schools as directed by the bye-laws concerned.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I feel strongly about this issue. In the United States of America all vehicles must stop behind a stationary school bus. No vehicle is allowed to overtake it. During the years a number of accidents have occurred as a result of children running out from in front of or behind a school bus and being hit by overtaking motorists. Most school buses stop on major roads. I am aware that prohibiting overtaking of school buses could create a difficulty, but the standard speed limit could be used in the vicinity of schools with an additional flashing sign indicating &ldquo;no overtaking&rdquo; wherever the school bus stops. It only takes a few minutes for children to get on and off. It would be in the interests of the safety of children and is something about which I feel strongly.</P>
      <P>If one travels in any suburban town in France, one will find that speed limits are not fixed at 30 miles or 40 kilometres per hour. In some places they are as low as five and ten. People in France expect these speed limits in certain areas. We appear to have the inflexible idea that the speed limit is either 30 miles per hour or 60 or 70. As I said on Second Stage, there are roads on which it is more dangerous to travel at 60 miles per hour than at 100 on a motorway because the roads are not meant to take it. Perhaps the Minister will respond to this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Coogan in this series of amendments dealing with traffic restric<Col N="1262" /> tions in certain circumstances. He referred to the issue of bus stops in the vicinity of schools. Amendment No. 10 specifies that local authorities, after consultation with the Garda, would apply a statutory maximum speed limit of 30 kilometres per hour.</P>
      <P>The issue of speed limits, especially the question of consultation between the Garda and local authorities, is very important. I support Senator Coogan's amendments in that it is important that we give additional significance to the role of local authorities working in consultation and partnership with the Garda in setting speed limits.</P>
      <P>I am particularly concerned with village areas, schools and bus stops. In the case of villages along roads carrying substantial traffic flows, speed has become an increasing problem for people trying to cross the road, particularly elderly people. Some of the villages I have in mind in County Tipperary are Toomevara on the N7 and Horse and Jockey on the N8, where it is virtually impossible to cross the road. Even in villages off the main roads, speed is an increasing problem. This is now one of the most frequent complaints which residents in the vicinity of such villages are raising with public representatives as a factor which is undermining their quality of life.</P>
      <P>In areas where there has been new housing development over the last five to ten years, not necessarily in the form of a village, as such, but even in the case of ribbon development, regardless of whether we want it, there may well be a need to review the requirement for local speed limits where the level of population is such as to warrant new measures being taken in the interests of safety and quality of life. In this context, Senator Coogan's amendments are very relevant in terms of clarifying the role of local authorities, particularly amendment No. 10 which provides that local authorities, working with the Garda, could apply a maximum speed limit of 30 kilometres per hour. That would also give the elected members of local authorities a role in bringing forward such proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I regard the points made as much more an issue of enforcement. Obviously, speeding is a problem in many villages, but the solution lies in enforcing existing speed limits rather than setting new ones. I would even suggest that, because of lack of compliance, some speed limits are actually pitched too low. I have heard debates at local authority level on the idea of reducing speed limits from 40 miles per hour to 30 in the hope people might stay within the 40 miles per hour limit. I agree that this is not a good approach to law enforcement and compliance, but, unfortunately, it reflects the situation as is.</P>

    <P>If speed limits are pitched at unrealistically low levels, they are unlikely to be effective. For example, a &ldquo;village&rdquo; consisting of a pub and a garage would be better served by a 50 miles per hour limit which is adhered to rather than a 40 <Col N="1263" /> miles per hour limit which is largely ignored. Not enough use is made of the 50 miles per hour limit which, I understand, is an option available to local authorities but not widely used by them. Standards need to be looked at with a view to having a degree of uniformity as a basis for more effective enforcement.</P>
    <P>I remind the Minister of his excellent address to his party Ard-Fheis in which he suggested it may be timely to look at the policing of traffic management areas. Perhaps there is potential for a significantly enhanced role for local authorities in this regard. In turn, it would release Garda resources to be applied on a more full-time basis to dealing with criminal activities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>My reason for not accepting the amendments is not that I disagree with them but that the primary legislation is already in place to facilitate what Senator Coogan is proposing. Under current regulations, there is provision for speed limits of 30, 40, 50, 60 and 70 miles per hour, providing flexibility for local authorities. I understand the request by Senators for the inclusion of a speed limit of 20 miles per hour in designated areas. Perhaps the way to take the matter forward is for local authorities for whose members this is a reserved function to consider if there is a need in certain areas to introduce such a new provision. If there is such a demand around the country, my Department would, as is normal, draw up regulations allowing for 20 miles per hour speed limits in particular circumstances. It would then be up to the local authorities to designate the particular areas in which this should apply.</P>
      <P>In relation to village areas, I agree with Senator Walsh's comment that if speed limits are pitched too low, they will be ignored, bringing the law into disrepute. A speed limit of 20 miles per hour would be ridiculous in the case of villages on national secondary roads or whatever. However, I take the spirit of the comments of Senators Coogan, O'Meara and Walsh in relation to new residential areas and locations in the vicinity of school bus stops. I am not sure if it is possible to have a moveable speed limit, as it were, to accommodate school buses stopping at points where there are no bus stop signs, but I share Senator Coogan's concern in this regard. I have some knowledge of the US system whereby other vehicle drivers have to take special precautions in relation to school buses, such as stopping when the bus has stopped while kids are boarding or disembarking, giving the bus a wide berth when overtaking and so on. I agree with this. However, as I have said, the amendments are not necessary because the primary legislation adequately provides for the changes in speed limit signs mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In deference to the Senator's comments and taking account of my response in relation to the <Col N="1264" /> local authorities' role &ndash; the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, has already indicated this &ndash; we will raise the matter again with the high level committee on road safety. We are now coming to the end of the current strategy period and will specifically ask the committee to have a look at this matter in preparation for the next strategy.</P>
    <P>I also reiterate Senator Walsh's comments in relation to speed limits. No matter what regulations and speed limits we have, the law will simply be brought into disrepute unless they are enforced and people believe they will be enforced. I am particularly familiar with the situation in the village of Batterstown, on my way to and from Dublin. Motorists are conscious that the Garda operates speed checks there fairly regularly, and one notices the brake lights coming on as they approach the speed limit signs at the village. I am sure Senators could cite similar examples. Our main focus has to be on even greater enforcement, acknowledging the huge increase in recent years.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to appear churlish in not accepting Senator Coogan's amendments, the spirit of which is accepted. We have the appropriate primary legislation and it is not necessary to duplicate it. I assure Senators Coogan, O'Meara and Walsh of my commitment to have the matter taken up by the high level group. The Senators are probably in a better position to inform local authorities of this than anybody else. If there is a demand for this from the members of local authorities, we will amend the regulations to allow for a 20 miles per hour speed limit in particular areas. That is as far as I can go at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>With no further pun intended, that would not be a better vehicle for the introduction of such limits than the proposed legislation, as we do not know when we will see the proposed regulations. I do not know if the Minister intends that it be introduced by regulation or legislation. In the interim, if the amendment is accepted, it might be responsible for saving a number of lives while awaiting any other changes the Minister intends to make in the future.</P>
      <P>On the way in to Dublin I am confused by road traffic signs regarding speed limits. This has cost me a few bob and may possibly cost me penalty points in future if I do not watch out. Speed limits change constantly along the western road. The 40 mph speed limit sign suddenly changes to 50 and I only become aware of this when somebody blows the horn behind me. It changes to 40 quite quickly and a light flashes behind me for a different purpose. I accept the fact that if one does not have a speed limit to which people adhere, there is no point in having it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the western route in Galway, a dual carriageway, no car travels under 30 miles per hour. At a recent meeting of the city council I recall remarking to someone that a terrible thing had happened in the case of a car travelling at 50 <Col N="1265" /> miles per hour on the dual carriageway. When the person concerned asked if the driver had been charged with speeding I replied that he was charged with obstructing traffic. If the Garda wants to make money, all it has to do is stand on the one spot along the road and everybody who passes will be travelling at more than 50 miles per hour.</P>
    <P>Corporation members have asked time and again that this road be re-examined, but their request has not been taken on board. The Minister can say what he likes about local government being able to do these things, but one has to return to the Garda which will say &ldquo;No&rdquo;. Privately gardaí will say it is impossible to enforce the speed limit unless they leave a Garda car on a full-time basis and while that may be financially rewarding, it is not exactly good law. I ask the Minister to reconsider if this is the proper vessel for this measure.</P>

      <P>I welcome this section which extends the remit of local authorities and gives them a role where offence or discomfort is caused by excessive emissions and noise from road traffic. It is important that the role of local government in traffic management is further extended, for which there is tremendous scope. There is an onus on local government to implement fully the provisions and powers they are being given, something which does not always happen. While the SPC structures are important, the implementation of policy and the remit and responsibilities of local government is equally so, and will necessitate a very significant and direct role for councillors in ensuring responsibilities in the areas concerned are fully implemented. In general, I welcome this provision. I know the Minister does not need any encouragement from me to do more of the same in the future.</P>

In normal circumstances I am in favour of having resolutions approving regulations put before the Houses.

      <P>This section deals with the extended use of electronic equipment, including cameras, which obviously are an effective deterrent. The thrust of much of the technology we have today raises serious questions about invasion of privacy. Entitlement to privacy is a fundamental right. When doing anything in this area we should ensure that we do not infringe that right to too great an extent. <i>Pro bono publico</i> applies, where one must ensure there is compliance with laws that provide for the common good, but we need to achieve a balance. I do not disagree with the section &ndash; I am simply sounding a note of caution because the thrust of various Government, international and EU regulations are starting to infringe, in a fairly serious way, on people's right to privacy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree wholeheartedly with Senator Walsh. I am not sure if it is true or one of those stories that grow legs, but some years ago in Great Britain somebody was sent a photograph of himself and he was in a compromising position because the woman in the car with him was not his wife. While I would hate that to happen to anybody, it is not the issue I want to raise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My problem is with the photograph that is taken of somebody when he or she is speeding at a particular point in time. I raised this on Second Stage and it is something about which I feel very strongly. How can one appeal in a case where one accelerates to 58 mph to safely overtake a car travelling at 30 mph in a 50 mph zone? Although <Col N="1269" /> one subsequently reduces one's speed to 50 mph, one has been photographed at the moment one was exceeding the speed limit although one was carrying out a normal procedure under the traffic laws. It makes more sense to overtake at that speed than at 50 mph and, perhaps, endangering oncoming traffic. I have a difficulty with the single point in time photograph. Perhaps it would be better if there were four or five different photographs.</P>
    <P>Regarding Senator Walsh's point, there is a growing sense that big brother is watching with the installation of citizen cameras. They are no harm in their own right and they are being installed because of unfortunate things that are happening.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister discuss what happens to a person who is fined when he or she is photographed at a point in time when he or she exceeded the speed limit while overtaking to ensure somebody else was not endangered? Their action makes much more sense than keeping to the speed limit in that instance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The application of the electronic equipment we are discussing used to be limited to the offence of exceeding the speed limit, as provided for under section 47 of the Road Traffic Act. Section 91 provides for it to be used in cases of dangerous driving, careless driving and of parking a vehicle in a dangerous position and to control traffic where an event is attracting large assemblies. Section 92 provides for the prevention of obstruction of traffic by fairs and markets, section 93 protects bridges from excessive loads and section 94 provides for the closing of roads to particular vehicles. Under the 1994 Act, section 35 provides regulations for the general control of traffic and pedestrians. Those sections are the reasons for extending the use of electronic equipment and why the extended uses are being put on a statutory basis.</P>
      <P>I am not a lawyer so I will not try to interpret the law, but as we saw, tragically, in the Jamie Bolger case, footage from CCTV is used in detecting crime and to see who was in the vicinity of a crime when it occurred. It is there to assist the Garda and it is difficult to argue with it. The right to privacy is an important one, but the common good has to be taken into account, as Senator Walsh said, and a balance has to be maintained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not being smart, but the short answer to Senator Coogan's remarks regarding point of time photographs and fines is that the person exceeded the speed limit in his example. He or she can pay the on-the-spot fine, if that is what is imposed. If there are particular circumstances and he or she feels he or she should have his or her day in court to explain what happened, all we can do is provide him or her with the opportunity to be heard there. It is possible that at some time in the future we will have moving versions of the <Col N="1270" /> cameras but for now, if one exceeds the speed limit, that is the postion. We are all supposed to drive in a manner that does not endanger anybody else and which puts us in a position to stop safely at all times, among other things. Those are the general rules we are all supposed to follow. If we exceed the speed limit and are caught on camera, there is nothing much we can do about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>When anybody who is working for a living looks at having to spend a day in court, rather than pay the fine, even if he or she feels they are right about what he or she did, he or she will pay. If the penalties begin to accumulate, people will say &ldquo;I was not doing anything wrong in overtaking quickly&rdquo;. As I pointed out on Second Stage, sometimes people force one to stay over the white line and refuse to allow one to return to one's side of the road. In that instance, the penalty should be imposed on such people. The person who travels at 45 mph, holds up traffic and creates chaos behind until someone loses their cool and overtakes five or six cars at once should be fined as well.</P>
      <P>We should have good driving practice, but it is very hard to instil that in people. Perhaps it is because of the way people are taught to drive that their consideration is for themselves and not for others. Something I mentioned to the Minister before, as well as on Second Stage, that might sound futuristic is the idea of using simulators to allow learners to be subjected to all types of road conditions to see if they know how to apply rules and regulations without causing any accidents. As Senator Walsh mentioned, today is a lovely day and if one was doing one's test now, it would be much easier than having to do so on a slippery slope somewhere in the middle of winter. In a simulator one can simulate the conditions of all seasons in the year and assess if the person adheres to the rules and regulations and knows how to drive adequately. It is a futuristic concept but in the long term it is the way to go.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised a number of points yesterday which I considered again overnight. Those points do not imply any criticism of what is important and far reaching legislation for improving road safety. However, there are some anomalies in the Schedule. Some are minor but one of them is extremely serious.</P>
      <P>Inadequate brakes carry one penalty point if the person pays the fixed charge and three points on conviction. That is rather low. If somebody drives on the road with inadequate brakes, it creates a hazardous situation. Perhaps the penalty should be looked at again, particularly when compared to other penalties. The penalty for crossing white lines seems a little high. The NRA seems to have influenced the local authorities and there are now continuous white lines in areas where it would appear safe to overtake. I also have in mind a road where there is a continuous white line for a certain distance followed by a broken white line, which enables one to overtake the vehicle in front. However, if one had passed 30 metres earlier, it would have been safer and one would have had greater visibility but one would be in breach of the rules.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel strongly about the penalties for trailers not equipped with rear lights. It is one penalty point on payment of the fixed charge and three points on conviction. All Members will be aware of accidents resulting in death which were caused by somebody pulling trailers or plant and equipment which was not properly lit. If I drive on the road pulling a trailer without brake lights, I will pay a small fine and get one penalty point if I am caught. Somebody else who commits the same offence might be unfortunate enough to cause a fatal accident. He or she obviously will suffer a severe penalty, and rightly so. However, our offences are the same. Where this offence occurs, there should be no recourse to the payment of a fixed charge. It should result in conviction. This <Col N="1272" /> situation occurs because people are either careless or have a total disregard for other road users. I strongly believe there should be a change in this provision.</P>
    <P>The other point I raised yesterday was the prohibition on vehicles using the outside lane of the motorway. This applies in other jurisdictions which have three lane motorways but, to the best of my knowledge, the majority of our motorways have only two lanes. Where articulated lorries are restricted to a 50 mph speed limit and a car in front of a lorry is travelling at only 40 mph, this provision prevents the lorry from overtaking. I wonder about the prudence of that provision.</P>
    <P>I am not trying to be pernickety because, overall, it is good legislation which I strongly welcome. It will make a major input to road safety. However, I feel strongly about the provision relating to trailers because people I knew were killed as a consequence of unlit trailers on the roads.</P>

      <P>Senator Walsh referred to defective brakes. I believe that is covered under reference No. 10 which relates to driving a dangerously defective vehicle. It provides for no initial penalty points but for five penalty points on conviction.</P>
      <P>Reference No. 13 refers to using a vehicle &ldquo;not equipped with rear underrun protective device&rdquo;. That is the barrier to prevent another vehicle from running under the back of a truck or lorry. Has the Minister considered the point I raised about additional rubber skirting, that is, rubber mats that prevent water splashing from the main wheels of juggernauts? When one is trying to overtake those vehicles, even with the windscreen wiper operating on the fastest speed, one is still ten feet past the vehicle before one has good visibility. That is because they do not have proper or full flaps on the back of the vehicle. In addition, if flaps were put on the sides of the vehicle, it might reduce the amount of water thrown up from the road. The number of accidents that occur as a result of overtaking such vehicles is phenomenal. Will the Minister consider introducing such a provision in the Schedule?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>There will always be a variety of views on what should and should not be in the Schedule and what penalty points should apply. The important point, however, is that we now have a penalty points system. It is our first attempt and the penalties can be changed in the future, but only by legislation.</P>
      <P>Senator Coogan did my job by outlining the position regarding brakes. Having inadequate brakes will earn the motorist one penalty point. The other offence is driving a dangerously defective vehicle. If there are serious brake problems, that is the provision that will apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At any stage, gardaí, whatever the offence, have the option of proceeding to conviction or imposing an on-the-spot charge. For a serious offence, therefore, gardaí should and will opt for <Col N="1273" /> conviction. The points option is available for less serious offences. Obviously, however, where a less serious offence causes a death or serious injury, gardaí can decide to seek a conviction rather than use the penalty points system.</P>
    <P>Senator Coogan spoke about flaps on the sides of trucks. I will look at his suggestion. These vehicles are manufactured outside this country so it is probably an issue we should deal with at European level. I will do that because the Senator's point is valid. On a wet day one can see a clear road in front when one is sufficiently far behind the truck to decide to overtake but when one comes up beside the truck, one can be temporarily blinded. I will raise this issue both domestically and at European level.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised a number of matters on Second Stage and I know this is probably not the right time to raise them again. We spoke about the reduction in the number of accidents and road deaths. Nobody would disagree that the purpose and thrust of this Bill will make a positive impact in that regard.</P>
      <P>There is another side to this which I emphasised previously, that is, the condition of roads in comparison to those in many of our European counterparts. Poor road conditions lead to accidents. On a major route such as that between Galway and Dublin, I could take the Minister to a place where, following rain, there is always an accumulation of water. I have seen cars aquaplane on that stretch of road when the weather is reasonably good.</P>
      <P>The standard of roads in Ireland must be improved. We know how much money is raised from the car drivers through VRT, motor taxation and tax on petrol. When road tolls are introduced the motorist will be paying again and again. Motorists are not getting back as much as they are putting in and they have a right to demand more from this Government, as they had a right to demand from previous Governments, with regard to the standard of roads and the time it takes to go from one place to another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Roads Authority stated that it wished to set a standard of an average speed of 50 miles per hour on national routes. As Senator Walsh will be aware, in a test run from the centre of Cork to the centre of Dublin on Saturday my average speed was 27.8 miles per hour. That is nearly half the standard which the NRA wishes to attain. The amount of time the cars are on the <Col N="1274" /> road, the damage they are doing to the environment at the same time and the cost of transporting goods at such a slow speed is adding continually to the costs of the motorist. The motorist has a right to demand that the standard of roads be improved, both in the interests of safety and of adequate and safe speed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Coogan has made a compelling argument about the roads. He said that he travelled from Cork to Dublin at an average speed of 27.8 miles per hour. The figures should be inverted. One should be able to travel from Dublin to Cork in two hours. If we had a proper motorway system, that would be possible. We should have such a system and I know the Minister aspires to it. Much of what is contained in the national development plan is heading in that direction but we need to see the investment as quickly as possible. Senator Coogan is quite correct. It will not only facilitate the economy but considerably improve road safety and reduce the number of accidents. Statistics in other countries bear this out. It is a very important component of traffic safety.</P>
      <P>This is probably one of the most significant pieces of road traffic legislation to pass through this House in the life of this Seanad. The Minister, Deputy Dempsey, and his colleagues, the Ministers of State, Deputy Molloy and Deputy Dan Wallace, deserve to be commended for their input and effort. Serious strides have been made in tackling the issue of driver behaviour and road traffic accident reductions.</P>
      <P>I understand that the manner in which this scheme is constructed is unique to Ireland. It is good to see that there is a fixed charge so that it can be dealt with administratively. There will be a significant improvement in driver behaviour because, as people start to accumulate penalty points, it will make them focus on improving their own driving behaviour and ensuring that they do not get to the stage where they are caught.</P>
      <P>Even though it is a less high profile part of the legislation, the EU-wide approach to the issue of offences and disqualification and the fact that drivers from other countries may be disqualified here is a step in the right direction. No doubt in the course of debates in this House in future years people will refer back to this as a watershed in improving road safety in Ireland and I commend the Minister for that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Members of the House for welcoming and supporting this important legislation. I thank the members of my own party for their support, in particular, but also the Opposition for their constructive approach. In the other House a number of amendments put forward by the Opposition were taken on board. It is an area where there should be all-party support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take this opportunity to put on record my hope that we will be returned to power after the <Col N="1275" /> general election in May, but it is important to give the commitment on a personal and party basis, leaving aside the commitment on a Government basis. One of the first things the next Parliament should do is establish an <i>ad hoc</i> or standing joint committee to go into the detail of road safety issues. It could look into the kind of issues raised by Senators Coogan and Walsh such as educating people in good road manners, etc., but also the more serious issues which have been raised. We should feed into the high level group on road safety, have a direct say in it and make a direct impact with that group. We should do that having looked at good practice in other areas.</P>
    <P>Many accidents can be avoided by people behaving themselves and adopting a responsible attitude. At times people want to blame politicians, the Garda, the local authorities, the NRA and everybody else, but the vast majority of road accidents are caused by people who do not give proper consideration to their fellow motorists. That is the long and the short of it. We will not reduce the number of road deaths significantly until everybody takes personal responsibility.</P>
    <P>The focus in the past couple of years has been on the penalty points system which is being introduced in the Bill. No doubt this will have an impact. However, it is my hope that the impact will not be realised by motorists accumulating a large number of penalty points. I would like to report to the House after the penalty points system has been operating for a year that very few drivers have accumulated penalty points because behaviour and attitudes have changed. It would be wonderful if that were so.</P>
    <P>I hope the system will promote greater caution among motorists and greater respect for all road users. That is the overall theme of the legislation. The number of fatalities has been reduced by 14%. We have achieved a considerable reduction in the number of serious injuries and I hope we can add to that over the coming years. This legislation will help, although there are other things which need to be done.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the point made by Senator Coogan about the condition of roads. In a huge number of road deaths it is not a factor, but in some cases it is. It is estimated that the roads programme, including the motorways, which we are putting in place in the national development plan will save about 50 lives per year. That underlines the importance of having not only a good national roads system but also a good local roads system.</P>
    <P>I thank Members for their contribution to the debate and the Cathaoirleach and the staff in the House for facilitating it. I also thank my own staff for all the work they have put into it.</P>

Mar atá leagtha amach in alt 3 moltar go n-ardófaí scair an Stáit in Arramara Teoranta go &euro;1.2 milliún le gur féidir clár mór tarrthála agus athmhaoiniú do Arramara Teoranta a chur i bhfeidhm ag teacht le cinní an Rialtais agus comhaontú idir na scairshealbhóirí.</P>
      <P>Bunaíodh Arramara Teoranta mar chomhfhiontar in 1947 chun min fheamainne do thionscal na hailgionáite a thairgeadh. Ta 51% den chuideachta i sealbhas Aire na Mara agus na nAcmhainní Nádúrtha, thar ceann an Rialtais agus an chuid eile de na scaireanna ag ISP Alginates (UK) atá lonnaithe in Albain. Tá roinnt deacrachtaí trádála ag an gcomhlacht le roinnt blianta de bharr meath ar mhargadh ailgionáite an domhain. D'oibrigh an comhlacht dhá shaoráid go dtí le gairid &ndash; i gCill Chiaráin i gContae na Gailllimhe agus Mín Mhór i gContae Dhún na nGall agus d'fhostaigh go díreach thart ar fhoireann 34 duine, agus thart ar 400 duine ag plé le baint fheamainne go séasúrach ar feadh chósta an iarthair. De bharr athruithe móra ar an margadh idirnáisiúnta, thosaigh deacrachtaí trádála do Arramara in 1999 agus mhéadaigh isteach in 2000 agus 2001 agus d'ardaigh na caillteanais airgeadais, mar is léir sna cuntais.</P>
      <P>Tar éis mion-iniúchadh agus mionluachála ar staid an chomhlachta, a rinne foireann comhairleoirí gnó a cheap an Roinn, cheadaigh an Rialtas oibríochtaí na cuideachta a athstruchtúrú, dúnadh mhonarcha an chomhlachta i nDun na nGall agus d'imigh thart ar 15 de phostanna san athstruchtúrú sin. Rinne an t-athstruchtúrú le tacaíocht iomlán na scairshealbhóirí agus rinneadh é le súil le sláinte airgeadais an chomhlachta a thabhairt ar ais agus le súil go mairfeadh sí go fadtéarmach. Ta dóchas agam go gcuideoidh na céimeanna atá glactha go dtí seo agus na cinn atá pleanáilte leis an gcuideachta a fhorbairt agus a háit amach anseo a chinntiú agus dul chun cinn a dhéanamh.</P>

Tá an tsuim maoinithe san idirthréimhse ag saoráidí bainc a rinne an chuideachta a idirbheartú. Tá gá le &euro;800,000 eile chun uasghrádú a dhéanamh ar an áitreamh monarchana i gCill Chiaráin agus chun trealamh nua a chur isteach ansin chun freastal ar riachtanais amach anseo le deis a thabhairt don chuideachta forbairt agsu chun éagsúlú chuig táirgí breis luacha.

    <P>Táim dóchasach áfach leis an méid seo infheistíochta go mbeidh todhchaí mhaith agus ceann a bheidh slán ó thaobh airgeadais di ag Arramara agus gur féidir na postanna ina mhonarcha agus a soláthróirí, atá suite den chuid is mó sa Ghaeltacht, slán. Is léir go raibh Arramara Teoranta le tamall ag fulaingt ó easpa maoinithe agus easpa fócas gnó straitéiseach nár chuidigh le leibhéil maoinithe, trealamh nua agus pleanála chun aghaidh a thabhairt ar riachtanais a bhí ag athrú ar an margadh feamainne domhanda. Ba chóir go gcuirfeadh an méid atáthar a mholadh anois an chuideachta ar bhonn maith don am atá le teacht agus go fadtéarmach freisin.</P>
    <P>Táthar ag leanúint ar aghaidh áfach chun malairt fiontair a fháil do mhonarcha Mhín Mhor agus tá mé féin, an tAire Stáit, Máire Ní Chochlain agus Údarás na Gaeltachta ag deileáil leis sin.

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and the Bill. I am disappointed the seaweed industry is taking a bashing throughout the country. This industry once thrived along the western seaboard, but it now seems to be concentrated in a few areas. I am disappointed that the factory in Donegal has closed. The Bill will hopefully put the remaining factory in Galway on a sound footing and secure the future of the seaweed industry on the western seaboard.</P>
      <P>There are many difficulties with the seaweed industry. The harvesting of seaweed is laborious and can only take place at certain times throughout the year. The transporting of seaweed from shorelines to the plants in Galway or Donegal is expensive because of its weight and bulk. I hope, as the Minister said, that the restructuring of this facility in County Galway will upgrade the factory, maintain the viability of the jobs there and, above all, guarantee that markets will be found for the few remaining people harvesting seaweed along the western seaboard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The seaweed industry has provided a basic income for families along the western seaboard for many years. It was one of the few industries <Col N="1278" /> that could supplement incomes and many people were once involved in the harvesting of seaweed. A former Member of this House, Myles Staunton, was one of the first people involved in the business and he was a big employer along the western seaboard, based in Newport, County Mayo. He had many outlets for his products in Scotland and so forth.</P>
    <P>The loss of jobs is unfortunate. However, the main concern now is that a market can be found for seaweed and its by-products. I hope that the re-structuring of the finances of this company and of the factory itself will place it on a sound footing. However, there should be a better mechanism for the harvesting of seaweed and grant aid should be made available to those working on it. It is very cumbersome and not the nicest of jobs. Harvesters have to get down to the shoreline, pull up the seaweed, drag it out on to roads or beaches, haul it on to lorries and then transport it to Galway or, previously, to Donegal for manufacturing. If there were some new designs of equipment, it would be a great incentive for the remaining harvesters. It is a dying art.</P>
    <P>The company in Galway cannot continue to operate if it does not have raw material to work with and that material can only be obtained along the seashore. Harvesters need some assistance also because these people will keep the factory jobs in existence. There is no mention of the harvesters in the Bill, but they are critical to the entire seaweed industry. I ask the Minister to consider how we could assist harvesters.</P>
    <P>The Bill is very short and only concerns the restructuring of the Galway company to guarantee its viability and the closure of the Donegal plant. It is designed to help maintain the seaweed industry and I hope it does so.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1279" />The investment will enable the rescue and refinancing of the company in line with the agreement between the two shareholders, the State, through the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources and the Scottish company, ISP Alginates (UK). I understand that all these matters were discussed and finalised by the Cabinet in December.</P>
    <P>In the 55 years of its existence as a company, Arramara Teoranta has received a total investment of just over £80,000. It therefore comes as no surprise that the company has run into financial difficulties. It has struggled for a long time and it is only in the last three years that the company has run into financial difficulties, due largely to substantial trading losses. When the plant in Dungloe closed last June, it was stated that the company was experiencing trading difficulties owing to the downturn in the global alginate market. It is my belief that this difficulty was mainly due to the fact that the minority shareholder, ISP Alginates, had deliberately manipulated the situation within the company by gradually reducing the output that they took from the factory in Dungloe. Having become involved with a company based in either Canada or Iceland, they reduced their intake from Dungloe from 6,000 tonnes of seaweed three or four years ago to 1,500 tonnes this year.</P>
    <P>For many years, the Dungloe plant totally relied on Kelco, Scotland, for their turnover and markets. When ISP reduced its intake, the manager in Dungloe sought other markets for their product. I am disappointed that a decision was made to close the Dungloe plant before a replacement industry could be found for the area. I have expressed my disappointment to the Minister. At the time of the closure, I accepted that ISP was no longer interested in maintaining the Dungloe plant. I now see that they are providing only 49% of the £400,000 redundancy money requested by the workers. Furthermore, they will provide no further funding for the restructuring of the plant at Kilkieran and they are to dilute their shareholding.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the State chose to close the plant rather than find another company to take over. The Minister has stated that consultants have explored such possibilities, but I believe more of an effort should have been made to call the bluff of ISP. Sole blame for the closure of the Dungloe plant lies with ISP. That plant provided full-time employment for 15 people; 19 people are employed at Kilkieran. As the Minister has stated, there were up to 400 harvesters based around the west coast, from north Donegal to Galway. The manager of the plant at Dungloe is a friend of mine and I know that for years he managed both plants. Now we find that it is is the Dungloe plant that has to suffer.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that ISP was insisting that Dungloe had to be closed. When the plant closed in June, we were told that £350,000 was needed to provide for redundancy packages and the revi<Col N="1280" /> talisation of the plant in Galway. The State's subsequent investment of &euro;800,000 in Galway leaves sour grapes with those of us in Donegal. Had the State acted differently, and dispensed with Kelco or ISP, I believe the jobs at Dungloe and the livlihoods of 400 sea harvesters could have been saved.</P>
    <P>The difficulties at Dungloe are now exacerbated by difficulties in the transportation of the seaweed to Galway. I appreciate what the Minister has done to try to resolve this situation. However, the amount of seaweed being transported between Donegal and Galway is restricted to one or two loads per week and only five harvesters are getting the opportunity to cut the seaweed. I do not know for how long this can last. Negotiations are taking place &ndash; I am aware that executives of Údarás na Gaeltachta are meeting with private companies in other countries in an effort to re-open Dungloe with a different type of seaweed product. What worries me is that, even if a new company is found, there will be a reduction in the amount of seaweed required and people who have been harvesting seaweed for 25 years will have nowhere to market their product.</P>
    <P>The Minister merits praise for the manner in which he handled the redundancy issue at the Dungloe plant, particularly after the Labour Relations Commission made additional awards. The staff of the Department for the Marine and Natural Resources made every effort to ensure that those who were made redundant received their money in time for Christmas.</P>
    <P>I have no grudge against the plant at Kilkieran and I wish it every success. I hope an alternative industry can be found for the Dungloe plant. However, people other than the factory workers have been affected. Some harvesters have not cut seaweed since last June, because there was no demand from the plant in Galway. Some of those harvesters who have continued to work may not be able to sustain it much longer. I ask that the Minister look at the possibility of organising some form of compensation for harvesters, particularly those in Donegal, who are now depending on social welfare benefits to survive. There is also a lorry driver, a friend of mine, who transported the seaweed from Mayo to Donegal. He had to give up and sell off most of his plant because the small volume he transported did not justify staying in business.</P>
    <P>The area in which we live has for years been synonymous with great unemployment. When the factory was established there was nothing in County Donegal, apart from the option of emigration. The factory provided employment for a small number of people in the Dungloe area. I wish the Minister, the Minister of State, Deputy Coughlan, and the management of the company every success in trying to attract a new industry into the plant. I had great hopes for the seaweed industry following the report published a few years ago, but, unfortunately, matters have not worked out in County Donegal. The industry has contributed substantially, mainly through exports, <Col N="1281" /> to the national economy and those of areas such as County Galway where I hope the plant will continue to be successful.</P>
    <P>The eventual takeover by a private company of the plant in Kilkieran has been referred to. If that is the case, I am disappointed this aspect was not looked at immediately the Dungloe plant ran into difficulties. I blame the co-shareholder, ISP, for the debacle and closure of the Dungloe plant. I also place much of the responsibility on the board. The Minister will be aware that there were many difficulties five or six years ago when the rainbow Government replaced a number of directors on the board, one of whom is sitting beside me. The men concerned had both experience and integrity and I would question the ability of some of those who replaced them on the board. Even though board members realised what ISP was doing and that matters were not going well, at the end of the day they sat with their hands underneath their backsides at the final board meeting. Some of them pontificated to be great socialists, but they accepted and voted for the decision to close the Dungloe plant.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be aware that as politicians in the area we have had a very difficult time since the announcement of the closure of the factory for which we have been blamed because it is the Government who closed it. However, we are the only politicians and board members who, through the Minister and Minister of State, continue to push to try to find a replacement.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will understand the reason I have made some of my remarks today. I come from an area which has suffered huge unemployment for many years. The fishing industry has had its difficulties. Salmon fishing, in particular, in the small coastal fishing port of Burtonport, just up the road from Meenamore and Dungloe, has been in difficulties. I appreciate the Minister's efforts to try to provide a sustainable industry for the future. The area has attracted very little employment other than that created by some of the fishing factories and the local co-op in Dungloe which has kept more than 100 people in employment during the years.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister and údarás every success and hope in the immediate future there will be some good news which will take the pressure off all of us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for bringing the Bill to the House. The seaweed industry is very important and worth &euro;100 million annually in value added terms. It is of great importance to those who live along the western seaboard.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's interest in doing something about Arramara Teoranta. From my experience of dealing with previous Ministers from all political sides, Arramara Teoranta was always kept on the back burner within the Department. There was very little interest in its potential, in doing anything with it or in developing bio-diversity, and very little encouragement for the board to take initiatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1282" />It appears from the Minister's statement that the financial difficulties of Arramara Teoranta began in 1999. Given my knowledge, economic world trends, the demands made and the vast interest in the development of the alginate business, it is very difficult to understand how the marketplace for Arramara Teoranta has dwindled rather than expanded. There is some truth in what Senator Bonner said that ISP has sourced from other places. It is a very strong multinational company which is part shareholder with Arramara Teoranta. In the past Alginates used to seek their supplies and source raw materials of seaweed from many other countries, interests and takeovers. I understand ISP Alginates has bought the Norwegian seaweed industry which, in turn, has put one of its biggest competitors in the business out of the equation. It has such a monopoly, therefore, it makes matters difficult for the board.  </P>
    <P>As a former director who was appointed by a Fianna Fáil Government and served on the board for four or five years, our first duty was to build up the external sales of the company. We had many battles with our partners to try to ensure a degree of autonomy and a decision was made by the board. We built up its profits very substantially from our third party sales to the extent that we were able to approach the IDA. We were the first to build a new Arramara Teoranta venture in County Mayo. We had sales of something in the region of 5,000 tonnes per annum, of which between 1,500 and 2,000 tonnes were accounted for by third party sales. We continued this operation to the extent that at board meetings our partners used to be very annoyed that we would not give them a guarantee of supply at their contract price. We maintained competition which kept the company strong and built up opportunities.</P>
    <P>I recall attending a joint Oireachtas committee meeting at which a commitment was given by the board, with the support of our partners, following a long discussion, teasing out and planning, to build a plant in County Mayo. We bought a site and received backing from the industry and the IDA. To put it in not too decent terms, we were shafted and thwarted at the joint committee by people who are still Members of both Houses. Arramara Teoranta's plans for development and the improvement of incomes on the western seaboard were thwarted by individuals both in this House and the Dáil. It is a disgrace that we have now been reduced to one milling unit in County Galway when our expansion plans extended to building a third plant.</P>
    <P>During the last general election there was an announcement in Newport that a seaweed industry would be established which would provide 17 jobs. Where are they? What has happened to the development of our indigenous industry along the western seaboard? Many serious questions need to be asked. I welcome the Minister's investment and hands-on approach to send in consultants to look at the potential of the company.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1283" />Kerry Algae has developed an industry in the south. It is time we examined the issue with a view to developing the potential of the industry. We should decide how to do it, with whom to go into partnership and whether Arramara Teoranta should develop its own bio-industries from the alginate process. Has Kerry Algae the capacity to develop the alginate aspect of the business? Should we look for a partnership on that basis or should we try to get ISP to play a more significant part in the development of our own industry rather than thwarting the seaweed industry and its potential? It needs serious examination and proper plans and proposals need to be brought forward.</P>
    <P>When we were building the third plant, the former Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, was asked to raise the shareholding of Arramara Teoranta. In fairness to him, he was fast in agreeing to the proposal. It needed legislation and we are here today to look for an increase in the shareholding. I would like to see the increase on the basis that it gives the company the opportunity to develop its potential and recognises the importance of the industry to the people on the western seaboard.</P>
    <P>County Mayo had a huge number of cutters but there are few of them left because the seaweed is not wanted except when Galway has none. The same applied when Donegal was working and Mayo cutters were not asked to cut unless Donegal was short. There is potential for a great industry and I ask the Minister to commit himself to an important national seaweed industry for the benefit of the people on the western seaboard. I support the Bill.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis na Seanadóirí as ucht an mhéid atá ráite acu. Níl aon dabht go bhfuil deacrachtaí faoi leith ag an tionscal feamainne. Is mar gheall ar na deacrachtaí sin go raibh orainn athstructúr a dhéanamh. Cuireann sé isteach go mór go raibh orm an monarcha sa Mhín Mhór a dhúnadh agus chuala mé caidé a dúirt Seanadóir Bonner ach ní bheadh aon comhlacht ann muna mbeadh an cinneadh sin déanta chomh sciopthaí agus a rinneadh.</P>
      <P>Tá suim agam sa méid a dúirt an Seanadóir de Búrca. Beimid in ann níos mó airgid a thabhairt amach mar phraghas don fheamainn ach ní dóigh liom go mbeimid in ann deontais a thabhairt. Dúirt mé le cathaoirleach an bhóird go mbeinn sásta praghas níos airde a thabhairt do no daoine atá ag gearradh na feamainne.</P>
      <P>Tá muid ag cur isteach níos mó teicneolaíochta sa tionscal. Tá beirt breise ceaptha againn atá ag obair le hÚdarás na Gaeltachta agus Bórd Iascaigh Mhara, i dteannta le hOllscoil na Gaillimhe, chun táirgí a fhorbairt sa dóigh is go mbeimid in ann luach níos airde a fháil ar son na dtáirgí atá á ndéanamh ag Arramara Teoranta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1284" />Tá gach iarracht á dhéanamh againn anois go mbeimid in ann comhlacht príobháideach a thabhairt isteach agus an monarcha sa Mhín Mhór a athoscailt. Tá mé féin agus an tAire Stáit sa Roinn Ealaíon, Oidhreachta, Gaeltachta agus Oileán ag plé moltaí leis an údarás sa treo sin. Tá mé cinnte go mbeidh tionscal i nDún na nGall ach caithfimid na táirgí a dhéantar sa mhonarcha a athrú. Beimid in ann an méid feamainne atá á gearradh anois a mhéadú agus monarchán nua a chur isteach.</P>
    <P>Glacaim go raibh an-iarracht déanta ag Condae Maigh Eo ach níor éirigh leis. Má bheimid in ann tionscal ceart a chur i bhfeidhm i gCill Chiaráin, níl aon dabht go mbeidh méadú ar an méid feamainne atá á gearradh i gCondae Maigh Eo. Leis an iarracht á dhéanamh le táirgí nua a chur ar fáil beidh seans ann a mhalartú sa chondae.</P>
    <P>Is lá stairiúl é seo. Bunaíodh an comhlacht i 1947 agus ní raibh aon dul chun cinn déanta ó shin. Cuireadh isteach £43,000 &ndash; sin an limistéir a cuireadh ar an méid airgid a thig leis an Stát a chur isteach sa chomhlacht ansin. Seo an chéad uair a tháinig muid ar ais chuig an Oireachtas le hairgead breise a chur isteach. Tá muid ag cur &euro;1.2 milliún inniu agus cuirfidh sin an-dul chun cinn don tionscal feamainne.</P>
    <P>Ní aontaím leis an méid a dúradh faoi ISP Alginates. Tá suim againn sa tionscal agus dá mbeimis in ann dul ar aghaidh linn féin agus an monarcha sa Mhín Mhór a shabháilt, bheadh sin déanta againn. Ní raibh an dara rogha agam agus, de bharr sin, bhí orainné á dhúnadh. Tá súil agamsa go mbeidh tionscal feamainne ann i gcondae Dhún na nGall.</P>

      <P>I appreciate what the Minister said as to why he cannot grant aid equipment for people on the west coast who are harvesting seaweed. I welcome the fact that he has said he will be able to do something regarding higher prices for the product. We also welcome the new technology which will allow new products to be developed and which will increase the by-product industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are difficulties related to harvesting which the Minister of State has recognised. The boom of recent years has had an effect on harvester numbers because there are easier ways of making money than harvesting. It is critical that we maintain their number on the west coast. Senator Chambers alluded to the decrease in County Mayo in particular. Incentives will be required to <Col N="1285" /> get people back harvesting seaweed because it is not the most attractive of businesses. As I have said, many families have been reared and incomes supplemented by the harvesting of seaweed along the west coast. I welcome the Bill.</P>

      <P>This is a Bill which has been amended by the Dáil. In accordance with Standing Order 103, it is deemed to have passed its First, Second and Third Stages in the Seanad and is placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage. On the question, &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration&rdquo;, the Minister may explain the purpose of the amendments made by the Dáil and this is looked upon as the report of the Dáil amendments to the Seanad. The only matters, therefore, that may be discussed are the amendments made by the Dáil. For the convenience of Senators, I have arranged to have copies of those amendments made available.</P>
      <P>As Members are aware, they may speak only once on Report Stage.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to be back in the Seanad to report on this Bill which was initially passed by the Seanad last October. Since then the Bill has been the subject of much lively <Col N="1286" /> and interesting debate in the Dáil and has been amended both on Committee and Report Stages in the Lower House.</P>
      <P>Of the amendments taken in the Dáil, five were of a substantial nature. One of these was inserted into the Bill at the request of my colleague, the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Fahey, and deals with access to upstream pipelines, that is, pipelines that connect gas production platforms with onshore terminals. The amendment ensures that Ireland fully meets its EU obligations in regard to this issue.</P>
      <P>The other four substantial amendments are set out as new sections to the Bill dealing with codes of conduct, declarations of interest, disclosure of interests and provision of information. These all impose, in one way or another, various obligations on the commission for energy regulation. Seven of the amendments were accepted on the advice of the Office of the Attorney General to ensure that the Bill fully meets Ireland's obligations under the EU gas directive. A further number made improvements to the proposed regulatory framework by, for example, strengthening the commission's powers in relation to certain undertakings.</P>
      <P>Over half the amendments taken in the Dáil were to clarify the existing text, to amend incorrect references or were consequential on other amendments. For the benefit of Senators, I will explain the effects of the more important amendments made in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>In section 2, the definition of &ldquo;storage&rdquo; has been refined to exclude any gas contained within a pipeline at any one time. This basically means that line-packing, which is the stocking of extra gas in a pipeline by an operator by increasing the pressure in that pipeline, cannot be taken to be a type of storage. Line-packing is an important facility used by pipeline operators in balancing the system and if the definition remained as it was, other gas undertakings would be entitled to access this as a form of storage which, in turn, would have created difficulties for the system operator's ability to manage the daily operation of the system.</P>
      <P>Section 7 has been amended by replacing all references to the word &ldquo;section&rdquo; in subsections (3) to (7) by the word &ldquo;Act&rdquo;. This change ensures that the provisions of these subsections apply both to functions being transferred by way of the Schedule and functions being otherwise transferred under this Bill.</P>
      <P>Senators will notice that there are three new sections inserted as sections 8, 9 and 10 in the Bill. Section 8 ensures that the commission is obliged to draw up and publish a code of conduct for its members and staff. Section 9 imposes obligations on the commission's members and staff, as well as consultants and advisers employed by the commission, in regard to declarations of interest. Section 9 imposes similar obligations in regard to disclosures of interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An additional paragraph has been inserted in section 12(5) of the Bill which deals with the com<Col N="1287" /> mission's powers to hold a competition for the selection of a person to be granted consent to build a pipeline in a particular area. The new paragraph clarifies that any regulations made under this subsection can provide the power to the commission to impose appropriate terms or conditions on a successful applicant. A similar amendment has been made to section 23 of the Bill to the equivalent provision dealing with the commission's power to hold competitive processes for the granting of orders under section 2 of the 1987 Act to confer town-gas functions on persons.</P>
    <P>There are a number of important changes to section 14(1), which amends the third party access provisions contained in the Gas Act, 1976. As Senators will recall, persons who are entitled to third party access rights are those who are entitled to obtain a supply of gas from suppliers other than BGE, or to arrange for the transportation of gas on their behalf through the BGE system. The first change that has been made was to extend the categories of person eligible for third party access to cover all natural gas licence holders and holders of petroleum leases, that is, producers of natural gas. This change ensured that the third party access provisions in the Bill fully comply with Ireland's obligations under article 16 of the EU gas directive.</P>
    <P>Second, a new section 10B of the Gas Act, 1976, is now being inserted by section 14(1) of the Bill. This has been done at the request of my colleague, the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, who has responsibility for upstream pipelines. These are pipelines that link gas production platforms with the onshore terminal where the gas is processed and the new section 10B ensures that Ireland meets its obligations in regard to third party access to upstream pipelines under the EU gas directive. The new section 10B has been modelled to the greatest extent possible on the section 10A that was already proposed in the Bill. This is because the provisions of section 10A have been in force since 1995 and market players are familiar with their rights and obligations under these provisions. Allowing for a matching framework for the upstream end of the market provides continuity and certainty for market players.</P>
    <P>A further improvement in this section is the inclusion of a new subsection (9) in section 10A. This imposes an obligation on the commission to consult the relevant national regulatory authority in another member state in the event of a cross-border dispute concerning access to a pipeline. This deals with an obligation that already exists under the EU gas directive.</P>
    <P>The amended version of section 11 of the Gas Act, 1976, which is set out in section 15, has also undergone a change. It means that section 11 only deals with the Minister's shareholder powers in regard to the profits and financial objectives of the board. The provisions dealing with directions to the board in regard to pricing policy are now <Col N="1288" /> incorporated as part of the commission's powers under the Gas (Amendment) Act, 1987. This is done by way of an amendment set out in section 23(2)(<i>b</i>)(vii) of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The section of the Bill dealing with natural gas licences has also been subject to some amendment. The scope of activity allowed by a supply licence has been redefined and simplified. The result is that it is now clear that a person who holds a supply licence can supply natural gas to anyone who is eligible for third party access rights either within the State or in another member state of the EU. This brings the provision fully in line with the requirements of the EU gas directive.</P>
    <P>The scope of the commission's powers under subsections (14) to (17) of this section has undergone a necessary enhancement. These subsections, which are based on similar provisions in the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999, give the commission the power to take immediate action to protect public health and safety, the environment or the continuity of supplies of natural gas. The commission's power also covers instances where licensees contravene a term or condition of their licences.</P>
    <P>The amendment made to these subsections in the Dáil ensures that the commission's powers also cover people who are exempt from having a licence by virtue of section 16(4) and people who are engaged in town gas activities by virtue of an order made under section 2 of the Gas (Amendment) Act, 1987. In conjunction with this, the amended subsections (16) and (17) ensure that the commission will have the power to modify the duties or obligations conferred on a person by an order made under the 1987 Act and that the provisions of the Electricity Regulation Act apply to the notification of and appeals against such modifications. The amendments to these licensing provisions improve this section of the Bill and strengthen the commission's powers in this area.</P>
    <P>Section 22, which deals with the funding of the commission, has had an additional provision inserted into it at paragraph (<i>c</i>). This inserts a clarification into the Schedule to the 1999 Act which ensures that the Commission on Electricity Regulation is clearly able to impose a separate levy order on natural gas undertakings following enactment of the Bill and that such a levy can take immediate effect. This amendment was important to ensure that the commission could begin funding its activities in the natural gas area as soon as possible after the transfer of functions took place.</P>
    <P>Two new amendments to sections 26 and 32 of the Gas Act, 1976, have been inserted in section 23, which deals with the area of miscellaneous amendments to the various Gas and Electricity Acts. These amendments rectify an oversight that was made in the previous amendments to these sections in the Gas (Amendment) Act, 2000. The amendments incorporated in this Bill ensure that Bord Gáis Éireann and all other operators in the <Col N="1289" /> gas market have exactly the same rights under the Gas Act, 1976, in regard to entry into land and the making of compulsory acquisition orders. The need to ensure that the rules and regulations governing the market do not discriminate unfairly between undertakings is a fundamental principle of EU law.</P>
    <P>The discrepancy that existed under section 32 of the Gas Act, 1976, was rectified in November last by the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources by way of S.I. No. 517 of 2001. The provision contained in the statutory instrument has been replicated in section 23 and the statutory instrument is accordingly being revoked under section 24. Including the amendment in the body of the Bill rather than having it in a separate statutory instrument means greater clarity and transparency in the legislative framework.</P>
    <P>A number of important amendments to the Gas (Amendment) Act, 1987, have also been included under section 23. These are set out in section 23(2)(<i>b</i>). In subparagraph (i) of this provision it is made clear that the commission, in addition to having the power to make an order under section 2 of the 1987 Act, has the power to refuse to make an order, when appropriate. The amendment also clarifies that such orders do not confer exclusivity on the undertaking in regard to the area to which the order relates and that the commission may make concurrent orders for certain areas. This is a necessary step towards ensuring that competition may be introduced when and where appropriate.</P>
    <P>Subparagraph (ii) sets out clearly the conditions under which the commission may refuse to make a concurrent order in regard to a certain area. The commission is given the power to refuse to make a concurrent town gas order for the provision of pipelines in a specific area where the commission considers that there is already adequate provision for pipelines in that area. However, the amendment requires the commission to refuse to make a concurrent order for the supply or sale of gas in a specific area prior to full liberalisation of the gas market.</P>
    <P>This is an important amendment and ensures that the introduction of competition into the sale and supply of town gas is fully in line with the timetable proposed for full liberalisation of the market which will be introduced through the reduction to zero of the annual rate prescribed under the third party access provisions in section 10A of the Gas Act, 1976.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State. While I did not deal with the Bill when it was first before the House, it appears many amendments were made to it in the Dáil. I wish to clarify a few issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the town gas function mean a person or persons can obtain a licence to supply gas to a town or can it be obtained for supply to a county or the country? What is the process for obtaining the licence? I presume the Government will advertise for applicants for licences to supply <Col N="1290" /> specific towns connected to the gas network or a specific county. Will the criteria be laid down in a ministerial order or will another process be used?</P>
    <P>The gas found in the Corrib Basin off the coast of Mayo will be piped through the county. No decision has been made on whether any town in the county along the pipeline from Broadhaven to Galway will be connected to it. The towns in question are Ballina, Castlebar, Belmullet, Claremorris and Ballinrobe. The pipeline will connect in Galway to the recently announced pipeline which will run from the east coast to Galway city.</P>
    <P>I am sure all the gas that flows through the Corrib field pipeline will be metered. Could a levy of a penny or a fraction of a penny per unit be placed on the gas which flows through it and the money raised ring-fenced for investment in towns and areas in County Mayo which could benefit from it? It is important that, where there is a find such as this, the people of the area should benefit directly from it. In this case, the people of the north and west coasts of Mayo should benefit from the gas find in the Corrib field. Some form of charge on the gas which flows from Broadhaven to Galway should be levied, the proceeds of which could be invested in the community. I welcome the amendments to the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senator for his positive comments. He made a plea that some revenue should be ring-fenced to ensure there is some level of tangible appreciation and benefit to the local area. I can empathise with that aspiration which I have long advocated in my constituency as the premier forestry county in Ireland. This makes for disadvantages to the local community, as the Senator has said. I have often put the same argument to the powers that be during the years that there should be some recompense, as the Senator expressed it so well, in terms of ring-fenced revenue being put aside by way of appreciation or compensation to the particular community concerned. Regrettably, I did not get very far with my argument in that regard over many years and hope the Senator will have greater success in pursuing his case, which makes a great deal of sense.</P>
      <P>The order which the commission may confer on a person may cover whatever is considered appropriate by the commission. This might be done on the basis of a town or county, if the commission, being the regulator, so decides. The Bill provides full powers for the commission to hold a competitive process to decide the most appropriate person to undertake such a function. The issue of taxing Corrib Gas is not one that arises in the context of serving towns in the north west. It is separate from the terms of the exploration licence issued to Corrib Gas.</P>
      <P>The Senator raised another point in relation to the changes in the Bill. Perhaps he will kindly repeat the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>My question related to the procedure for allocation of licences for the supply of <Col N="1291" /> gas. Will they be allocated on the basis of individual town areas, county areas or whatever? I assume it will be on the basis of open competition. Could one individual or company obtain an exclusive licence to supply gas to a particular town or city? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with that issue. The Senator mentioned that there have been quite a number of amendments to the Bill, both in the Dáil and Seanad. Perhaps that is a reflection of the number of issues involved. The legislation is complex in that it seeks to combine pre-existing legislative frameworks into one overarching framework. It draws together the Gas Act, 1976, the Gas (Amendment) Act, 1987, and the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999. Accordingly, there are a large number of cross-references on other issues which we had to ensure we fitted together in a coherent way. Furthermore, considerable time has elapsed since the Bill was published. We have taken full advantage of this to make appropriate additions. While the Bill could have been enacted without these additions, its scope has been enhanced in the process of discussion both in this House and the Dáil. I have taken on board a number of amendments as a result of the debates in both Houses and acknowledge the very positive approach of Deputies and Senators in this regard.</P>
      <P>On the Senator's specific question, the Bill provides full powers for the commission to hold a competitive process, as the Senator opined, to decide the most appropriate person to undertake the distribution function. Licensing will take place as a result of a competitive process.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to debate this important Bill in the Seanad. The Bill before the House is designed to ensure, to the greatest extent possible, that when people arrive in the State, from places other than the common travel area with the United Kingdom, they have valid travel documents with them. The Bill also contains some amendments to the Refugee Act, 1996, the need for which emerges from the experience gained from operating the Act since I commenced it in full in November 2000. The Bill, in creating a statutory obligation on carriers to make sure that their passengers have proper documents, is one part of the strategy to deal with the problem of improperly documented arrivals. The other element is the process of ongoing contact and advice that is already in place between the Irish immigration authorities and carriers to assist them in fulfilling their obligations.</P>
      <P>Ireland, in common with all other states throughout the world, operates immigration controls on persons arriving from abroad. These controls are there to protect and safeguard the interests of Irish society and of the individuals, regardless of whether they are citizens of Ireland, who make up that society. It is to the benefit of everyone that our immigration controls operate not only effectively, but also efficiently. The travelling public do not want to experience undue delay at immigration before being able to go about their business in the country. Carriers can do without the hassle of having to bring back their passengers who have been refused admission to the State because they do not meet immigration requirements. The interest of the immigration authorities themselves, in ensuring to the greatest extent possible that only those who are in compliance with the requirements of Irish law arrive in the State, is self-evident. It is for these reasons that states operate visa and other pre-clearance and carrier liability systems. That is why Ireland is now joining its fellow members of the European Union with the proposals in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to place the Bill in its context as part of the Government's approach to matters pertaining to migration and asylum matters. The Govern<Col N="1293" /> ment's period in office has seen changes in the migration environment of Ireland that are without precedent in the history of the State. There has always been some element of inward migration to this island; sadly, for much of our history as an independent nation, the pattern that has prevailed has been one of extensive net outward migration. That pattern established itself firmly in the famine years of the 19th century and was dictated largely by economic pressures. All that changed in the middle of the last decade. In my time in office, we have seen burgeoning expansion of inward migration to Ireland. Our economy has expanded and developed, due in no small measure to the policies adopted by the Government, as well as the sensible approach of the social partners in successive agreements affecting how we manage our economy.</P>
    <P>Ireland has developed into an attractive place, one where people from abroad can see opportunities to share in and contribute to our economic growth &ndash; just as our predecessors through many generations saw opportunities during the last two centuries in far-flung, young and vibrant countries like Canada, the United States and Australia. Regular migration to Ireland in recent years has been at its highest level ever thanks to the enlightened approach the Government has taken to migration policy, which is recognised as one of the most liberal in Europe. According to figures from the Central Statistics Office, immigration to Ireland has been averaging almost 45,000 people a year over the past five years, with outward movements estimated at around 24,000 a year. This indicates an estimated average net inward migration of over 20,000 people a year.</P>
    <P>Analysis of the figures demonstrates the upsurge in returning Irish migrants and people from within the European economic area who are coming to Ireland to make their living. Ireland's attractions as a place for people's future are recognised further afield as well. In 1999, my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, issued a record 6,000 work permits to people from outside the European economic area, EEA. The following year that figure trebled and in 2002 doubled again to the phenomenal figure of 36,000 work permits &ndash; a total in the three most recent years of 60,000 work permit holders migrating to Ireland for economic reasons, observing our normal immigration requirements and being made welcome in their places of employment and their new communities.</P>
    <P>Along with this increase in regular migration, we have experienced what many other developed countries of the Western world had already undergone in the previous decade or so, a growth in illegal migration and in the international business of facilitating those who, for one reason or another, feel that they cannot avail of the legal means of entering and settling in their chosen countries of destination. The international experience has been that a significant feature of this trend is the increase in the number of people <Col N="1294" /> seeking protection in destination countries on foot of claims of persecution in their home countries and Ireland has been no exception to that trend. This observation should not be interpreted as implying an assumption on my part that all asylum claims are motivated by reasons other than fear of persecution because the Irish asylum process is based on the principle that no assumptions are made about particular applications until they have been examined. It is simply a reflection of the experience internationally, an experience mirrored on the domestic scene.</P>
    <P>Ireland has been a party to the 1951 Convention on the Status of Refugees since 1956. However, when I took office I found only a rudimentary and under-resourced system for investigating and determining such claims. A recently enacted Refugee Act could not be implemented because it was not capable of catering for the volume of claims being received or of dealing with the growing backlog.</P>
    <P>Let me remind Senators of the actions I have taken in the sphere of immigration and asylum since taking office. I put in place a new administrative arrangement, known colloquially as the Hope Hanlan procedure after the UNHCR representative with whom they were agreed, and secured new staff and new premises in order to establish the human rights of those who had claimed and were claiming asylum in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I brought forward the legislation that became the Immigration Act, 1999, which had the vital effects of amending the Refugee Act, 1996 &ndash; necessary to make it work &ndash; and filling the lacuna left in the wake of the court decision on the constitutionality of certain aspects of immigration law. Not long after I took office, an essential element of this law was found to be incompatible with the Constitution. I organised the establishment and funding of the Refugee Legal Service, under the aegis of the Legal Aid Board, to assist claimants with their asylum claims.</P>
    <P>I ensured the Garda Commissioner was able to establish the Garda national immigration bureau to cater for the demands placed on the Garda Síochána by the increase in regular migration to the State and the related, though lesser, growth in irregular migration. I put in place the logistical, statutory and administrative arrangements which were the essential precursors to the Refugee Act and the establishment of the two independent bodies under the Act whose job it is to investigate all asylum claims and recommend decisions to me.</P>
    <P>I brought forward legislation to criminalise trafficking in human beings and streamline procedures for the judicial review of steps taken in the asylum and immigration processes, which constitute an expanding area of court business. In close co-operation with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, enhanced arrangements were put in place to ease the processing of work permits and related visas to allow economic migrants to enter the Irish workforce. I have facilitated a range of measures, in particular <Col N="1295" /> the &ldquo;kNOw RACISM&rdquo; campaign, to ensure the seeds of racism and xenophobia, which sadly exist to some extent in Irish society, do not flourish in order that all who come to our shores, for whatever reason, will be treated with dignity and fairness.</P>
    <P>There is more. As well as bringing forward the current Bill, I have laid the groundwork for a root and branch restatement of immigration law. Senators will be aware of the public consultation process I conducted last year and now that all the expected responses are finally in, my Department is preparing a synopsis, which I expect to release soon.</P>
    <P>The interdepartmental team on immigration matters, which I also established last year, has, among other matters, been monitoring a consultancy project in which the International Organisation for Migration is drawing together research on best migration practice in many jurisdictions worldwide. I expect to be publishing the team's work in the reasonably near future. This work, coupled with the internal review of immigration operations under way in my Department, is informing the development of a comprehensive new law on immigration and residence in Ireland, as well as the ongoing development of policy in this area. What I have in mind is for the new law to provide a modern legislative framework for the development and implementation of the policies needed to meet the evolving needs of society with procedures to cater for the rights and expectations of those who come into contact with the immigration process.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a step towards that comprehensive measure and is needed now to deal with the scenario we face. In the year 2000 &ndash; the most recent year for which figures are available to me &ndash; a total of 5,852 persons were refused leave to land on arrival in the State. Of those, 2,735 &ndash; almost one in every two refusals &ndash; occurred because the person concerned did not have a proper passport. A further 1,397 were refused because, although they should have had visas, they did not. In other words, three quarters of those refused leave to land in the year 2000 were not in possession of proper travel documents. I have no reason to believe that the figures for 2001, when available, will portray a different picture. There is a clear need to address the issue and a ready means by which it has been successfully addressed in other jurisdictions. That means is the carrier liability system which the Bill contains provisions to establish in law.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the provisions of the Bill. Section 2 is at the core of its carrier liability provisions, setting out the obligations that will be placed on a carrier whose vehicle brings persons to the State. A &ldquo;carrier&rdquo; is defined in section 1 as the owner of a vehicle or, in relation to a vehicle other than an aircraft, the person in charge of it. This definition encompasses ferry and other shipping companies and the captains of vessels. It includes airlines, but not the captains of aircraft, <Col N="1296" /> who are in a different legal position to the captains of seagoing craft. As well as these, the definition covers the owners and operators of road vehicles such as buses, coaches, cars and lorries.</P>
    <P>Under subsection (1) of section 2, where a vehicle arrives in the State from outside Great Britain or Northern Ireland, the carrier is subject to a number of requirements. Under paragraph <i>(a)</i>, the carrier must ensure everyone in the vehicle who wishes to land disembarks in compliance with any directions given by an immigration officer. Paragraph <i>(b)</i> requires that everyone on board who wishes to land is presented to an immigration officer while paragraph <i>(c)</i> requires that each non-national passenger who disembarks has the appropriate travel documents with him or her.</P>
    <P>Every non-national should have a valid passport which must be current and relate to the bearer. For an EU national, the identity card issued to citizens by many member states meets this requirement. The nationals of certain non-EU countries require, in addition to a passport, a visa of one of two types &ndash; depending on their nationality and whether they want to visit the country or merely transit through a seaport or, more usually, an airport. The categories of non-nationals who do not require a visa to enter Ireland are currently set out in the Aliens (Visas) (No. 2) Order, 2001. Anyone not included in the categories there set out needs a visa. The order also lists the countries whose nationals must be in possession of a transit visa if they wish to make a journey which involves transiting through an Irish port, as distinct from entering the country.</P>
    <P>The first two elements of subsection (1) give statutory weight to the normal co-operation with the immigration authorities that most carriers at present offer as a matter of routine business practice when disembarking their passengers. The last element, at paragraph <i>(c)</i> of the subsection, has the effect of requiring carriers to do in respect of journeys into Ireland what they already must with regard to journeys in the other direction. This will entail having in place systems to check the documents of passengers at embarkation. Carrier companies are no strangers to the business of checking travel documentation. All other EU member states, and most other countries to which carriers operate routes out of Ireland, already have in place legal arrangements of the type I am bringing forward in this section. When a person boards an aeroplane in Dublin bound for the Continent, or boards a vessel in Rosslare bound for France, his or her carrier company is already making the document checks at this end of the journey which are necessary to ensure both he or she and it comply with the immigration law of the destination country. The proposal before us means that those document checks will also be done as one boards for one's return journey to Ireland. Many carriers &ndash; both airlines and ferry companies &ndash; already routinely conduct pre-boarding document checks on all passengers, even where there is no immi<Col N="1297" /> gration requirement to do so. They consider it necessary for their own security reasons and in the interests of the safety of their passengers, particularly in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of 11 September in the USA.</P>
    <P>In the discussions my officials have had and continue to have with various groups of carriers in the course of preparing the Bill and waiting for its provisions to come into effect there has been a general recognition that carrier liability provisions are now the norm internationally. There is also a general welcome from carrier interests for the assurances of continuing co-operation between my Department's staff and the Garda national immigration bureau in helping them to meet their obligations under this proposal. They are particularly welcome regarding their obligations in terms of passenger documentation. None of these obligations is likely to prove unduly onerous to the bona fide carrier. I want the business of meeting these obligations to work smoothly and effectively.</P>
    <P>Senators will note that the provisions of subsection (1) apply only to arrivals from outside the common travel area operating between Ireland and the United Kingdom. A significant part of the CTA arrangements is that citizens of the two states can travel freely between the two jurisdictions without any passport requirement. We do not operate systematic immigration checks on arrivals from the United Kingdom and, in the circumstances, it would scarcely be reasonable for the law to put carriers in the position of having to carry out checks on their passengers which go far beyond what the Irish immigration authorities themselves do. Accordingly, the obligations in subsection (1) apply only to non-CTA arrivals.</P>
    <P>Section 2(3), by contrast, sets out an obligation which applies to all arrivals, including from the CTA. It enables an immigration officer to request the carrier in such a case to produce a list of the names and nationality of the persons carried and details of crew members. This is a useful control measure, based on a current provision in the Aliens Order, 1946, and will enable immigration officers, where they consider it necessary, to gather important information about clandestine entry into the State from whatever source.</P>
    <P>Section 2(5) and (6) provide specific defences to charges of failing to meet obligations under the section. The first of these, available in relation to any of the offences, protects a carrier from conviction where it can be shown that all such steps as were reasonably open were taken to ensure compliance with the obligations. Thus, a carrier who has proper procedures in place at the point of embarkation for the checking of documents and can show that those procedures were operated properly in the particular case, would be able to invoke this defence. The defences provided for in subsection (6) apply where the offence is under subsection (1)(<i>c</i>), that is, where a non-national passenger did not have proper documentation, and arise where the carrier can show either that the non-national concerned had <Col N="1298" /> the relevant documentation at the point of embarkation, subsection (6)(<i>a</i>) or, at paragraph (<i>b</i>), that the carrier did not know and had no reasonable grounds for suspecting that the document was invalid &ndash; for example, if the falsification technique used in the document in question was not a particularly easy one to spot.</P>
    <P>The provision of these defences ensures balance in the operation of these proposals when enacted. They are based on our experience and the experiences of other member states of the reality of document fraud. Typical instances include the disposal of genuine documents during the journey after they have been used to get the passenger on board. We are aware of instances where the same documents will be used over and over again to secure boarding for different passengers, presumably having been retrieved by the smuggler providing the service to the passengers in question. We are also aware that some high quality forgeries and falsification methods, including photo substitutions, are in use which might only be detected by an expert, often only after recourse to sophisticated equipment. Carriers are not expected to operate document checks to an unreasonably high level of sophistication and are not expected to give absolute guarantees as to the possession by their passengers of proper documentation on arrival in the State.</P>
    <P>Section 2(8) is an important provision covering the drawing up and publication of guidelines for carriers to ensure compliance with their obligations under the Bill. In anticipation of the measures in the Bill, my officials, together with officials from the Department of Public Enterprise and representatives of the Garda national immigration bureau, met with the Irish Road Haulage Association in a series of negotiations which resulted in what both I and the haulage association believe to be an effective set of guidelines for its members, addressing the question of clandestine passengers on board their vehicles. We both recognise the vulnerability of international hauliers as targets for smugglers who have no scruples about how they transport their often unfortunate human cargo.</P>
    <P>The guidelines, which have been adopted already by the association, are aimed at providing a checklist for long distance lorry operators so that they can minimise the scope of their vehicles being used for this clandestine trade. Observance by a haulier of these guidelines will have two effects. In practical terms it will help to protect them and their cargo from the activities of human smugglers and, as far as this new law is concerned, it will go towards assisting them in dealing with any prosecution that might arise in the event that covert passengers succeed in boarding their vehicles unknown to them, on the basis of the &ldquo;all reasonable steps&rdquo; defence in subsection (5). I commend the mature approach of the Irish Road Haulage Association to this matter and I see this type of consultation with particular interests <Col N="1299" /> involved in international carriage as a model for further such guidelines with other sectors.</P>
    <P>We have deliberately kept the guidelines provision in section 2(8) separate from the standard regulation making power in section 6 of the Bill. This is because guidelines of their nature must have a reasonable element of flexibility, a flexibility which might not be available if the style of language and rules of statutory interpretation necessarily associated with regulations, which are statutory instruments, were to be employed in drawing up guidelines under section 2(8).</P>
    <P>Failure to meet any of the obligations set out in section 2 is an offence, punishable on summary conviction by a fine of &euro;3,000. However, section 3 provides a means, similar to the system at present in relation to parking offences, where the carrier can avoid court proceedings by payment of a fixed penalty, in this case &euro;1,500, within 28 days of receiving the notice of intention to prosecute. Section 4 is a standard provision regarding the responsibility of officers of a body corporate for offences committed by the body.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the amendments to the Refugee Act, 1996, which are provided for in section 5 of the Bill. These amendments arise out of the ongoing review of the operation of that Act. That continuous process involves my Department and the two independent bodies set up under the Act, the office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, co-operating to ensure that the procedures under the Act achieve in an efficient way my policy aim and that of Government in relation to asylum. That policy is to ensure that anyone arriving in the State who is genuinely in need of the protection of the State is identified as such as soon as possible after they arrive so that they can immediately start the process of integration into Irish society and take up the rights to which they are entitled under the 1951 Convention on the Status of Refugees. The necessary corollary to that policy is to safeguard the internationally recognised concept of refugee status and of our domestic asylum systems and protect them against abuse.</P>
    <P>The proposals at present in section 5 of the Bill relate to two aspects of the Refugee Act: the role of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal and the question of protecting the identity of asylum seekers. I propose, in paragraph (<i>a</i>) of the Bill, to ensure that the important role of the tribunal is acknowledged by giving the chairperson of the tribunal an <i>ex officio</i> place on the refugee advisory board. The board, which is envisaged by section 7A of the Act, a provision inserted at my initiative as part of the amendments of 1999, is designed to draw together the various interests in the business of catering to the needs of asylum seekers and of refugees so as to monitor the operation of the Act and of other aspects of the lives of asylum seekers in the State.</P>
    <P>The Refugee Applications Commissioner's role in relation to the board is already specified in the legislation. Her function as an <i>ex officio</i> member <Col N="1300" /> is to act as secretary to the board. It makes sense, also, to have the chairperson of the other key independent body involved in the asylum process as an <i>ex officio</i> member. One of the functions of the proposed board, as set out in section 7A, is the preparation of a report every two years on the operation of the Act in the previous two years, with the first report to be in 2001. Since the Act itself did not commence in full until 20 November of that year, it would not have been possible to meet that statutory requirement, so paragraph (<i>a</i>)(i) of the Bill proposes to move the date for that requirement to 2003. I expect to announce the full membership of the board in the near future, once the provisions before us become law.</P>
    <P>Another matter related to the operation of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, which is not covered in the Refugee Act at present, is the preparation and submission of an annual report. That matter is addressed by section 5(<i>c</i>) of the Bill. I take this opportunity to commend both the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the chair of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal and their staffs for their excellent work in dealing with asylum cases as part of my overall asylum strategy. Following the investment of significant additional resources by the Government in the asylum process, I am pleased to inform the House that, since July last year, scheduling and processing of asylum applications has significantly exceeded monthly intake and, by June 2002, I expect the commissioner's office will, in the main, be dealing with applications which were made in 2002.</P>
    <P>The Bill also proposes, in section 5(<i>b</i>), to amend section 19 of the Refugee Act to remove the requirement of the Minister's consent where an asylum seeker himself or herself consents to be identified as such in the media. This change has been pressed for by many media interests, including some who have represented the current situation as being a ministerial veto on any coverage of asylum matters. It is nothing of the sort, but I am satisfied that the protection of the privacy of individual asylum seekers is sufficiently achieved without the additional requirement of ministerial consent, which only serves to create an administrative burden without a corresponding benefit in any significant additional protection of the individual applicant's interests. The advance consent of individual asylum seekers will continue to be required and journalists should be ever vigilant to ensure that irresponsible disclosure of asylum seekers' identities, even with their consent, will not jeopardise the lives of the applicant or of any family or other connections in the country of origin.</P>
    <P>Senators may note that I referred a moment ago to proposals which are &ldquo;at present&rdquo; in section 5. That is because I am considering bringing forward, by way of Committee Stage amendments to the Bill and subject to Government approval, further amendments to the Refugee Act, 1996, and also to the Immigration Act, 1999. I already referred to the ongoing review of operations in <Col N="1301" /> these areas with a view to ensuring optimum efficiency in the delivery of services to non-nationals. I expect the matters to be covered by Committee Stage amendments will include a more efficient way of dealing with asylum applications that have been, in effect, abandoned by the applicant and will elaborate further on the role and functions of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. It is also likely that some technical issues to do with general immigration law will be addressed by Committee Stage amendment.</P>
    <P>I and the Government remain committed to honouring our humanitarian obligations under the range of international instruments to which Ireland is a party, including in the particular context of this Bill the 1951 Geneva Convention relating to the status of refugees and its related New York protocol of 1967. We also remain committed to the development, consistent with those international obligations, of an effective immigration framework which serves the interests of Irish society and of all who are part of that society. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House, even if I cannot accord the same welcome to the Bill. I am sure on this bright sunny day the Minister would much rather be elsewhere, as I would myself, anywhere within sight of Killarney, Kenmare, Caherciveen, Killorglin or Dingle, but here we are. On a recent occasion when I was enjoying a function down there, I noted that the Minister was stuck in the other House with some Bill.</P>
      <P>I must apologise to the Minister and to the House. I have been thrown in at the deep end here. I am substituting for Senator Taylor-Quinn who is unable to be here today. It is not my area.</P>
      <P>I have listened with great interest to all the Minister has said and I will come back to specific points in his speech in a few minutes. As he will be aware, Amnesty International has huge concerns at the grave human rights implications, particularly in section 2(1)(<i>c</i>) of this Bill, which obliges carriers to ensure &ldquo;that each non-national on board the vehicle seeking to land in the State or to pass through a port in the State in order to travel to another state has with him or her a valid passport or other equivalent document which establishes his or her identity and nationality and, if required by law, a valid Irish transit visa or a valid Irish visa&rdquo;. Contravention of this provision would constitute an offence carrying a penalty of &euro;3,000 per inadequately documented passenger.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should have said at the outset that this Bill has two purposes, as the Minister has outlined in the explanatory memorandum. The first of which is the one I have been referring to. First it places on carriers bringing persons to the State obligations regarding the compliance of their passengers with immigration requirements on arrival. Contravention of those requirements will constitute an offence punishable by a fine &ndash; with the possibility of avoiding prosecution by payment of an on-the-spot penalty. The Bill also makes cer<Col N="1302" /> tain amendments to the Refugee Act, 1996. It would be far preferable if there could be an obligation on carriers that they would not carry any passengers at all. In any event, this is a little rough if, unknown to them, they find they have such a person on board.</P>
    <P>Amnesty International has pointed out:</P>
    <P>To penalise carriers this way evades our duty to provide asylum from persecution, contrary to international human rights law. It will force untrained airline and ferry staff into the role of immigration officials; to decide which passengers' documents to scrutinise, and who may and who may not travel to safety in Ireland. Some of those turned away may face torture or worse.</P>
    <P>This is an important point. There were instances of summary execution in places. I am not saying the people involved were turned away from here. I do not have the facts to hand but this has happened in some countries. That seems extremely harsh.</P>
    <P>Amnesty International further points out:</P>
    <P>Carriers will have to weigh the human rights implications of turning a passenger away against the severe financial penalties resulting from a breach of this legislation. Thus the protection of human rights will be devolved to commercial entities, which by their very nature are profit-driven and owe a responsibility to their shareholders in this regard.</P>
    <P>UNHCR has repeatedly stated that such carrier sanctions conflict with the letter and spirit of the 1951 UN Refugee Convention.</P>
    <P>In addition to the six Irish organisations that joined with Amnesty International to release a joint statement in December last, a number of others, such as Concern, the Human Rights Commission and the Children's Rights Alliance, are equally opposed to carriers' liability legislation.</P>
    <P>Amnesty and other organisations very much oppose this measure. I have here a statement to which Amnesty International, Comhlámh, the Irish Commission for Justice and Peace, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, the Irish Refugee Council, and the Refugee Protection Policy Group subscribe. It states:</P>
    <P>The Irish Government will shirk its moral and legal responsibility to afford protection to refugees if it introduces its planned carriers' liability legislation, which will impose heavy fines on airlines and ferry companies that transport people not in possession of proper documentation into Ireland.</P>
    <P>International standards of refugee protection recognise that people fleeing human rights violations are rarely in a position to obtain the proper documentation. Sometimes the need for flight is so urgent that to do so through normal channels is impossible. In other cases, the functions of their States of origin have broken down through armed conflict and obtaining docu<Col N="1303" /> ments is out of the question. Many asylum seekers, denied regular means of transport as a consequence of this legislation, will be driven to resort to other dangerous means of travel. The inevitable result of this sort of restrictive measure is to force asylum seekers into the hands of smugglers and into the back of freight containers. Some will consequently pay the ultimate price for their passage. This we witnessed on December 8th in Wexford where eight asylum seekers were discovered to have lost their lives in horrifying circumstances inside an airtight shipping container.</P>
    <P>While we acknowledge that States have a right to control their borders, measures which directly or indirectly obstruct the entry of asylum seekers into their territory are incompatible with international law and in particular with the 1951 UN Refugee Convention.</P>
    <P>They state that under this legislation &ldquo;airline and ferry staff would have to decide who is allowed to enter Ireland &ndash; decisions that could literally be a matter of life or death &ndash; and will be forced to adopt the role of the Irish immigration authorities&rdquo;. They further state:</P>
    <P>People fleeing torture or death have the right to have their asylum claims determined by the appropriate Government bodies, not the employees of carriers who are ill-equipped and untrained for this task. Otherwise, access to the whole asylum apparatus of the State (including the right to an appeal, right to legal assistance, right to interpretation, etc.) established under the Refugee Act, 1996 is removed. This will take place without any mechanism for transparency or accountability or means of appeal in relation to decisions made to refuse people entry to apply for asylum in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Government should instead concentrate on processing asylum claims efficiently. A State's asylum obligations must not be reduced to a numbers game. The object of our asylum policy should always be the fulfilment of our international obligations towards asylum seekers and refugees. This is not served by striving to reduce the numbers of those who manage to seek our protection.</P>
    <P>Forcing airlines, ferries and other carrier companies to take on the responsibility of the Government in immigration control, a role for which they are not equipped, cannot be a safe practice. These companies will have to weigh the human rights implications of turning a passenger away against the severe financial penalties resulting from a breach of this legislation. Thus the protection of human rights will be devolved to commercial entities, which by their very nature are profit-driven and owe a responsibility to their shareholders in this regard &ndash; a highly unsatisfactory situation for all concerned.</P>
    <P>Carriers' liability laws have been put in place throughout the EU, but Ireland does not have <Col N="1304" /> to follow suit. An EU Council directive harmonising this sort of legislation recently came into force. Fortunately, Ireland is not bound by this directive, not having signed the 1990 Schengen Convention abolishing border controls. As there is no EU imperative for adopting such restrictive legislation in Ireland, it cannot be excused on this ground.</P>
    <P>This document of December 2001 states:</P>
    <P>In conclusion, this legislation will almost certainly result in the obstruction of access to persons at risk of serious human rights abuses to the protection of the Irish State. When Ireland signed and ratified the 1951 Refugee Convention, we undertook to determine the refugee status of anyone wishing to apply for asylum on our territory. By forcing the employees of companies to decide who may and who may not enter its territory, Ireland would be effectively delegating this responsibility to the carrier. If carrier sanctions are put in place, carriers and their staff will be placed in the position of doing the government's job without being equipped to do so. As a result, many men, women and children at risk of serious harm will be prevented from gaining the protection of the State, contrary to our international obligations.</P>
    <P>The Minister made many important points that conflict with the above statement. He mentioned the enlightened approach the Government has taken to migration policy and claimed that our policy is recognised &ldquo;as one of the most liberal in Europe.&rdquo; If section 2(1)(<i>c</i>), to which Amnesty International and other bodies are objecting, is implemented, this will not be the case. The Minister also stated: &ldquo;I have facilitated a range of measures, in particular the &ldquo;kNOw RACISM&rdquo; campaign, to ensure the seeds of racism and xenophobia, which sadly exist to some extent in Irish society, do not flourish in order that all who come to our shores for whatever reason will be treated with dignity and fairness.&rdquo; Again, I respectfully suggest section 2(1)(<i>c</i>) very much conflicts with this claim.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke of a comprehensive new law on immigration and residence in Ireland, something we very much welcome. He also spoke of meeting the evolving needs of Irish society, but, as he said, the Bill is not yet ready. It is merely in preparation and will inform our further policy. Given that this is the case, the Bill might be premature.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he was considering bringing forward amendments to this Bill on Committee Stage and referred to the ongoing review of operations in these areas with a view to ensuring optimum efficiency and delivery of services to non-nationals. He claimed the Government remains committed to honouring our humanitarian obligations under the range of international instruments to which Ireland is a party. Again, I respectfully suggest that some of the measures in the Bill, particularly the point to which Amnesty <Col N="1305" /> International and other bodies are objecting, represent a strange way of showing this commitment.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to wait. We are in the dying days of this Parliament and there is no order for Committee Stage in the House. It does not look like it will be reached. It is not ordered for tomorrow. As I do not know when we will be sitting after that, I cannot see the Bill being taken in the other House. Therefore, I do not see the reason it cannot be left in abeyance and receive due consideration. I respect very much that the Minister has alluded to some very important matters, which he is addressing and intends to bring forward.</P>
    <P>I will deal quickly with some other points. It would be far preferable if we could ensure carriers do not have any passengers rather than placing people at the risk we seem to be placing them at by way of the introduction of section 2.</P>
    <P>Where is the Bill going? It seems to be going nowhere. I am advised that there was a lack of transparency in signing up to some parts of the Schengen agreement to which we have not signed up fully.</P>

      <P>We could be in contravention of the 1951 UN convention. The Minister stated this is a very important Bill, but without addressing some of the matters to which he referred, it is not as important as it should be. It would be much more thorough if we could wait until those matters were addressed. I respect that we need to deal very much with residency law and all the other matters to which the Minister referred. Rather than rushing the Bill through Second Stage without any further plans to take any other Stage in the House, it should be left in abeyance for another while pending the Minister's ongoing review of all these other matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I very much welcome the Bill which is both very important and humane. We have to know who is coming in and going out of the country, particularly who is coming in. With regard to illegal human trafficking, we know the dangerous position into which so many people in poor circumstances are put by criminals who are charging them a lot of money to transport them into the country by hook or by crook. Trafficking leaves a lot of deaths and misery in its wake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must have a Bill like this because it is important that everyone coming into the country is properly documented, has proper visas and we know who they are. Anyone coming in could blow up a ferry &ndash; we have seen what happened in America. We must have stringent controls in the times in which we live. We cannot have an open door policy. My colleague, Senator <Col N="1306" /> Coghlan, quoted people who want such a policy and to let everybody in regardless. We cannot have that; it cannot be done. All carriers should be held accountable to ensure they know who is on their plane, boat, truck or other means of transport.</P>
    <P>It is also important that we have electronic surveillance equipment in order that it will be known if people are hiding in the boots of cars or trucks or containers when boarding various types of transport. They should be checked out in order that we know who they are. This is important for their own safety, because the criminals smuggling them in do not give a curse about their lives. The criminals get their money and do not care whether they smuggle people into the country dead or alive. They are hard hearted individuals looking for big money who pressurise people in poor countries.</P>
    <P>Criminals are bringing people into the country for many reasons. Some are bringing them in for prostitution, promising them great jobs, work and big business. Such people end up in misery. If they had proper documentation, they would not end up in misery because immigration officials would know exactly who they are. We must have a proper system of documentation and the onus must be on the carrier to enforce it. Who else can do it?</P>
    <P>If one is travelling to any country in the world, even if one is a parliamentarian, one has to have a visa and the correct documentation. It is even impossible to get into some countries from which asylum seekers are coming with perfect documentation because the countries concerned do not want to let people in. They are not democracies but dictatorships in which people are suffering. We must ensure all genuine asylum seekers who enter this country are treated fairly and justly.</P>
    <P>Many would say we give better care to asylum seekers than to the poor of our own country, but we certainly treat them as well as possible. I always make sure that I give people from strange countries a salute and let them know they are welcome. It is important to do so and I condemn those who unfairly make critical remarks about them. However, the law has to be upheld. We have to ensure we know who is entering the country and that they are documented.</P>
    <P>Truck drivers should be equipped with electronic equipment to ensure their vehicles are not harbouring illegal immigrants. Many people are entering the country by first taking the boat and then climbing into trucks. It is important that they are documented before they get onto the boat. It is a difficult task because people are prepared to spend money to bring individuals into the country by hook or by crook. This is good legislation and it is important for the safety of passengers, whether on a plane or a boat. They will know that their fellow passengers have proper documentation and are not carrying any weapons or equipment that could endanger lives.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1307" />I welcome the Bill, into which the Minister has put much thought and work. He made it very clear that the Bill is not in any way an anti-asylum seeker measure, but will help asylum seekers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Pardon?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>It will. It will ensure that people have proper documentation so they will not be hassled when they arrive here or possibly be sent back. They will now arrive with the proper documentation, thus enabling a smoother and more efficient processing of asylum applications. This will mean less hardship for people entering the country.</P>
      <P>The Bill is very important from a safety point of view and from the perspective of refugees and immigrants. Every country in the world has such provisions and we must have them also. Thankfully, under the Government, we have a prosperous country to which many people want to come and we are delighted that the Government is sanctioning permits so that many people can come here to work. We want people entering the country because many job vacancies exist. I never thought I would see the day when Ireland would import workers. I saw us export workers for many years. As a young man I often spent an evening in Dún Laoghaire, watching the emigrant ships coming in and going out. Those coming home were always singing and in good spirits, while those leaving were tearful and downhearted and wondered why Ireland was not doing something to get them jobs.</P>
      <P>We are delighted to be able to give jobs to people and to give them a better standard of living than they can obtain in their own countries. However, we must ensure that those entering the country are officially recorded and documented. I congratulate the Minister and his staff on an excellent Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Farrell is a lovely person and one of the loveliest things about him is his innocence. He seems to have swallowed this Bill in its entirety, but I hope to demonstrate how wrong he is. The Bill will damage the rights of asylum seekers; that is the sole reason it was introduced. It is intended to exclude people and it has no interest in the human rights of asylum seekers or refugees under various international treaties. It is designed purely to keep the numbers down. The Minister is an honest man and I am sure he will accept that there is political pressure to keep the numbers down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Did this Bill originate in France? Amnesty International issued a statement in November 2000 noting the initiative of the French Republic seeking a directive aimed at the harmonisation of carrier sanctions in EU member states. Let us think about the French. I wonder if the Minister has been reading Lara Marlowe's excellent series of articles in <i>The Irish Times</i> in recent weeks detailing the activities of the French in Algeria. <Col N="1308" /> They introduced the most barbarous forms of torture, judicial murder, ex-judicial murder and illegal detention. That country is the source of this wish to create an even more fortified Europe.</P>
    <P>Senator Coghlan referred to the fact that we may have escaped certain provisions of the Schengen agreement. He was relying on briefing materials issued by Amnesty International, but the situation has changed since then. The Government formally approved an EU Council of Ministers decision providing for Ireland's accession to certain parts of the Schengen <i>acquis</i>, including the obligation to introduce carrier liability. I am sure the Minister will confirm this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Article 26 of the Schengen <i>acquis </i>has been implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>In other words, I am right. In the Amnesty International statement, it was noted that there is no EU imperative to introduce this legislation, but that is no longer the case. It is now the position that if we do not implement the EU directive, we will eventually be brought before the European Court of Justice by the Commission. That would be splendid. Let us go down that road and be taken to the European Court of Justice because I have no doubt the Bill would be found to be an illegal instrument. The directive's obligations are in breach of international human rights as recognised by the European Court of Justice and there is every chance the court would agree with this view.</P>
      <P>I know Senator Farrell made his observations with real goodness of heart that the Bill will favour refugees. Let us hear it from the horse's mouth. This will impose an obligation on airlines, boats, other carriers and their personnel to act as immigration officers. One of the things we have said repeatedly is that there must be sensitivity in this area, with properly trained personnel. We have not trained our personnel properly yet, or at least not in sufficient numbers, and now we are getting airline crews to do it. It is a compete and utter nonsense.</P>
      <P>British Airways, which is not my favourite airline, has said that such measures have an impact on refugees. This is evidenced by the comments of British Airways to the European Council in October 2000 when it voiced its concerns regarding the UK legislation, which is similar. It said that since carrier liability was introduced no less than 400 passengers on its flights who arrived in the UK without valid travel documents were granted refugee status. If BA had observed the strict letter of the law, these 400 would have been denied the international protection they deserve. That is what British Airways said. That is the effect of this law, which is why I intend to vote against it. It is rotten law that violates people's human rights and it is a disgrace to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another piece of research was conducted by the European Commission &ndash; it is condemning its own legislation. This interim research project, which was carried out by the Commission, found, <Col N="1309" /> among other things, that &ldquo;many asylum seekers. are seeking asylum via trafficking routes as a result of restrictive border control measures&rdquo;. Research for the UNHCR has also shown that the vast majority of asylum seekers now enter Europe in an irregular fashion and more than likely with the assistance of traffickers and smugglers. The main nationalities trafficked and smuggled are those who go on to gain refugee status. That is the situation. I have placed on the record of this House evidence, first, from a commercial airline and, second, from the European Commission. Both highlight precisely the dangers involved in these kinds of measures being incorporated into legislation in terms of a serious violation of people's human rights.</P>
    <P>It is only a week since I was in Buswell's Hotel and met a young Turkish man, several of whose family perished in the containers into which the Minister and his laws will drive further tragic families. This will be followed by another public outcry, but it can be avoided in the first place by not passing this law. I urge my colleagues to vote against it.</P>
    <P>The usual excuse for the introduction of this kind of law is to control irregular migration, but the solution to this problem does not lie in the potentially harmful practice of denying people access to a state's territory. This simply drives the most desperate people into the clutches of traffickers or smugglers. The denial of access has been shown not to prevent entry, but rather to drive people into another channel. I do not believe this is what we should be attempting to do.</P>
    <P>On 16 July last year, the head of the liaison office of UNHCR in Dublin said she was opposed to the planned introduction of this kind of law in Ireland. She stated that, where such a measure obliges carrier staff to check the authenticity of documentation, this &ldquo;delegates an authority which squarely lies with states. and the end result is that people who need access to may effectively be barred.&rdquo;  When I made the same point in a more vague manner a little while ago, I saw that the Minister was shaking his head.</P>
    <P>This sort of restriction undermines the carefully constructed international system for the protection of refugees and circumvents the object and purpose of international treaties dealing with the protection of refugees, including the 1951 Refugee Convention. Such legislation prevents the effective enjoyment of the right to seek and enjoy asylum granted by Article 14 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The result of this legislation may well be that those who cannot flee oppression are left at risk of serious harm. Even those who have the means of escape find themselves placed in the hands of unscrupulous traffickers.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that this type of legislation has met with difficulties in other European countries. I refer to the situation in Austria, where in October 2001 the Austrian constitutional court upheld complaints from three carrier companies <Col N="1310" /> against the same kind of legislation as that which the Minister is seeking to uphold. The Austrian constitutional court said that this legislation is wrong. It argued that the provisions did not state how, in fulfilling the provision, the carrier staff would take into consideration the state's commitments under the Geneva Convention. I want to hear the Minister answer that question. Like the Austrian legislation, the proposed Irish Bill does not refer to the State's obligations under the Geneva Convention.</P>
    <P>This legislation is being brought in to comply with the 1990 Schengen Agreement, which Ireland has recently signed. However, Article 26 of the agreement clearly stipulates that its implementation is subject to obligations arising from the 1951 Geneva Convention. How will the Minister square all of these contradictions? An Austrian court has found that such legislation is unconstitutional because it violates these conventions; Amnesty International and many other organisations here have made the same point; the UNHCR rejects this type of legislation. It is quite clear that everybody does. We have the opportunity to do something glorious &ndash; to stand up for the oppressed. We should let them take us to court, which is what I would like to see happening, and see whether we can justify a position which would be more in favour of refugees.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that this legislation is mean-minded, as is this whole exercise. He is playing a numbers game intended at exclusion. The Minister wishes to keep the greatest number of people possible out of Ireland. He is asking airline staff to act as immigration officers. I wonder if he remembers the case of an unfortunate Congolese woman who became hysterical while being placed on a plane in Brussels. Airline staff, who had been unofficially put into a similar situation to that proposed by the Minister, sat on the woman and smothered her to death. This is the path down which the Minister is driving us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>This will probably be the Minister's last visit to this House in this session. He has come to this House on many occasions over the past five years and he has been a hard working, progressive and innovative Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. This fact may not be publicly acknowledged, but it ought to be. He has introduced more reforming laws during his tenure than many of his predecessors. That is a fact.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>The very last thing this country needs is to become over-emotional about the issue of asylum seekers and refugees. In my con<Col N="1311" /> stituency of Cork North-Central, we have had a sad and sordid example of a politician who&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not finished what I have to say yet. We have a politician who, for naked electoral reasons, decided to jump on the bandwagon. In so doing, he generated and fanned a flame of racism at a very delicate time in Cork. Such behaviour is wrong. That anybody involved in politics should allow such a thing to happen is a sad indictment of each of us. I do not want the presentation of this Bill to be used as an opportunity to add to an element of racism that currently prevails in Ireland.</P>
      <P>I have mixed feelings about this Bill. If the outcome of it is to reduce or eliminate sordid human trafficking, such as happened in Wexford recently and happens in other countries more frequently, the Bill must be supported. Those of us who are truly concerned about human rights must seek to eliminate this exploitation of human misery and hardship. We should have the courage to do so in our laws. We are all aware of the level of international terrorism, drug trafficking and trading in human misery in the world today. We must narrow the range of possibilities that allow such trafficking to flourish and seek to eliminate it. We are obliged to do so.</P>
      <P>I have grave reservations regarding the potential impact of this legislation on people who are fleeing from active persecution. Such people are unlikely to have their documentation in order when they enter any country. How are we to reconcile all that is good in this legislation with the potential harm that it could cause? It is correct to seek to eliminate illegal trafficking and give a measure of protection to drivers of carriers, particularly container type carriers, who find themselves in a dreadful situation with people being smuggled onto their vehicles at the last moment. They need the protection of the law, including all the help we can give them to play their part in ensuring this type of trafficking does not happen. This is the good aspect of the Bill, which I fully support, having included my proviso.</P>
      <P>The Minister has worked hard to put in place a system to deal with an influx of asylum seekers for which this country was neither administratively, psychologically nor historically prepared. Ours was a country where the traffic was in the opposite direction and we had no experience of dealing with this type situation. The Minister had to confront this issue as humanely and speedily as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the number of asylum seekers currently in the country, which is not very big, the Minister has put in place a huge number of additional staff to process applications. Nevertheless, in deference to those already here, we must seek to extend the numbers of staff to deal more speedily with applications. This is crucially important if we are to be seen to respond in a humane fashion. <Col N="1312" /> Those who can stay in the country should be allowed to take up employment as soon as possible. It is the only way refugees or asylum seekers will integrate in Irish society. We all know from experience that it is with the people with whom we work we begin to integrate. There can be no integration until people are allowed to work. Therefore, I ask the Minister to make an additional effort to speed up the process in order that we can enable asylum seekers currently in the country to take up employment and give them that dignity.</P>
    <P>Great efforts have been made in some areas to assist refugees and asylum seekers. The VEC in Cork city holds special language and socialisation classes and so on which have been offered to asylum seekers. There is a very good uptake. This is making a difference and helping to break down the horrible prejudice. While asylum seekers have their own special classes, they also attend classes with others with similar needs.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to teachers in schools throughout the country who were not prepared for this phenomenon. When I visit schools I now see a range of different nationalities. It is a great time to get young people because they mix and mingle with Irish people and form a neighbourly relationship, which is good. I pay tribute to the schools for the work they have done in this regard.</P>
    <P>I have little more to say on the issue except that I have no doubt the issues and fears I have expressed will be examined in greater detail on Committee Stage. However, I recognise the nakedness of an island country like this which does not have a law in place in line with the countries surrounding it. There are those who, from an idealistic point of view, would argue for a total open door policy. I would prefer if we had a policy which would, not just allow people to be admitted, but would have proper education, health and housing provisions in place. This would enable Ireland, not just to be a place where people are welcome at the borders, but where refugees and asylum seekers' human needs are properly looked after and where there is parity of provision between asylum seekers, refugees and our own people. That is the ideal which we can achieve if we seek to properly regulate the matter.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to look again at this issue. I do not know how it can be done, but he has expertise which I do not have. At the end of the day those most in need and fleeing from the most active of persecutors should not be the first victims of this law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Lest the House thinks there is any conflict between Senator Quill and me in regard to our exchanges, I was merely trying to intervene to agree and congratulate her. She spoke about utterances made by certain people in her constituency, which is very regrettable. I am pleased she raised these issues. There is a sad irony in this for her and perhaps politics in Ireland because <Col N="1313" /> she lost her seat in the constituency during the last general election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">

      <P>To the gentleman concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the very point I wanted to make. It certainly does not mark progress. It is a rather ironic outcome, given Senator Quill's courageous stance in the constituency, where obviously, if one is to believe public opinion polls, there is a gallery to which one can play on the subject.</P>
      <P>This is further legislation which reinforces our participation in the fortress Europe policy being adopted by every EU member state and which certainly goes against the spirit of good human rights practice and the tide in the world today. All human history is about the migration and the movement of people which is the reason there is diversity all over the globe. Because of major political upheaval in eastern and central Europe ten years ago, including total adjustment from one economic system to another, there is a movement of people from south eastern Europe to this country and other countries in western Europe. This is accompanied by a large movement of people from the continent of Africa, in particular, the poorest continent on the globe, which in real terms is poorer today than it was ten years ago because of corruption and failure of the economy in any of its major countries.</P>
      <P>As part of this human family, we all have an obligation to look after our fellow human beings. As one of the smallest countries in Europe, we are <i>per capita</i> the recipient of the least number of migrating people as part of this migration phenomenon, yet we are the first to jump in line with the policies of the countries which wish to operate a fortress Europe policy, which is shameful. Countries such as Hungary have accommodated 80,000 people from the former Yugoslavia. They are not necessarily ethnic Hungarians from Vojvodina &ndash; some are, but many are Roma people or Serbs. The Ukraine, which is supposed to be chaotic and did not make the transition, has accommodated approximately 250,000 Tartars, formerly Crimean Tartars deported by Stalin to Tajikistan. They have now returned to the Crimean region of the Ukraine. Despite its difficulties, the shambolic state of its economy and its politics generally, the Ukrainian Government has welcomed them. Many have been returned to lands they formerly owned. Would we do so in this country given the current climate of which we are part? We would not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite wrong to devolve responsibility for illegal immigration into this country. This carrier legislation is something that is in the process of enactment in every parliament in the member states of the EU and we are enthusiastically following suit. Placing the responsibility on the carriers for policing ports against illegal immigrants, asylum seekers or refugees is wrong because there is only one possible reaction. They will fear the sanctions of the law and they will deploy all <Col N="1314" /> kinds of methods to ensure that people do not board their ships, planes or vehicles. No doubt they will often act outside the law, which will look the other way because they are doing the dirty work for governments and the legal systems of the various countries.</P>
    <P>We should be no part of this kind of legislation but should give the lead in Europe at Council of Europe level. There should be a proper pan-European approach to the migration of people. That approach should be generous in outlook and should learn from history. In bad economic times Ireland sent millions of its own sons and daughters to the United States, Australia and the United Kingdom. We hoped they would find an amenable situation on arrival in those countries and would be the first to protest if they did not.</P>
    <P>I have had personal experience through work with the Council of Europe of going to almost all the countries of former Yugoslavia and visiting refugee camps and camps for internally displaced people. Their situation was awful. Their human rights and dignity were taken from them and they lived in wretched conditions. If it were not for the work of people such as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees their lives would be appalling. The response of member states of the EU to this phenomenon is hostile and I find that obnoxious and objectionable.</P>
    <P>Our record and history, from the 1920s to the 1960s, show that we sent hundreds of thousands of economic refugees to culturally friendly countries like the United States. Once they left our shores we never thought of what might become of them. Despite the historical hostility that existed to some extent in the United Kingdom we were lucky there was never much hostility towards Irish people. We learnt nothing from history.</P>
    <P>I have been a critic of much of the legislation this Minister has introduced and when I was spokesperson here on justice we had many clashes. I have not spoken on a justice issue for 18 months but I feel compelled to speak today and object to what I see happening. Why do we not look at the example of a country like Hungary and what it can do for people coming from a neighbouring country? A country that has had difficulty making the change from a communist socialist controlled economy to a market economy found the generosity to accommodate 80,000 people. Poland has also done a lot for people from Moldova and accepted thousands of people for shelter and protection until they returned home or were given refugee or asylum status.</P>
    <P>Our policy seems to be to stop everybody from coming into the country. That is the message going out. The Minister will disagree but the message he is sending is that we are an unfriendly country and that the people coming here are &ldquo;false tourists&rdquo; and we should get rid of them.</P>
    <P>It is inappropriate that we should enact this legislation. We should instead give the lead in seeking a pan-European solution through which governments, acting together, would decide to <Col N="1315" /> tackle this phenomenon of our age &ndash; hundreds of thousands of people fleeing their country because their countries' economies have failed them. It is disappointing that given our history we are following enthusiastically this fortress Europe policy. I oppose this Bill and hope we will have some amendments that will tone down its harsher elements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister and his officials. I welcome this important Bill. I sometimes wonder if Senators Connor and Norris live in the real world. Irish people cannot leave the country unless they have proper visas or passports and it should be likewise for those coming into the country. There is no need for people to travel in containers enabling certain people to make vast amounts of money. There is work in this country for people who come in on work permits and there are still companies looking for these people. We must compliment the Minister for Enterprise and Employment on speeding up the process of obtaining work permits and on the improvements in the system.</P>
      <P>It would not be right to have an open-door system of entry. Before 1997 we did not have many applications for work permits, nor were there many illegal immigrants here. Because of the good policies of this Government, the economy has been turned round and it is now the place to work and live. We welcome those who come to the country in the proper manner.</P>
      <P>The number of people who emigrated from Ireland in the past was mentioned. Those people emigrated legally to find work. Hardship cases among immigrants were also mentioned. There are many Irish people working on the ground to improve conditions in some of the countries from which these hardship cases come. The Minister mentioned that the number of people wishing to come to Ireland stands at around 45,000 a year over the last five years. They serve a need where companies and employers require people. Many of those people have come from some of the hardship countries but they have had proper permits.</P>
      <P>We know the unfortunate cases of the people who have died in containers and the numbers involved. That must be stopped. There is an onus on other European countries to do so. I spoke to a driver who travels the Continent and he told me of the stress and strain on hauliers who are under threat of their containers being interfered with and people getting on board. Many of those drivers pick up those containers without knowing they contain illegal immigrants and this leaves a long-term effect on those men. We must recognise that.</P>
      <P>Other countries have a responsibility to tackle the crime bosses and the people who are ripping off immigrants in order to get them into this country. This must be looked at but it is not the responsibility of the Minister or his Department officials. What can they do about it? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1316" />This Bill needs the support of this House to remedy some of the defects in our law. I welcome that and hope that this Bill will be passed through the Houses of the Oireachtas before the election. Other Senators, particularly Senator Norris, spoke about people fleeing from persecution. Nobody wants to see anyone being persecuted or in difficulty and no people are better than the Irish to help out. We have in the past and will in the future. Once people enter our country legally, there will be a welcome for them, as there has been. There are also health aspects to the problem of people who come in illegally.</P>
    <P>We must recognise the great work that has been done in our schools with immigrants. Many illegal immigrants have been catered for well by the schools, the health boards and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform which ensured that people were housed properly while they awaited decisions on their asylum applications. We must recognise what has been done for asylum seekers. Before 1997 no one wanted to come to this country &ndash; most people wanted to get out. We now have a good country with good laws and this Bill is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>Everybody will not agree with all legislation but I support this Bill and I compliment all those concerned with its drafting. I look forward to its early passage through the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I had better welcome the one part of the Bill that I approve of, which is the section that amends the Refugee Act whereby refugees and asylum seekers no longer need the permission of the Minister before they can speak to anyone about their life story or condition. I objected to the original provision very strongly when it was being considered. I said it was a terrible imposition on people to have to seek the Minister's approval before they were in a position to say anything, even to a member of the public.</P>
      <P>The rest of the Bill is appalling. I acknowledge that there is a serious problem regarding the trafficking of people on an international scale, but the Bill lumps asylum seekers and the trafficking of people who are economic refugees. I do not know how the two speakers on the other side of the House thought that asylum seekers could possibly have valid documents with them. I have had much work dealing with asylum seekers, many of whom are in the medical profession and have had to flee their own country, having refused to carry out operations such as the amputation of limbs. They did not have valid documents when they fled because they would not have been allowed to cross the borders if they had tried.</P>
      <P>Some of this is the most two-faced legislation I have seen introduced in a long time. I am particularly angry about the section 2(1)(<i>c</i>) which states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>that each non-national on board the vehicle seeking to land in the State or to pass through a port in the State in order to travel to another <Col N="1317" /> state has with him or her a valid passport or other equivalent document which establishes his or her identity and nationality and, if required by law, a valid Irish transport visa or a valid Irish visa.</P>
    <P>How can anyone think that in these countries people are in a position apply to their ministry for justice for such visas? It is ridiculous.</P>
    <P>I am most annoyed about how hypocritical we are being about this. For the past few weeks in this House, several Members &ndash; particularly Senator Lanigan &ndash; have appealed on behalf of a woman who became pregnant and was sentenced to death in a state in northern Nigeria for alleged adultery. As the Minister and Senators are aware, Sharia law has been introduced into northern Nigeria in 13 or 17 states. It is a serious problem for them and is causing a great deal of dissension between the Muslim and Christian communities. I am sure there are some good points in Sharia law but most people in this country are less than enthusiastic about stoning to death women who are accused of becoming pregnant outside marriage. There was uproar about it and people were encouraged to write to the Nigerian ambassador to say how upset they were. I was one of those who did and was relieved to hear that the woman had been given a reprieve so she could suckle her child but was to be buried up to her neck and stoned to death as soon as the child was weaned. I am further relieved to hear that the woman has now been given a total reprieve.</P>
    <P>There is another woman in the same situation in a nearby town. What would happen if that woman managed to escape with her baby into Mali, crossing the country with a friendly camel driver or in a jeep, eventually reaching Freetown on the west coast of Africa and managing to get on a boat to Ireland? In Freetown nobody knows who is who, so she could give money to a trafficker for false documents because she could certainly not apply for a passport and a visa to go to Ireland in somewhere like Ibadan &ndash; I have never heard of a suggestion so ridiculous in my life.</P>
    <P>The woman is fleeing for her life, on a boat bound for Ireland and manages to get into the port of New Ross where she crawls with her child from a container. The Irish people have been pleading for her life for months, so she expects a warm welcome but is instead told to get back on the boat and get out of the country. This is truly ridiculous. We must be either compassionate to people who are in such situations or we must stop pretending by writing letters to the Nigerian ambassador.</P>
    <P>People from Somalia and Iraq have told me their stories. They gave money to traffickers and got into the country on false papers. They have been allowed to stay because they were asylum seekers and their conditions were shocking. One man however has not been allowed to stay &ndash; he is a doctor who fled because he refused to carry out amputations in the Iraqi army.</P>
    <P>At the same time, President Bush is telling us these regimes are supporting terrorism and must <Col N="1318" /> be bombed. We are told we must support him and that we are either with him or against him. I agree that these regimes do not seem to have the same views on democracy as we do. However, what do we say if one of those people who is trying to support democracy against the regime manages to get out and come here with false papers? They are being told, &ldquo;Sorry, you better get back on the boat.&rdquo; I know we are agreeing with President Bush that &ldquo;you are either with us or against us&rdquo;, but we are being a bit milk and water about this matter.</P>
    <P>Senator Moylan said that Irish people bring their passports and visas with them when they leave here and do not travel illegally. I have never known of anyone having to flee for their lives from Ireland, however, apart from fleeing the IRA, loyalist organisations and drug dealers. We have spoken out strongly about the people who had to leave Northern Ireland. It is outrageous and the IRA should allow them to return, but one cannot compare both situations.</P>
    <P>I have found that some refugees or asylum seekers will not even contact their relations. Some of them are medical practitioners and the Medical Council has tried to see if they could obtain documents to prove that they are doctors so they could get jobs here. Half the health service is dependent on non-EU doctors, so we would be enthusiastic about having some of these highly qualified people working here. Naturally, the Medical Council has to be careful about who it allow in and they are requested to produce copies of their qualifications and registration details. Some of them even have postgraduate degrees but they are too terrified to seek such documentation from their relations, some of whom have no idea where in the world they are based. They know that in doing so they would place their relatives' lives at risk. The idea of having to have valid passports and visas is patently ridiculous because, having fled their homes, asylum seekers are not in a position to produce such documentation.</P>
    <P>Amnesty International has pointed out that the right to asylum and the principle of <i>non-refoulement</i>&ndash; not returning people to countries from which they have fled &ndash; requires that access to the territory of asylum countries, as well as to a fair and satisfactory asylum procedure, is ensured. I do not see how this legislation can support that. How on earth are carriers supposed to be experts in knowing the difference between valid and invalid passports? I gather that it is difficult, even for those involved in immigration control, to spot the difference because the passports have been so cleverly forged.</P>
    <P>Many other countries have run into trouble when introducing similar legislation. I appreciate the difficulties the Minister has had regarding the large number of people arriving in the last few years, but we are now coping with them in a faster and improved manner. It is seriously wrong, however, to ask people who are fleeing for their lives to do the impossible by not allowing them <Col N="1319" /> to have access to our territory so that we can properly assess their status.</P>
    <P>Pregnant refugees and asylum seekers have now become ashamed of their condition in this country. They think people believe they came here purposely to take advantage of the constitutional right of any child born in Ireland to become an Irish citizen. As I pointed out when discussing the case of the woman in northern Nigeria, some of these women had to flee because they are pregnant. We had 15 cases of concealed pregnancy delivered in the Rotunda Hospital last year, the major of whom were refugees or asylum seekers. They tried to keep their pregnancies secret from everyone until they came to the time of delivery, which is unlike the case of someone arriving here just to give birth. I realise that is a problem and that some people almost go into labour on the other side of the Irish Sea before coming here to give birth. However, those women did not insert the provision into the Constitution, where a child born here is entitled to Irish citizenship; we did it ourselves and reinforced it recently in the Good Friday Agreement. It would be a good idea, therefore, if we stopped blaming those women. It is unfortunate that we always seem to blame those who are trying to escape the most appalling circumstances rather than trying to do something for them.</P>
    <P>As regards this legislation, I am also worried about the situation regarding unaccompanied minors. We know that this problem has become more prevalent, although unaccompanied minors are being better dealt with than before. A Nigerian woman is currently before the courts suspected of trafficking in this area. We can cope with this issue, however, and do not need legislation like this. I am willing to give the Minister credit for the fact that we have improved our handling of such matters. It has been a difficult task because it all came upon the Minister very suddenly. It would be better to improve our refugee and asylum procedures rather than introducing legislation like this, which I will oppose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other speakers, particularly Senator Quill, I recognise the work the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, has done during his term of office. I recognise also the valuable contribution he has made to the State and to society in general. He has had to deal with problems that did not face any of his predecessors and on a scale that would test the calibre of any Minister. He has dealt with those problems effectively and humanely. He takes his responsibilities seriously with regard to protecting people who are vulnerable and who come to these shores having fled intolerable regimes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tone of the debate has been, in part, very emotional and not in accordance with the facts. In many respects it has not even been in accordance with the legislation before us. The Bill deals primarily with people who are carriers of persons <Col N="1320" /> into the State. If I or anybody else leaves the State through Dublin Airport, bound for a European country or elsewhere, we would be asked to produce our passport at the departure desk. It is standard international practice that the point of departure is the point at which the carrier is asked to check the intending passenger's capacity to travel. It is reasonable to have a similar procedure for people entering the State.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that during the debate we have confused several categories of people. We have confused people who are bona fide travellers, asylum seekers and refugees. Even within refugee status there are different categories, including political and economic refugees, all of whom have to be dealt with differently. The Minister is aware of that. It is legitimate to expect that any carrier bringing people into the State should have to furnish the State with certain minimum requirements.</P>
    <P>If one looks at the history of the famine ships that went to the United States &ndash; there is one in particular I can think of in Wexford &ndash; one will find the ship's manifest with the name of every person that boarded the vessel in Wexford. That happened back in the 1840s and 1850s, so we are not creating something very different. When a ship went down with all souls, at least it was known who was on board.</P>
    <P>It is true that Irish people were accepted in the United States and other countries over the years but until Ellis Island was established, there were no restrictions on people travelling abroad. Immigrants were welcomed to the United States because the country was being built at the time. We should be careful about the things that are being said in this debate. It is unfortunate that in dealing with these issues people tend to say things that can be of a racist nature. In the recent past we have heard some echoes of fascism that we thought we had left behind in the 1930s and 1940s. They seem to have resurfaced in our country, which is most unfortunate. However, the substance of the Bill has nothing to do with those issues. It has nothing to do with the fact that when such people arrive here, they are ill-treated and vilified by certain sections of society. Neither the Minister nor anybody else would condone such behaviour. We need to be careful how we approach this matter.</P>
    <P>Another aspect is section 5 which deals with the Refugee Act, 1996. Judging by some of the contributions from the Opposition, it is almost as if the Minister had not said anything in his speech. It is worth recording that he said the policy is to ensure anyone arriving in the State who is genuinely in need of its protection is identified as soon as possible after arrival so that he or she can immediately begin the process of integration into society and avail of the rights to which he or she is entitled under the 1951 Convention on the Status of Refugees. Can anyone say that statement is not something that should be applauded? It should, but listening to the Opposition, it is almost as if the Minister never said it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1321" />He also made the following point: &ldquo;The Bill also proposes, in section 5(<i>b</i>), to amend section 19 of the Refugee Act to remove the requirement of the Minister's consent where an asylum seeker himself or herself consents to be identified as such in the media.&rdquo;  The provision under section 5(<i>a</i>)(ii) is to protect asylum seekers from unwarranted intrusion by the media, although they can waive that protection. The Minister is attempting to provide the type of protections any civilised society should provide for these people.</P>
    <P>My view is straightforward. If a person enters the country as an asylum seeker, he or she should be dealt with properly, humanely and correctly by the State. It is an unfortunate fact that these people are confused with others, some of whom have the right to be here and some who do not. I have made the point before that it would be improper for the Minister and he would be accused of being in dereliction of his duty by the Opposition if he were to allow a system that was so liberal that a criminal from Russia or some other country could enter the State with impunity. The Minister would be the first to be vilified if such a person committed an illegal act or some outrage. There must be a balance and the Minister has achieved that in the legislation. There are humane aspects to the legislation which should be upheld.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about our international responsibilities under the Geneva Convention on the Status of Refugees and the New York protocol of 1967. The State undertakes to fulfil its international obligations. It is part of the international community. It will not act in a unilateral way which would be inimical to people who come here in great need. I am sure we would all agree that, if a person must flee a totalitarian regime and has reasonable grounds to believe that his or her life and the lives of his or her family may be at risk, the State should take a humane and reasonable view of that. The difficulty is that we are catching up in terms of the manpower and finance available, not just in the case of asylum seekers and refugees but also in the case of others who want to enter the country legally.</P>
    <P>I thank God that this issue is a product of the economic advances in the country in recent years which have made it an attractive place to come and live in. I also thank God that we are finally being exposed to other cultures, colours and creeds, that the criticism which might have been valid at one time and which was levelled by Mr. Trimble can no longer be said to be true of the State and that we welcome pluralism. We welcome other people into our midst and hope that they integrate successfully, that they will be happy, that they will have jobs and that they will be able to rear their families here. I know that is the Minister's objective.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I welcome the opportunity to speak on this legislation which, from the comments of Senators on this side of the House, is clearly con<Col N="1322" /> troversial. One cannot help but think back to the horrendous news we received one Saturday morning a few months ago that immigrants, in an attempt to enter the country illegally, had been found dead in a container after a dreadful journey. Trafficking is a terrible crime and trafficking in vulnerable illegal immigrants must qualify as one of the worst. I would be delighted to be able to say that the legislation will tackle or go some way towards tackling the problem, but I do not believe it will. If anything, it will make the situation worse.</P>
      <P>As my colleague, Senator Connor, pointed out, Europe is experiencing one of the largest movements of people for a long time. He pointed out that history is marked by movements of people. Our own people have been part of that until recently. When I travelled on the train today, I met a woman who lived near me. She had a large family of children, some of whom went to school with me. I asked her where they were. Some were in England and others in America where she sometimes visited them. I asked if they were there legally and she said they were not and asked how they could achieve legal status. I also met someone yesterday who was on a short visit from America to see his family. He has not a legal status and does not know if he will get back in when he attempts to return. We have one attitude to that when it is our people and another when people come to our country.</P>
      <P>I listened to Senator Quill's constituency colleague, Deputy O'Flynn, on the radio yesterday talking about illegal immigrants, undeserving people and influxes in his constituency. This is a serious topic and how we speak about it is important. What have been described as emotional outbursts on this side of the House have been based on people's genuine and deeply held concerns about how we as members of the European Union deal with this problem.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that, in recent years, we have constructed a fortress around Europe. Despite that, we have not succeeded in keeping people out because they are determined to get in. We must ask ourselves why they are so determined. One need only talk to the people in question and listen to the stories about where they have come from, especially those who have left dire economic and personal circumstances. These are people who have left their country to undertake a hugely perilous journey across Europe in an attempt to make a better life for themselves, often travelling through countries where the language and culture is unknown, in circumstances fraught with danger and in many cases bringing their families with them. The vast majority of people who undertake this journey have a strong desire born out of pure desperation.</P>
      <P>We have seen how the economies of eastern Europe have fared since the fall of the Berlin Wall. People there see a prosperous western Europe, which includes this country, something we should be happy about. They want to be part of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1323" />We have also been in a similar position of seeking economic well-being. Like many thousands of others, as a student I travelled to Germany where people were happy to see us assist their economy during the summer. We were happy to be part of that. Given that people have gone abroad to other countries as near as Britain and as far as the United States and Australia to seek better economic conditions for themselves, why are we so surprised that others should seek that here?</P>
    <P>The immigration of recent years has severely tested the Irish attitude to pluralism and diversity and we have a long road to travel before we can even begin to say we are dealing with it successfully. Because there are no racist signs and billboards on display around the country it might appear, from a public relations aspect, that we are all of one mind on the matter, but when one scratches the surface the reality is very different on the ground. Those who are dark skinned or who look &ldquo;foreign&rdquo; have often been subjected to racist taunts and not exactly been made to feel welcome. We have a long way still to travel in this regard.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Bill, a number of questions arise. How will it work in practice? Leaving aside the whole issue of human rights, as other Senators have commented, how can a person fleeing persecution be expected to have a travel visa or the relevant documentation? Such a requirement really beggars belief. As Senator Taylor-Quinn has pointed out &ndash; I commend her remarks &ndash; our concern, in the context of the Bill, must be with refugees. I hesitate to use the word &ldquo;genuine&rdquo;, having regard to the use of the term by Deputy O'Flynn. How can we, in this House, ensure refugees and those rightfully entitled to ask for asylum will have their rights upheld? Having read the Bill repeatedly, I cannot see how it will achieve this. My greatest concern is that we are actually encouraging trafficking. We are, clearly, attempting to make this more difficult, but I fear it will have quite the opposite effect. We know how desperate people are to get into western Europe, including Ireland, and also that traffickers will go to any lengths to carry out their activities and seek out ways of getting around the legislation. In doing so, they will be taking unfair advantage of the most vulnerable people whom we wish to protect and who will be left in an even more difficult situation.</P>
    <P>For the reasons I have outlined, I cannot support the Bill and ask the Minister, again, to look at how it can operate in practice. How can genuine carriers be expected to be immigration officers? How can they be expected to assess whether a person is carrying the appropriate documentation? This will simply lead to the generation of false documentation. The traffickers will find ways and means of circumventing the legislation and continuing to exploit people. I have no doubt that will continue to happen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>Carriers' liability is a feature of the law in all other states of the European Union and a requirement of the Schengen <i>acquis</i>. I should emphasise that the Schengen <i>acquis </i>is not the primary reason for initiating this Bill, which was already in train long before that. In addition, the UN convention signed at Palermo makes specific reference to the issue of carriers' liability which is recommended as a measure to be put in place against organised crime. It is an important measure in the fight against trafficking in human beings, including women and children for the purposes of sexual exploitation.</P>
      <P>The European Council recently agreed a directive for the harmonisation of carriers' liability penalties. The Council sees carriers' liability as an important element of the response to illegal immigration and the trafficking of human beings into the European Union. As far as we are aware, all countries from which persons arrive in Ireland are signatories to the Geneva Convention and covered by Article 33 which prohibits <i>refoulement</i>.</P>
      <P>The purpose of immigration controls is to protect the security and well-being of citizens. In operating these controls, we must take action against those who try to enter the country illegally and those who facilitate them. Carriers' liability is an important instrument in achieving this objective. To suggest we should take no action to combat illegal immigration, trafficking and people smuggling, on the basis that it may affect asylum seekers, is clearly unsustainable. To do so would leave Ireland totally open to this evil trade, playing into the hands of internationally organised criminals.</P>
      <P>As I have said, other countries have carriers' liability legislation. I am aware that, as Senators have pointed out, Amnesty International has expressed reservations in relation to the Bill. I have great respect for Amnesty International, which does a great deal of important and valuable work on behalf of humanity. However, I do not hold the view which Fine Gael speakers expressed that the fact of Amnesty International being against something means it is wrong. The fact that it is against it does not make it wrong. In this instance, I believe it is wrong.</P>
      <P>Ireland needs this legislation in the same way as every other country. People of many nationalities are currently coming into this country. It is untrue to suggest that we have a fortress mentality. Last year, over 36,000 work visas or permits were issued. Obviously, all of the people who got them came from outside the EEA. They came from very many countries. There is no basis for the accusation that Ireland is building a wall against the world &ndash; that is simply not true and never was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been various criticisms of the Bill on the basis of the suggestion that it puts up the type of wall to which I have referred. However, if one looks at the situation with regard to legal migration to Ireland, the many countries from <Col N="1325" /> which people have been granted Irish work permits are quite widely spread. Some of the countries involved in the 36,436 Irish work permits issued last year were Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, the Philippines, South Africa, Romania, the Czech Republic, Russia, Ukraine and Estonia. With regard to business permissions, these were issued to businessmen from the USA, Hong Kong, Australia, Switzerland, Canada, Russia, New Zealand, India, Malaysia, China, Japan, among other nationalities. Work visas were granted to people from the Philippines, India, Romania, Russia, Ukraine, China, Nigeria, Slovakia, Jordan, Pakistan and other nationalities. Working authorisations were granted to people from South Africa, Australia, the United States, New Zealand, Poland, the Czech Republic, Canada, Zimbabwe, Malaysia, Israel and other countries.</P>
    <P>It is possible for a person to come to this country by making an application for a work permit or visa. I hold to what I said that, at this point in its history, migration to Ireland is the most liberal in western Europe. It has been stated that, by introducing carriers' liability, Ireland will exclude asylum seekers and refugees from access to protection and, therefore, be in breach of its international obligations. That is not true. The introduction by Ireland of an immigration control mechanism already in operation in many jurisdictions throughout the world will not deny protection. We will not, therefore, be in breach of our international obligations. Such protection is not exclusive to Ireland and is available in all of the main countries of embarkation to Ireland for those who wish to seek it.</P>
    <P>International legal commentators recognise that the right to asylum does not grant a right to seek access to whatever state one pleases. The whole concept of asylum shopping is something which the international community rails against. Ireland was a signatory to the Dublin Convention, in which it was quite clear that an individual making an application for asylum was supposed to make it in the country in which he or she could first reasonably have done so. I am not aware of a situation that could arise, therefore, whereby a person seeking to come from France or Britain to Ireland could be denied the right to seek refugee status because they too are signatories to the Geneva Convention of 1951.</P>

The countries from which carriers operate routes into Ireland all have highly developed protection mechanisms available for use by those genuinely in need of protection.</P>

      <P>It is. Most of them are Dublin Convention countries. Ireland does not have exclusive claim to be the only country in the world, or western Europe, which can give protection to those in fear of persecution, and to suggest otherwise is nonsensical. The Oireachtas recently passed the necessary motions for Ireland to opt into many aspects of the Schengen arrangements, including those relating to carrier sanctions. We are glad to participate with our European partners in these arrangements designed to curb illegal immigration and make it difficult for the international criminals who make a handsome and exploitative profit out of illegal immigration, just as we are participating in the development of European policies on regular migration and a harmonised approach to asylum policies and practices.</P>

      <P>Most of the scheduled passenger routes into Ireland are from within Council of Europe states. Accordingly, to that extent, these proposals do not prevent people from arriving in Council of Europe states. The remaining scheduled passenger routes are from North America, where both the United States and Canada already have highly developed asylum systems of their own, and protection is available for those who fear persecution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no inconsistency between the proposals in the current Bill and the often stated policy of the Government to ensure any person arriving in the State who is genuinely in need of the protection of the State is identified as soon as possible after he or she arrives in order that he or she can immediately start the process of integration into society and take up the rights to which they are entitled under the 1951 convention. Nor is there any inconsistency in the strategy of catering for regular migration in Ireland in accordance with Government policies, and the policy of curbing efforts to circumvent immigration controls. By adding to the effectiveness of immigration controls the Bill will make the international organised crime of smuggling and traf<Col N="1327" /> ficking more difficult for those who carry it out and thus reduce the scope for exploitation of vulnerable people as well as for garnering illicit profits.</P>
    <P>The Bill prescribes offences for carriers only, and does not punish improperly documented passengers. There are ample provisions in the Refugee Act, 1996, to protect the right of the person who arrives here claiming asylum to remain here until the application has been brought to a proper termination, whether by completing consideration of it under our own systems or by transferring it to another EU member state under the Dublin Convention. These provisions are not affected in any way by the Bill.</P>
    <P>I think it was stated by Senator Henry that carriers' liability amounts directly or indirectly to constructive <i>refoulement</i>. This is an untenable argument. The<i> non-refoulement</i> principle, enshrined in Article 33 of the 1951 Geneva Convention and Irish law at section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996, prohibits the return of a person to a country where he or she would be at risk of persecution. The notion that Ireland might, even indirectly, seek to subject to <i>refoulement</i> a person refused passage to Ireland by a carrier as a result of the Bill simply does not hold water, since such a person is not, and has not been, on Irish territory. There is no question in such circumstances of Ireland sending or returning that person anywhere. Where a person goes, or whether a person stays where they are, after being refused passage by a carrier is a matter entirely for him or her and the authorities in the country concerned. All the countries from which carriers operate into the State are parties to the 1951 Refugee Convention, and equally bound by the prohibition on<i> refoulement</i> at Article 33 of the convention.</P>

      <P>I want to deal with the safe country principle also. Leading academic commentators on human rights and refugee law &ndash; most recently, Dr. Rosemary Byrne of TCD and Professor Stephen Legotnsky of Washington University, at a recent seminar on asylum law in Trinity College Dublin &ndash; acknowledge that the right to seek asylum does not imply a right to seek it where one pleases. It follows that the right is satisfied if the individual in need of protection has the opportunity to obtain protection wherever it is that he or she finds himself or herself. It is a matter for the individual to seek to avail of that opportunity. Asylum is available in the countries of embarkation to Ireland, and it is open to someone in need of protection to seek and get it there. The Refugee Act fully respects this provision of the 1951 convention. It is untrue to suggest that we do not issue visas on protection grounds. As recently as 18 months ago, Ireland issued visas and travel documents to many fleeing the turmoil in Kosovo in order to facilitate their arrival in the State. We have done the same in respect of other countries such as Vietnam.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to carriers' liability shifting the State's responsibility in human rights matters onto private carriers, as has been alleged by Senator Norris, it cannot be seriously maintained <Col N="1329" /> that any element of human rights decision-making is involved in a carrier making basic routine checks on an intending passenger's passport or other travel papers. One might equally argue that a carrier which refuses to give free passage to a penniless passenger is thereby potentially interfering with his or her human right to seek asylum in the intended destination. Human rights decision-making will continue to reside where it is at present and where it properly belongs, with the State mechanisms established by law for that purpose.</P>
    <P>It has been stated that carrier sanctions will require carrier staff to undertake the work of immigration officers, which is to grossly overstate the effect of the Bill. This contention was supported by the Fine Gael contributors. Immigration officers have to examine those arriving in the State with reference to a broad range of criteria&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is also the routine task of checking that the person has the appropriate documents. Only the last matter is the subject of the new Bill which does not change, in any respect, the powers and functions of immigration officers. Its effect will be that carriers will carry out the most rudimentary of checks to ensure that a passport is valid and relates to the person presenting it. They will also ensure that, where necessary, there is a current valid visa in the passport. Nothing more is required of them. They will not ask questions about the purpose of the journey or the means of the passenger beyond their ability to pay the fare. Carrier staff will be assisted, as some are at present, by having training and advice provided by immigration officers to help them spot the more obvious forgeries and falsifications. It is, basically, a mechanical task.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The allegation that the asylum obligations of the State will be transferred to carriers is utterly without foundation. The notion that carriers would, as a result of this legislation, be expected to assess an intending passenger's need for protection is as absurd as the notion that a carrier, in deciding not to sell a ticket to a person with insufficient credit on his or her credit card, was therefore deciding that the intending passenger had no valid claim on protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Until now, carriers have not had to bother with the issue of the human rights of their passengers, or potential passengers, and this legislation will <Col N="1330" /> not change that position. A rudimentary check for travel documentation cannot, by any stretch of the imagination, be considered equal to the sort of consideration it is incumbent on states to apply to decisions regarding the entry of individuals to their territory. That responsibility will remain exclusively one of states. It has been asserted in some quarters that the complexity of the issue means decisions relating to undocumented passengers should only be taken by trained staff, following a full and comprehensive evaluation of international and national law. The logic of this assertion is that carrier companies should continually weigh up the human rights implications of selling tickets to intending passengers, which is utterly untenable.</P>
    <P>In the normal course of business, carriers have two very straightforward and purely commercial issues to determine at the point of embarkation The first is to determine if the intending customer has sufficient money to pay for his or her ticket and the second is to decide whether he or she is likely to cause a problem for the carrier during the passage, or on arrival. Neither of these matters involves any consideration of international law or human rights law and the first can usually be determined readily at the point of intended embarkation. The second can be more problematic for the carrier and depends on a number of factors, including the health or condition of the intending passenger and whether he or she will be admitted to the destination country at the end of the journey. A carrier may think twice about allowing an obviously drunk person to board, particularly in the case of an aircraft.</P>
    <P>This legislation puts a limited aspect of this last factor on a clear legislative basis. A carrier can now be confident that the passenger is unlikely to be refused entry because of improper documentation. These provisions are in ease not only of the bona fide traveller, but also of the carrier since it is generally the responsibility of the carrier to return a person refused entry to his or her place of embarkation or country of origin. The carrier must bear the cost of the return.</P>
    <P>It has been asserted that carrier liability will drive people into the hands of traffickers and smugglers. Smuggling is, by definition, the business of illegitimately circumventing legal controls and the very existence of any such controls can be said to drive people into the hands of smugglers. One can eliminate smuggling by abolishing controls. One could also eliminate the trafficking in drugs by legalising them, but that is not an option in the way the same course of action is not an option in this case. The submission itself accepts that there must be immigration controls. The additional immigration controls proposed in the Bill, particularly when combined with the very practical guidelines the Irish Road Haulage Association has agreed with the Garda national immigration bureau and my officials, will make life harder for those engaged in the criminal activity of smuggling and trafficking in humans. Naturally, I make no apology for that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1331" />The closing of access at ports and airports has been cited as a reason for people to seek alternative means of entry by hiding in trucks and containers. They will, therefore, fall victim to people smugglers. The very fact of immigration controls means that smugglers are there to offer services to those who wish to evade those controls. The logic of the argument is that, because people are willing to put themselves at risk, or are willing to offer a service which puts others at risk in order to circumvent legitimate immigration controls, we should abolish the root cause of that risk by removing the controls themselves. Even the harshest critics of this Bill recognise that states have a right to exercise immigration controls. This Bill is intended to make those controls more effective and the fact that it will do that is not any more likely to encourage people to seek out the services of smugglers than is currently the case. As far as people travelling to Ireland are concerned, effective asylum processes are available in the states at either end of the journey and it is open to a person genuinely in need of protection to seek it without having to embark for Ireland.</P>
    <P>Given that the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act, 2000, deals with those who profit from smuggling, it has been stated that carrier sanctions are unnecessary. This argument misunderstands the purpose of this Bill, which is to address the problem of irregular movement into the State of people who do not have the requisite documentation. The aim of the Bill is not to punish people who act mala fide in circumventing the proper immigration processes by smuggling people into the State. Such acts are already addressed by the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act, 2000. The purpose of this Bill is to create an incentive for bona fide carriers to ensure that those they bring to the State meet the requirements for entry, at least as far as the necessary documentation is concerned. It is one part of the approach to the problem, the other being co-operation of immigration staff in helping carriers to comply with the Bill's demands. It must be clear to everybody that clandestine travel is dangerous. What is not self-evident is the rationale behind arguments that would, if carried to their logical conclusion, dictate the elimination of immigration controls in order to eliminate the hazards undertaken by people who seek to circumvent them.</P>
    <P>This legislation addresses the problem of improperly documented non-nationals arriving in the State by requiring carriers to ensure that passengers presented by them for entry have a current, valid passport or other acceptable form of national identity document. Where necessary, a current, valid visa must also be presented. The Bill creates legal obligations for carriers regarding their passengers on arrival in the State and failure to fulfil them will be an offence carrying a fine of &euro;3,000 in each case. Carriers can avoid prosecution by paying an on-the-spot penalty of &euro;1,500 per case. Specific defences provided for in <Col N="1332" /> the Bill are designed to protect carriers who have taken all reasonable measures to ensure compliance.</P>
    <P>This Bill is one of the two essential elements in addressing the question of improperly documented passengers. The other element is co-operation between carriers and the immigration authorities to ensure that potential passengers without the documents required by Irish law can be identified at an earlier stage in their journey. Many countries throughout the world, including all our EU partners, have been operating systems similar to this one for years and have found carrier liability to be a useful additional tool in limiting irregular migration.</P>
    <P>Regular migration to Ireland has grown rapidly in the last few years and the number of visas issued in 2000 was 68,000, with the outturn for 2001 in the region of 100,000. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has greatly increased the number of work permits issued to non-EEA nationals, which has risen to 36,000 in the last year. This figure is indicative of the increase in those coming to Ireland in, I stress, compliance with immigration law. Alongside that, the numbers of those entering or seeking to enter the State irregularly has also grown and to fail to address the issue would be a mistake. It is not unreasonable that those who benefit from carrying passengers to the State should be asked to carry out the basic checks involved in ensuring that those passengers are properly documented.</P>
    <P>This legislation does not arise as a result of the Schengen <i>acquis</i>. It is stand alone legislation. For the record, Article 26 of Schengen provides for carrier liability.</P>
    <P>It was argued that this Bill owed its genesis to a French initiative in November 2001. The Bill was in gestation long before that. Senator Norris advocated that Ireland should flout European directives with a view to having the legitimacy of carrier liability arrangements tested by the European Court of Justice. It is interesting to note that carrier's liability has been in place for many years in many countries which, like Ireland, are parties to the European Convention on Human Rights. Not once in that time has a case come before the European Court of Human Rights seeking to impugn such arrangements, never mind to strike down such arrangements.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the effect of this Bill will be to enable improperly documented asylum seekers who arrive in New Ross to be refused admission. That is not the case. The Refugee Act contains robust provisions guaranteeing admission to the Irish asylum process and to Irish soil in those circumstances. They are not in any way affected by this Bill. With regard to comments attributed to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees liaison office, since the events of 11 September 2001, the head of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees has issued a statement recognising that document checks are an important measure in combating and preventing acts of terrorism.</P>

This includes a significant new proposal published last autumn for the entry of third country nationals for employment and self-employment purposes. If Europe does not take action against those responsible for trafficking and smuggling people, it will leave the door wide open for unscrupulous individuals and gangs to ply their evil trade across our Continent. If we do not firmly tackle this activity, we risk creating more victims such as the unfortunate people who arrived in Wexford last December.</P>

If he is saying that the Bill will not be dealt with throughout the summer until after the election, surely the sensible thing to do, with goodwill all around, is to have the proper consultation we asked for last night, which has not taken place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (1), lines 6 and 7, to delete &ldquo;is unable to benefit from an ordinary school programme&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;needs more than the ordinary school programme&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1336" /> This amendment concerns the definition in section 1, the interpretation section of the Bill. It currently states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;child with special educational needs&rdquo; means a child who, because of attributes arising from a disability, is unable to benefit from an ordinary school programme without special classes or other special education services and cognate expressions shall be construed accordingly;</P>
    <P>In other words, we recognise, define or interpret the phrase &ldquo;child with special educational needs&rdquo; as one who is unable to benefit from an ordinary school programme. I have never seen that written before and it is not logical. I cannot imagine a child who could not get some benefit from an ordinary school programme, even if is only to identify black from white or how to sort something at its most basic level. No child would be unable to benefit from an ordinary school programme. It might be said that children who have severe or profound disabilities could not, but it is impossible to think that there would be no benefit whatever, in any shape or form, obtainable from the ordinary school programme.</P>
    <P>My questioning of this definition is important because the definition would allow a future interpretation in the courts that would not take account of the special needs of a child. Somebody might say: &ldquo;There is a child who could benefit in the sense that he has learned how to lift a spoon or has learned how to tie his shoelaces and therefore he has gained something from the ordinary school programme and could not be defined as a child with special educational needs.&rdquo;  The definition approaches the problem in the wrong way. The Minister should look at the problem from the other side and take a different perspective. Rather than saying that a child with special educational needs is one who is unable to benefit from an ordinary school programme, he should refer to a child who &ldquo;needs more than the ordinary school programme&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>My proposal does not make any significant difference in terms of what the Minister said, but it will prevent a lawyer some time in the future from defining a child as not having special educational needs because he or she has managed to get some benefit, however slight, from some aspect of the ordinary school programme. It defeats the purpose of the Bill to leave the definition as it stands. In the interests of what we are trying to achieve in this legislation, I ask the Minister to concede to my argument and to agree to my amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Will this definition include children with behavioural problems that might interfere with their ability to gain benefits from the ordinary school programme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill refers to the &ldquo;ordinary school programme&rdquo;. It would be ascertained by assessment if a child was not capable of being contained in an ordinary school setting or pro<Col N="1337" /> gramme. If a child in an ordinary school programme is having assessments done by a team of specialists it indicates that the child is not capable of being contained in an ordinary school programme. Therefore, I understand why the definition is used. Senator O'Toole's amendment to substitute &ldquo;needs more than the ordinary school programme&rdquo; for &ldquo;is unable to benefit from an ordinary school programme&rdquo; would lead to the problem of defining what &ldquo;more&rdquo; means in this regard. I have difficulties with the amendment and I am interested in the Minister's views on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>Members would agree that this particular sporting project has generated a significant amount of media and political publicity since the proposal was first mooted. I have on many occasions in this House and in the Dáil made extensive contributions to discussions on the project. I am pleased to be afforded this opportunity to address the Seanad about the position in relation to the aquatic and leisure centre, which is being developed at Abbotstown, to be ready to host the Special Olympics Summer Games in 2003. Since January 2001 funding for the development of this facility is being provided through the Vote of my Department.</P>
      <P>A year before that, in January 2000, the Government decided that the feasibility of developing an aquatic centre to host the Special Olympics Summer Games in 2003 should be actively considered by Campus and Stadium Ireland Limited, CSID, the company set up to oversee the development of the Stadium and Sports Campus Ireland project at Abbotstown. This project is one of the highest priorities of the Government. This is reflected in the quality of the people appointed by the Government to the board of CSID, which is made up of people of the highest calibre in the fields of sport and business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In July 2000 CSID commenced an international competition by inviting tenders under the EU public procurement directive to participate in a negotiated procedure to design, build, finance, operate and maintain an aquatic and leisure centre on the site at Abbotstown. Tenders were to be assessed by CSID, which was also the designated contract awarding authority for the competition. Eight expressions of interest were received. An assessment process, under the auspices of CSID, shortlisted five consortia which were invited to submit outline bids, on the basis of which three were selected to proceed to detailed negotiation stage. The consortia selected were Waterworld UK-Rohcon with S&amp;P Architects, Dublin International Arena Limited and Prospero. Panels including members of CSID, the Office of Public <Col N="1338" /> Works, the Irish Sports Council, Fingal County Council, the National Coaching and Training Centre, Special Olympics 2003 and an international leisure and sports expert assessed the bids. Expert legal advice was provided by McCann Fitzgerald Solicitors and PricewaterhouseCoopers also provided a report on the bidding consortia.</P>
    <P>The assessment panel recommended to the board of CSID that the Waterworld-Rohcon bid, which was also the lowest cost proposal submitted by some &euro;15 million, merited overall top ranking for the award of the contract for the project. The Government, on the basis of the board's recommendation, agreed, in December 2000, that CSID sign heads of agreement with the Waterworld consortium. Heads of agreement were signed by CSID, Rohcon and Waterworld UK on 22 February 2001. The tender included a requirement to establish a special purpose company to operate the pool.</P>
    <P>Dublin Waterworld Limited was set up as the company to act as operators of the pool on completion of the construction phase. This is a private company limited by shares with a shareholding of 4% held by Waterworld UK and the balance by three directors who already have an involvement in the operation of swimming pools in Ireland. Final contract negotiations, on foot of the signed heads of agreement, continued between CSID and the successful consortium through spring into summer 2001. In May 2001 my Department, in consultation with its legal and technical advisers on the project, agreed to CSID's request for approval to issue a letter of intent. The purpose of this was to allow work on the pool to commence pending completion of the final contract negotiations in order to meet the Government's objective of having the pool ready in time for the Special Olympics World Summer Games, which will take place in Ireland next year.</P>
    <P>Following the completion of these negotiations, and subsequent consultations with my Department and its legal and technical advisers, CSID late last year submitted final draft contracts as agreed with the consortium for formal approval prior to signature. Last January, the Government, on the basis of a memorandum submitted by me on the negotiations and resulting final draft contracts, approved the conclusion by Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Limited of its negotiations with the consortium, which I am advised signed the contracts on 7 February last. Following a recent media inquiry, I asked CSID for a comprehensive report on certain issues raised in relation to the contract for operating the aquatic and leisure centre, including specific reference to the role and status of a named company in the tendering process and final award scheme. I received a response from CSID and subsequently sought some further clarifications, which were supplied by CSID.</P>
    <P>In its report to me, CSID again outlined the process, which it undertook in giving effect to the Government decision to procure an aquatic and <Col N="1339" /> leisure centre at Abbotstown. In relation to the status of the operating entity, CSID has confirmed that when the detailed proposal from the consortium which included Waterworld UK Limited was received, the assessment panel's recommendation was that this consortium, based on all aspects of the bid, including design, price, etc, should be selected as the preferred bidder. CSID insist that notwithstanding that Waterworld UK Limited was a dormant company it was entitled, under EU procurement rules, to proceed as part of the bid provided that it was in a position to satisfy CSID that it had available to it the resources from a third party or parties on which it could rely in the performance of the contract, if awarded.</P>
    <P>CSID requested that independently verifiable proof of sufficient backing for Waterworld UK be provided. This was provided to CSID on 7 February 2001 by way of letter of comfort from Anglo Irish Bank, indicating that it was prepared to provide a &euro;3 million guarantee to Waterworld UK Limited in association with the national aquatic centre project. Furthermore, the track record of the individuals who were identified as having responsibility for managing the centre was also considered by CSID to be satisfactory.</P>
    <P>CSID and its legal advisers are satisfied that the contract has been awarded in full accord with the bid received by CSID and in compliance with EU procurement regulations and that the arrangements entered into between Waterworld UK Limited and Dublin Waterworld Limited are the result of normal business negotiations between the parties. There were, however, a number of aspects of the handling of this matter which needed to be urgently reviewed by the board of CSID. I therefore recommended that the executive chairman call an immediate meeting of the board, which took place on 8 March 2002. I received a report on the outcome of the board's review immediately after the meeting. At the same time, the Government informally decided at its meeting on 7 March that I would arrange, following consultation with the Attorney General, for the preparation of an independent report on the matter for the next meeting of the Government.</P>
    <P>It was subsequently agreed on 10 March, by the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, the Attorney General and myself, that an essential input into this report would be an inquiry on issues surrounding the award of the operator's contract for the aquatic and leisure centre at Abbotstown. This inquiry was carried out under the auspices of the Attorney General and focused on issues relating to the corporate governance of CSID in so far as it concerned the process of selecting the preferred bidder. It also examined the processes and procedures adopted within CSID leading to and including the selection process. The Attorney General's team initially examined all documents relating to these issues and followed this up with clarifications with particular individuals where <Col N="1340" /> necessary. The Attorney General stresses that his report does not purport to resolve any conflicts of fact or recollection or to pass any final judgment on the merits or demerits of the behaviours of any individual or company. On the contrary, the purpose of this report is, as requested by the Government, to provide it with a provisional analysis of the issues and to highlight some features of the matters dealt with to assist the Government.</P>
    <P>The draft report was brought to Government on 20 March 2002 and the completed report was delivered yesterday. The Government has made the report available to the Committee of Public Accounts. The Attorney General's report repeats the executive chairman's explanation that he did not bring certain information regarding the contract for the operator for the aquatic centre to the attention of the board of CSID or the Government. However, the Attorney General states that it is important to emphasise his analysis is not suggesting that the decision of the assessment panel to select Rohcon-Waterworld in preference to the other two bidders was unreasonable. For reasons of price and design, the preferred bid was obviously clearly ahead of the other contenders. It has been stated on a number of occasions that even if the information in question had been made available to the assessment panel and the Government, the consortium which was eventually selected as the preferred bidder would have been the same.</P>
    <P>At its meeting to discuss the report yesterday, the Government decided to act on the proposal of the board of CSID to separate the roles of chairperson and chief executive. To ensure that the project proceeds to completion on schedule and in the light of the controversy which has arisen, the Government decided to appoint a senior official of my Department, who is also a member of the board of CSID, as interim chairman of the board. The Government will also make available to the board the services of an appropriate official as an interim chief executive. Mr. Teahon will remain a member of the board of CSID.</P>
    <P>I reiterate the Government's statement that Mr. Paddy Teahon is a person of outstanding integrity and commitment to public service. In carrying out his duties as executive chairperson, he has been committed to contributing to the construction of a set of facilities of which the people of Ireland would be proud. His commitment and achievement in a long career of public service have been widely and deservedly applauded, not least in respect of his contribution to social partnership and the Northern Ireland peace process, especially the Good Friday Agreement. That same commitment is evident in his efforts to ensure that the Government's challenging target of having an aquatic centre available in time for the Special Olympics would be met.</P>
    <P>Despite the recent adverse publicity, I assure the House that the aquatic and leisure centre remains on course for completion by the end of <Col N="1341" /> December next, well in advance of the Special Olympics Summer Games in June 2003. The Special Olympics will be the largest sporting event in the world in 2003 and will involve 7,000 athletes and 3,000 delegates and coaches. All will be accommodated in Ireland during the period of the games. This is the first time the Special Olympics will be staged outside America.</P>
    <P>In addition to the Special Olympics, the pool at Abbotstown will provide state of the art swimming facilities for our competitive swimmers and will also be a major leisure facility for families and the local communities. The pool at Abbotstown will be one of the largest indoor water centres in the world. It will comprise a 50-metre international standard swimming pool, an international standard diving pool-warm up pool, extensive leisure waters, including adventure water rides, seating for 2,500 spectators, a fitness centre and cafes. The pool will feature a moveable boom and floors to allow the pools to be reconfigured for leisure activities. Under the terms of the contract, the operators will make the 50-metre pool available for agreed periods of time for training for Ireland's elite swimmers, as well as emerging promising top class swimmers. The pool will also be available to host competitions. We will have an aquatic and leisure facility of which the country can be proud.</P>
    <P>In relation to the main element of the stadium and campus project, a tender competition for the stadium and other sporting facilities, in the form of a design, build, finance, operate and maintain process, DBFOM, commenced on 20 November 2000. The outline bid stage of the competition closed on 21 June 2001. Bids from three consortia have been received. No decision has been taken to move to the next stage, the detailed negotiation stage, pending the Government's clarification of the future of the project.</P>
    <P>As the stadium and campus project advanced, concern at the potential overall cost of completion was a matter of public comment. To assist it in determining final Exchequer allocations for Stadium and Sports Campus Ireland, the Government decided on 1 May 2001 to conduct an overview study of the likely costs arising and to review the overall approach and contracting strategy with regard to risk identification, management processes and structures, timing and overall cost effectiveness. A steering group was established, under the chairmanship of my Department, and following a public competition, High Point Rendel Limited was appointed to conduct the overview study.</P>
    <P>High Point Rendel finalised its report in November 2001 and it was published on 31 January 2002. The overview set out to assess the estimated costs and revenues arising from developing Stadium and Sports Campus Ireland as defined both at the beginning of the outline bid process and as currently envisaged by CSID. Based on the proposal for a revised scope of project, the HPR report estimates the total cost of the stadium, arena and other facilities are broadly similar to <Col N="1342" /> those of CSID. In addition, the HPR projection provides for a higher contingency amount because of the still evolving nature of the brief and a slightly higher than anticipated inflation level. It also provides for professional costs and a sinking fund.</P>
    <P>HPR considered that a rationalisation of certain facilities within the project could be made, but the extent could be confirmed only after agreement with the main stakeholders. The report also identified a number of issues critical to the realisation of the project, including the need for detailed planning and strong management of the project. The Government has requested that I should report on the implications of the HPR recommendations and options and in particular to evaluate the viability of the existing tendering strategy as a basis for any modification of the stadium design and operation; the implications for the Exchequer of the options and recommendations; and specific issues raised in the report. The consideration of these issues is underway.</P>
    <P>The Government remains committed to the concept of a national stadium and is convinced that a stadium project at Abbotstown is both desirable and feasible. It remains convinced that the Abbotstown campus can, and will be, a vital infrastructural asset for the achievement of national aims in the field of sports, recreation and related tourism.</P>

      <P>One does not know where to begin with this issue. I thank the Minister for his outline, even if he has to be an apologist for what has happened. Oliver Hardy used to say to Stan Laurel: &ldquo;That's another fine mess you've got us into.&rdquo; I can imagine how Paddy Teahon, the fall guy Kerryman who was scapegoated, might feel.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, this project has become embroiled in frightful controversy. There is no doubt the aquatic centre is entirely meritorious. We all sincerely hope that the proper procedures will be put in place and that the centre will be ready for the Special Olympics. I had a few words on Radio Kerry this morning with a distinguished Fianna Fáil colleague and councillor, for whom I have a lot of time. He was asked by the interviewer, as I was, about Mr. Paddy Teahon and how he would summarise what happened. He said: &ldquo;It is as simple as this, Niall, Paddy Teahon was in the wrong place at the wrong time. There is an election in prospect and certain people cannot appear to take the blame.&rdquo; He seemed to imply that Mr. Teahon was expected to roll over, lie down and play dead. However, I am pleased he will remain on as a director, even if he was prised out of both roles.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to recall. I took note of what the councillor said. In fact, I largely agreed with him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1343" />A large element of the Government is trying to face both ways on the issue. The Minister said that Mr. Teahon was guilty of a lack of information and not bringing forward certain points. He also referred to his very distinguished record of public service, with which I wholeheartedly agree. He has been a very fine public servant throughout his career, including in the Taoiseach's Department. I do not know what hoops he was expected to jump through or what pressure the Government or others may have put him under.</P>
    <P>In regard to the other Kerryman and businessmen involved, there is nothing wrong with their record in business. It is just that they got caught up with this dormant company with Virgin Islands connections. I am not sure whether they can be held responsible for that.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste either agreed or compromised on this issue. We do not know which because we are not privy to the negotiations. Perhaps the Minister will enlighten us as he attended the Cabinet meeting yesterday. The decision of the Government was to stand Mr. Teahon down. There was an admission that corners were cut, but we do not know precisely where they were cut. I am not sure we have been fully informed in that regard. In fairness to Mr. Teahon, he was hand-picked by the Taoiseach who would have known his style. Therefore, if there was something wrong with his style, the Taoiseach is culpable. Mr. Teahon, in turn, hand picked Laura Magahy and her company. I have a lot of respect for Des O'Malley, as have all Members of this House, and he was very trenchant in his comments about the Magahy company and the contract. I do not wish to get into that aspect but his words were harsh. I greatly respect his judgment but I am not aware of all the arguments.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General's report was highly critical. We are led to believe that there was a lack of consultation all round. In terms of Deputy O'Malley's comments and the executive services management, there are probably further questions to be asked in that regard. There may be questions about the memorandum brought to Government. I understand it may have come from CSID. I also read it was the Taoiseach who briefed the Cabinet in advance of the decision being made.</P>
    <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General was also rather scathing in his analysis. He spoke about incomplete corporate governance of the project and said there was a major deficiency in the way it was run. I also took note of what the chairman of the Office of Public Works, Barry Murphy, said because he seemed to be very unhappy. These are major players in the State and I have no reason to believe they are not exemplary civil servants who are doing their best for Ireland incorporated. The lesson I draw from the remarks of Mr. Purcell, Mr. Murphy, Deputy O'Malley and the Attorney General is that the Government <Col N="1344" /> needs to get its act together and bring people together. A much more appropriate and cohesive approach must be taken to this issue which is a frightful shambles. It is all over the shop and it is not good for the country.</P>
    <P>In fairness to Mr. Teahon, I do not think he would have hired Dermot Gleeson, a former Attorney General and very eminent senior counsel, to be in his corner. He said he would not resign, he did not break any law and that he did not do anything wrong. The question arising from that is why did the poor man capitulate? What happened during the telephone conversation between him and Mr. Dermot McCarthy, the Secretary General to the Government?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">

      <P>I assume the Minister was privy to what went on. Therefore, I have no reason not to believe him. The question is whether this is a nod and a wink system. I would be interested to know what Mr. McCarthy said. The Tánaiste was very critical of the concept of 1.8% of the overall price for executive services which she said was not sustainable. I do not think we have all the information on that aspect. Perhaps in his response the Minister will fill us in on that matter.</P>
      <P>I believe there are many more questions than the Minister attempted to answer in his speech this evening and we deserve to know. The aquatic centre is a meritorious project which we would all like built on time for the Special Olympics. However, there was a heading in this morning's edition of the <i>Irish Examiner</i>, &ldquo;Teahon move will not end controversy&rdquo;. I had a quick skim through the article from which many questions arise. Everything was above board legally, yet, as the Minister said, certain matters were lacking. The information given to the Government was of a flawed nature, which is what the Attorney General seemed to say in his report. I would like to hear the Minister say something further on the fees. It is something about which the Tánaiste and Deputy O'Malley were very concerned, and perhaps still are. It was a commercial decision of a very unusual nature, to say the least.</P>
      <P>There is the major question of taxpayers' money being invested in projects which people seem to think are poor value. I already referred to what the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Purcell, said and there are questions about the overall cost of the venture and how much it has increased since it was originally projected.</P>

That is healthy for our leisure and social activities.</P>
      <P>This issue emanates from the political football that has been made of the idea of Sports and Stadium Campus Ireland.

It is worth restating what the Minister said:</P>
      <P>For reasons concerned with price and design the preferred bid was, obviously, clearly ahead of the other contenders. It has been stated on a number of occasions that, even if the information in question had been made available to the assessment panel and the Government, the consortium which was eventually selected as the preferred bidder would not have been different.</P>
      <P>That statement is significant in the context of the controversy raging in the media over the last few weeks.</P>

      <P>I would say that it is to raise publicity in one's own right. I have seen colleagues, and I may have done it myself on occasion, reading newspapers or listening to &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; to see what issues they can raise on the Order <Col N="1346" /> of Business to gain publicity. The same thing is prevalent in the Dáil. The more I think about it, the more I feel it is an unhealthy preoccupation.</P>

      <P>The leaders of the Opposition should set a political agenda on the social and economic priorities of the day instead of taking their agenda from the headlines of the morning papers. Much of the political arguments we hear in the Dáil or Seanad, although fortunately not to the same extent in the Seanad, are driven by those headlines. That does not mean that politicians should not have regard for what goes on in the media. The media are an important component of any democratic society. However, there appears to be a kind of incestuous relationship there at the moment and we need to take stock of the situation.</P>
      <P>In this instance it has been clearly outlined that there were eight bidders for the contract. The number was narrowed down to three, one of which was the successful and preferred bidder. I listened with interest to many discussions in the media on this matter over the last number of weeks and heard much ill-informed comment in regard to dormant companies. It was the fact that it concerned a dormant company that initiated the controversy in the first place, but that should not have been a significant issue.</P>
      <P>The only real issue should be the management capability of any of the bidders to successfully administer the project and prove that they had resources available to them. It would not be unusual in such circumstances, particularly where a number of different parties were coming together, that they would establish a company which might not have financial resources but would have access to them in order to operate and run the contract subsequently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Attorney General's report was, in his own words, a provisional analysis to deal with some of the issues that arose and to highlight some of the features. In corporate governance in general the view is that the role of chairman and that of chief executive should be separate to have the right checks and balances. In this instance we must be aware that the executive chairman was under pressure not only to deliver the project, but to do so on time because of our commitments to the Special Olympics. The games organising committee for the Special Olympics in Ireland would have been one of the pressure points. The Special Olympics international committee would also have brought pressure because its reputation and the running of the games depended on the chairman meeting his targets. The sponsors involved and our national image would also have created pressure. The Government also, aware of these issues, would have been mindful of the necessity to have it delivered and finished on time. In that situation it is understandable that somebody of Mr. Teahon's record and capability would be <Col N="1347" /> doing what was necessary to ensure that the project was successfully delivered on time.</P>
    <P>I listened with interest to the reports from the Committee of Public Accounts. Anybody who read the reports would be impressed by Mr. Teahon's integrity and by his interest and commitment to the project. The manner in which he presented himself before the committee was indicative of his commitment and of the integrity with which he carried out his responsibilities.</P>
    <P>Without the background controversy, this matter would probably not have become the issue that it did. We hopefully will have a saner approach to this after the election. The facilities we have in the country, at both local and national level, leave much to be desired. The Minister wants to ensure, in regard to the resources available to him, that basic services are available in any local club to those participating in sport.</P>
    <P>Last year the Minister visited one of my local clubs. The manager of that club told me that since the mid-1970s he has been in charge of many boys ranging from age ten to senior level. In all his time involved with the club, only one young lad has ever become involved in difficulties that brought him to the attention of the Garda. That is indicative of the social benefit we derive from sport.</P>
    <P>The GAA has taken steps to provide a stadium commensurate with current needs but if we look at rugby and soccer, we can see the need for facilities which service the public. As a country that has gained achievement and success at international level in many sports, disproportionate to our population, we should have facilities commensurate with that. The Minister has outlined the facilities that will be available at Abbotstown: a 50 metre international standard pool and diving area, leisure waters and seating for 2,500 spectators. When we look at Campus Stadium Ireland in the future people will be reminded of George Bernard Shaw, who said, &ldquo;Some men see things and say why but I dream of things that never were and say why not?&rdquo; That is the vision we need &ndash; the vision that is driving projects like this that aim to make Ireland a better place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope never to hear anyone in this House describe me as a man of integrity because I know it will be my obituary or they are about to sack me.</P>
      <P>I have listened carefully to this debate over the past two weeks and I have not yet heard the reason Paddy Teahon has had to step aside. He is a decent, highly regarded former public servant, a man who has been diligent, committed, effective and has done all that has been required of him efficiently and effectively. That much was confirmed in the Minister's speech. In the past two weeks he has seen his reputation tainted and has been buried by the media.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take issue with a point made by Senator Walsh by stating that this is a classic example of a Government running madly in front of the <Col N="1348" /> media &ndash; it is not Members on the Order of Business they need to worry about, it is the Government which is worried about comment in the media. I do not know if anybody else has a sense of responsibility or a sense of conscience about this but we are looking at a person who, in the light of the revelations of tribunals in the past two or three years, received no personal gain or enrichment. There was no fraud involved, nor was there commission of anything that was unacceptable. His was a sin of omission. The only point the Government can find is that he did not bring a particular piece of information to the Government. According to the words of the Government and others, had such information been available to the assessment panel and the Government, the consortium which was eventually selected as the preferred bidder would not have been any different.</P>
    <P>What then did Paddy Teahon do? He made a judgment about the quality of the information, he decided not to bother the Government with it and he anticipated correctly &ndash; in the Minister's words &ndash; what the decision would be. I call that effective management. What we see is a victim of the media and a victory of bureaucracy over good and effective management.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the conclusion &ndash; and I have said this before &ndash; that when elephants fight, Kerrymen get trampled. I have seen this time and again. This is a lack of understanding about what is meant by transparency, accountability and the relationship between them. There is a complete and significant difference between taking responsibility, being accountable and being transparent. Transparency is a different thing. Now somebody who is not transparent is considered to be less than completely honest. In the part of the world that I grew up in &ndash; which significantly is Kerry &ndash; we used the word transparent to describe someone who was a bit simple, someone one would not send to the end of the pier to buy a box of mackerel or pull a pint behind the bar. However, we placed much importance and merit on honesty, accountability and taking responsibility. That was what was done here and we are seeing a man who has paid the price.</P>
    <P>I was told he took shortcuts. I answered that I take shortcuts every day in my job &ndash; I only employ people who take shortcuts. I am sick and tired of people who wait around for something to happen before they make it happen. The people who do not say &ldquo;why&rdquo;, but &ldquo;why not&rdquo; are people who skip from here to there as quickly as possible, efficiently, credibly, accurately, honestly and legally and that is what happened here.</P>
    <P>As a senior management person, I have a rule about information which is that I need to know what I need to know. I had better be told what I need to know to ensure that correct decisions are taken. That is a mantra I use in my own organisation and I feel very strongly about it. Most organisations are tied down by useless pieces of information going from one level to another which do not help the quality of the decision <Col N="1349" /> making and often skew the focus of what is sought to be achieved so that we do not see the wood for the trees.</P>
    <P>In dealing with this issue, a good man has paid a price. I feel disturbed by it and to be part of the political process. I have argued for our taking a harder line against politicians who step out of line and that we should be seen to regulate our own procedures and take the strongest measures possible. I have read through this report, looking for the reason someone should be brought to a public hanging, which is what has happened to Paddy Teahon in this case. In any system of reprimand or dealing with a problem, the effective and eventual action must reflect the issue that created it but whatever error made should justify the pain suffered. I defy anybody to prove otherwise.</P>
    <P>I do not want someone telling me there were minor issues. I said last week if someone made a mistake of significance, cost the taxpayer or did something incorrectly they should be made to pay the price. This media frenzy was based on notions of what was done. Somebody in the media told me they had information that EU procurement rules were not followed but, according to the Minister tonight, they were followed. The legal advisers of Campus Stadium Ireland have confirmed that. Even if they turn out to be wrong, he was following his legal advice. We cannot have it every way.</P>
    <P>Deputy Michael Noonan was hammered for following legal advice in the Brigid McCole case. One can never get it right because it is a matter of judgment &ndash; it is not a clear path or route, it is about having people of integrity taking the correct decisions with the information available to them in the best interests of everybody.</P>
    <P>Paddy Teahon must have felt that he had political cover because I have seen that man operate, I have worked with him. I have argued with him over the years and I have never seen him operate without political cover. He must have believed that he was doing right because there is no way he would have taken a decision that he believed would embarrass the Cabinet, nor would he deliberately conceal information from the Government which he felt was important in its reaching a decision. That is proven by the facts because, as the Minister said, there was no question of the decision being any different.</P>
    <P>What we have seen is wrong. It has tainted him and we must have some degree of understanding of what we have done. Who is satisfied today? What is different today? It is just that somebody has been pushed aside. I agree with separating the two roles of chief executive and chairperson, but I would like to see the Government put that in legislation. In large public listed companies that should apply. I have raised that here myself and the investment managers association has been saying it for years. No large organisation should be run by an executive chairman who is also chief executive officer. It cannot be done and it is right that they should be split up. However, that is not the issue.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1350" />In all fairness, the only words in the Minister's speech that apply, as far I can see, are &ldquo;in the light of the controversy&rdquo;. Has the Government taken this action because there is a controversy? What are we doing as politicians? Are we afraid to take action or face up to people? Some of us are involved in controversy every day in our jobs, and most Senators have experienced it in some shape or form. In the light of controversy we should try to make the correct decisions, not defuse the controversy. We can live with, and through, the controversy as long as we are doing the right thing.</P>
    <P>I recognise that people may be attempting to deal with this matter correctly but there has been a sacrificial victim, which is unfair. On many occasions I have defended people or argued with them, but I have always tried to be absolutely direct in my assessments. On some issues I may have turned out to be wrong but this is basically a flawed outcome that does us no service. In years to come, people will look back and try to analyse this affair. In doing so they will examine this episode and ask why it happened. I believe that time will justify the position of Mr. Paddy Teahon. I hope it does.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I can answer one of the questions posed by Senator Coghlan. The central issue in the controversy over the aquatic centre at Abbotstown is that there must be confidence that the democratically elected Government is provided with accurate and comprehensive information for the decisions it takes regarding taxpayers' money. That fundamental point has also been mentioned by the Minister in some of the exchanges during this debate.</P>
      <P>If there is one conclusion to be made today, it is that confidence has been restored, as it should be. This has been a difficult decision for the principals involved. We all regret the difficult personal situations that people find themselves in on occasions like this, but the imperative must be to restore confidence in full, democratic accountability for public money.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole spoke about the need to know, so that he could make the correct decisions and make them properly. The need to know is at the heart of the matter. It has been the Tánaiste's concern for a number of months that taxpayers' money is at stake and that the Government was being left in a poor position to secure the taxpayers' interest through flawed negotiations and lack of information provided to it. Other lessons can be learned about the negotiation and management of a bid process. They will be of value going into other public projects and particularly in public private partnerships, so some good has come of these events in recent days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our focus must be on ensuring that the public interest is well served through these difficult events and decisions. Any fair-minded person will give credit to the Attorney General and the permanent staff of his office for the clarity and comprehensiveness of the report he produced for the <Col N="1351" /> Government. The Government was absolutely correct to publish the report, with all the supporting documentation, so that interested parties, the public, and people like Senator O'Toole, can see the full picture and take their own view. In essence, the report of the Attorney General shows the extent to which the Government was not kept fully informed about the aquatic centre contract and the people behind the operator company.</P>
    <P>Clearly, there were many occasions when full information could have been given to Government. Only last December, the Government and the Tánaiste put the contracts under a lot of scrutiny but the information given was still incomplete. The Tánaiste confirmed in the Dáil today that full information about what the relevant people in CSID knew about the dormancy of Waterworld UK Limited on 18 December 2000 was given to the Minister only a few weeks ago. This and prior events undermined confidence in information coming from CSID to the Government.</P>
    <P>It is important to differentiate between the construction and operation of the facility. Nobody is suggesting that there has been any problem with the construction of the facility or that it will not be completed on time. Neither has anybody suggested that the Special Olympics will be jeopardised.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General's report also shows that bidders made an attempt to create the impression that Waterworld was a significant operator with 20 years' experience, yet this was wrong. The creation of that false impression should have led CSID to disregard those bidders when that information came to light. This information should have been brought to the attention of the Government. Corporate governance in the private sector would demand no less than that, and would probably demand a great deal more. In addition, corporate governance in the private sector would not tolerate open-ended contracts for executive services or 30-year contracts for the operation of facilities.</P>
    <P>The political response to recent developments has been interesting, to say the least. The Fine Gael and Labour spokespersons on sport have maintained strict radio silence throughout the controversy. That distinguished former sportsman and county colleague of Senator Coghlan's, Deputy Deenihan, was kept well out of sight.</P>

      <P>For Labour, Deputy Rabbitte has been highly critical of the aquatic centre contract and has been very audible on radio, yet his party colleague, Deputy Spring, cut the ground from under him on radio last Saturday. In fact, nobody has given stronger and more unequivocal support to the operating contract at Abbotstown than the former Tánaiste.</P>
      <P>As a party in Government, the Progressive Democrats speak with one voice on this issue. It is no secret that there are differences between the two Government parties on the whole Abbotstown issue. The Progressive Democrats have been concerned for some time at the expanding scale of the project and its rising cost. We have been concerned also about the capability of CSID to manage a project on this vast scale.</P>
      <P>It is because of these concerns that we secured agreement for the appointment of independent consultants to conduct an overview study of the whole project. Those consultants &ndash; High Point Rendel Limited, to which the Minister referred &ndash; reported last year and their report was published some weeks ago. The HPR report is an excellent document. It is comprehensive, analytical and questioning. It is based on considerable expertise and a deep knowledge of sporting infrastructure.</P>
      <P>There have been efforts in some quarters to question the credentials of HPR and I would like to address that issue briefly. HPR acted as project managers for the sports complex in Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia which hosted the 1998 Commonwealth Games. This was a massive project by any standards, comprising a 100,000-capacity, roofed, all-seated outdoor stadium built to international standards; an indoor, air-conditioned, 13,000-seat stadium for sporting events such as badminton, boxing, tennis, basketball and gymnastics; and a 3,500-spectator, covered swimming complex with ten-lane, 50-metre competition pool, five-lane training pool and 5-metre diving pool. The project also involved the upgrading of pre-existing facilities and the provision of 5,500 parking spaces.</P>
      <P>The ability to handle such a project is clear evidence that HPR are serious players who know what they are talking about. When they tell us that the Abbotstown project will cost, in total, almost &euro;1 billion to complete I, for one, am prepared to listen to them.</P>
      <P>Writing in <i>The Irish Times</i> last April, the then chairman of CSID wrote: &ldquo;The honest reality is this; this project is being built out of a budget surplus.&rdquo; That was true at the time but the international economic situation means that our budget surplus has declined. The need to invest in hospitals, houses, roads and railways over the next five years will push us to the limit to keep our budget in balance. This means that, by definition, Abbotstown can only be built at the expense of something else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Maastricht criteria put a lid on our ability to borrow and we must live up to our responsi<Col N="1353" /> bilities as members of the eurozone. Given that one cannot spend the same money twice, the next Government will have to choose between Abbotstown and other more pressing needs. My party has made it clear that a vast sports complex on the scale mooted would not be a priority for us and that we could think of better ways of spending the money.</P>
    <P>Some commentators have raced into print in recent months with the conclusion that the Progressive Democrats are anti-Abbotstown and, therefore, anti-sport. On a personal level, as someone who has been involved in active sport for 30 years, I find that somewhat insulting. We have reached a sad stage if Members of these Houses must repeatedly make declarations of their interest in sport. Let me make it as clear as I can for the commentators: I am not anti-sport, the Tánaiste is not anti-sport, and the Progressive Democrats are not anti-sport. Nor are we anti-stadium.</P>
    <P>As a regular and paying visitor to Lansdowne Road, I know as well as anybody else how far that ground lags behind its international counterparts, although that does not diminish my affection for it. Our international rugby and soccer sides take to the field in what is now a physically sub-standard stadium, although it is situated in an ideal location and has a great atmosphere on big match days. It is a big step, however, to jump from saying that Lansdowne Road is run down to saying that we need to sink &euro;1 billion into a site at Blanchardstown.</P>
    <P>We do not need an 80,000-seat coliseum in Abbotstown. That would make us one of the few cities in the world to have two such facilities, although we need a second stadium to Croke Park in Dublin, perhaps on a more modest scale, such as one which could accommodate 50,000 spectators. We have had one attempt to get such a stadium off the ground and it failed. It is not beyond the ingenuity of the people, Government and sporting bodies to devise a workable proposal for the development of such a stadium in a cost-effective way that protects the interests of the taxpayer. We must learn lessons from this. We have learnt some and we know that corners cannot be cut with taxpayers' money.</P>

We did not do so for political reasons. We sought the truth. Our concern was the same as that expressed by the Tánaiste, namely, what exactly was happening. Was everything above board and everything done correctly? We waited and saw some results. The Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation said everything was above board. If that was so, why was it necessary to fire Mr. Teahon, a man whom I know only from his good reputation as a hard worker and a focused individual who knew his way around business and the <Col N="1354" /> inner workings of the Dáil?

      <P>These are political decisions. If the man did not do anything wrong, even though his effectiveness was reduced he would still stand on his principle and demand to stay in his job. That is a fact no matter how much the Minister tries to cloud it.</P>
      <P>My party supports the construction of a 50-metre swimming pool and believes it should be in place for the Special Olympic Games. I have a keen interest in swimming and for years hoped that the pool would be located in Galway because of the strong interest there, but unfortunately, it was not. I thought subsequently it might have been improper to have located it there because not many such pools would be built and perhaps the place to locate it would have been somewhere central like Athlone. Instead, it is to be located in Dublin, but I do not disagree with that as long as we get it.</P>
      <P>I know the difficulties swimmers have with training in a 25-metre pool. They have to do too many turns. They cannot get themselves up to Olympic standard without the appropriate facilities. For that reason, we fully support the construction of the 50-metre pool.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, we do not support the idea of what is known as the &ldquo;Bertie bowl&rdquo;. Having listened to some of what Senator Dardis said, I can see that one of the partners in Government feels the same as we do. If &euro;1 billion is to be spent, we had better examine how it will be spent and the long-term effect it will have. The concept of a substantial sports stadium and associated facilities is wonderful and looks good on paper. However, the experience of similarly sized developments in other countries has shown that often they do not pay. The stadium in Australia built for the Olympics is facing bankruptcy. It is easily accessible from Sydney by public transport. Abbotstown is not, although it may be in future <Col N="1355" /> if it is built. The Australian experience has been replicated in other countries with similarly sized projects. The facilities have not been utilised to the full and costs are too great.</P>
    <P>If such a facility is developed in this country, it will benefit those who have realised their potential at the top level. While that is wonderful, we should look at the bottom level. People must become involved in sport at an early stage. Senator O'Toole will say, and I am sure the Minister knows well, that physical education teachers are not attached to national schools. If children are not involved in sport at an early stage, no one will come through at the top level. It does not matter how good the facilities at that level may be if there are no participants. There are many opportunities for young people to spend their time and money, many of them indoors such as computers or listening to music. Unfortunately, many young people do not take the opportunity to become involved in physical exercise. That said, it does not follow that, if they did become involved, all of them would become Olympic sports stars, but it does mean they would be healthier. The Minister would have to agree.</P>
    <P>We know from experience in Canada and the United States that $1 spent on sports facilities saves $3 in the cost of health care provision because the population is healthier. However, for that to be effective, people must become involved at an early stage so that the perception is created of sport as a part of everyday life. I have been involved in education for 35 years and have seen the gradual reduction in the number of children participating in sport. There is a dependency on voluntary contributions and on small sports clubs which scrape by on minimal grants. Will the Minister review the position and build from the bottom up? The top level will be created in time. It will not be done from the top down. It will not work that way if young people are not involved.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House for these important statements. A number of people have called for this debate in recent weeks.</P>
      <P>We must welcome the rapid progress and development of this project which the Minister outlined. The Government decided in July 2000 to proceed with the development of the aquatic centre in Abbotstown which would include facilities for hosting the swimming events of the Special Olympic Summer Games in 2003, with the potential of upgrading the facilities to host European championships. It was proposed that the facility at Abbotstown would feature swimming and diving facilities of an international standard designed for use by élite swimmers as well as by the public. It would also include extensive water leisure facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be one of the world's largest indoor water centres. The Minister outlined that there would be a 50-metre swimming pool and diving pool of international standard, a warm-up pool, <Col N="1356" /> extensive water leisure features, including water rides, seating for 2,500 spectators, which is important, a fitness centre and cafés.</P>
    <P>We have spoken often about our élite swimmers having to leave the country to train. People with an interest in sport have asked why we cannot provide facilities for them in this country. This development is not just for the current generation but also for future generations who will have the training facilities by which they can reach the top in the swimming world.</P>
    <P>This country has got great enjoyment from our athletes' success in the Olympic Games. Getting to the top involves huge financial cost to the athletes and their families to enable them carry out their training programmes abroad and they deserve to be complimented on that. As well as catering for international events, the facilities in north County Dublin will also be a major benefit to the huge population of the Dublin area. The choice of location to ensure excellent access to the facilities is also a major advantage.</P>
    <P>Many people have been greatly confused and concerned by the recent reports in <i>The Irish Times </i>in relation to a dormant, London registered shelf company with assets of only £4 sterling. The Minister and his Government colleagues took the right approach in undertaking to have the matter thoroughly examined by the Attorney General. His very detailed report outlines the developments at each stage of the project. All the companies involved were fully bonded. The significance of the shelf company was exaggerated out of all proportion and it was implied that some of the parties involved could walk away, leaving the Government and the Exchequer to carry the can. The reality is that the companies involved are of the very top class and are fully bonded. Everything was above board, nothing was left to chance in relation to the development of the facilities which we are discussing and those involved are to be complimented on their work.</P>
    <P>Irish people, especially younger people, are saying they want the development completed. With the open draw system now operated by the GAA, Croke Park is not capable of catering for additional sporting fixtures to the extent now required. I agree with Senator Dardis's comments earlier in relation to the need for adequate facilities to enable our soccer and rugby teams display their talents to a wider audience. The aquatic leisure centre is phase one and people are looking to the completion of the remaining elements of the development. In my view, the right party, the right Taoiseach and the right Minister were in place at the right time for the development of those facilities. I welcome the development and compliment the Minister on the way he has driven it forward. I have no doubt the people will remember him and this Government for ensuring that proper facilities are provided for sporting activities, including swimming, Gaelic games, soccer, rugby etc. The Government and the Minister are committed to fulfilling that requirement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation to the House and thank the Leader of the House for, even at this late stage, allocating time to debate this very important issue. For various reasons, sport and leisure activities of all kinds are undoubtedly playing a substantial part in all our lives and featuring in television and radio programmes to an increasing extent. We have shorter working hours, people have more leisure time and sport is an ideal interest to fill that free time. When people go on holidays, they expect hotels to have adequate leisure facilities &ndash; in fact many people will only go to hotels which have such facilities.</P>
      <P>Campus and Stadium Ireland has been well and truly debated in recent weeks in the print media and over the airwaves. The handling of the entire issue leaves a great deal to be desired. From the outset, the Taoiseach made this his pet project to embrace a majority of sporting activities in this country and I am sure his heart was in it, but it has fallen asunder in many ways. The events of the past few weeks are depressing. It is surprising that the Office of Public Works has not had a significant role in this project. The Office of Public Works has done outstanding work throughout the length and breadth of the country, including work of the highest standard on the these buildings where we are meeting. However, in relation to the Campus and Stadium Ireland project, the Government has veered away from the Office of Public Works which, apart from having a member on the board, has only played a back room role in the project. There are aspects of the matter which I simply do not understand.</P>
      <P>I have sympathy for Mr. Paddy Teahon, whom I do not know apart from what I have read and heard of him in recent days, and have no doubt he is a person of the highest calibre and of excellent standing. I fail to understand the basis for Mr. Teahon's recent statement that he would deliver Campus and Stadium Ireland on time and within budget, having regard to the fact that the aquatic centre has already gone over budget by 50%. It was to cost in the region of £30 million and it now stands at £45 million.</P>
      <P>With regard to the involvement of Ms Laura Magahy, her payment structure was on the basis that the more the project cost, the greater her remuneration. In many cases where consultants act on behalf of companies or State bodies, they are paid on the basis of their cost saving achievement. The more they save, the more they are paid. In this case, the greater the cost of the project, the more the consultant stood to gain.</P>
      <P>The handling of this project is incomprehensible to me and to people outside. The Taoiseach must take the blame for what has happened in this regard. I have great sympathy for the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, who has been pushed forward by the Taoiseach to take some of the blame. The Taoiseach has said this is his project. It is called after him &ndash; the &ldquo;Bertie bowl&rdquo;. It is difficult to believe that all this was passed in Cabinet meetings.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. It is somewhat ironic that towards the end of a term of office that is unprecedented in this Department, there is a cloud of sorts hanging over it. Much of the debate on this subject has been misdirected. It is appropriate on his visit to the House that the Minister's achievements in office should be placed on the record. The figures in regard to this are quite staggering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1997 the sports budget was the equivalent of &euro;17 million. This year that budget is &euro;166 million &ndash; an increase of some 900%. Over that period <Col N="1359" /> 2,044 clubs have been funded, to some extent, through the national lottery. The introduction of a minimum grant of &euro;250,000,000 per county ensured that the smaller counties were not discriminated against. That was a very worthwhile achievement. The Minister and his Department have provided support for projects such as the Ryder Cup, the Special Olympics 2003 &ndash; which I will return to later &ndash; and more recently, the UEFA football championships in 2008. By any standards that is a remarkable catalogue of achievement.</P>
    <P>The commitment of the Government to the entire Abbotstown project has been restated:</P>
    <P>The Goverment remains committed to the concept of a national stadium and is convinced that a stadium project at Abbotstown is both desirable and feasible and that the Abbotstown campus can, and will, be a vital infrastructural asset for the achievement of national aims in the fields of sports, recreation and related tourism.</P>
    <P>I wholeheartedly agree, particularly in regard to the infrastructural asset. It is essential if sport, recreation and tourism are to move on to achieve anything like their potential.</P>
    <P>Having been involved in competitive sport for most of my life, I admit to a degree of cynicism in regard to the direction which sport is taking, particularly at the higher levels. I do not have to go into the detail of the problems being encountered at Olympic level and at the top level of international competition in regard to drugs. It is a travesty and does no service to the individuals involved at a voluntary level who form the base of the pyramid that is the culture of sport throughout the world. The trust that those athletes placed in their coaches and in the voluntary workers at the outset of their careers is being blatantly betrayed when they move on to this higher level of achievement. Short-cuts are taken in the never ending search for success. The drugs factor in sport is greatly to be regretted and does no favours at all to those involved at the base of the pyramid.</P>
    <P>As a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Tourism, Sport and Recreation, last week I had the privilege to witness a delegation of Special Olympics athletes make a magnificent presentation. For one who has become somewhat cynical in regard to the direction sport is taking and the dilution of the traditional ethos of sport, listening to those people talking about the work they put into it and the aspirations they have on running such an event in this country next year was heart warming. It had all the best elements of sport &ndash; voluntary effort, State support and the individual aspiring to excellence.</P>
    <P>The 2003 Special Olympics will be one of the great sporting occasions in Irish history. It will be the largest sporting event in the world in 2003, involving 7,000 athletes and 3,000 delegates and coaches. It will be a huge event by any standards <Col N="1360" /> and will be an enormous event by Irish standards. It is probably being somewhat overshadowed at the moment by the prospect of World Cup 2002, but I have no doubt that when the excitement of Japan and Korea dies down and we begin to focus on what is next on the sporting agenda, the enormity of what is involved in the Special Olympics will hit us. It is a project which will provide a lasting and hugely beneficial legacy, not only to Irish sportspeople but to the nation. It will give us an entirely new awareness of the potential of those less fortunate in society than ourselves.</P>
    <P>I mention that particularly in the context of the pressure that was involved in moving along the Campus Stadium Ireland project specifically to facilitate the holding of those games. Having listened to those people last week and studied their presentation I do not hesitate to recommend every possible support and I congratulate the Government and this Minister on the support they have given to that project. If it had been completed before this controversy arose, the dispute would have been very much diluted. The prize is certainly well worth the hassle of the obstacles encountered along the way to reaching it.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of individual finger pointing throughout this controversy. I have a copy of the Attorney General's report, which was published today, and wish to refer to an extract from page 30.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimGlennonFF" hpid="Mr. Glennon Mr. Glennon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glennon</NameTxt>
      <P>I will. It states that S&amp;P Architects describe Waterworld UK Limited as the UK company of one of the world's leading water park operators, with approximately 20 years' experience operating and managing some of the most popular resorts of the type. Its philosophy is to maintain and improve its place in the market by constantly seeking creative and innovative ways to have fun. From these assertions it is clear that an attempt was made to foster in the minds of Campus and Stadium Ireland's executives the impression during the early stages of the process that Waterworld UK Limited was a leading water park operator with approximately 20 years' experience.</P>
      <P>In the submission made to the project, as described on page 30 of the Attorney General's report, a firm is named which has not come to the fore in the course of the debate and controversy so far. Given the circumstances, I ask where that information came from, because it is patently untrue.</P>

      <P>In many ways the status and success of Ireland internationally are far out of proportion to the size of its territory and population. Many are asking questions, as they are here, about the country's success and on what is based. I read recently in the newspapers that in a number of countries in which elections are taking place opposition parties have put up advertising <Col N="1361" /> hoardings asking the reason those countries cannot do what Ireland has done. That has to be the basis of this debate. We either have vision and confidence in ourselves, or we return to the days of pessimism and scepticism, of which there is an element creeping into the debate.</P>
      <P>Paddy Teahon has been mentioned many times in the House. He described the matter very simply when he said a problem was brought to his attention, he analysed it and found a solution. It is as simple as that. He was approached with the proposed statement and asked the reason he accepted it. He said he did so because he was committed to this project and wanted to see it succeed. I have known him personally for many years and had the privilege of working alongside him on another project which had a North-South dimension. I travelled to Stormont with him and have seen the difficulties and obstacles placed in his way. He had a manner of circumventing such obstacles, overcoming or sidelining them and whatever choice was presented to him, he took one or other of those courses. He was held in the highest esteem by both traditions in Northern Ireland because of his pragmatism. As we all know, the Unionist family is particularly endowed with that same pragmatism which they recognised in Paddy Teahon.</P>
      <P>At first this latest controversy was about the particular issue of the firm involved being a dormant, shelf company. Since then it has become quite evident that people wanted to add to it. This has been happening on a constant basis, which clearly suggests that we see this debate against the background of the original negative response to the project which came from certain quarters. It has made me very sad to see that negative response because I have seen exactly the same thing happen in the case of every other development.</P>
      <P>A great deal of money has been invested in tourism during the years and we have had the fruits of that investment in one of the most successful industries we have ever developed. We were very glad to have it at times when other industries were not successful, but when we were making that investment there were doubting Thomases who believed we were too small to have the ambitions we had and that we should not go down that road. Luckily, we had visionary, pragmatic people who went down it.</P>
      <P>I still remember the huge controversy when Charles J. Haughey proposed the Government Buildings project. I stood in that building with a number of people from Northern Ireland and as they cast their eyes around it, they remarked what a pity it was that they did not have a building like it in the North of Ireland. The same can be said when talking internationally. We will not maintain the status to which I have referred with the begging bowl or as an inferior state, we will do it as an equal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many other projects elicited exactly the same negative response, but I thought we had left those days far behind. When it comes to sport there is <Col N="1362" /> no excuse for not having done so. Is there any person of a certain age who does not get excited by reruns of Ronnie Delaney's Olympics win, or who does not get the same excitement when seeing Dundrum jumping against the clock to win the Aga Khan Trophy? One can take any other sporting exploit going back as far as one likes and see what it did for morale. When Clare came in from the cold and won an All-Ireland, nobody could measure what it meant to the county and Munster. The same is true of our successes in the World Cup. We have seen the welcome our team has got upon returning home. If we want to measure investment, we have to measure what it means to the morale of the nation. If we do any less than what is planned for Campus and Stadium Ireland, we are not being fair to future generations. We have had affluence at our disposal. It is the one area where investment is required.</P>
    <P>I do not mind the public cut and thrust when people want transparency in procedures, but as I watched Paddy Teahon before the Committee of Public Accounts in recent days, I felt ashamed to be Irish and a public representative. This goes far beyond the question of integrity. Here was a man who had a specific and special talent and done great service to the State as a civil servant. When he was appointed chairman and chief executive officer of the project, although I thought it was asking too much of him to fill both positions, I still believed that it was in particularly secure hands. We were asking the man to meet deadlines, to be professional and succeed in completing the project with his hands tied behind his back. Any suggestion that the Government got rid of him is disingenuous in the extreme, because all one has to do is go back a number of steps in this debate to see that it was evident from the beginning that a head on a plate was being demanded. There is no doubt about this. For anybody who made that demand to suggest that they played no part in Paddy Teahon's departure from the positions of chairman and chief executive officer is also disingenuous. The fact that he is prepared to continue as a board member means the project will have continuity and represents a vote of confidence by him in its prospects for success.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation have handled this in a most sensitive manner. I listened to the Minister's speech in which he clearly stated his view and that of the Government of Paddy Teahon's ability, character and service. I guarantee the public sector will look for Paddy Teahon to get involved in many projects in the future.</P>
    <P>Let us leave this behind us once and for all and, for the sake of the country, get on with the project. It has much to offer sport, economics, tourism, the country's image and its youth. It is particularly important that the negativity is sidelined and that this project is brought to fruition. If we do that, we will also do justice to Paddy Teahon.</P>

      <P>People are not opposed to the completion of this project; it is a project few people would have opposed in the first instance. What is wrong, however, is the culture that exists in Irish business, which is almost being given a blessing by Government in this instance. I listened to Senator Ó Murchú speak about people getting rid of the chief executive, Mr. Paddy Teahon. Mr. Teahon was removed by the Government.

      <P>It is not a contradiction. If the Government backed Mr. Paddy Teahon, he would never have resigned. He is not that kind of man. He resigned because of the embarrassment caused and I am not sure that he really caused it. Much pressure was put on him, unfair pressure perhaps, to carry out this project, so he cut corners. It was wrong that the contractor was a dormant shelf company in London with a share capital of £4. He did not tell the Taoiseach, the Minister or members of the Cabinet. However, the Minister has plenty of officials and the Minister or the Taoiseach should have been asking these questions at that time.</P>

That is the simple reality.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister read what Mr. John Purcell, the Comptroller and Auditor General, an independent constitutional officer of the Oireachtas who does the accounts for and is accountable to the Oireachtas, had to say.</P>

Regardless of whether one agrees with Deputy O'Malley, he is an influential Member of the Oireachtas and has a long record of insisting upon the politics of accountability and openness. The <Col N="1364" /> Minister will have read what the Attorney General, the chief law officer of the State and the legal adviser to the Government, had to say about this. It did not make for pleasant reading with regard to how public funding was being managed.</P>

The Minister was responsible and his boss, the Taoiseach, carries ultimate responsibility because it was he who insisted on this project becoming a reality before the general election. That is what this debate is about and there are lessons to be learned.</P>
      <P>There were lessons to be learned from many things in relation to business and where Government and business interface which we should have learned but did not. This affair is a repeat of so many things we have seen in the past. It is a repeat of what has bred so much public cynicism about how the Government goes about its business. In the general election we will be lucky if 60% of the people go out to vote. About 40% will be disillusioned because they are so cynical about the way we conduct our business.</P>
      <P>This project was intended to be carried out as a public private partnership. The Comptroller and Auditor General drew our attention to this. However, we discovered it was being funded almost solely by public money. It is most important that there is clear accountability when public funds are involved.</P>

      <P>We had to make a decision. Paddy Teahon has informed the Government and the Committee of Public Accounts that he made a mistake in not informing the Government of the particular subject matter. There was a number of occasions when Paddy Teahon could have informed the Government. In fact, when the decision was taken on 19 December, Paddy Teahon was present at the Cabinet meeting to explain the project and the process to the Cabinet. Even then, however, he did not use that situation to explain about the shelf company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Glennon raised a serious point. Executive services were bringing forward the information to CSID. Page 30 of the report, as Senator Glennon mentioned, refers to S&amp;P Architects. The Senator quoted what S&amp;P Architects said about Waterworld UK. I understand S&amp;P Architects is a reputable company. If the Senator was receiving this information, as CSID was, from a reputable company regarding Waterworld, he would have had confidence that he was proceeding in the right fashion as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1366" />Unfortunately Waterworld UK turned out to be what has been described by some people as a cowboy company. It had tried this on a number of other occasions, particularly with Southport Council in England, where they tried to use a similar tactic in order to get through to a contract. Unfortunately it turned out that Waterworld UK did not have any financial backing and that this could have repercussions for the public purse. Naturally all sides of the Government decided we should have been informed regarding this specific issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>He should have insisted on knowing these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the reason we took the decision, that it would be impossible for the project to proceed otherwise. Mr. Paddy Teahon, like the good civil servant to the end, accepted the Government's decision and he will carry on as a board member. When all the Opposition Senators are out there in December at the opening of one of the largest water projects in Europe, if not in the world, this country will be proud of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that the Opposition is shedding crocodile tears for Paddy Teahon, it is trying to involve the Taoiseach. They are trying to make it into a political football, making sure they say every morning on the Order of Business that the Taoiseach is responsible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a natural that the Opposition benches would try to involve the Taoiseach. All along it has been the policy of the Opposition benches if they cannot get the man on his policies, they attack him personally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>From the opinion polls, they should have learnt long ago that attacking the personality of a person rather than the policies is not working for them. They will try to involve the Taoiseach in order that he becomes the focus of it. They are really wasting their time in that case because the public know exactly what we are doing and from where we are coming. There is a <Col N="1367" /> great deal of confidence in the way we have handled this matter.</P>
      <P>This project will proceed. The Special Olympics will proceed. It would probably not be capable of proceeding or would not have been at the stage it has reached today and be finished in December without having had a person of the calibre of Paddy Teahon at the helm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>More crocodile tears.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not more crocodile tears. The Senator should go back and check his records.</P>
      <P>A number of other issues arose. Senator O'Toole made an eloquent contribution. The reasons we felt that Paddy could not continue are those which I have outlined.</P>
      <P>Senator Coogan and other Senators made the point that Paddy Teahon knew we had to get the project finished. I said last night that we did put a great deal of pressure on Paddy Teahon in order to get it finished. I did not mean the pressure was just from the Government. There is Special Olympics Ireland, the International Special Olympics and sponsors. Paddy was under pressure from many areas to get this project finished.</P>
      <P>Other Senators mentioned other stadia such as Homebush, which was built for the Olympics. If one takes a look at what we have planned, the whole campus idea was to have sports facilities, headquarters for national governing bodies, water facilities and, surrounding all of that, 100 acres of parkland which everybody in the community could use. There are all of these facilities and there are facilities where hotels and businesses would grow up. It will provide a real spark to that entire area and it will become a hub. That is what is intended. One cannot compare it to Homebush.</P>
      <P>If people wish to view other stadia, they should take a look at the stadium at Munich. The Olympic stadium in Munich is a hive of activity, a total success, and that is the idea on which this one is based. In due course, other stadia will probably come to profitability also.</P>
      <P>Senator Coogan and Senators on the Government benches spoke about the pyramid effect. This Government is trying to build up a sporting infrastructure. As Senator Glennon pointed out, 2,400 projects have been grant-aided. By the end of this week, or certainly by the end of next week, that figure will have risen to nearly 3,000 and we will probably have added another &euro;60 million or &euro;70 million to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>There are deserving projects in my constitutency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an excellent way of spending money. We need to have the facilities for these young people to practise so that one day <Col N="1368" /> they will get to the top. I see no reason that the pyramid should not be here. There are people whose ambition is to play at Lansdowne Road or in Croke Park. We all probably had those dreams and we all want to provide those facilities for young people in the future. We will continue to put money into those facilities.</P>
      <P>Senator Connor asked if I had read the report and what the Committee of Public Accounts said. I know every page of each PR report, the report of the Attorney General and the report of the Committee of Public Accounts. Senator Connor said that the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. John Purcell, had raised certain issues. The Committee of Public Accounts was satisfied to the very end that all the accounting issues were totally above board. That was the conclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>He was critical of the procedures. The Minister does not deny that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>A rebuke from the Comptroller and Auditor General of the accounting of the Department is a serious rebuke.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;Barry Murphy of the Office of Public Works brought forward a list of conflicts of interest. The Secretary General of my Department researched all of those conflicts of interest. Eventually when we came to open up the bids on 21 or 22 June the Attorney General said that all these issues were completely legal, there were no conflicts of interest, and we could go ahead and open up those bids.</P>
      <P>There was also a meeting which we held, I believe, in May of last year, at which Paddy Teahon gave a presentation to the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, the Minister for Finance, myself and officials from all of those Departments. The Office of Public Works was present also. There were no &ldquo;conflict of interests&rdquo; questions raised at that meeting but now that this matter has come to the fore, all of these questions have to be answered, as I am quite confident they will be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>

      <P>On a point of order, why did the Minister mislead the House at 5.50 p.m. this evening? I asked him very clearly then if this Bill would be taken in the other House tomorrow. The Minister told me it would be. I said: &ldquo;So it will be in the other House tomorrow.&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;That is my understanding.&rdquo; It is not being taken tomorrow. It has not been requested. The Whip's office told me a short time ago that it has not been requested and that it is not on the Order of Business for tomorrow in the other House. The Opposition Whips are not aware of it. I spoke to Deputy O'Malley from the Government side and he is not aware of its being taken tomorrow. The Minister deliberately misled this House.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The focus of the definition in the Bill of a child with special educational needs is on the fact that the ordinary school programme is not sufficient for such a child. Something else is required. There may be a need for him or her to attend special classes, to avail of special education services, or both. The definition has been framed in this way to emphasise that a child with special needs will have a right to avail of these extra resources which my Department has made and will continue to make available.</P>
      <P>Senator Henry raised the issue of behavioural problems, which are included if they are assessed needs. For this reason, the definition, as drafted, is sufficient and encompasses what is envisaged in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue is the use of the English language. What matters is not what the Minister intends the definition to mean but what it actually means. Section 1 defines a child with special educational needs as a child who &ldquo;is unable to benefit from an ordinary school programme.&rdquo;  Whatever the intention, that means one thing only, that a child gets no benefit whatsoever. No such child exists, every child will get some benefit, even if it is only learning to distinguish basic numbers and colours. This is important because at some stage some smart lawyer is going to argue that a particular child does not fit the description of a child with special educational needs because, even though he or she has a reading age ten years behind that of his or her peers or is moderately or even severely mentally handicapped, it can be proved that he or she has learned basic addition, how to make his or her way to the toilet or how to lift a spoon.</P>
      <P>We are talking about a child who in the first place is in an ordinary school, and trying to determine whether he or she has special needs. There will be no child in a school, however, who will not have obtained some benefit from it. The Minister talked about a situation where a school programme is &ldquo;not sufficient&rdquo; and something else is required. That is exactly what I agree with, but the definition in section 1 does not meet it, it does quite the opposite. My amendment would redress this by substituting the phrase &ldquo;needs more than an ordinary school programme.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Senator Ormonde asked whether we would then have to define the word &ldquo;more&rdquo;. That is what the education plan is, the plan is designed to ascertain the additional needs of a child. The issue is very simple, the potential for a legal expert to interpret the word &ldquo;benefit&rdquo; literally. If a child gets any benefit at all, it means that he or she cannot be defined as a child with special educational needs. There is no argument about this, unless I cannot read English.</P>

As matters stand, the Bill states a child with special educational needs is one who is unable to benefit from an ordinary school programme, among other things. There is no such child, all children will benefit to some extent, no matter what their level of disability. The Minister is suggesting that on Report Stage he will propose to substitute the words &ldquo;to the extent that a child without such attributes would benefit&rdquo;.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The council must ensure that the education of a child with special needs takes place alongside the education of children who do not have such needs. This is usually described as integrated education or inclusion. I am pleased to note that the Minister has not used these words in the Bill because words go out of fashion so quickly in this territory.</P>
      <P>Children with a disability must be educated in the ordinary classroom, provided that certain conditions are met. These include the needs of the child, the wishes of his or her parents, the efficient provision of an education for those children alongside whom the child will be educated and the efficient use of resources. The needs of the child are particularly important. Very often, a parent may prefer that their child should attend the local school, despite their learning difficulties and the fact that they may never reach the level of ordinary children. That is understandable. However, this choice would be wrong if the special needs assessment of the child indicated that he or she would do better were they enrolled at a special needs school. It is important the child is educated in the establishment wherein they can achieve their potential. Integrated education should always be based on what is best for the child.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 6, subsection (5), line 24, after &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;and may convene a suitable team as outlined in <i>subsection (2)</i> and <i>(3)</i> of <i>section 9</i>&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The basis for this amendment is a recognition of how schools actually function. The principal of any school, regardless of its size, is under extraordinary pressure in terms of his or her work. They never have enough time to do everything that is required of them. Many principals of small schools have a full class responsibility in addition to the other tasks that come with their position. There are management, educational, functional and parental requirements with which they must deal, and that is only the tip of the iceberg. Every time we pass new legislation in these Houses, we put additional work on principal teachers in particular and the school authorities in general. The principal is the key person in any school and he or she must be the fulcrum upon which progress is levered.</P>
      <P>Regardless of any prior knowledge of a child's abilities, each school has to produce a individual education plan for him or her. What the Bill refers to as an &lsquo;education plan' is more commonly referred to as an IEP, an individual education plan. Each plan is child-centred. The principal may do that and it is a very intensive job of work, looking at every aspect of the child's education from the curriculum to psychological, physical and social requirements.</P>
      <P>Yesterday I asked a fellow teacher for a response to the Bill's provision that the education plan should include the goals which any child is to achieve during any period not exceeding 12 months. He said that the idea of goals to be achieved in the course of the year has no relevance in these situations. That teacher said that if he could get a child to learn how to lift a spoon, that would represent an extraordinary achievement. That is an extreme situation but it is part of the spectrum of disabilities about which we are talking. It begins at that level. I am not suggesting that such a child would be dealt with in an ordinary school, but I need to give the example to explain the education plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Principals will be very angry that this is being introduced following their meeting with the Minister in regard to the various difficulties involved in their work. They are now being given more responsibility without negotiations taking place <Col N="1378" /> or agreement on the resources and how the work can be done. I am asking the Minister to give a commitment tonight that before the proposals are implemented there will be absolute agreement with the INTO that resources will be made available to these principals. I will return to that matter.</P>
    <P>The reason my amendment refers to section 9(2) and (3) is the proposal that the principal can decide the best person to do the education plan is the special educational needs organiser. Section 9 outlines a whole list of support structures that can be put in place legally and on a statutory basis by the special educational needs organiser. In other words, the special educational needs organiser can bring together a team of people, including psychologists, to deal with these requirements. This is the special educational needs organiser's only duty and that person has a team to carry out the work, and rightly so. However, principal teachers in mainstream schools have many other responsibilities. My amendment proposes that what is put in place in the Bill to support special educational needs organisers should also be available to principal teachers.</P>
    <P>I welcome the recognition in the section of the importance of the role of school principals and teaching staff. I said a great deal last night and I have much more to say about how teachers, particularly principal teachers, will feel badly put out by this proposal. Nevertheless, they will also feel there is at least a recognition of their role in this regard. Resources should be put in place to marry the two positions. Obviously, the principal teacher could delegate this responsibility but this needs to be made clear in the Act. There is a reference that this can be done by a teacher, but it should be clear that this additional function is something the principal might decide would be more appropriately done by someone else in the school, for a variety of reasons. There might be a special class teacher, a resource teacher or a visiting teacher who the principal might conclude would do the job more effectively. For that reason, it should be made clear that this function could be devolved to an appropriate member of staff.</P>

      <P>Having had experience of dealing with and devising an education plan for special educational needs in special areas, I agree with much that Senator O'Toole said. We need to ensure there is a team, including an educational psychologist, a remedial teacher, a career guidance teacher and perhaps a class teacher or resource teacher. That would arise in any event. However, Senator O'Toole is correct that perhaps it should be spelt out more clearly. I would like to hear the Minister's views on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator O'Toole in this regard. Looking at it from a layman's point of view &ndash; I am neither an educationalist nor a teacher &ndash; it seems the Minister is putting unbe<Col N="1379" /> lievable responsibility on principals of schools, whether small or big schools, without any additional resources. Will the principal have to carry out a formal assessment of each student in the school before he can invite in teachers with special responsibilities? If a principal does not detect that a particular student has a problem, would it leave him open to litigation in the future whereby he could be sued in the courts by the family or student involved for not detecting that the student had special needs when young? </P>
      <P>I support Senator O'Toole's amendment because this section needs to be developed further. Perhaps there could be some form of template which would include resources and special needs teachers who could visit each school. This aspect warrants debate with the leaders of the various unions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very important to have goals. They may be simple goals or small goals but they must be agreed goals. As Senators pointed out, particularly Senator O'Toole, lifting a spoon in some instances is a goal while identifying letters and communication are goals in other cases and there are various ways this can happen. It is important that there are goals and that they are set out rather than just drifting on.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole was concerned about the support services and resources, which is the purpose of the Bill. The national council for special education will have responsibility and resources to provide the necessary supports.</P>
      <P>It is provided in the Education Act that the principal can delegate. The principal in the school will have an obligation to prepare an education plan for the appropriate education of the child concerned. In having this responsibility, it obviously makes sense that a principal should have access to the advice &ndash; I accept that should be made very clear &ndash; of the multi-disciplinary team in the same way as a special needs organiser where an education plan is prepared at the direction of the council. I, therefore, agree with the thrust of Senator O'Toole's amendment and I am persuaded by his contribution of the value of such an amendment.</P>
      <P>However, with the permission of the House, I would like to table an alternative amendment on Report Stage which will encapsulate the Senator's proposal. The amendment would read, &ldquo;&nbsp;&lsquo;In page 6, subsection (5), line 24, after &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;having regard to section 9 subsection (2) and (3)'&nbsp;&rdquo;. This is the section which deals with the group of persons and inter-disciplinary team. This should make the proposal absolutely clear, as the Senator pointed out. It was suggested to me that this would be the appropriate amendment. I thank the Senator for his suggestion.</P>

      <P>There is a dichotomy here which the Chair might help me resolve. It has just ruled out of order two of my amendments and unfortunately I cannot move them. They both required resources. One said that the school might recoup the costs associated with the production of the education plan and the other asked that the board of management ensure the school principal is supported by any additional staffing required. The Chair ruled them out of order.</P>

      <P>There is no quibble with the Chair's ruling. The Chair is on my side on this. Last night when we asked about the resources we were told they were available. I thought I would spell that out in an amendment but when the Cathaoirleach read it he saw it would cost more money and it was ruled out of order. Last night the Minister said the resources were available, so I need him to tell me how it can cost more money? Perhaps it is a restatement of the money but it cannot be an additional cost.</P>
      <P>The educational plan has to be put together. I have seen the work involved for the principal and what is required and we agree it needs to be done. However, I cannot see how the resources get from where they are to the school authority &ndash; the board of management, the principal, the class teacher or whoever has to do the work. If they have to convene meetings or meet parents, from where does the money come? It is not appropriate for it to come from normal school funding. I am now suspicious because I put forward an amendment in order to have clarity on the matter but the Chair thinks it will cost more money. How can that be if the resources are there?</P>

This issue will arise in another section of the Bill and I hope the Minister has an explanation for it. It is unfair for the Chair to rule Senator O'Toole's amendment out of order. Funding is the kernel of the Bill. How can school principals take on considerable additional responsibilities without additional resources? Will they be provided or not?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the Chair is technically correct. I must refer the Senator to section 13 which states, &ldquo;The Minister shall, with the consent of the Minister of Finance, out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, provide for the payment to or in respect of schools and their employees such moneys as are necessary for the provision of appropriate education to children with special educational needs.&rdquo;  I do not want to go into the proposed amendment but listening to the Senator's concerns I propose including in that &ldquo;in accordance with the provision of this Act&rdquo; in order to make it clear we are talking about meeting the provisions of the Act. That is where the funds are provided.</P>
      <P>I know the Senator is concerned that the Minister of Finance is involved. He is constitutionally involved but the key element is that it says &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo;&ndash; the Minister for Education and Science &ndash;&ldquo;shall&rdquo;. It is the Minister who has the obligation and that is a legal and enforceable requirement. Beyond that the Minister for Finance must be consulted and give consent. In a case where &ldquo;the Minister shall&rdquo; there is not much scope for doing anything other than giving consent unless one wants to go to the courts. This provides for procedures in the courts if it is not met.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the Senator's concerns but I think they are well met. On section 13 I will go a little further to ensure they are met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I need clarification on where we stand with this section. Reference has been made to section 13 which must be referred back. I understood that when the Minister for Finance agreed the budget, it went to the Department of <Col N="1382" /> Education and Science and the spending of the education budget was a matter for the Minister. That is why I am worried about section 13. I think it refers to the overall amount of money and is not based on the school or the child. What I do not understand and what is not in the Bill is how the money gets to the school. What is the conduit?</P>
      <P>Section 13 talks about the provision of appropriate education for children. The development of the education plan might happen in one school and the provision of education might be in another school. The payment of the money would not arise in the first school so the principal and school authority will be out of pocket unless there is a way to make it clear. I agree this could be dealt with under section 13 by changing the wording to ensure that expenses properly incurred by schools or school staff under the direction of the board in order to implement all aspects of the Act are covered. It would not just cover the provision of education which might be seen as a narrow view.</P>
      <P>Perhaps we should say that expenses, properly incurred by the school or staff in the preparation or implementation of plans &ndash; which is what the Bill is about &ndash; can and shall be provided by the Minister. That could clarify it significantly so that I can point out to principal teachers that money shall be provided by the Minister for the job they are doing, without their having to face the arguments which they almost certainly would. They may never get around to providing education for a child &ndash; that may happen somewhere else &ndash; but they still have to do the work. There is a huge gap and I need to have a clear commitment that the funds will go to the proper place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why I am putting clarification into section 13 on the point the Senator raises. It relates specifically to the provisions that are here. It is important to understand that this is becoming a demand led scheme, based on assessments. People cannot say I have a blank cheque book. It is an open cheque book, but for properly assessed needs that are in plans, it is not just demand led without responsibility. One must be responsible in relation to the provisions of this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">

      <P>In effect, that is why we have gone along that route because once the needs are assessed the money is being provided.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a contradiction, although I am not saying it is deliberate. Senator Ormonde said this will be done through the Department of Education and Science, whereas the Minister told me it would be done through the national special education board. This is precisely the kind of difficulty I have. These are the questions I will be asked at the conference next week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The funds will come through the estimates which go to the Department. The administrative arrangements will be made through the national council, but in the meantime, before it is established, the money will be paid directly. When it is established, it will be paid by whatever is the most effective way of doing so. In the first instance, authorisation for it will come from the principal of the school, as Senator Ormonde said. It is then an administrative matter. The basic issue is that the money will be there and these elements are being recognised, including the preparation of plans and all that goes with them and the specialists will have to be available.</P>
      <P>There is no question that this is a major change but it is a change that is long overdue. These things are happening not just because we have greater resources. We are giving the support which principals and parent have sought. That has been given as of right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to tell a story and I would like Senator Ormonde in particular to listen and pay attention. I do not say that in a teacher-like way but it may help to guide her absolute trust in the Department &ndash; the &euro;7 million to &euro;70 million place.</P>
      <P>For the past five or six years, schools have been providing payment for psychological assessments of children out of their own resources. I am giving the Minister an opening to come back with his claim regarding the &euro;7 million to &euro;70 million but I need to make my case. I was in a small school near Edenderry where the total funding they received from the State in one year was spent on psychological assessment. Senator Ormonde would be proud, because I told them to send the bill to the Department as it was the appropriate thing to do. The bill came back unpaid. We did it with another school and we were doing it for years until we met that nice man from the Department of Education and Science, Deputy Woods, and we asked if it would not be good to pay these people for doing this. He eventually agreed &ndash; out of the &euro;70 million.</P>
      <P>Now that has been put in place by the Minister and I give him credit for it. It was a progressive move so that when schools in certain circumstances have to carry out psychological assessments, they can recoup the costs. The gap between the schools deciding what they needed to do &ndash; and were required to under the Education Act &ndash; and getting paid for it was years and some of them were never paid. I want to find a place in the Bill that I can point out to doubting principals and school authorities to assure them they are not being set up and they will get the money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have listened to the Minister say that the money comes from the budget to the Department of Finance to the Department of Education and Science to the special education board but what I have not yet heard is how the money gets from <Col N="1385" /> there to the schools. All the Minister needs to say is that all appropriate and proper expenses arising out of the preparation of the plan are redeemable and can be claimed from the Department. That might be funding to do with staffing, resources or assessments &ndash; we do not need to say what they are but that they are appropriate.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Staff will continue to be paid by the Department and the other expenses will be met. I thank the Senator for what he said about the NEPS and its development. We have gone from having 44 psychologists to shortly having 160 when the current interviews are complete. We got approval for the end of this year to increase that figure to 200. We will have in the region of 200 by the end of this year which is a dramatic change. The target contained in the national development plan was that we would reach this figure by 2004. We are, therefore, two years ahead of schedule.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that last year and the year before there were many difficulties, but it was hard to communicate that what was happening would not recur because the NEPS was building up and extending its regional service. As Senator O'Toole mentioned, arrangements are being made on an interim basis where the service is not yet available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Where a parent makes a case to the council to have his or her child included in the register, it is putting unnecessary pressure on the parent. It would seem from the section that the parent has to have all the assessments carried out and give them to the council. Once the parent notifies the council, the obligation should be on the council to get the principal or whoever else is responsible &ndash; as the Minister said, the principal can delegate the responsibility &ndash; to act, in order that it will be up to him or her to provide the assessments for the council. In this instance, the section places too much pressure on the parents of a child to make sure all the assessments are carried out. The council should ask the principal to carry out the assessments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>While I appreciate the Senator's concern, section 5(1) states, &ldquo;A parent of a child who is of opinion that his or her child has special educational needs may apply to the Council to have the child entered in the Register.&rdquo; Therefore, it is the parents who can apply and the organiser will be the person bringing the team together. It can equally come from the school. It leaves the options open in order that parents can be involved. The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is very important in this context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the fail safe method in order that if the parents believe it is not going the way they want, they can apply. It is an extra provision to make sure parents are covered. Parents who have concerns that a child may have special educational needs may bring the matter to the attention of the council by seeking to have their child entered on the register. It is a fail safe mechanism for parents.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>While I appreciate what the Minister is saying, if the parents notify the council that they want their child included in the register, who carries out the assessment? Whose responsibility is it to get the assessments for the board? My reading of it is that the responsibility to make sure the assessments are carried out rests with the parents. My concern with the section is that the responsibility is theirs at that stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the parents in that case, but they can have them done under the NEPS system, as they do at present. It comes back to whether <Col N="1387" /> they want to have them done privately. They can do so, if they wish. Some parents prefer to do so. If they find there is a special difficulty, they can bring it into the system. Others will use the national education psychological service and move forward from there. In that case, an application will be accompanied by any relevant assessments and information concerning the child, as the council deems necessary to reach an informed conclusion regarding the application. It will then decide either to register or decline to do so. Where it declines, the safeguard for parents is that they may appeal the decision within one month to an independent appeals board. This confirms the vital role of parents in the new procedures. While the focus of the Bill is on the rights of children and others with disabilities, we must also support the rights of parents to determine the best route for their child wherever possible.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 7, subsection (1), to delete all words after &ldquo;by&rdquo; in line 42, down to and including &ldquo;psychologist;&rdquo; in line 45, and in page 8 to delete lines 1 to 5, and substitute &ldquo;an educational psychologist.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The difficulty I have with this section is that there is a misfit between the lead-in paragraph and the list below it. I have considered it a lot today since I tabled the amendment. When I look at my amendment, however, it seems to exclude certain matters, which was not my intention. My amendment reflects the point we discussed about the educational needs of a child, which are not best served by a medical practitioner, social worker or therapist. Section 6 states:</P>
      <P>Where the Council receives a notice under <i>section 4 </i>or an application under <i>section 5 </i>the Council may, if it considers it appropriate to do so and subject to <i>section 7(2)</i>, cause an assessment of the educational needs of the child concerned to be carried out.</P>
      <P>The only people who can assess the educational needs of a child are educationists or educational psychologists. That was the point of my objection to the list in the section, and my amendment. I recognise, however, that while my amendment may do what I set out to achieve, it would actually change the intent of the section. The problem is that in assessing the special educational needs of a child it is also necessary to find out and explore other needs closely connected with their educational needs. One set is dependent upon the other. In other words, a child could have a medical condition which would inform or modify his or her educational needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I, and I imagine Senator Burke, were trying to achieve, although I have not discussed it with him and do not want to put words in his mouth, was the inclusion of a form of words such as &ldquo;other connected needs&rdquo; after the word &ldquo;educational&rdquo; in section 7(1) because the section needs something like that. I am not trying to widen the scope of the Bill. It is just that, to determine the educational needs, it may be necessary to investigate other needs. The assessment may need something like that. As well as that, the list of people should include an educational psychologist as well as the psychologist specified or just <Col N="1389" /> an educational psychologist. There would have to be a reference to an educational psychologist as distinct from another type of psychologist.</P>
    <P>I am trying to recognise that educational needs are a matter for educationalists who may be informed by other people. It is a case of how we get to the point of doing that. It is not that I want to exclude any important information which could be made available by others.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand Senator O'Toole's approach. When a child is being assessed, the opinion of an educational psychologist is needed. The matter begins before that because someone must refer the child to the educational psychologist. In the course of an assessment it may be discovered that other aspects of the child's personality need examination and it may be necessary to defer to other expertise. That is covered in the Bill. I am delighted that a social worker is specified because he or she can say a huge amount about other needs. If the social worker and psychologist were to work together, it would allow for a broad assessment of the requirements and needs of the child involved. The process begins with the educational psychologist and moves on from there so that a wide assessment is obtained. I agree with the specification of an educational psychologist. I am not sure about specifying a medical practitioner. Will the Minister give us his views on that? I welcome the other aspects of the section.</P>

      <P>I agree with Senator O'Toole that the psychologist should be an educational psychologist. The aim of our amendment is to make the assessment more of a team effort and that more than one person would be involved in the assessment. That is why we wanted to change the last line in section 7(1) to read:</P>
      <P>.those persons shall include the following&ndash;</P>
      <P>(<i>a</i>) a psychologist;</P>
      <P>(<i>b</i>) a medical practitioner;</P>
      <P>(<i>c</i>) a teacher nominated by the principal of the school which the child is  attending;</P>
      <P>(<i>d</i>) a social worker; and</P>
      <P>(<i>e</i>) a therapist.</P>
      <P>Our amendment would achieve more of a team effort by allowing for a group of the people listed in the section.</P>

      <P>I agree with Senators O'Toole, Burke and Ormonde that the inclusion of the word &ldquo;educational&rdquo; is essential in this section. I do not see the point of Senator Burke's amendment which would change the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; to &ldquo;shall&rdquo;. It may not be necessary to have the other people involved in the assessment, although it may be in some cases. The wording is strong enough to include them if they are necessary. There is no point having people involved in an <Col N="1390" /> assessment if they are not required. I do not go along with what the Senator said, but I agree with Senator O'Toole's suggestion that the word &ldquo;educational&rdquo; should be included.</P>

      <P>I am happy to accept amendment No. 4<i>b</i> as it provides a greater focus on addressing the special education needs of a child in an assessment. Senator O'Toole made this point as well. The purpose of section 7 is to ensure a multidisciplinary approach is taken to the assessment of a child who has or is likely to develop special educational needs. This is extremely important as the response to a child's educational needs is determined not only by educational issues but also health, welfare, therapy and behavioural factors. If we were to limit the assessment to one carried out by an educational psychologist, there would be a danger that it would be inadequate and, therefore, the response could be inappropriate. The approach I have adopted in this provision ensures that a holistic approach is taken to each child's assessment and that this will inform the preparation of the education plan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment which has been conceded because it is important. I will not push my amendment because I am not happy with it and I accept the points the Minister made. However, will he consider the following before I withdraw it? My contention is that the assessment of the educational needs referred to in sections 3(3) and 6 should be done by an educationalist &ndash; someone with an educational qualification, such as an educational psychologist, teacher or whatever. I recognise the importance of the point Senator Burke, the Minister and others made about the input others could make. The Bill states that the assessment should be carried out by a list of people specified. I have an objection to that because a medical practitioner could never be seen as someone who could make a decision on educational needs.</P>
      <P>What could be done is to drop the word &ldquo;by&rdquo; from section 7(1) and replace it with the words &ldquo;with the assistance of&rdquo; so that it would read:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;An assessment under <i>section 3(3)</i> or <i>6</i> shall be carried out with the assistance of persons possessing such expertise as the special educational needs organiser or the Council, as the case may be, considers appropriate; those persons may include one or more of the following&ndash;&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That does not violate the section, recognises it as an educational issue and allows for the team effort to which Senator Burke referred and for the involvement of all the people the Minister <Col N="1391" /> mentioned. It would still involve an educational person and, while the section would stay silent on who would conduct the assessment, it would allow it to take place as an educational issue and allow for the team effort to which Senator Burke referred. Will the Minister consider taking that on board on Report Stage?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 8, subsection (2), lines 9 and 10, to delete &ldquo;and shall not cause the assessment to be carried out without the consent in writing of the parents&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister's advisers will be aware of my views on this and it is a discussion which must take place. I may appear to be doing the unthinkable. The Bill requires parental consent in writing before an assessment can take place. I question and challenge that for the reasons I stated earlier.</P>
      <P>Under our Constitution, a child has the right to be educated and the parent is the prime educator and can make a choice not to exercise that right in person but to entrust that task to the educational system, in other words to ask a school to do it. Those are three distinct rights and they are not mutually exclusive. There have been situations in various parts of the world where parents, for some daft reason, did not wish their child to be educated. Under our Constitution, the Minister is also required to ensure that each child receives a certain minimum level of education and the Education (Welfare) Act was passed a few years ago to ensure that happened. Under that Act if a parent decides he or she will educate a child at home and the Minister's representative or inspector is not facilitated in evaluating or assessing the education the child is receiving, the Minister can intervene and insist that the child goes to school, where evaluation takes place as part of the normal daily classes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The key point is that there is provision for intervention. It is not a matter of the parent's right superseding that of the child &ndash; the Constitution requires the child to be educated. It is perfectly right and proper that parents should be <Col N="1392" /> involved in this process. We do not want a situation to arise, as could happen, where people will decide they do not wish to send their child for assessment, and that they want their child to be at home. This is particularly liable to happen in the context of special education, where people may say they want their child to be happy at home, rather than being educated elsewhere, which may be understandable, although it is not the right thing for the child.</P>
    <P>I do not expect the Minister to be totally supportive of my proposition in this regard but I ask him to make a significant response which will have regard to the constitutional position. In a situation where the Minister or his representative believes a child should be assessed but a parent says &ldquo;No&rdquo;, the rights of the child should prevail in the same way as in the Education (Welfare) Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>To some extent, Senator O'Toole has answered his own question. There are several vehicles for doing what he refers to, including the provision for the State to intervene under the provisions of the Education (Welfare) Act. In this Bill, the State could go to court, if required, but we may make it more explicit and I will consider that when the Bill goes to the Dáil. It requires some consideration and I will look at the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that. There are <i>causes célèbres </i>in this regard, including a case in north Kerry and one in Leitrim, where the Minister's Department has been in and out of court in an effort to get children to attend school. I am not advocating any hasty action. I appreciate there are constitutional issues and I am not a lawyer. However, there is a question of a child's rights being recognised as the core issue. I am prepared to withdraw the amendment on the basis that the Minister is prepared to consider this and bring forward an appropriate wording which also values the parent's involvement. I do not wish it to be seen as any diminution of the parental contribution. It is, rather, a proactive approach in favour of a recognition of the child's rights. Naturally, there should be consultation with the parents but if, in the final analysis, there is a view that an assessment should take place, then it should go ahead.</P>

The register will contain a great deal of information in that regard and I believe it should only be accessed in limited circumstances. It should be treated as privileged information which not everybody can access. The Bill does not appear to specify clearly how this confidentiality will be safeguarded. We are in an era of litigation and there could be negative consequences for a child or a family or it could militate against a person getting a job &ndash; it could have various connotations for the child concerned.

      <P>I move amendment No. 5<i>a</i>:</P>
      <P>In page 10, subsection (2), between lines 27 and 28, to insert the following new paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(<i>h</i>) The teacher to be consulted with regard to the setting of the goals which the child is to achieve as part of the education plan.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This relates to a core element of the Bill. It involves setting up an individual education plan for a child with a disability. In order to deal with the child's special needs, whether it involves autism or whatever, an assessment is required. It could involve a child who is already in a school classroom or it might be a child who is presented for enrolment at a school and the school principal considers an assessment necessary to ensure the child can benefit to the greatest extent from attendance at the school. The next step is to set up the education plan. I am sorry if I appear to draw out the point but it has to be contextualised.</P>
      <P>The education plan will have to look at the nature and degree of the child's disability and how that disability affects his or her educational progress. It continues to the question of educational performance and looks at the precise educational needs, based on earlier consultation with a psychologist or whatever professional guidance is required. The next point is the goal to be achieved by the child over a period not exceeding 12 months. Those are all very important matters and they could relate to a child who is already in the school concerned. I believe that, after eight, the teacher should be consulted with regard to setting the goals the child is to achieve as part of the education plan. It is crucial that the setting of the goals should involve a teacher input and, as the Bill stands, it is unclear if that will happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept it is the Minister's intention to have a teacher consultation but that is not written into the Bill and that could cause problems in the <Col N="1394" /> event of court proceedings. I would welcome the Minister's response.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with most of Senator O'Toole's comments. I believe the matter of goals is already detailed in section 9. I do not particularly like the idea of goals in the context of dealing with people with disability as it may be seen as too great a step for them. I also wish to raise a point in relation to the 12 months provision in this section. Should we specify 12 months when the goals which a child should achieve&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am of the view that it is really a matter for the school or the council to decide what must be included in the education plan. There is a list of matters contained in section 10(2) referring to the education plan. It is not exhaustive and other matters may be included. If the amendment was to be accepted, there would be a risk of the legislation becoming too prescriptive. On the question of the principal or a teacher nominated by the principal, this is already included in section 9(3)(<i>b</i>).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not disagree with that point. Perhaps I have not explained my position clearly. Section 10(2)(<i>g</i>) states the plan will include the name of the school which the child is to attend. This recognises that it could be a different school. It could be any school. The child will arrive at the school with a set of educational goals without any consultation with the teacher in the school who will be dealing with him or her. That is the difficulty I have with it. It is a matter of recognising how this will work on the ground. In terms of the preparation of the plan, if it is all happening in the same school, this issue will not arise, but if the child is going to another school, it will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot see that happening. If a child is assessed in one school and sent to another, there will have to be a correlation between the teams of each respective school regarding the consultation process. That will happen. Section 9(3)(<i>b</i>) refers to &ldquo;the principal of the relevant school, or a teacher nominated by the principal of the relevant school to be a member of the team&rdquo;. What Senator O'Toole fears will not happen.</P>

      <P>I agree with the sentiments behind what Senator O'Toole suggests, but the Minister has pointed to the words in section 9(3)(<i>b</i>) &ldquo;the principal of the relevant school, or a teacher nominated by the principal of the relevant school&rdquo;. I hope the principal could nominate a teacher from the school where it is suggested the child should attend, particularly if he or she is moving from mainstream education to a special school. In such a case it is important that <Col N="1395" /> somebody from the special school is involved in the preparation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the welfare Act, the principal is required to inform the school to which a child is transferring. I would not envisage any particular problems in this regard. We are trying to ensure in law the general package is right. Common sense will prevail in the way in which this is done. The key element is that the principal or the delegated teacher will have a prime function and have to be consulted and involved in the decisions made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty is that common sense does not prevail. Every one of these steps is going to require the agreement of several people. I accept the point made by a number of Senators regarding the principal of the relevant school or a teacher nominated by him or her. That could be stretched to say it might be the school to which the child is going.</P>
      <P>Can anyone imagine a doctor being asked to accept a patient where the remedy has already been prescribed? He or she will have to come to his or her own conclusions. The goals for a child will be set by the teacher in the class. No matter what education plan is put together, any judge in the land will say that the person required to implement it is the one who knows the child. Believe me it is going to happen this way. Someone will produce a Rolls Royce plan and bring it to a teacher in a school who will say he or she is not doing it. The Minister will surely not tell me that will not happen. It will happen &ndash; regularly.</P>
      <P>It will be a matter with which my successor, John Carr, will be left to deal. This needs to be absolutely clear. If we do not have the professional charged with the responsibility of reaching these goals involved in their determination, difficulties will arise. The plan will prove to be incapable of implementation. A class teacher put before a judge will plead that he or she has never met the child before. The child will have come into the class with a set of goals and what is the teacher supposed to do with him or her? A child could be in a school having his or her needs assessed and because of his or her particular disability will be sent to a special school. He or she will be sent there with his or her set of goals, which will have to be put together before a school is named. Naming the school is the last thing to be done. How is it proposed to deal with the issue of a teacher being handed a list of goals without having had any interaction with the child?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it is the case that this is common sense, please indulge me and write it into the legislation in order that we do not have to argue over this any more. If it is clear, let us write it down. I have been dealing with schools for too long now to know where common sense gets me. Common sense would have schools properly funded and properly staffed with all necessary resources. If <Col N="1396" /> common sense were allowed to apply in primary schools I, my successors and I would be out of a job, as there would not be any need for us.</P>

The educational psychologist, career guidance counsellor or whoever else will go to the other school with the case study to detail what is required in regard to the assessment done. All the information involved will be transferred to the other school. The educational psychologist will be dealing with the other school, but if not, there will be an educational psychologist and a class teacher or resource teacher and the principal of the other school with whom to discuss the case which will proceed from there.

      <P>I find the case made by Senator O'Toole to be very convincing. He is somebody intimately concerned with this area. If I understand this correctly, a child could be in a school for a comparatively short space of time while an assessment is made, before being transferred to another school with the plan of campaign already determined. I am not sure that is a good thing, especially if the plan is fixed. It is not even good teaching practice. In a human sense, a teacher developing a relationship with a child feels that he or she has a particular perspective and that a plan will grow organically as the relationship develops. Any good teacher will take the recommendations and expertise of an educational psychologist into account, but the plan should still develop organically. It should not be determined to too great an extent before the child arrives at the place where the teaching will actually take place.</P>

      <P>I do not want to go over ground other Senators have covered, but my question arises from what was said. If a student leaves one school and goes to another, do both principals make out plans? When the child arrives at the new school, does the principal make out a new plan instead of adhering to the plan the child had at the previous school, as set out in the file he or she takes to the second school? Whether it is an ordinary school or a special needs school, does the principal carry out an assessment of each pupil in it?</P>

Section 9(3)(<i>b</i>) specifies that the principal of the relevant school, or a teacher nominated by him or her, is to be a member of the team.

With all due respect, the word &ldquo;proposed&rdquo; here refers to a school at which parents present a child proposing to enrol it. That is the &ldquo;relevant&rdquo; school, which is the point we have been making all along. It is either the school the child is attending or the school at which the child is presented for enrolment. The educational plan begins to be put together at that stage and it is then that it is decided to what school the child will be sent. It is a different school and there is no doubt about that.</P>
      <P>The school which prepares the educational plan is the school at which the parents first arrive, which is not the proposed school. With the best will in the world, people will begin to put the educational plan together and I have no problem with that as there is no other practical way of starting the process. Until one starts the business, one does not know where it will finish. If it is decided that the best place for the child is not the first school to which it was proposed to send him or her, but another one, then there is no doubt that what is in question is another school. The relevant issue is what happens in this other school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1398" />The other school will have its own plean scoile, or school plan, and its own staff and principal with a different way of doing business. The other school will require every teacher to have a scéim seachtaine, or weekly plan, or a plan that fits with the overall school plan, depending on how the school organises itself. That plan is the professional plan of work organised by each person and certain compromises have to be made because there is more than one child in the school. Unless the child with special needs goes into a one-to-one class, which is highly unlikely and hardly ever happens, there will be other children involved and their work obviously will be affected. A new set of activities will have to be implemented, taking into consideration what has to be planned for the other children in the class. We are discussing one child in terms of the legislation and it is correct that it should be child focused, but when these provisions are implemented there will be other children in the classrooms in 99% of cases. A compromise will be made and there will be nothing more irritating than professionally undermining teachers by introducing a child with a set of needs and goals for the year which have to be implemented. People will not buy into that and they will resist and resent it. It is wrong.</P>
    <P>This gets worse. We have had this problem before. It was considered very practical to have shared teachers until somebody asked who was the principal of a teacher attending a number of schools. It is a small question and most of the time and for most people it does not matter, but when it does matter, it has to be answered.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides that, in preparing the educational plan, under section 3, the principal of the school concerned shall, unless he or she decides with the consent of the special educational needs organiser with responsibility for that school that there are good and substantial reasons for not doing so, comply with guidelines for the time being in force under subsection (3). Whoever wrote that might think it is, in Senator Ormonde's word, commonsensical, but no one can go into a school principal and tell him or her how to do their job. Not even a school inspector can make demands of a school principal. He or she can only advise. This provision undermines the authority of the principal and that cannot work. There can only be one person making decisions in a school and that is the principal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a set of bouncing balls here, one going after the other. The difficulty for the INTO is that John Carr, the president, and the union's executive will have to explain to teachers how this will work and these are the questions with which they will have to deal. Clarity is essential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two issues arise from this section, one of which I deal with in the amendment and the other which <Col N="1399" /> is the matter of educational plans. They will cause internal conflict. I have read through this Bill four times and it was only on my last reading, while having a cup of coffee before coming in here, that I spotted this last problem. I immediately saw potential for conflict and any official in the Department of Education and Science will agree with me.</P>
    <P>As regards my amendment, I am told that common sense will prevail, but I do not agree. I am also told that &ldquo;school&rdquo; and &ldquo;relevant school&rdquo; mean different things, but that is not correct. Those issues might be arguable, but the issue of authority is not. The principal is the accounting officer in the school and he or she is responsible for the implementation of the curriculum. An inspector might come in and say that he or she does not like the way something is being done, but while the school is required to listen to his or her advice, the principal does not have to take it if their professional conclusion is that he or she does not want to change the way the school operates. When the Department of Education and Science issues guidelines for certain subjects, there is always flexibility in finding the best way to meet the needs of the school. That will not work here.</P>
    <P>My frustration with the Bill is that it contains good things which are being trapped. I will not vote against the Bill because I want its provisions implemented. However, I might vote against ten things between now and then because I want to make the point that they will cause problems. Both these issues need to be revisited. There is the issue of the authority of the teacher in the classroom and what he or she is required to do professionally and there is the authority of the principal teacher in running the school and what he or she is required to do. There is a genuine conflict there. It is also a professional conflict and it is leading us to a steep cliff.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am becoming more confused as time goes on. This amendment relates to the content of the educational plan. I accept the point made by Senator Norris that any of these plans must be organic. It must grow with people, particularly if it is proposed to move a child from one school to another. Moving to a new classroom and new teacher means relationships must be built before progress can be made. Obviously, therefore, organic development must take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I understand it, the amendment deals with the content of the plan and who is involved in putting the plan together. This issue is covered in section 9. Let us say I am the principal of a school and I believe one of the children would be better off in a different school. I would go to that school and say: &ldquo;We have somebody whom we believe might be more suited to this school.&rdquo;  The principal of the new school will suggest the class that might suit the pupil. It might be for mildly or moderately disabled children. The teacher, there<Col N="1400" /> fore, would be identified and I would talk to the teacher and see what type of programme is likely to be put in place. That would be part of the formation of the educational plan. That is what I believe will happen. It is already happening every day on the ground. The situation is covered in section 9(3)(<i>b</i>). We are running around in circles and getting nowhere.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Toole is right that the principal is the key person in this process. The principal is the authority. However, everybody knows that in the teaching profession there are many chiefs and few indians because everybody is a professional in their own right. That has always worked and will continue to work where professionals are allowed their own space. The professionals, along with the principal, will have this consultation process. It is wrong to suggest that the educational psychologist or the organiser will march into the school and lay down the rules to the principal of the school. There is no way that could happen. Both the Senator and I know it will not happen&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Senator read it? The principal has to get the consent of the organiser. The provision has the same wording as provisions in which the Minister for Education and Science must get the consent of the Minister for Finance to spend money. The English language is simple and the provision reads: &ldquo;.the principal of the school concerned shall, unless he or she decides, with the consent of the special educational needs organiser.&rdquo;. The principal must get the consent and that is being written into law.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>That is untenable, unworkable and unacceptable and it undermines the principal's authority in the school. I believe it also must undermine the provisions of the Education Act, which make the principal responsible for the day to day activities of the school. I have not checked this, but I suspect it comes close to doing that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>We have said a great deal already about this issue. I cannot agree with the Senator and my advice is that he is wrong. Nevertheless, I am prepared to look again, as the Bill progresses, at the points he made in this respect. Subsection (4) deals with compliance with the guidelines. There are guidelines in every situation. They are devised in conjunction with the social partners. That is what is involved here. In the event of one not complying with the guidelines, the consent of the special educational needs organiser applies. The idea here is that the special educational needs organiser is, in effect, the guardian angel of the child through all the situations they encounter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1401" />With regard to the Senator's other point, we cannot see it as a problem but I will certainly look at it further.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister told me some time ago that when the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is used, it means the Minister must do it. The Minister was referring to section 13 which says that the Minister shall provide the money, but with the consent of the Minister for Finance because the Minister must get that consent. The same words are used in this provision. The principal of the school &ldquo;shall&rdquo; do it with the consent of the outside guardian angel. It is the same situation as applies between the Minister for Education and Science and the Minister for Finance &ndash; one cannot move without the other.</P>
      <P>That provision undermines the authority of the principal. The Minister should recognise here that if a principal teacher decides not to comply with the guidelines, he or she will have a good reason for doing so. That should be recognised. There is no need to require him or her to seek consent. It is unsafe to impose that conditionality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has, to an extent, given the game away by using the phrase &ldquo;guardian angel&rdquo;. What superior authority could there be? He has underlined the fact that this person will be in a situation of superiority over the principal. He has effectively demonstrated Senator O'Toole's point.</P>

      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 10 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 10 refers to the goals to be achieved over a period not exceeding 12 months. Might that period be too short, particularly as it might relate to a severely or profoundly disabled person? It is worthy of a lengthier period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking about a year in school. The goals will relate to the disability, the potential and what is possible. I accept we have much to learn about that. I will have something to offer Senator O'Toole and others shortly in that regard. While people are talking about an election in the offing, I am not finished working yet. I will keep going. There is no question that we have much to learn and do in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any child needs to know where they are going in a year, especially a child with a special need. It <Col N="1402" /> might be a modest improvement or there might not be any real improvement, but that will depend on the assessed needs and the situation of the individual child. Nevertheless, we must be prepared to say that in a year in school we are aiming to have some improvement for the child and to try some teaching methods and so forth that will help to improve the child in that period. The 12 months would be a standard time period for such things in other countries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot agree to section 10. I have spent many years here representing teachers and many years talking to the Minister to whom I have listened speak to principal teachers. Whatever about the question, there might be some doubt about my amendment, which I withdrew. Even though I think I am correct, there is enough to state the class teacher must be consulted with which, in negotiations, we can deal. The withdrawn amendment can be dealt with in negotiations.</P>
      <P>A Chathaoirligh, I am sure that you, as a school principal, will understand that I cannot allow, nor would anybody in such a position thank me for supporting, legislation which gives authority to somebody on an educational matter over a teacher in the day-to-day running and operation of a school. It is not acceptable to me that the principal must get that consent. I want to read the words again, that the principal can only make a decision with the consent of the special educational needs organiser. This is fundamentally wrong and fundamentally undermines the position of the principal. No board of management would want that to happen. I do not know where it puts the board of management.</P>
      <P>What is the relationship between the board of management and the special educational needs organiser? I do not believe there is one. The board of management also has authority over the school. There is a decision being taken about the education of a child in its school for whom it is responsible by a person over whom it has no control and who may have no connection with the school. This is wrong. I appeal to the Minister to reconsider.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us be very clear about what we are talking about, this is to provide for consistency throughout the country. There must be consistency for children with special needs. In that regard, this refers to paragraphs (<i>d</i>), (<i>e</i>) and (<i>f</i>). In paragraph (<i>d</i>) one is talking about the special education and related support services to be provided to enable the child to benefit from education and participate in the life of the school. These are the special education support services to be provided. One is saying the specialist who specialised in looking after the child on which I will not make any other comments on should be consulted in this regard because the guidelines will set out the general nature of the measures to be complied with. Paragraph (<i>d</i>) is one of them <Col N="1403" /> with which I do not see anything wrong. It is a normal, natural requirement. The second deals with the special education and related support services to be provided for the child to enable him or her to effectively make the transition from primary to post-primary school education while the third deals with the goals which the child is to achieve over a period not exceeding 12 months.</P>
      <P>This is a specialised area, one where one has the person who has specialised in special education. In other words, the principal may depart from the guidelines with the agreement of the special educational needs organiser. That is what the Bill states. It is reasonable that the principal should have a say, that there is a guideline running right across all schools. It must be reasonable and properly worked out. In a particular case the principal may be justified in departing from this guideline which will be done with the consent of the&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but one must have somebody who is looking after the child with special needs. That is the whole purpose. It is to ensure there is someone to look after the child's special requirements, which is what the special educational needs organiser is there to do, but only in relation to specified and agreed guidelines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister will explain this. It might make it very clear. I hope the Fianna Fáil Senator and the Progressive Democrats Senator will bear this mind. Does the House remember the nice scenario we heard a while ago, that they will talk to the school principal and the class teacher and that the principal will do this? Let us suppose the principal goes to the class teacher and determines the goals, they come to a conclusion on them having regard to everything involved, they are different from the guidelines because that is what they believed was in the child's best interests and what they want to do. However, they cannot do it if the special educational needs organiser does not agree with them.</P>
      <P>The special educational needs organiser floats in and out of the school. This now confirms my original view. When he or she has gone out the door, it is the school principal and staff who will be responsible for the goals, with which they have not agreed, which brings us back to my earlier point. This proves to me that this is a mess. There is no hierarchical responsibility and it is not going to work. It undermines the position of the principal because, no matter how one looks at it, there is consultation with the class teacher, but it is worth nothing because there is another person who can make a decision. This deals with the question with which I dealt about the importance of the authority of the class teacher in the class.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It then goes to the school principal, who comes to a similar conclusion. This raises the question, <Col N="1404" />&ldquo;Can that be implemented?&rdquo;  It can as long as it is in line with the national guidelines. We are talking about a child centred curriculum. This is the Ireland that states that we will not have a curriculum which is prescriptive in terms of each child at national level. We are now saying the national guidelines &ldquo;shall&rdquo; apply unless somebody says otherwise to the school principal. I cannot accept this. It turns on its head everything that is happening in primary schools, the system of authority in primary schools and the work of principals and class teachers. It does not matter whether the Minister agrees or disagrees, that is what is written down. These are his own words about common sense and this is where common sense can now be turned on its head by a person who holds a different point of view.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that the person concerned would not have the best of intentions. Somebody must call it. What we are deciding is that it will not be the class teacher and the principal. It will be somebody not part of the school staff who will make the final decision as to what is being dealt with by a child in the school. This is wrong. I do not think teachers will ever agree to it. Neither will I.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>We prepare guidelines for every sort of matter in schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, they are guidelines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>They are guidelines which must be complied with. One cannot go off and run one's own curriculum or whatever else one likes. These are very special children and there must be guidelines which provide for reasonable consistency across the country. They will be prepared in consultation and with proper discussion.</P>
      <P>Having done this, if there is a case where the principal believes he or she wants or needs to depart from them, he or she just looks for the consent of the special educational needs organiser. I would expect that in most circumstances that would automatically apply because one has available somebody who is a specialist, who has specialist training in the education of children with special needs and is working right across the board and attending special courses, which, as a matter of interest, will be increasing substantially. That person has specialised knowledge.</P>
      <P>We must have somebody to protect the children concerned in that situation. The Senator is talking about departing from relatively simple, straightforward guidelines to which people will agree generally, but even in such circumstances there may be cases where a principal believes he or she must depart from them. What they will be doing is checking the matter out with the specialist organiser.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand the point Senator O'Toole is making. He is making the point that nothing can interfere with what the principal decides, but for children of this kind there must be guidelines and consistency and for the principal there must be a <Col N="1405" /> means whereby if he or she cannot fit in with this, in a particular case, the special educational needs organiser will be there to give consent and agree that this does not work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it horrific. I am going to stop talking about it now because I find myself getting really angry that we must have somebody to protect the children concerned. That is what I thought teachers and principals were there for. I resent deeply the Minister's statement, not an implication, that we cannot trust principals and teachers to do it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>They are the Minister's words: &ldquo;We have to have somebody to protect these children.&rdquo;  This State has been well served by generations of teachers and principals who have protected their children, and they would never take a decision other than in the best interest of the children. The only issue&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a problem, which is as follows. When it comes to a decision on a child enrolled in the school, subject to the authority of the class teacher, principal teacher and board of management, the final call on an educational matter is to be made by somebody outside the school. It has never happened in the history of Irish education.</P>
      <P>If we want the teacher to consult, I accept that. If we want somebody to make a decision on what should be in the curriculum of a school, I accept that. We have done all these things and there are very clear lines of authority. There is no precedent for what the Minister is proposing. I do not accept that, in respect of a final decision on the educational future of a child, we have to bring in an outside protectorate, guardian angels or whatever we wish to look after that child's needs. I find it absolutely appalling that we would&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Bill is passed, the Senator should not forget that if somebody is not delivering on the guidelines, then one can go to court. One can go to court over anything to do with this matter. One can go the whole way to the appeals board, the mediation, to court. The guidelines will be designed with the principals and unions involved to achieve the kinds of guidelines that are appropriate to any particular child with a special need. If a principal feels he has to depart from the guidelines that exist, naturally one would want to consult, at a minimum, the special needs organiser. A simple mechanism is being provided in this regard. I accept what the Senator is saying on this matter. However, we have to ensure that there is a national standard in terms of special needs. We are talking about bringing children with special needs into the sys<Col N="1406" /> tem and we want to provide a consistent standard across the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to support Senator O'Toole in this matter. As he said a long time ago, it is common sense. The Bill states in many sections that the education plan is being put forward by the principals of the schools. If that is the case, the buck must stop with the principal. One can equate this with any business one wants. If a country manager is making a decision on a planning application, he gathers all the reports from the various sections &ndash; the planning, roads and sewerage sections &ndash; and makes the ultimate decision. He might overrule some of the reports because of what he feels to be the best interest. The chief executive officer of a company gets various reports, but ultimately he has the call.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole is quite right in this respect. When a principal gets the various reports from the special needs teachers, surely he should be the one to make the last call on what he feels to be in the best interest of the student. He, after all, is the person with whom the buck stops.</P>
      <P>Earlier, I said that when the Minister puts this extra responsibility on the principal of a school, it leaves that principal, who prepares the plans, open to litigation. If a teacher or principal does not detect that a pupil has a special need, will that leave the principal or teacher open to litigation years later? If so, the last call must be with the principal. He has to be the boss in his own school. Everything rests with him. Senator O'Toole is quite correct in this regard.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Toole has already referred to the point I was going to make. It is late at night and the linguistic guard is slipping, and interesting patterns are emerging in the Minister's speech.</P>
      <P>I was very struck by the fact that he used the word &ldquo;protect&rdquo; because one protects a child against some danger or threat. It is scarcely conceivable to me that the principal of a school could pose such a threat. That is a rather dangerous concept to introduce. The Minister said the child has to be protected&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Against what? By including this final authority and making it reside in the hands of somebody outside the role of principal in order to protect the child, the Minister seems to be suggesting that the principal is not capable of so protecting that child. That is the point Senator O'Toole has been arguing &ndash; at least it is to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have any difficulty with a requirement to consult the special needs organiser. I welcome it. The final arbiter is what bothers me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senator Burke said, somebody makes a decision taking everything into consideration. <Col N="1407" /> The difference between me and the Minister is that he is giving the bias of the final decision to the person who is not part of the school. It would be quite in order to have a requirement to consult with the special needs adviser. Rather than &ldquo;with the consent&rdquo;, the wording should be &ldquo;following consultation with&rdquo;. I do not have a difficulty with that. A requirement to consult is a very good and positive thing, and it means that people have to engage with different points of view. I cannot accept anything less than that.</P>

      <P>We are back at the same issue again. I protest that what we are doing now is unnecessary and an insult to the House. It is contemptuous. I ask the Minister to recognise that everybody plans their day and co-operates with proceedings, but there comes a time when we should simply pull back a little and address this with some sort of sanity. That is not being done at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding section 11, I have to accept that two of my amendments have been ruled out of order on the basis that they would increase costs. I proposed them for that very reason, to draw out that fact. The Minister had led us to believe that there was no shortage of resources available to implement this legislation. In assessing how the Minister's plans will work, it is clear that there will be a huge workload implication for school principals. Extra staff may well be required in order to implement the education plan and additional resources will be required to meet those needs. Subsection (2) is not clear. It says <Col N="1410" /> the principal shall make a report which I presume means the principal will be responsible for implementing the plan, or for delegating the authority to do so. This is a case of vision without provision.  I am living in the hope that, when he comes to section 13, the Minister will do whatever it is that he has said will allay my fears. The way things look at the moment, that is not going to happen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator O'Toole in everything he says. School principals have an enormous amount of work to do as it is. How on earth are they going to be able to get involved in the plan? Many parents may have reason to believe their child is not achieving the goals specified in the education plan and that a review of the plan has not occurred in the previous six months. I suspect a large number of people will request the principal to do this. A huge onus is being put on the principal which will be almost impossible to achieve. The child's plan should be independent of the school and assessing what has happened with the child's plan should also be independent of the school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator O'Toole and I am disappointed that his amendment has been ruled out of order. This goes back to the kernel of the matter, that is, the financial resources. I hope the Minister will give some indication that extra finance will be made available. Who determines how much finance will need to be made available to implement section 11 and how much a school principal should receive in this regard? Will everything be recoupable or will the boards of management of different schools have to fund-raise by way of card games and so on? As Senator Henry said, there is already enormous pressure on the principals of schools. The Bill will put additional responsibilities on school principals and we do not want a situation where school principals must fund-raise to provide additional facilities for their schools. The Minister must give a guarantee that sufficient funding will be put in place to ensure sections of the Bill, such as section 11, are fully complied with and that school principals will have the necessary resources.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 12, subsection (1), line 4, after <Col N="1411" />&ldquo;child,&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;and a school teacher, principal or Board of Management may in respect of a pupil enrolled in the school or seeking enrolment in the school,&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I raised this issue last night. A pattern is emerging in the Bill where there is a lack of deference to the importance of the role of the school and the school authorities in many instances. Section 12 clearly and correctly allows parents, in respect of their child, to appeal to the appeals board against the statement or description of their child's special educational needs or any of the matters in the plan. If they believe that is the case, it should be followed through. I do not have a difficulty with that.</P>
    <P>The problem is that we have drawn up legislation where the school principal can be overruled. School principals could find themselves in court defending a course of action to which they were utterly opposed but which has been imposed on them. Nevertheless, the Minister sees nothing wrong with this. What is even worse is that they cannot even appeal against such a proposal. I cannot believe the Bill was drawn up without taking these issues into consideration.</P>
    <P>My amendment seeks to allow a school principal, school board or school teacher appeal against a decision if they believe it is the incorrect course of action, methodology, content or whatever in respect of a pupil enrolled in the school or seeking enrolment in the school. It is a straightforward amendment which the Minister should accept.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, that is incorrect. No law in the land can decide who will receive a writ. As long as there is space on a piece of paper, any lawyer worth his or her salt will include the name of everyone, including class teacher, principal teacher, ex-principal teacher, former teacher, ex-teacher, etc. There is a list of them in my office and in the Minister's office so he should look into the dusting cupboard and not talk down to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Effectively, in a case like this, those liable would be the board and the Minister. It does not matter how it is stated.</P>
      <P>The Constitution recognises that the family is the primary and natural educator of the child and provides that the State guarantees to respect the right and duty of parents to provide for the education of their children. I am strongly of the view that we must respect the rights and choice of parents. If a parent is satisfied with the education plan prepared for his or her child, it is not a matter for someone else to take issue with it.</P>
      <P>That said, where a teacher, principal or board of management believes the education plan is lacking, they will bring this to the attention of the parents of the child concerned and discuss it with them. The final decision as to whether an appeal against something contained in the plan should be made must rest with the parents concerned. Accordingly, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator O'Toole on this. He has spelled it out several times tonight. While some of the Bill appears to be all right, it is not easy to follow. Senator O'Toole has pointed out where there could be a court case and where the school principal might hold a different view as to where a case was going. The Minister says it is only the board of management and the Minister who would be taken to court. We must have due regard for the taxpayer who has to foot the Bill in relation to this. We made the point several times tonight that the principal of the school has an important role to play.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The education plan is the core to what will happen to the child and the teacher is central to its implementation. The teacher must be totally committed to it. The education plan may have been put together by a number of people for which we have rightly allowed. We now have a situation where a parent might be happy with it, but a teacher may believe it is the wrong course of action for the child. The principal or the board of management of the school may feel the same way and it is only right that they should be entitled to appeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is emerging is anti-principal, anti-school and anti-teacher legislation. Why are we getting into these difficulties? It is wrong that we cannot solve these matters as we go along. The legislation is creating ways out and giving oxygen to those who will oppose them anyway. It is also <Col N="1413" /> alienating those who might be open to much of it. It is making matters impossible for me and the INTO. It is legislation that could go a long way to get them right, but it has now reached a situation where it undermines the authority of the principal on which I lost the vote. The situation now is that we have changed something and that after 160 years of running primary schools principal teachers can now be overruled on an educational matter within a school. This is something school inspectors were never allowed to do over all that period of time.</P>
    <P>Now when a teacher or principal, using his or her professional judgment, believes that the wrong course of action has been taken but cannot convince people of this, wants a final decision on the matter or to appeal it, he or she is denied this opportunity. It would be reasonable to expect that they could appeal against a proposal and have the rule run over it, but that is being denied to them. I cannot accept that is how we should <Col N="1414" /> do business. The Minister is running the Bill into a wall of resistance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>All I can say is that the measures are pro-children with special needs. That is the purpose of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>That is like pointing out that we have increased spending from &euro;7 million to &euro;70 million. What has the Minister's point got to do with what I said? Is he suggesting that giving recognition to a teacher is in some way not pro-child? Did he listen to my argument? I said that it relates to a case where a teacher believes it is not in a child's best educational interests and that it has nothing to do with the teacher, but with their judgment on behalf of the child. That is pro-child. I cannot spell it out any other way. What is happening is that the Minister is excluding the judgment call of the teacher.</P>

      <P>What I wish to say is relevant to the section, but I wish to develop it a little if I can have some latitude, a Chathaoirligh. We have seen situations throughout the country where one or two students can mean the difference between a school losing or retaining a teacher. In my constituency, I have seen various strokes &ndash; I presume it is the same in every other constituency &ndash; whereby schools will take students from other catchment areas to make sure they maintain the required number of teachers within the school. If one or two students who required special educational needs were moved, in their best interests, to a different school, would the loss of those students mean the school would lose a teacher?</P>

      <P>With respect to the Minister, I know there is an appeals mechanism. In deference to Senator Burke's point, however, the education plan can, quite correctly, move a child from school A to school B, and we all agree with that. Everyone in this Chamber has received representations from a school that drops one pupil under the numbers necessary to retain its teachers. The Minister said there is an appeal mechanism but it would be helpful to have the Minister's own views on the record. Would he be prepared to say that it is not his intention for schools to lose out when a child is directed to another school because, for the best of reasons, the necessary support structures are in another school? That would reassure such a school that it was not going to lose a teacher as well as a pupil, which can easily happen. That is the essence of the point. That would come via the education plan so, in fairness to Senator Burke, this is the only section under which this point can be raised.</P>

      <P>The principal of a school may draw up a plan for a particular student or a school. If that school is going to lose one or two students who will have to go to a different school, it could well influence the way the plan is being written. If, under such a plan, one or two students had to attend another school, I hope the first school would not lose its existing teacher entitlement. I am afraid that it would influence the way in which the plan may be written. This is very serious because we have all seen situations where schools have lost a teacher because of the loss of one or two students. In this case, it would be in the best interests of the student to have a guarantee from the Minister that if for some reason a special needs student has to move to another school, it would not affect the pupil-teacher ratio, thus avoiding the loss of a teacher from the original school attended by that pupil. I am seeking such a guarantee from the Minister. Perhaps it could be tabled as an amendment on Report Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 12, subsection (1), lines 28 and 29, to delete &ldquo;, with the consent of the Minister for Finance,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the core of the legislation, the lifeblood that provides the wherewithal to implement it <Col N="1418" /> and the conduit that will provide resources for the problem. There are many complications in this section and one way of dealing with them is through my amendment, the effect of which will be that the Minister will have complete authority and will not have to seek the consent of the Minister for Finance. It is my understanding that this requirement is unnecessary under the Ministers and Secretaries Acts. It applies to the budgeting aspect.</P>
    <P>The problem is that there is no indication that money will be made available for individual schools or pupils. What is missing is some form of words stating that moneys will be provided for devising, implementing and reviewing the implementation plan and all relevant costs or a form of words such as &ldquo;all the relevant costs involved in the implementation of the Bill&rdquo;. That is what is missing from the Bill and it creates doubt in our minds. It is clear in the Minister's mind but not in ours.</P>
    <P>My amendment is not the only way to deal with this. There are certainly four or five ways of dealing with it and I, Senator Manning and Senator Burke are open to any appropriate wording which makes this more solid. This goes back to the Minister's blank cheque speech.</P>

      <P>I said to the Senator earlier that for the purposes of clarity we would table an amendment on Report Stage stating as follows:</P>
      <P>In page 12, line 32, after &ldquo;needs&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;in accordance with the provisions of this Act&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This would make it clear that it is to meet the provisions of the Bill. I trust that meets the concerns of Senators.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">

      <P>It goes a long way towards doing that. I will have to examine the wording but I recognise that this constitutes a great deal of progress. I was seeking for the Bill to be dependent on the requirements of the child but I recognise that it is based on those requirements and that the implementation of its provisions will be in response to those. This amendment will go a long <Col N="1419" /> way towards ensuring the Bill is demand-led and that it is not a case of doing what we can with a set amount of money but deciding what to do and providing the money to do it. That said, I do not like the reference to the Minister for Finance but I presume the Minister is stuck with it.</P>

As Senator O'Toole correctly pointed out, this is the nuts and bolts of the Bill. It is all about money. The Bill is not worth a damn if extra funding is not provided to implement it. It will cost money to deliver and I hope the Minister's amendment will guarantee the extra funding necessary to put the provisions of the Bill in place for all schools.</P>

      <P>How soon does the Minister expect the recommendation of the Cromien report that the number of school psychologists be increased to 200 to be fulfilled? This is important. Does the Minister intend to place the national educational psychological service on a statutory basis? Will there be a separation of functions between those who deliver the service and those who assess it? In the old days we did not have the insights we have now. There was an idea that one size fitted all and the people who delivered the service assessed progress. However, that will not do in future. Will there be a separation of functions? Will those making the assessment be different from those delivering the service? That is central to the success of what I believe to be an extremely good Bill, on which I compliment the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>My point is that somebody should determine the resources, apart from claiming them, which is the aspect that has been ruled out. There should be a resource assessment or an audit on any proposal as to what a school needs. This becomes part of the education plan of the school and is a huge additional burden on the school, which will be discharged by the principal, somehow or another, to make sure this informs and infuses the curriculum of the school. Unless these matters are to be regarded as purely aspirational, they require to be implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section states the board of management of a school shall make all reasonable efforts to ensure the special educational needs of the students are met &ndash; this is centred very closely in the Bill and would be part of the earlier discussions on costs; co-operate to the greatest extent practicable with the council and its employees &ndash; that is not unreasonable; ensure all relevant teachers and other relevant employees of the school are aware of the special educational needs of students &ndash; that is the first additional task somebody has to perform to ensure people are properly informed and advised to work to the system; it is rather like dealing with immigrants or refugees and involves creating a certain approach; ensure teachers and other employees of the school are aware of the importance of identifying children who have <Col N="1421" /> special educational needs &ndash; that is an additional function but part of a teaching function and relates to direct involvement in the curriculum; inculcate in students of the school an awareness of the needs of persons with disabilities &ndash; that smacks of the idea that, if there is a problem in society, it should be sorted out in the schools.</P>
    <P>There is nothing wrong with what is stated in the section, any more than it would be wrong to say we should inculcate in students of the school an awareness of the needs of immigrants or people from County Kerry or whatever. There are all kinds of possibilities as to what one might seek to inculcate in students to ensure there is no discrimination against minorities who suffer badly from the system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 14(1)(<i>f</i>) requires the board of management of a school to ensure that, as regards admission to and participation in the school, a policy of maximum accommodation for children with special educational needs is in place and implemented &ndash; that is quite a significant issue. For example, it would be necessary to ensure doors are wide enough to accommodate a wheelchair. All these requirements have to be attended to. It is very clearly stated that they are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other enactment imposing duties on boards of management of schools.</P>
      <P>My point is that there is an additional burden of responsibility, including an additional practical burden, on schools. Where are the resources to implement this? The simple answer is that the school principal will be given the authority to do it &ndash; the same school principal whose authority we have undermined in an earlier section and whom we do not trust to protect our children. That is the person to be charged with this responsibility, according to the Bill.</P>
      <P>The management authorities of schools will question the imposition of this additional work, without any consultation with them. While I do not disagree with the provisions of the section, there is a resource deficiency. The Minister should reassure boards of management, having regard to what he said on section 13, that he will see to it that resources are available. In his own words, this is a provision of the Bill which should receive the appropriate support and resources under the legislation.</P>

      <P>Section 16(7) states that &ldquo;the persons who shall be concerned in providing the programme concerned shall be a person who is a registered teacher (within the meaning of the Teaching Council Act, 2001).&rdquo; This is the core of how the educational provision is delivered. The people recognised under the Teaching Council <Col N="1423" /> Act have particular authority and responsibility and they have professional views of their own.</P>
      <P>The recognition here will not undo the problems that we have created earlier by not allowing them to appeal against what is in the plan. It is stated that they will be involved in its provision, but they do not have the authority to appeal against it. If we go to the trouble of recognising teachers' qualifications and importance, we should also be prepared to give them the right to appeal. If they come to the conclusion that it is being done in the wrong way and if somebody from outside comes in to evaluate progress six months later, they could find a situation that is all over the place. A person could be implementing a programme in which he or she has no faith and it will be evaluated by a person who will not be happy with what is being done and so on. There is confusion and a contradiction in the Bill. I do not object to the section, but I want to use it to reflect on the other issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I have gone through the functions of the council in detail and do not object to any of them. I have tried to look at it from the point of view of where they may be lacking. Section 19(2) states: &ldquo;The Council shall have the power to do all things necessary for or incidental to the performance of its functions.&rdquo;  That is a very solid support clause to ensure that if something is left out, there can be redress. I am sure things will come up that we have not considered, so it deals with all the issues.</P>
      <P>I would like to hear the Minister's view on where paragraph (i) stands in regard to the connection between health and education. This problem is always raised when I meet with groups involved in the education side of children with disability. There is a lack of interlinkage between the Department of Education and Science and the Department of Health and Children. In this case it is doubly so because we now have this new board which will have authority over certain aspects of what is happening in schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are agreeing to do that but do we know how it will impact on the Department of Health and Children? What happens if the education plan says we need some kind of therapist as part of the requirements of a child's needs and no therapist is available? The Minister will no doubt <Col N="1424" /> refer to the &euro;70 million and the number of additional therapists he has approved but that does not deal with the problem. If a therapist is required, what kind of pressure can be put on the health boards to make such provision?</P>
    <P>Anyone who has dealt with health boards will know how difficult it is to get anything from them. There are things to which I can compare them that might be unparliamentary, to say the least. There is a gap. The council can review the provisions made by the health boards and can publish reports on the results of such reviews. They may include recommendations on the manner in which such provisions could be improved. However, it is very weak. I am not saying I can do something about it here but I would like to know on what basis we decided not to give the council the authority to make provision. The difficulty goes back to section 13 where it says that it is entitled to moneys to ensure the provisions of this Act are implemented. In this case it does not have power over what needs to be provided. It would be a worry if some of this money could go to the health boards. What kind of lever can it apply to health boards?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator O'Toole, I do not have any great problem with any of the functions of the council but paragraph (i) is somewhat loose and the Minister needs to elaborate in regard to the difference between the functions of the health board and the Department of Education and Science or the council. Many of us have had dealings with health boards and specific guidelines are necessary when there is an overlap between different Departments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I too have a problem in regard to section 19(1)(<i>c</i>) and the co-ordination of the work between the health board and the education system. Education in schools operates up to 4 p.m. but the structure of the health board is on a different format. In the past it has been difficult to get such co-ordination, so I urge the Minister to spell it out more clearly. The health boards need to be made more aware of their duties to ensure that educational plans can be implemented.</P>

      <P>There is a typographical error in paragraph (i). Section &ldquo;13&rdquo; should read section &ldquo;16&rdquo; and I will propose an amendment on Report Stage to correct it. This is explained in section 36, which sets out the duty of health boards with regard to special education. It provides that the council may request a health board to take specified actions to assist it or to ensure the preparation or implementation of an education plan. <Col N="1425" /> Before making a formal request under this section, the council must discuss the matter with the health board, which will generally accede to a request made under this section, unless it feels the request is unmerited or that compliance is impossible. If the health board decides it cannot comply with the request of the council, it must state its reasons and the council may appeal that refusal. The ultimate arbiter in any dispute relating to these requests is the appeals board, which has the power to compel the health board to comply with the council's requirement if the appeal is considered reasonable and upheld.</P>

      <P>I hope I am not jumping ahead of other business, but I ask the Minister to expand on section 36(3)(b). I am not quite sure what the practical implementation of the advice referred to entails. There is, again, a subsection regarding financial resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection 3(b) provides that advice to the Minister shall take into account the implications of that advice for the resources, including financial resources, available to the State in respect of the provision of education and the practicalities of implementing that advice. That is good practice. We are creating duties and rights and in that context the council will naturally be independent in the administration of its day to day functions, though not in relation to policy. It will be able to act independently, but must have regard to available resources.</P>
      <P>The Minister has a duty to provide the resources which are required, within reason, for assessed needs. Those resources will be huge when compared to those provided in the past and at present.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole raised the matter of the lack of available people to carry out assessments and to provide speech and language therapy. The sections of the Bill will have to be introduced on a phased basis because once they are in law their provisions become absolute rights. The NEPS is being built up as a matter of urgency and I have approved the recruitment of another 75 speech and language therapists. That problem is one for the health boards to resolve, but we are going to provide for the rights and we will have to find ways of meeting them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 17, subsection (2), line 6, after &ldquo;disabilities&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;and shall include</P>
      <P>(<i>a</i>) at least one person nominated by the National Parents Council,</P>
      <P>(<i>b</i>) at least one person nominated by the Irish National Teachers' Organisation,</P>
      <P>(<i>c</i>) at least one representative of the following groups or services,</P>
      <P>National Education Psychological Service</P>
      <P>School Management Authorities</P>
      <P>Colleges of Education.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I was really disappointed with the way this section was worded and with the difficulties it could create. It provides that the council will consist of a chairperson and ten ordinary members who shall be appointed by the Minister. The only requirement of them is that they have a special interest in, or knowledge which relates to, the education of children with disabilities. The Minister is to have regard to gender balance when selecting the board.</P>
      <P>I may have to get into a long discussion on this, but it is preferable to say that the educational partners should be statutorily represented on the council, not just on the advisory body. I would be horrified if there were not a preponderance of educationalists on the board of a national special education council. They need not necessarily be teachers, but they would have to be people with an educational background. People will recognise that my amendment will give the Minister flexibility and not close down the membership. Of the ten, one should be nominated by the National Parents Council, one by the Irish National Teachers' Organisation and one each by the national education psychological service, the school management authorities and the colleges of education. I had intended that each of the last three would be represented, but I drafted the amendment ambiguously. I certainly did not want to demean the role of school management, which I would certainly wish to have represented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1427" />There should be one person representing parents, one representing teachers and one representing school management, as well as the NEPS and the colleges of education, which are closely involved. That does not close down the membership of the board as there are still other places available. This is crucial as there is enough trouble with this Bill as it is. People working daily in this area have to be able to look at it and see that they are represented and this amendment provides the opportunity to give them that. I do not say that it should be included in the Bill in its present form, but all the people who are important to the implementation of the legislation should be represented in it.</P>

      <P>The parents of those with disabilities should also be on the board and I will be putting down amendments to that effect on this section. Such provisions may be in the Minister's heart, but we need them in the Bill because its provisions, as drafted, have been very much resented by those who have been in contact with me since the Bill was published 36 hours ago. It is most important that we try to rectify this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I support previous speakers in relation to the composition of the board. I do not mind who is on the board, but it should be enshrined in statute. People with disabilities and their parents should be represented on it. School principals should also be represented because the Bill confers a lot of power and much additional responsibility on them. The health boards also have a role to play and should be included. The composition of the board should be set down in statute. Perhaps the board should be enlarged to include some of the bodies mentioned by Senators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is designed to be a reasonably tight, effective board to do the job. That is the reason it comprises the chair and ten members, a total of 11. Two extra members would bring the total to 13. To enlarge it any further would make it too broad to be an effective, businesslike board. A consultative forum will also be established, <Col N="1428" /> which will provide for much wider involvement. If more Senators spoke, they could suggest more groups to be represented because this is a vast area. As the Bill applies to primary and second level education, for a start, three teachers' unions are involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I add my voice to those who made the case for having parents' representatives on the board, as opposed to the consultative commit<Col N="1429" /> tee. Parents of disabled people have insights into the condition, which teachers could never hope to have. I taught at three levels in my teaching career, but despite that and the professional training I received, I do not have an understanding of, for example, autism and many other conditions. If we are to get insights that will enable us to adopt the proper approach and procedures, we must have a strong parents' representative on the board. It is essential to the success of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I understand the people who deliver the service must be represented. However, it was late in the day that we sought the involvement of parents in education. We were even late bringing boards of management on board. For too long we excluded the people concerned and their expertise, born of their daily raw experience on the ground. I strongly appeal to the Minister to ensure parents of children with disabilities will be included, not on the consultative committee, but on the council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not press the amendment. I wish to defend the Minister. I remind Members that the levels of representation which could be sought would make for an impossible council. Look at the deliverers of the service &ndash; the same argument could be made about teachers. The autism spectrum contains at least 12 different categories and that is just one section of special education. I accept the argument that all people should be represented, but it would be impossible to have teachers representing all special education areas, or parents. It just cannot be done.</P>
      <P>It is an education needs service. A structure has to be put in place which is efficient in the delivery of the service. The people involved will have to take advice. There does not have to be a teacher on it who has taught in a particular area of special education or a parent who has a child with particular needs. We need a parent who has a child with a disability and a teacher who teaches children with a disability to ensure the expertise we put together is properly focused.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister. I would be slow to make the main committee much larger and agree with the concept of a forum. It is a second tier and, in that sense, a subordinate or subservient tier. Nonetheless, it is a statutory way of giving people an input. It is a clever device to make progress. I look forward to Report Stage when we can examine this further. I agree with the objective of the points made by other Members, but I know, from numerous attempts, that it cannot be done. When this is implemented and if there is a teacher or even three teachers included, I will still have 25 other categories stating there is nobody representing their area of teaching. They are never going to be there. We have to get the proper people who will have an open and broad approach to focusing on a problem.</P>

There is a contradiction where it states that the health board cannot go ahead because of a lack of resources, but the appeals board may direct it to go ahead. That could put an additional burden on the health board to find resources. Can the health board, in turn, go to the Minister for Finance looking for funds or will the extra funds be provided under section 13? If that is the case, the Minister might have to insert an amendment in this section so <Col N="1432" /> that it would be covered and proper funding would be available if an appeal was successful.</P>

      <P>The only comment I want to make is that however bad things are in education for people with disabilities, they are much worse in health.</P>

      <P>I had a most unpleasant experience on Monday last when I attended a meeting about medical litigation. A doctor said to me that when they had seen the appalling situation for people with disabilities in this country, they were not at all surprised that people tried to sue to see if anything could be done in the case of birth injuries and if blame could be attached. The parents said there was so little else they could do for their children that they felt they had to take that opportunity. The Minister may think things are bad in education, but they are much worse in health.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>That brings me back to my point about how closely the Department of Education and Science and the Department of Health and Children must work together. We all know the experience of the Department of Health and Children and how it does its business. It works very differently from the Department of Education and Science. Teachers work differently from the way the health services work. It goes back to the original point about how we draw up a plan of co-ordination to make sure that, whatever the council says, the money must be available to implement individual education plans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This section sets out the duty of the health boards concerning special education. It provides that the council may request the health board to take specified actions to assist the council or ensure the preparation or implementation of the plan.</P>
      <P>Before making a formal request under this section, the council will discuss the matter with the health board. The health board will generally accede to the request made under this section unless it feels the request is not merited or compliance is impossible. If the health board decides that it cannot comply with the request of the council, it must state its reasons and the council may appeal the refusal to comply.</P>
      <P>The ultimate arbiter of any dispute in relation to these requests is the appeals board. The appeals board has the power to compel a health board to comply with a request from the council if it upholds an appeal. The health board can be directed to make the provision. I will have a look at that issue before Report Stage in terms of the possible deletion of section 36(3)(<i>c</i>), &ldquo;having regard to the resources available.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a recommendation for the Minister. I will not repeat what has been said <Col N="1433" /> about the health board, but the section would be infinitely strengthened if the Minister substituted the word &ldquo;will&rdquo; for &ldquo;may&rdquo;. The word &ldquo;may&rdquo;, which appears twice in the section, is too vague and it leaves too much leeway to health boards not to comply with the requirements of the Bill. This is a matter for Report Stage. However it is done, we must put the strongest possible requirement in law on the health board to play its part in making the objectives of the Bill a reality. That could be the Achilles' heel of this very good legislation. I ask the Minister to substitute the word &ldquo;will&rdquo; for &ldquo;may&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator must mean to use the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;may&rdquo;. &ldquo;Shall&rdquo; is the legal term.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>The word should be &ldquo;shall&rdquo;, the legal term, instead of &ldquo;may&rdquo;. Can the Minister see how &ldquo;may&rdquo; leaves too many loopholes?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for stating that he will have another look at this section before Report Stage because section 36(3)(<i>c</i>) could let the health board off the hook. If it has no resources, it could quote this section. In the event of it stating that it has no resources and the appeals board making a decision that it must comply, the issue of funding will arise. Who will provide it? Perhaps there is a way out for the Minister under section 13 or perhaps the Minister the Finance will come into play. I thank the Minister for deciding to have another look at the section.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Sections 37 to 41, inclusive, agreed to.</P>
      <P>Schedule 1 agreed to.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Schedule 2 contains the description of the job of the director. I missed the section which dealt with the employment of the director. I thought the Department of Education and Science might play a stronger role in respect of the recruitment of a director. It would seem the ultimate power really lies with the council. The council will be made up of a chairman and ten or 11 other people. The Department of Education and <Col N="1434" /> Science should play a stronger role in the recruitment of the chief executive officer of the council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that we may appoint the first director and that the council will be responsible subsequently. It is obviously a very important post and will be very widely advertised. In terms of finance and resources, I have got approval already to go ahead with that appointment. I can do that administratively anyway. It is not as if I am undermining anything. The legislation will make it statutory. We will be proceeding very shortly with the appointment of the director under the normal public service appointment arrangements.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister and his adviser, and all the Senators, for taking us through this tedious stage tonight. It is a very detailed Bill, which will work very well and I am very pleased that it will be very satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I also thank the Minister. I thank him for conceding additional time to take Report Stage. This is a very important Bill and it is putting serious responsibility on principals of schools. I am delighted we have an additional week to look at the Bill and consult widely with all the other organisations, which have the best interests of this Bill at heart. I thank the Minister for allowing us the additional time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister and his officials for giving the leeway he gave us during the course of the debate. Last night on Second Stage I had some criticisms of the Bill, mainly related to the resources available. Certainly, the Minister has outlined the position and I am very happy with the way matters have proceeded. I thank all the other Senators who contributed to the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I also thank the Minister for being so accommodating and helpful this evening, as well as his officials. This has been a disaster area and it is essential that we try to get it as right as we possibly can. One has seen the court cases we have had and the dreadful emotional response there was when people realised how little was being done for people in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister understands why all of us are so concerned that the Bill, which is an excellent <Col N="1435" /> framework, should be as good as possible coming out of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators for their contributions. I hope they will appreciate my anxiety to have the Bill passed because it is hugely important. I will not explain how difficult it was to get to this point and hence my great anxiety to see it pass into law. I hope I will have the opportunity later in the other House to complete the passage of the Bill. I know people have different views about what might happen at that stage.</P>
      <P>Much agreement and negotiation have taken place behind the scenes. As Senators will be aware, resources are very important. Coming towards the end of the session, I had difficulties in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank everybody. I thank Senator Manning for coming in and saying what he said at the time. In effect, right up to the latest stage today, the Whip was making every effort to have Second Stage in the other House tomorrow. I was anxious to reach a point where we could do that. <Col N="1436" /> The pressure on the staff of the House, apart from anything else, has been very considerable and I appreciate that. They have been doing a fantastic job over recent weeks because of the volume of legislation. In respect of this Bill, they have been doing a great job.</P>
    <P>I am happy the Seanad will sit again next Thursday and that we can complete the Bill then. Again, I thank everybody.</P>
