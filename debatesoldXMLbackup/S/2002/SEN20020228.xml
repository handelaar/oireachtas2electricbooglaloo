      <P>I have received notice from Senator Henry that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to explain why he has deregulated the retail pharmaceutical trade before his appointed committee on the topic has made its report to him.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Cosgrave of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to outline the changes he proposes in relation to the running of elections, with particular regard to nomination procedures and wheelchair access to polling stations; the arrangements being put in place in relation to electronic voting, including a backup system in case of technical difficulties; and the need for him to make a statement on the matter.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Taylor-Quinn of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to outline the background to the recent decision taken by his Department to provide an extension to St. Joseph's secondary school, Tulla, County Clare, rather than a new school on a greenfield site.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>I seek clarification from the Chair about the way in which today's business is being ordered. We are dealing with Report Stage of a Bill, but a great deal of the material is new. I am glad the Bill has only three Stages because it has grown exponentially; it almost doubled in size on Committee Stage and has increased by one third on Report Stage. Thank God, we are coming towards the end of it. Will we follow the normal Report Stage procedure where a person can only speak once on each amendment?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Leader yesterday to indicate the legislation he expects to be taken between now and the election. I ask him to be realistic in the assessment he gives today. Does the Leader expect that any new legislation which has not yet been published will be taken? Given that we are sitting two days next week and that we will not sit next Wednesday, will he ensure that the normal rights for Private Members' business are maintained?</P>

      <P>Yesterday the Leader promised to give details of what it is planned to bring before the House in the coming weeks and I assume he will do so. I agree to today's Order of business.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader urgently bring the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the House because of the concern that has arisen regarding an Adjournment Debate matter last night? This is the question of passports for sale. The Minister&mdash;</P>

      <P>I ask the Senator to bear with me for a moment. There is a long-standing convention that matters which are raised on the Adjournment cannot be debated again on the Order of Business the following day. Therefore, I cannot allow a debate on this matter this morning.</P>

      <P>I accept direction from the Cathaoirleach on this, but I would like the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come into this House to discuss issues that we have not had the opportunity to discuss so as to hear his views. Four years ago today, he made statements that were not in line with what he subsequently did.</P>

      <P>When we hear a matter articulated so well on &ldquo;Morning Ireland,&rdquo; we must support it.</P>
      <P>Has the Government gone to cloud cuckooland? It has decided to co-host the 2008 European Championships when there is no second stadium, the junior partner is opposed to the construction of one and the GAA has voted not to support other games being played in its stadia. The Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs stated that social welfare recipients will have all the money they can spend by 2007, while the Minister for Health and Children says that we will have state-of-the-art facilities in the health service by 2010.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>In light of previous contributions, will the Leader ask the Minister for Justice, <Col N="600" /> Equality and Law Reform to reduce the price of passports and make them available to asylum seekers at cost, which would be only fair?</P>
      <P>On the question of the European football championships, the taxpayers have a clear interest. During the debates on university legislation, there was a strong demand that the Government appoint members to represent the taxpayers on the boards of our institutions and that was supported. The taxpayers paid for Croke Park and ought to have representation there to express the people's will.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly ask the Leader to make representations on the matter of East Timor, which we debated before. The Seanad played a significant role in this matter and it welcomes the announcement that an ambassador is to be appointed there. However, it will be a non-resident ambassador. America, Britain and Australia, which were complicit in Indonesia's invasion and destruction of East Timor, have opened resident embassies. The Leader must make strong representations to the Minister for Foreign Affairs at least to upgrade the existing mission there to a diplomatic one. This country has a strong and unusual interest in East Timor and played a remarkable role there. Let us walk the last mile with the people of East Timor and appoint a resident ambassador. A titular one is of no use. We must make a further diplomatic effort.</P>

      <Col N="602" />Senators Manning, Quinn and Costello inquired about forthcoming legislation and I will give this information at the end of my replies. I will pass the views of Senators Quinn, Norris and Coghlan to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    <P>Senators Costello and Norris expressed views on the co-hosting of the European championship. Anyone involved in sport knows that there are two fabulous stadia in Ireland, Croke Park and Pairc Ui Chaoimh.</P>

      <P>Two Bills are not yet published, one of which is the Electoral Bill. Senator Manning requested that I inform the House this morning about Bills we expect to be published. As the Senator is aware, the Electoral (Amendment) (Deposits) Bill will be published and brought before the House before the general election. I will inform the House about one other Bill when I have more information on it.</P>

      <P>Before we commence, I remind Members that a Senator may speak only once on Report Stage, except the proposer of an amendment who may reply to the discussion on the amendment. Also, on Report Stage, each amendment must be seconded. Amendments Nos. 1 to 66, inclusive, form a composite proposal and may be discussed together by agreement.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 6, to delete lines 8 to 10 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&nbsp;&ldquo;applicant&rdquo; means a person who applies for approval of a PRSA product under section 94;&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I thank the House for allowing the Bill to be taken at this time. I also thank Senators for their forbearance in regard to the arrangements in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 1 to 66, inclusive, relate to the change I referred to on Committee Stage regarding the licensing arrangements for PRSAs. The Bill, as published, envisaged that this would be undertaken by the Pensions Board. However, following further consultation with my colleagues, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Minister for Finance, I now propose that the PRSA provider will be as set out in the revised definition. The following will be appropriately authorised entities: an investment firm, an insurance undertaking and a credit union which produce, market or sell PRSA <Col N="604" /> products. This means, for example, that existing financial entities which are already appropriately licensed by the Central Bank or by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment can be PRSA providers. Any entity which wishes to be a PRSA provider can apply to the Central Bank for authorisation.</P>
    <P>The requirement for a PRSA provider to be a separate company has been removed, which given the representation I received on this point should facilitate PRSA providers coming forward. I am aware that some companies are setting up separate companies. These changes mean that the sections of the Bill dealing with the licensing of the provider are now redundant and I propose to delete them.</P>
    <P>As already envisaged in the Bill, the PRSA product will be approved and monitored by the Pensions Board and by the Revenue Commissioners, as provided by the insertion of section 92 in the Pensions Act. Revenue approval will be contingent on the Pensions Board having approved the product.</P>
    <P>Section 94 to be inserted into the Pensions Act sets out the requirements for approval of a product in this regard. The applicant for approval of a product must have adequate levels of expertise, supply the Pensions Board with all the necessary information and organise the structure of its business in such a way that allows the board to perform its supervisory functions. The board shall prepare a code of conduct with respect to the producing, marketing and selling of PRSAs having regard to the need to provide for the protection of consumers and for the effective supervision of products.</P>
    <P>Given the changes in arrangements which will reduce the work of the Pensions Board at the initial approval stage, the time limit for the board reaching a decision on product approval has been reduced from six months to three months. I am satisfied that the revised arrangements will not in any way lessen the protection for the consumer, the PRSA contributor.</P>
    <P>The provisions regarding changes and disclosure information together with those regarding the employer providing access to a standard PRSA remain the same. The proposed changes in the licensing and monitoring of the PRSA provider mean that there are some technical consequential changes to be made in Part 4, with which I will deal later. Overall, I suggest the proposed amendments will simplify the legislation, which is a good thing.</P>

      <P>Parliamentary history is being made this morning, as I am not aware of 66 amendments having been taken together previously as part of one proposal. I am glad there are only three parliamentary Stages effectively in taking this Bill because it has grown exponentially since its inception. It was a hefty Bill on Second Stage, by the end of Committee Stage it was a large Bill and by the end of Report Stage <Col N="605" /> it will become almost a bound volume when all the changes are incorporated.</P>
      <P>If we were not at this stage in the life of this Parliament and if there was not such general agreement that this is an important and positive Bill, for which many people are waiting, there would be concern at the way in which we are taking it. The Minister's Department, his officials, the Pensions Board and Revenue were helpful in the briefing they gave us. One lesson I learnt from the experience of dealing with this Bill is that it is one that should be taken in a specialist committee which could examine it and provide the necessary back-up to the members involved. We are at a disadvantage here. I worry that we are going through this Bill at such speed that there may very well be visits later to the Supreme Court, but we will have to live with that.</P>
      <P>I presume there was wide consultation with the various interests involved before the drawing up of these amendments, which in effect create a new section. I had a communication yesterday from a professional body involved in pension brokering. To my surprise it seemed only to be aware of the Bill at this stage and sought to make a number of amendments to it. While I do not want to comment on the body, the way it has handled its business does not speak well of it, given that it communicated with me only yesterday on this Bill. I will forward its correspondence to the Minister's officials &ndash; who may have spoken to this body already &ndash; after the debate. In any event I was a little perturbed by this.</P>

      <P>I can give the Senator that assurance. In relation to amendments Nos. 1 to 66 which deal with changes to the licensing arrangements, we consulted fully with the social partners and they are all in agreement in regard to them.</P>
      <P>If the Senator has correspondence from an organisation that has a query regarding that aspect, he might let us have it and between now and when the Bill goes to the Dáil we will examine it. The representations may not be in regard to this point, as it is quite straightforward. Even though there are 66 amendments in regard to it, they all relate in effect to changes in the licensing arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept what the Senator said about the passing of this Bill. I thank him and his party col<Col N="606" /> leagues for their views that this Bill should be passed. Given the timescale available, everyone concerned, including all those who had a long input into this legislation, want it to be passed. I thank all those for their forbearance in that respect.</P>
    <P>I agree with what Senator Manning said about a specialist committee. I have had the opportunity during my time in Leinster House to serve on special committees which have each examined one piece of legislation. I found that an interesting experience and one which resulted in a better Bill in each case than if it had been dealt with through the normal course.</P>
    <P>All the proposals we are making, in effect, have the agreement of the social partners. If there was a major objection to them, we would probably not be able to pass this Bill. I indicated when the Bill was introduced on Second Stage in the Seanad that we would leave a long timespan between that Stage and Committee Stage to allow people to make representations. We published the bones of the Bill long before we published the Bill to allow the industry and the social partners to give their views. I was upfront and said we would be amenable to amendments to the legislation. I approached all the various institutes and organisations representing interests in this area and said we were more than willing to listen to reasonable submissions to the legislation, as a result of which more than 200 were received. There is virtually no disagreement in relation to any aspects in respect of which proposals have been put forward.</P>

      <P>On the question of PRSA products, I asked the Minister on Committee Stage how many types of pension schemes would qualify as PRSA products and he said two. I may be confusing myself on this. What is the status of buy-out bonds and retirement annuity contracts? The social partners recommended that there should be only two types of pension schemes. Obviously, there are four now.

      <P>I totally agree with what is being done here. What type of provision exists for the publicising of the revocation of the licence? After consultation the board may suspend or withdraw. Is there any obligation on the board to ensure such a withdrawal is widely publicised so that it does not just appear in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> or on the back in a small notice like some planning applications and to ensure that those affected are very much aware of this?</P>

      <P>There is provision elsewhere in the legislation whereby if the board is revoking a product it has to put a notice in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and <Col N="615" /> also in public newspapers. I will be able to provide the reference later for the Senator.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment relates to the taxation of PRSAs. It amends the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, to provide for various tax reliefs and arrangements for PRSAs. A four page summary of these proposals was made available to Senators before Committee Stage. The nature of tax legislation means that the specific legal provisions in this amendment run to many pages. It would be most useful, therefore, for me to highlight its main features.</P>
      <P>Contributions paid into a PRSA will benefit from tax relief at the individual's marginal income tax rate. As with most tax reliefs, there is a limit on this relief. The maximum annual taxable deductible contributions are based on a percentage of the individual's earnings. The allowable percentages that arise with age are as follows: under 30, 15%; 30-39, 25%; and over 40, 30%. The 30% limit will apply, irrespective of age, to certain other categories of persons who typically retire earlier than usual. An earnings cap of &euro;254,000 will apply also to PRSAs as in the case of retirement annuity contracts, for the purpose of tax relief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="643" />Contributions paid in any year in excess of the maximum tax deductible contribution may be carried forward and claimed in future years, subject to the annual limit for those years. Similarly, contributions paid while out of the workforce may be carried forward and claimed against future earnings on return to paid employment, subject to annual limits. The limits apply to the total contributions made by the employee and employer where the employee is not a member of an occupational pensions scheme. For example, where an employee aged 29 contributes 5% of his or her earnings to a PRSA, the employer may contribute a further 10%, making a total of 15% on aggregate.</P>
    <P>Employer PRSA contributions on behalf of employees will be fully deductible for tax purposes. Contributions to a retirement annuity contract and a PRSA will be aggregated when calculating the maximum tax relief. For example, a person aged 45 who gets tax relief on 25% of their earnings on contributions to a RAC may contribute an extra 5% to PRSAs, making up 30% tax relief on aggregate. Employees in an occupational pension scheme may use a PRSA as an AVC vehicle. In other words, additional voluntary contributions may be made to a PRSA. The age limits applicable to total employee contributions to an occupational pensions scheme and the PRSA/AVC are as follows: under 30, 15% of earnings; 30-39, 20%; 40-49, 25%; and over 50, 30%. Benefits can usually be provided at age 60, subject to the same early retirement rules that exist at present for the self-employed and employees, respectively.</P>
    <P>The options available on retirement are similar to the options introduced for RAC holders and certain other persons in the Finance Act, 1999. A PRSA holder, therefore, may take 25% of the fund on retirement as a tax free lump sum and, subject to the existing rules, may invest the balance in an approved retirement fund, subject to a minimum investment in an approved minimum retirement fund, withdraw the balance in cash subject to a minimum investment in an AMRF or invest the balance in an annuity. If a contributor dies before retirement, the PRSA fund may pass in its entirety to the estate of the deceased person, free of income tax. Inheritance tax will apply, however, according to the usual rules. If a contributor dies after benefits have commenced, the taxation rules for the PRSA fund will be similar to taxation rules for ARFs on death. Transfers from a RAC to a PRSA will be allowed. Transfers from an occupational pension scheme to a PRSA will be allowed where the person was a member of the scheme for less than 15 years.</P>

      <P>As the Minister indicated, this is an extremely long amendment which proposes a new part of the Bill. I have two questions about the amendment, which I support. The reliefs available under the new section 787E will be 5% higher than those currently available in the Fin<Col N="644" /> ance Bill. Why is this the case? Is there a danger that this amendment will mislead consumers?</P>
      <P>My other question relates to the provision in this amendment that will mean that people cannot transfer after 15 years. Why is this so? Is it not possible to introduce greater flexibility? Is this amendment intended merely as an initial provision? Will it be reviewed and, if so, who will review it? I presume it is intended to be flexible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senator for his queries. The limit of 15 years in relation to the transfer of an occupational pension scheme is intended to restrict the large-scale transfer of schemes to PRSAs. I am trying to prevent a mass movement of those with a substantial occupational pensions scheme to PRSAs. The amendment does not intend such mass transfer, which would be an undesirable outcome. The Department of Finance and my Department agreed that the 15 year limit would be reviewed by the Department of Finance in the light of experience on an annual basis.</P>
      <P>The PRSA contribution limits are more generous than the existing limits for RACs. A decision was purposely made to encourage greater PRSA uptake. It could be argued that this complicates the overall tax position, which may be true, but it should be remembered that PRSAs are primarily intended to increase pensions provisions for those who do not have enough cover.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 68:</P>
      <P>In page 45, line 13, to delete &ldquo;reference.&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;reference or, if in his sole and absolute discretion he believes that special circumstances, of which he is the sole judge, warrant examination of a complaint prior to those prescribed in (4)(<i>a</i>)(i) and (ii) above.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We covered this matter at some length on a previous day. It relates to the ombudsman. Everybody welcomed the fact that there would be an ombudsman to provide confidence to people and ensure they get a fair hearing if they have a grievance. I was pleased the last day that one of the amendments increased the time limit from three to six years.</P>
      <P>I have a specific case which I made on Committee Stage in the context of a general point. If there is a genuine grievance out there it can cause enormous suffering and trauma. All of us in politics come across people who have the latter part of their lives destroyed by their sense of impotence in a situation where they feel they cannot get a fair hearing. In many cases all they want is a hearing, they want their say. The six year limit is very generous and I praise the Minister for making that change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, it may well be that from time to time this period may be exceeded and a person may want the ombudsman to adjudicate on whether he or she has a case to be heard. The amendment <Col N="645" /> I propose is very restrictive. It proposes that if the ombudsman, in his sole and absolute discretion, believes that special circumstances exist it can warrant examination of a complaint prior to those prescribed under the six year rule. This is something which would work in the interests of everybody.</P>
    <P>Politicians often feel very strongly that an individual has a genuine complaint and they feel a sense of humanity for the suffering and trauma of that person. At least now the ombudsman can say &ldquo;Yes, there is a <i>prima facie </i>case which should be examined.&rdquo; or &ldquo;No, there is no real case there.&rdquo;  At least there is an element of finality to the process. The individual may not be happy but a line can be drawn under the case rather than have it fester and blight not just the last years of the individual's life but also the lives of his or her family.</P>
    <P>In framing the amendment I was conscious of not opening floodgates. I want to put the ball very much in the court of the ombudsman, who would be the sole judge of what could happen. I ask the Minister to look sympathetically at this. I know that the Department of Finance will not like it &ndash; the Department of Finance does not like ombudsmen anyway. There are times when the judgment of politicians exceeds the collective wisdom of those in Merrion Street.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I am fully persuaded as always by Senator Manning's convincing argument, particularly with regard to the Department of Finance not liking this. That in itself merits my seconding the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened very carefully to what Senator Manning in particular said on Committee Stage and my officials have had some discussions with the Senator on the particular issue he raised. They had some contact with the people involved. When this Bill was brought forward originally, three years was the look-back period. We got the consent of the Government and the Department of Finance to change this to six years as a result of what was said in this House on Second Stage as well as other representations made to us and our own view that six years would be better. This is very significant.</P>
      <P>I cannot accept the amendment but I point to subsection (5) which states:</P>
      <P>The Pensions Ombudsman may investigate a complaint or dispute under this section notwithstanding that the act giving rise to the complaint or dispute was done prior to the establishment day if, and only if, the complaint or reference is made to the Pensions Ombudsman within the period specified in subsection (4)(<i>a</i>).</P>
      <P>There has been discussion with my Department and others regarding what that actually means. We believe it would be up to the ombudsman to intervene in that in his own way. It would be possible for the ombudsman to interpret the nature of the act giving rise to the kicking in of the legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the action, that is what it is. This comes up from time to time in relation to pension schemes when establishing whether it is the date of the establishment or the date that something happened that caused difficulties. Leaving the section as it is would cater for what the Senator is seeking and would give the Pensions Ombudsman some flexibility. If we were to make it too open-ended the ombudsman would be under horrendous pressure and would be snowed under with look-backs well beyond the six year period. By leaving it as it is the Pensions Ombudsman would have some discretion in this regard. It may be something that might be challenged, I fully accept that. Perhaps the trustees of a scheme might not agree with it being reviewed. However, it is preferable to leave it as it is. The Senator's amendment could cause some difficulty in that the Pensions Ombudsman would not be able to look at new cases arising after the date the legislation is passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Minister has worked very hard on this but there are two problems with his reply. First, there is a vagueness about the terms &ldquo;act&rdquo; or &ldquo;action.&rdquo;  In a case where a person receives his pension payment and is dissatisfied with the sum he gets, believing he is entitled to a larger sum, does that action then entitle him to bring a challenge to the ombudsman about what has been proposed? </P>
      <P>Second, the whole point of the ombudsman is that a person has access at low cost or free, it is confidential and attempts are made to resolve problems without all the expense of recourse to the legal process. Take the case of the person I have in mind who decides to go to the ombudsman and says: &ldquo;This is my case, will you have a look at it, have I got a <i>prime facie </i>case or do you know anything about it?&rdquo;  However, the trustees, who may feel they have a case as well &ndash; there are two sides to every story &ndash; are the big guns, the individual is the small gun. The cost of taking a case for somebody like that can be so crippling that he may conclude at the end of the day that it is not worth it and give up.</P>
      <P>Those are my two concerns about what the Minister has said. At the end of the day, everything will depend on the attitude of the ombudsman. Under my proposal, the ombudsman could still refuse to make an exception for somebody if he did not believe that they had a case. The Minister has suggested that the Ombudsman for Pensions may very well take an expansive view and in the past the general Ombudsman has acted in a way that many members of the Civil Service would not have liked him to. A great deal depends on the personality of the ombudsman concerned, making it a lottery situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not push this to a vote because it would be a foregone conclusion. I think I have made the case and I ask the Minister to revisit this issue <Col N="647" /> in the Dáil when he has further reflected on it. However, I suspect that what I am proposing would have the support of all sides of the House.</P>

It deals with the power of the Pensions Ombudsman to determine whether any person can be legally represented in the Ombudsman's Act, 1980.

      <P>These are technical amendments arising from changes to PRSA providers. The amendments are to the principal Act as it relates to the Pensions Board role in monitoring supervision and the issue of guidance notes for pensions generally. I wish to clarify that the requirements only extend PRSA providers when acting as PRSA providers. Section 11 extends the provision covering investigations by authorised persons to PRSAs. These amendments arise as a consequence of the changes that I have been making in relation to the authorisation of PRSA providers. The amendments will limit the scope of the information supplied by the officers and employees of the PRSA to the board to information relating to PRSA activities of the PRSA provider. In addition, it will allow the board to require an employer to furnish it with such information as it is obliged to give under the obligations Section 1(2)(i), which covers the obligation of an employer to provide access to PRSA and to pay remit PRSA contributions. The effect of this is that the board will have the power to investigate an employer with regard to non-compliance with that section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, that is fine. As the Minister will remember from Committee Stage, the purpose of this amendment is to ensure that moneys which are deducted by an employer for the sake of pensions are not unreasonably delayed in the hands of the administrator. This issue was brought to my attention by a group of pension funds in particular which felt that the administrator kept large sums of money in a drawer for a long period of time and there was a question as to who was the beneficiary.</P>
      <P>This section appears to place the onus on the trustees and the management to remit everything within 21 days, but there does not appear to be anything to prevent the administrator from holding on to this money for a long time. I think the Minister will say that amendment No. 109 will allow for the transfer to the trustees and that may or may not be an adequate response. If the Minister is transferring it under amendment No. 109 so that the onus is on the trustees to put pressure on the administrator, what measures are open to the trustees to enforce this measure on the administrator? There do not appear to be any such measures. In other words, the administrator can prolong the holding of this money and the trustees cannot enforce the measure without difficulty. It would be better to leave this to the administrator with an obligation to do so.</P>
      <P>What does the phrase &ldquo;undue delay&rdquo; mean in the context of amendment No. 109? This seems a vague and unacceptable term. If the amendment proposed that the administrator was not allowed to hold the money for longer than a specified period of time, that would be fine. However, the amendment suggests that there will be a tussle between the trustees, who have no statutory powers, and the administrators who could hold on to the money. I know of a case where this happened and that was indefensible. I am open to be convinced, but I am not sure that Government amendment No. 109 answers the point I made on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>It seems that this is analogous to cases where people make investments. I do not often make investments but, on the advice of a dear friend, I made an investment in Greencore some years ago. I discovered that it is extremely difficult to extract money from financial agencies. They like to hold on to it because they get interest on it, and that is a pity. The individual investor should be cherished, and I am not sure that under this legislation as it exists without Senator Ross's valuable amendment the individual investor would be protected to the extent that he or she should be.</P>
      <P>Senator Ross is perfectly right in saying that the sum should be remitted to the trustees immediately and not held for an unreasonable time. Going against this amendment would mean the sum could be held for an unreasonable time. I am quite sure the Minister wishes to be reasonable.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance would love that. The trustees are responsible for the operation of pension schemes. I have some sympathy with what the two Senators have said. On the one hand, I am strongly advised that the trustees rather than the Pensions Board should have the power to force administrators to pay up; they would have a contract with them and would, therefore, be able to sue. On the other hand, I am somewhat persuaded by what Senator Ross has said both on this and on Committee Stage. The Pensions Board is of the view that the power should reside with the trustees. However, we will re-examine this between now and when it is introduced in the Dáil with a view to coming up with a better way of ensuring that there will be no undue delay in remitting money held by administrators.</P>
      <P>I fully accept what the Senators have said. The focus should be on protecting the consumer. I will undertake to insert something more definite in the Dáil if that is possible, and if the Senators withdraw their amendments on that basis, I will also withdraw mine.</P>

      <P>I would have to discuss that with my officials and with the Pensions Board. I would like something better than my amendment. I will at least move my amendment. However, I would like to table a stronger amendment imposing a much greater onus on administrators to pass money over. I come from a profession that has been accused over the years of retaining moneys on behalf of people for longer than necessary. Perhaps we can come up with a mechanism to put the onus on administrators to pay up. I am advised that it is up to the trustees to pursue the administrators. However, that is too weak and I would prefer a stronger provision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on this important and highly complicated Bill. The sooner it can be implemented the better. The Minister will be aware that Senator O'Toole, Senator Ross and I were unhappy at the way the Bill was processed through the various Stages. We were unhappy at the large number of new sections that appeared on Committee Stage and the large number of amendments on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and his officials rightly consulted widely with the industry. Apart from the document I mentioned earlier, which I will pass on to the Minister's officials, I am not aware of any other group that was not fully consulted. Their expertise went into the making of the Bill. However, in the process this House was, at times, <Col N="664" /> sidelined. Information came late and we did not have the time required to consider all aspects of the legislation. The lesson to be learned from this experience is that Bills like this should be referred to a House committee where they could be examined in more informal surroundings with access by the Members to expertise.</P>
    <P>I express my appreciation for the help I received from the officials in the Department, especially from Ms Vaughan. She went out of her way to be helpful and was painstaking in her explanations to me of the various parts of the Bill. I thank the Pensions Board and Revenue officials, who were helpful in explaining different sections of the Bill at the briefing yesterday.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on getting this important legislation through the House. In the nature of things, it may have less searching scrutiny in the Lower House. In any event, I hope it will soon be on the Statute Book. I suspect that one or two sections of the Bill may ultimately be scrutinised out of here. That is in the nature of most legislation that is passed and there is probably little we did today that will change that.</P>
    <P>Between now and the Bill going to the Dáil, I urge the Minister to look again at the ombudsman question. I saw no point in pressing the issue and I know that, instinctively, the Minister is more at one with me on this aspect than with his colleagues on Merrion Street. He showed openness in dealing with Senator Ross's amendment. I congratulate him on getting the Bill through the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very difficult and technical Bill. Many of the amendments, from both Government and Opposition, are almost impossible to decode unless they are considered in great detail. The Minister's grasp of the Bill is superb. It is an example of the benefit of having a competent Minister in an area of great difficulty and intricacy. He had a much better grasp of the legislation than the rest of us. Sometimes Ministers have come to the House without a proper grasp of their legislation but this Minister was not one of them. To that extent I compliment him. He was well briefed and took the trouble to respond to the points raised. It did not matter that we did not agree on all of them.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable that the wider pensions industry has not been addressed in this Bill, which is mainly concerned with new developments rather than the industry itself. I plead with the Minister to look at the industry. Pensions are something people understand they have but do not understand anything about, and this Bill will not educate them. People contribute to pension funds but then ignore them for 30 or 40 years. For some reason they do not, nor do they want to understand what is happening to their money. The Minister said as much in reply to a point I raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a very paternalistic attitude to pensions from those who organise them. This is a problem the Minister may consider because serious issues are involved. There is the issue of <Col N="665" /> where the money goes and whether it is well invested. I submit it is not well invested and all the evidence is on my side. There is the issue of what happens in the pensions industry, what people in the industry charge and why they charge and are paid so much for doing so little and being so unsuccessful.</P>
    <P>There is also the issue of transparency, where those of us paying into pension funds are putting money into funds we know nothing of and are not told. We do not know what we are paying for, nor the charges we have to make. However, we know that some people are getting very rich out of the industry and they are not delivering. That will be the issue to be addressed in the next pensions Bill.</P>
    <P>This is a very big and untransparent area. The Bill addresses certain issues and there is the Pensions Board, which is politically appointed. However, there is also a huge, almost invisible area that has not been explored, either by financial correspondents or the Government. It is a very self-satisfied, self-perpetuating industry. This should be explored much more deeply by Governments in future and I hope the next pensions Bill will deal with other areas of the industry and make it much more transparent to those who create it so that it becomes directed from the bottom and not the top.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minster on his grasp of detail and for the way in which he has taken the Bill through the House. It is an example to many other Ministers who have not been so knowledgeable or acted so skilfully. I also thank him for being in attendance throughout rather than sending in a Minister of State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnLeonard" hpid="Ms Leonard Ms Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Ms Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I also thank the Minister for his attendance. He has been present for all social welfare legislation introduced to the House over the past five years. I agree with much of what Senator Ross said about the pensions industry.</P>
      <P>In this Bill the Minister has begun the process whereby ordinary people can avail of pensions. The most important aspect of the legislation is that members of the public will have greater awareness of and control over their pensions, and that is to be welcomed. I thank the Minister's officials, the Pensions Board and the Revenue, who met us yesterday for a briefing. They have been very helpful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their forbearance when dealing with this Bill. The debate was not conducted in a way I, as a parliamentarian, would have wished and I apologise for that. Difficulties arose from the start of the process when we said we would be open to submissions and amendments. As the debate progressed we realised there could have been a better way to proceed and I apologise to the House and to Senators for bearing the brunt of what happened. However, we can take some pride in going to the Dáil with a cleaner Bill and <Col N="666" /> hopefully we will have fewer technical amendments. Senators should recognise there were some key issues we had to deal with here.</P>
      <P>We will look at some of the issues raised before going to the other House. I agree to a certain extent with some of the sentiments expressed by Senator Ross on the issue of pensions and transparency. There was a national pensions policy initiative on my desk when I became Minister and the issue of raising pension coverage in the general population came from that. That was the reason for bringing forward this Bill. Time will tell whether the Bill is successful when passed. It is subject to PPF reviews and renegotiations, as there are PPF commitments to ascertain whether this will ultimately be successful in increasing pension cover. I do not doubt we will be coming back more often with a pensions Bill than heretofore and perhaps on those occasions or at intervening times we may be in a position to deal with some of the other issues to which Senator Ross referred.</P>
      <P>Regarding the kind of pension structure the legislation sets up, it will be more transparent and we will know more about charges and disclosure to people. People will be more aware of what they are getting or not getting for their investment.</P>
      <P>It has obviously happened before that the Pensions Board appeared before Oireachtas committees and perhaps that should happen more often so we can look at the board's workings and powers. Going back to Senator Manning's point, it was probably preferable to leave this with a specialised committee, given the back-up available to people. However, there were time constraints. This was an agreed process &ndash; there was all-party agreement in both Houses on passing this before the dissolution of the Dáil &ndash; and it was best to get it passed.</P>
      <P>I thank Senators for their remarks. I thank my officials, who were absolutely excellent as always, in particular the official who has been living with me for the past four and a half years in dealing with this. I thank her particularly for her efforts. They say behind every good man is a good woman and I assure the House I have excellent officials &ndash; there are more officials than those behind me. I also thank the Revenue and Pensions Board officials, who were available at all times of the day and night &ndash; I assure the House that meant well into the night at times. I also thank the Cathaoirleach and his officials. Having been a Whip in the Dáil I was very much aware of the difficulties for people in putting down amendments and I thank the Seanad staff for all they have done. It has not been unappreciated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted the Minister of State is here to take this debate as he will know, being in general practice like me, that if one writes a prescription, there is a very good chance that one's instructions will be reinforced when the patient gets to the pharmacy. We have had a very good network of community pharmacies all over the country where individual attention was given to patients, which was extraordinarily important. They were frequently advised on health matters which was important in freeing our accident and emergency departments and general practitioners of unnecessary visits. The Minister of State will understand the value of these pharmacies.</P>
      <P>There have been problems regarding the regulations introduced in 1996 but the road the Minister has taken, bringing in total deregulation, has been unwise. The Minister set up a committee last September to look at deregulation of pharmacies, as we have had ridiculous incidents where, because of the ruling that starting a new pharmacy could be considered a threat to existing pharmacies, such pharmacies could not be opened in neighbouring towns. That was not good.</P>
      <P>However, the Minister pre-empted the findings of his own group by bringing in deregulation of the retail pharmacy business on 31 January this year. Unofficial statements from officials in the Minister's Department and a report in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> following that announcement suggest that even they were anxious about this. The Minister said he had to bring in deregulation because it was <i>ultra vires</i> since 1998 and that he had to act. However, it would have been better if he had waited to discuss this with the committee. The Deloitte &amp; Touche report stated that products supplied by pharmacies seemed good value for money. I realise the price of pharmaceutical products is dearer in some of our pharmacies here than in other EU countries. There might have been a better way of dealing with the situation, such as bringing in a <i>prix fixée</i> such as exists in France and Italy. We cannot just look at the price of individual pharmaceutical products.</P>
      <P>This country has one of the lowest rates of consumption of medicines in the European Union. That is largely because pharmacists do not press people into getting extra pharmaceutical products. The same may not happen if pharmacies are based in supermarkets where the individual pharmacist may not have the same feeling for the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also have a very low rate of drug reactions and admissions to hospital due to poor compliance in taking pharmaceutical products. This is very important and I do not think it has been taken into account. Good advice is needed in this area and patients get it from existing pharmacies. During the winter, when there has been such a crisis in terms of people on trolleys in accident <Col N="668" /> and emergency departments, a colleague of mine contacted me, asking if anyone had taken any account of the number of people who have to be kept in hospital due to reactions of an adverse nature to pharmaceutical products. I had not thought of it at all, but he felt that a reasonable percentage of bed days in hospital were due to such reactions. If we adopt a less personalised system, more of these beds may be taken up.</P>
    <P>Pharmacists, as I am sure Members saw, were frightened that the Minister's actions would favour foreign companies and chains at the expense of independent local pharmacies. I do not know how this point was reached. I note that Gehe, the German pharmaceutical retailers, have pulled out of buying the Unicare chain. What happened does not seem to have satisfied anyone. I ask the Minister of State to explain why he believes this is the right way forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Henry for raising this issue. Could such deregulation mean that in certain areas it will be more difficult for people to get prescriptions? I am thinking of rural areas in particular where it may not be economically sound for some of the bigger chains to open branches. Increased competition might put the local pharmacy out of business and the consumer at a disadvantage. In certain areas, the local pharmacy, like the post office, is a focal point. Local pharmacists know their customers' needs very well. In the context of this debate, I ask the Minister to consider if certain pharmaceutical products can be included in the general lists. I support Senator Henry's comments on this issue. A number of people have contacted me about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Henry and Senator Cosgrave for raising this issue on the Adjournment. The retail pharmacy trade has not been deregulated. That is a very misleading statement and it is very important that the Seanad understands the position. The opening and operation of pharmacies has been governed by the Pharmacy Acts since the 19th century. Anyone who complies with the provisions of the Acts and regulations may open a pharmacy. However, only fully qualified pharmacists may operate a pharmacy; this is as it should be. Openings are also subject to restrictions imposed by non-pharmacy legislation such as the Planning and Development Act, 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1996 pharmacy contractor regulations, made under the Health Act, 1970, set out the consent procedure for awarding a health board contract to provide prescription items under the community drug schemes. The 1996 regulations did not control the operation of a pharmacy, its opening or location outside that contract. During ongoing legal challenges to the regulations, the Minister sought advice from the Attorney General's office on the legal basis for the regulations. The advice received concluded that the regulations were <i>ultra vires</i>. Given that advice, he <Col N="669" /> could neither defend the regulations in court nor make settlements under them. Therefore, he revoked the regulations on 31 January 2002.</P>
    <P>The net effect of the revocation of the 1996 regulations is that there are no restrictions on the granting of new health board contracts in terms of location, population or viability of existing pharmacies. The revocation does not affect the operation of the community pharmacy scheme; existing pharmacy contracts still stand. The Minister has consistently supported a regulatory framework for community pharmacy services, as for the health services in general. The Department has spent four years and a considerable amount of money defending this framework in court and in other quarters. While it was not possible to continue doing so, the decision to revoke the regulations was not taken lightly.</P>
    <P>The pharmacy review group is examining, among other things, issues raised in the OECD report in relation to the consent procedure for granting community pharmacy contracts. The revocation of the 1996 regulations resulted from legal factors and did not involve any of the issues the group was set up to examine. The group will continue to operate under its terms of reference. It is now being asked to report as quickly as possible in light of the new circumstances. The type of framework, whether statutory or otherwise, required for community pharmacy services will be considered when the group reports.</P>
    <P>I concur with many of the remarks made by the Senators regarding the value of the pharmacies we have and the personal treatment they give to their clientele.</P>

      <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for affording me the opportunity to raise the issue of St. Joseph's secondary school, Tulla, on the Adjournment. It is unfortunate that it has again become an issue which must be debated in the Seanad. I want specific answers from the Minister regarding the recent decision made by the Department of Education and Science to proceed with an extension to St. Joseph's secondary school. As the Minister is aware, the parents, teachers and entire Tulla community were most dissatisfied with the decision to proceed with an extension. Their strongly preferred and logical option was a new school on a greenfield site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The local community prepared a package which they presented to the Minister for Education and Science. Detailed work was done on this by a local architect who made very specific proposals, along with teachers and parents representatives. It must have been clear to the Minister and his officials that the overriding view in Tulla was to proceed with a greenfield site. Nevertheless, the Department has, for a second <Col N="670" /> time, made a decision to proceed with an extension.</P>
    <P>A two-acre site in Tulla currently accommodates over 500 pupils; it is very congested. The proposal is to extend that school to accommodate 700 children. The current school opened in 1987 and had 270 pupils. The number of pupils has increased to 540 and all the indications are that the figure will expand much more rapidly in the future. If that happens, as we know it will, it does not seem to be prudent financial management by the Department to proceed with an extension on a two acre site that would prohibit future extension. A future Government will have to build a new school at enormous cost. It would be prudent financial management to build on a greenfield site a new school with playing pitches and to which an extension could be added.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister tell us how this decision was reached? Were different considerations taken into account? Was the fact that this is a rapidly expanding area adjacent to Ennis considered? Previous figures showed that it expanded rapidly and current figures indicate that this will continue. Was the question of recreational facilities taken into account as the existing site does not provide these? Did the Department and the Minister properly examine the proposals submitted by the parents' and teachers' representatives?</P>
    <P>The decision taken is contrary to the wishes of the local community, parents, teachers and all concerned. Who made such a decision without the agreement of the Tulla community? I thought that we lived in a democracy where the people's will was taken into account and where the wisdom and judgment of a local community received priority consideration. This decision must be looked at again since the prudent action is to build a new school on a greenfield site, affording the current and future students the best in educational facilities and the teachers the best environment in which to teach the young people of Tulla and its environs. If the project goes ahead as the Department envisages, how will the teachers teach and the students study while construction work goes on around and on top of the building? Why for the sake of saving &euro;600,000 or &euro;700,000 did the Department make this ill-considered decision for an area of County Clare where education was given priority in the past, and I hope will be given it in the future?</P>

      <P>I thank the Senator for giving me the opportunity to discuss this matter. The school in question was built in 1983 to cater for 250 pupils. An application was received by the Department in 1997 from the school's board of management for additional accommodation. The application was referred to the Department's planning section for assessment of the long-term projected enrolment figure for the school. A figure of 500 pupils was evaluated and subsequently agreed by the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was considered that an extension of 900 square metres was required to provide the rel<Col N="671" /> evant necessary accommodation. Schedules of overall accommodation and residual accommodation were drawn up on this basis by the Department's senior inspector, issued to the board of management and subsequently accepted. The Department's post-primary building unit provided nominations to the board for the appointment of a design team to commence architectural planning of an extension.</P>
    <P>In January 1999 the trustees of the school informed the building unit that they had not been consulted regarding the application for additional accommodation and had not given their consent to same. Therefore, the project was put on hold pending their decision. In April 1999 the trustees requested permission to appoint a design team to proceed with the proposed extension. In June 1999, a new list of nominations for the appointment of a design team was sent to the trustees. In November, before they appointed the design team, the trustees and board stated that they did not think an extension was the solution and requested the building unit to consider the provision of a new school on a greenfield site. As a result the building unit requested the trustees to appoint a consultant architect to carry out a feasibility study to look at the best solution to the school's requirements.</P>
    <P>In December 2000, the feasibility study was received and referred to the technical staff of the Department for examination. A planning and briefing meeting was held on 24 January 2001 to discuss the four options put forward in the feasibility study. Option three of the recommendations, that is, to refurbish the existing building and provide an extension, was seen as the best. The consultant architect was requested to prepare a report, including detailed costings of phasing and decanting of pupils for this option. A revised feasibility study was received by the building unit in March 2001. However, this study was based on the schedule of overall accommodation and included the application of revised area limits to the existing accommodation and a stand-alone PE hall which were not part of the initial schedule of residual accommodation.</P>
    <P>Following examination of this study the decision of the officials in the building unit was to remain with the initial schedule of residual accommodation, to build an extension on the existing site and refurbish the current buildings. This decision was conveyed to the trustees of the school in September 2001. The trustees and board of management of the school were unhappy with this decision as their preferred option was still for a new school on a greenfield site. They again requested the building unit to consider this option and identified six possible sites for the new school.</P>
    <P>In November 2001, officials from the building unit visited the school and examined the existing site and the proposed sites put forward by the school authority. All the sites were examined and only one was considered reasonably suitable. <Col N="672" /> However, it is outside the town boundary and approach is by means of a narrow road with no footpaths or public lighting. It also has implications for the local authority regarding the compulsory purchase of adjoining lands. All these considerations and the abnormal works associated with this site rendered it also unsuitable and uneconomical.</P>
    <P>A further meeting was held with the trustees in the building unit in Tullamore this month. The trustees were informed that having examined the feasibility study and following the visit to the school and sites, officials concluded that the educational requirements of this school could be met by the provision of an extension of 1,096 square metres on the existing site, encompassing the updating of residual accommodation in line with current area norms. The current buildings are in good condition from educational, architectural and value for money points of view. The trustees were advised that they could apply for a new stand-alone PE hall which would either be provided on the existing site or on an alternative site if available from the trustees. An application form for same was given to the trustees.</P>
    <P>The trustees were informed that in the interim the building unit would ensure that three prefabricated classrooms would be provided for September 2002 to cater for the existing enrolments. It is proposed to approve the appointment of a design team to commence architectural planning on the proposed extension-refurbishment in the current year. The appointment of the consultant architect will be via the European procurement procedures.<i></i></P>

      <P>Does the Minister of State believe it is satisfactory to have a PE hall located some distance from the school? In the case of this school in Tulla, it could be anything up to half a mile away from the school. Is that in the general interests of the children of Tulla?</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I presume there is an ongoing review of election procedures in the Department. Will the Minister of State update us on those procedures because, being realistic, we are now within weeks of an election?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="673" />I want to raise a number of matters with the Minister of State and I ask him to reply to them to the best of his ability. The first concerns the new procedures on nominations for general elections in light of the High Court decision on deposits etc. Has the Department come up with a formula in that regard? Will it be the case that only a certain number of people can nominate or what will be the position in that regard? Will pictures of candidates appear on the ballot papers? Have steps been taken to ensure that certain procedures are adhered to and that candidates or agents will be satisfied with those procedures?</P>
    <P>I presume the Minister of State will be of a mind that, as far as possible, polling stations should be as accessible and user friendly as possible, although I am sure there may be difficulty with the odd polling station. While people who are handicapped in one way or other might be entitled to special voting arrangements, there are others for whom voting is part of a day out. Will direction be given to returning officers that, as far as possible, areas should be made wheelchair accessible etc.? I understand notice went out in one constituency recently to the effect that certain polling stations were not wheelchair accessible and people now have an opportunity to vote at an alternative station. I realise arrangements cannot be 100% perfect but I am sure the Minister of State would support, in principle, my thoughts on that matter.</P>
    <P>I understand three constituencies have been selected to use electronic voting in the forthcoming election but will polling clerks be sufficiently briefed in that regard? Have these machines been tested and will there be a back-up system in place? Will people in the three nominated constituencies &ndash; Dublin North, Dublin West and Meath &ndash; have the option to vote using either system? What will happen if technical difficulties arise? I have had the experience, as I am sure have other Members, of arriving at a polling booth very early only to find that machines had broken down or there was a power failure. I am sure the Minister of State has discussed that aspect thoroughly with his senior Minister and the officials in the Department.</P>
    <P>On the question of polling clerks and the instructions given to them, council officials or local teachers sometimes apply for the position. In the last Seanad election, instructions were given by the returning officer which obviously had not been read fully by some people resulting in certain votes being disallowed, through no fault of the returning officer or her assistant. It may be a case of certain information being passed down the line to officials &ndash; one official described it as the &ldquo;Noddy Noddy letter&rdquo;&ndash; but some people can be briefed morning, noon and night and they still do not take in the information. Is there a plan in place to ensure that instructions are fully effective? In the trial areas it may be necessary to brief those involved on this system because some people are less mechanically minded than others, particularly if they have not used these machines <Col N="674" /> previously, regardless of what will be explained to the public.</P>
    <P>There should be some latitude in terms of people getting on the supplementary register. If people want to vote, they should be allowed to vote.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State to take on board the various points I have made. I am sure he and his officials have been working on these matters but given the mistakes made in the past, a full examination of this area is needed, although I acknowledge trials have taken place. I thank the Chair for his indulgence. I am sure he will agree with some of the points I have made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Cosgrave for raising these matters. A range of improvements has been made to electoral law over the past five years and I will confine my comments to the specific matters raised by the Senator.</P>
      <P>The House will recall that in July 2001, the High Court held that the provisions of the Electoral Act, 1992, and the European Parliament Elections Act, 1997, in relation to election deposits, were repugnant to Article 40.1 of the Constitution. In light of this finding of the High Court and following examination of the matter, the Government approved the text of a Bill on 26 February 2002 to provide for an alternative to deposits. The Bill, which will be published shortly, will provide that non-party candidates at European, Dáil and local elections will be required to obtain the signatures of 60, 30 and 15 electors, respectively, and those assentors will have to be registered in the constituency or local electoral area to which the candidate is seeking election. Candidates who are nominated by a registered political party and who have a certificate of political affiliation from their political party will not have to obtain signatures on their nomination papers. Details of the procedures for assenting the nomination forms will be set out in the Bill.</P>
      <P>In relation to wheelchair access, polling stations are located, whenever possible, in buildings that are accessible to people with disabilities and must be located on the ground floor in all cases. My Department issues advice on access matters to returning offices in advance of each poll setting out details in relation to access widths, the need for suitable parking facilities and information in relation to ramps. Returning officers are also required to make a table and chair available at polling stations at which electors can vote if they find that is more convenient than the traditional polling booth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of other arrangements in place to facilitate voters with disabilities. These include voting at an alternative polling station if the local station is inaccessible; assistance in voting at the polling station by a companion or the presiding officer; postal voting by electors living at home with a physical illness or disability and <Col N="675" /> voting at hospitals and nursing homes by electors living there.</P>
    <P>The Senator raised the issue of electronic voting. The Government recently agreed to proposals for the use of voting machines and electronic vote counting in the constitutencies of Dublin North, Dublin West and Meath at the forthcoming general election, subject to satisfactory final testing of the software involved.</P>
    <P>The elections in the three constitutencies will be conducted by the respective returning officers who will set up each election using election management software. Voters will register in the normal way at the polling station, record their preferences on a ballot paper displayed on a voting machine by pressing the space beside the candidate's photography and vote by pressing a &ldquo;cast vote&rdquo; button. The votes will be securely stored in vote modules, which will be brought to the count centre after the close of the poll and counted electronically using the PR-STV count software. Final results should be available within two hours of the close of the poll. The voting machine is accessible for wheelchair users.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="676" />While the system is simple to use, an information campaign will be undertaken in each of the three pilot constituencies. This will involve the distribution of an information leaflet to each registered elector, a poster campaign, local radio advertising, a travelling roadshow with the voting machine and a number of other measures. In addition, training of returning officers and their election staff will be undertaken in the run up to the polls.</P>
    <P>The electoral system comprises a complex set of arrangements from voter registration to voting and vote counting. It requires continual assessment to ensure that any unnecessary obstacles or inflexible practices in the registration and voting process are removed. At the same time, however, we must make certain that the integrity and security of the system are not diminished in any way. Significant improvements in the electoral process have been adopted in recent years and this process will not doubt continue.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 1.05 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Thursday, 7 March 2002.</P>
