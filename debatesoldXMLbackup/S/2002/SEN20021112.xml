      <P>I have received notice from Senator Finucane that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to outline when construction will commence on the Alzheimer's unit at St. Ita's Hospital in Newcastle West, County Limerick.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator O'Meara of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to restore the breast screening service at Nenagh General Hospital.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Henry of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to explain the reason funding for the postgraduate course in clinical psychology in Trinity College Dublin has been withdrawn at short notice, particularly in view of the serious shortage of such personnel in the country.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Leyden of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to outline the precise contents of the Security Council resolution agreed by Ireland.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Finucane, O'Meara and Henry as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. I regret I have to rule Senator Leyden's matter out of order as it is more appropriate for discussion as a substantive motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of my party, I wish to express our sympathy on the sad death of Richard Hourigan. I did not know Richard Hourigan, even though I was a Member of the Dáil on one occasion when he was a Member of the Seanad. I cannot accurately place him but, having read <Col N="778" />about him and spoken about him to Senator Brennan, I have obtained a clearer picture of him.</P>
      <P>Richard Hourigan served as a Senator from 1983 to 1987 and from 1989 to 1992. He was famous in agricultural circles and was particularly well known in the IFA. He was especially noted for his expertise and knowledge, which he used professionally in the field of agriculture.</P>
      <P>Mr. Hourigan was from Murroe, County Limerick, and he contested one Dáil election. He and members of his family were well known for their public spiritedness and civic engagement. His brother has been a long-time member of Limerick County Council, which he served on one occasion as cathaoirleach and he is currently a member of the local authority.</P>
      <P>This is the second occasion during this session we have had expressions of sympathy in respect of a former Member of the House. It is a noble sentiment and rite that we should continue because Mr. Hourigan served here as a Member. He served in the interests of agriculture, a topic on which he contributed his expertise during his two terms as Senator. I am sure his wisdom and knowledge of agriculture were of great benefit in the Seanad debates. On behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party, I extend our sympathy to the members of his family, his wide circle of friends and acquaintances and, particularly, the agricultural community where his loss will be deeply felt.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. B. Hayes Mr. B. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Richard Hourigan was a Limerick man. The Hourigan name is synonymous with Fine Gael politics in County Limerick and it is with great sadness that on behalf of my colleagues in Seanad Éireann I mark the untimely passing of Richard Hourigan. He was a distinguished member of our party for a long period, not just in the Seanad, but also as a committed Fine Gael activist. Today, we mark his untimely passing.</P>
      <P>Richard Hourigan was a Member of the Seanad from 1982 to 1987 and from 1989 to 1992. I did not know him, but during the last Seanad election campaign I got to know his brother, Paddy Hourigan. I was very well treated when I called to the Hourigan household in County Limerick on a beautiful summer evening, where I spent a long time doing my best to put forward my point of view. Richard will be sadly missed by his family, his community in County Limerick and the Fine Gael activist base in the county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Richard Hourigan had a distinguished record of service as a Member of Seanad Éireann. He won three of the four elections he contested, which is a remarkable achievement for a person who was not a former Deputy. It was an excellent electoral performance. He was also an excellent debater. He won a gold medal at UCD for his debating skills which I am sure he honed to good use when he was elected to the Seanad in 1982. He was an agriculturalist who was elected to the House on the Agricultural Panel. He was also a farmer and had graduated with a degree in agricultural science from UCD. Not many people undertook that course at the time. He was an <Col N="779" />expert in agriculture and was an official, in many capacities, for the Irish Farmers Association from 1962 to 1979.</P>
    <P>To his wife, Nora, their three children, his brother, Paddy, and his cousin, Michael, another Fine Gael councillor in Limerick city, I extend our sympathy at his untimely passing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been asked by my Independent colleagues to speak on their behalf in memory of the former Senator, Richard Hourigan. I do so with sadness because I was unaware of his illness and impending demise.</P>
      <P>Unlike the last two speakers, I had the privilege of knowing Richard Hourigan. He was a most delightful and charming man and represented the best of the Fine Gael tradition. Like everybody else, my roots were in the country. My grandfather was an auctioneer and farmer; in fact, he did a little bit of everything. I gather it was similar with Richard. He sat in front of me in the Chamber and was an authority on farming. He was large in body, in mind and sometimes, as he rose to his feet, one wondered if he would really get off the ground, oratorically speaking. It does not surprise me that he won a gold medal for debating and oratory because suddenly this large frame would appear to lift and passion would come into the debate, even late at night. He was an ornament to the House. He is somebody of whom I have fond memories and who will be missed. I send my sympathy and that of my Independent colleagues to his family.</P>
      <P>My extremely efficient secretary-PA seems to have used the same research as Senator Hayes which, if I am correct, is Jim Farrelly's <i>Who's Who in Irish Politics, 1990-1991</i>, an authoritative book which describes Mr. Hourigan as &ldquo;an able, witty speaker who is extremely knowledgeable on farming and on farmer politics&rdquo;. That is the kind of person we always needed in this House. I have often criticised the method of election to the Seanad and I am afraid that I can be a bit snotty about it sometimes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Here was somebody, however, who came through on the Agricultural Panel and was also an authority on agriculture. This is the way to use the somewhat convoluted electoral system of the House. I, for one, am glad that it brought Mr. Hourigan here so that we on the backbenches could share in the warmth of his companionship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Bhí aithne agam ar Dick Hourigan. Bhíomar le chéile sa Tigh seo ar feadh roinnt blianta agus bhí cairdeas eadrainn. Chaitheamar cuid mhaith ama trasna an bhóthair i dtigh ósta nach dtabharfaidh mé ainm air. Dick Hourigan made many efforts to explain farming to me, particularly late at night. I would not be recognised as the most sympathetic commentator on the ups and downs of agriculture but Dick saw it <Col N="780" />as a personal crusade to enlighten me about it. As well as being an authority on agriculture, he was also farseeing and passionately committed to it. He considered its future as much as its present condition. His loyalty to Fine Gael was taken for granted and whatever his personal thoughts might have been about things that were said or done, his loyalty to the party was unequivocal and absolute.</P>
      <P>I was saddened to hear that Dick Hourigan had left us because I did not see him as being of an age where death was a likely prospect. The last time I met him he still had hopes of returning to some sort of political activity and while that particular ambition has been denied him, he made a contribution both to his party and to this House for which he deserves to be remembered. Ar dheis lámh Dé go raibh a anam fíordhílis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I was shocked and saddened to hear of Dick Hourigan's death. I shared a similar background to him both in the farming sector and from having served with him on these benches from 1989 to 1992. Dick Hourigan was a formidable figure in Irish agriculture and it could be said that the IFA was, in many respects, a product of his energy and enthusiasm. It is not readily appreciated that he was one of those who tramped through the highways and byways organising the IFA in its early days, but he did so effectively and well. Subsequently, he became a formidable fund raiser for the IFA. Indeed, on one occasion he castigated me for not allowing my grain levy to be deducted for the IFA's coffers, and he left me in no doubt as to my responsibility in the matter.</P>
      <P>Mr. Hourigan was an effective advocate in this House for the agriculture industry in general and for farmers in particular. He never lost sight of his farming background which was always to the fore in his contributions to debates. In the latter stages of his membership of the House he suffered an accident from which he never fully recovered. It was with a deep sense of shock and sadness that I learned of his death. I had known him for a very long time. On behalf of the Progressive Democrats I extend sympathy to his wife and family, and to his Fine Gael colleagues. May he rest in peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I attended the removal of the remains of Richard Hourigan yesterday, and the massive turn-out demonstrated just how popular he was. I met many Oireachtas representatives and councillors from around the country and many senior members of the IFA were also present. It was testament to his long service in the IFA and in farming, of which he had a great knowledge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was not aware that he had won a gold medal in debating until my colleague referred to it, but it does not surprise me because over the years Richard was always a person who could be asked, even at short notice, to address a local Fine Gael meeting at branch, district or constituency level. <Col N="781" />He was a very convincing orator at those meetings and was recognised for his great understanding of agriculture in particular.</P>
    <P>I extend my sympathy and that of all the other Members of the House to his wife Nora and their family, to all his brothers and sisters, especially to his brother, Paddy Hourigan, who is at this stage the longest serving member of Limerick County Council and who is well known to you, a Chathaoirligh, and to my county council colleague, Senator Michael Brennan. Paddy is one of the most solid members of Limerick County Council.</P>
    <P>It came as a shock to all of us because it was an untimely death. I agree with Senator Dardis that he probably did not recover properly from that injury. Richard's passing will leave a big void in Fine Gael circles because the Hourigans have been synonymous with Fine Gael over the years. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan2" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I too would like to be associated with the expressions of sympathy to the Hourigan family. In County Limerick we recognise the contribution of Richard Hourigan to Seanad Éireann. His brother, Paddy, is a member of Limerick County Council and was cathaoirleach on one occasion. I have had the honour of serving with him for the past 18 years. We appreciate the contribution to political life of the Hourigan family. All political parties were represented last night at the removal of Richard's remains.</P>
      <P>Richard Hourigan was a man of all the people and that is recognised by those who turned out last night to pay their respects. We also appreciate the contribution he made to community organisations throughout the county. He was admired for that. To his wife Nora and family I extend my deepest sympathy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I also would like to be associated with the expressions of sympathy on the death of the late Richard Hourigan. I first met Richard through the IFA, where he was an organiser and I was a member. Later he joined me here in Seanad Éireann, also on the Agricultural Panel. As a member of the Fine Gael front bench he proved to be a fine spokesperson on agriculture</P>
      <P>I would have to agree with Senator Finucane that the esteem in which he was held and his popularity were definitely in evidence last night at the removal. I arrived at the church in Milford in Limerick 9.30 p.m. and the remains did not arrive until 11 o'clock. That will give an idea of the popularity of Richard and the Hourigan family. I would like to convey my sympathy to his wife Nora, to his family and to his brother Paddy, a colleague of mine on Limerick County Council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leader. She will be aware of the two primary legislative measures relating to the confiscation of assets gained through criminal activity. I refer to the Criminal Justice Act, 1994 and the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996. Last week in the High Court a successful challenge was mounted by an individual currently serving a 28 year prison sentence for drug trafficking. Will the Government be appealing this decision to the Supreme Court in order that a definite position in respect of this legislation is established? It is vitally important for communities fighting the scourge of drugs that this legislation be upheld in the courts. Criminals have taken huge sums of money from and destroyed the lives of young people in some of the most deprived communities in this and other cities. We must ensure the assets gained through such activity are returned to the communities concerned. Will the Leader find out from her Government colleagues whether the State will test this judgment in the Supreme Court?</P>
      <P>Last week six matters were raised on the Adjournment, three on Wednesday and three on Thursday. On both evenings one Minister of State came to the House to respond to all three items. It is a matter of disrespect to the House that the Minister to whom an Adjournment matter is addressed, or a Minister of State from his or her Department, is not present when the matter is discussed. Will the Leader raise this question? It is not acceptable for a Minister to read three prepared scripts to the Members who have brought matters to the attention of the House. We must set a precedent at the start of this new Seanad that when a matter is raised on the Adjournment, the relevant Minister or Minister of State comes to the House to hear the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader ascertain from the Government when the new civil registration Bill will be presented to the House? Like other Members, I receive the newsletter of the Genealogical Society of Ireland. The headline on the editorial in this month's edition is &ldquo;Where is the new Civil Registration Bill&rdquo;. The editorial continues, &ldquo;On the tenth anniversary of the birth of <Col N="783" />the Roscommon experiment there is still no registration&rdquo;. I understand this matter comes under the auspices of the Department of Health and Children and concerns the question of the registration of births, marriages and deaths. There is concern that unless the Bill is produced matters will be left in a quagmire, and that if it is produced in the shape anticipated, much less information will be accessible to the public. I would welcome information on the matter.</P>
      <P>Could we have a debate on the media which is necessary because we see many calls in the newspapers for reform of the libel laws, all in the interest of newspaper magnates? Today a woman married to a former Cabinet Minister, Mrs. McDaid, was savaged by two women journalists on foot of an article which appeared in a disgusting Irish tabloid owned by English interests. The two women journalists who attacked Mrs. McDaid admitted subsequently that they had not even read the book in question. This is quite extraordinary. If we are to do anything with the libel laws, we must establish a strong press council. I look forward to the debate, to which I would like to contribute. I have no fear of newspapers, their editors or their sometimes lamentable correspondents, especially as I am a member of the National Union of Journalists. I respect many of my colleagues, but there are those whom I do not respect at all. There are newspapers I do not respect either.</P>
      <P>I always think it is very rude to ask a question and then leave the House, but I have to attend the Committee on Foreign Affairs. I apologise and do not intend any discourtesy to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Norris for reminding me about the meeting of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. I had forgotten the time had moved on and I may not be here to hear the Leader's entirely reasonable replies to my questions.</P>
      <P>I would like the Leader to tell us why we have no motion on the Flood tribunal and why we have one on the Lindsay tribunal, a sycophantic motion which, among other things, sings the Government's praises. I find the contradiction between the two attitudes quite extraordinary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Ms O'Rourke Ms O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of information, because the Senator will be gone, the Lindsay tribunal has concluded but it is an interim report and that was the wording used in Dáil Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that this is an interim report and that if Fianna Fáil had responded to the Flood tribunal's request it would have been published before the election, not afterwards. The six month delay in appointing two judges was extraordinarily convenient to the Government parties before the general election. I also believe that the motion on the Lindsay tribunal is an appallingly poorly worded one.</P>

      <Col N="784" />Anyone who has been listening to any of a dozen different radio programmes over the past few weeks would wonder what is going on in the construction industry, both on the part of some estate agents and on the part of builders. Do consumers in that area have any rights at all? What hold does the industry have over the Government that things that could not be done in any other area continue to be done in the area of building? Purchasers of houses are treated disgracefully by the vast majority of builders. The catalogue of horror stories of abuse of customers is quite extraordinary and I ask for an immediate debate in this House on the building industry, the sale of property&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;and the apparent ignoring of the most basic of purchasers' rights, which now seems to be endemic in the industry.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Norris that we need a debate on the media. I found last Friday night's &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; unpleasant, in that somebody was given the opportunity to say things about a Member of the other House who happened to be her estranged husband. I have no idea what it had to do with public service. I have no idea what it had to do with anything other than prurience and I have no reason to believe that is what any of us really believes public service broadcasters should be doing. Where are we going to end up? If the estranged spouses of every Member of both Houses of the Oireachtas in that position are given such opportunities, RTÉ will be busy forever. If it extends beyond that and begins to explore the little peccadilloes of every Member of this House &ndash; I am sure the Leader is above reproach, but for the rest of us who are mere mortals, the idea of the media exploring&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is a fundamental need to look at the values that motivate our media because what I saw on the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; on Friday night was unworthy of public service broadcasting.

      <P>Last week several Senators referred to the importance of having the Minister for Communications, the Marine and Natural Resources attend the House to debate fisheries. It is critical that he attend the House next week. Over the weekend fishermen's organisations and fish processors emphasised the situation that would prevail and which would be catastrophic for the industry if negotiations next month are not successfully concluded. They outlined the possibility that the Spanish may have the right to use the Irish box, an area extending 50 miles around the coastline, from 1 January 2003. It is important to the fishermen and for spawning and conservation that the box be preserved. If the Spanish gain access it will be the end of fishing as we know it in this country.</P>

      <P>Two private schools in the Dublin area issued statements recently to the effect that, with the consent of the parents, they will engage in drug testing where there is a suspicion that students have been involved in drug taking. Will the Leader ask the Minister for Education and Science to indicate if this practice is to be extended to all schools? This may well happen due to public pressure and, if so, the Minister should indicate if the Department has the personnel and resources in terms of counsellors and so on to adequately monitor such practices. Many second level schools do not have access to in-school counselling services and are obliged to share them.</P>
      <P>If the practice of testing for drug taking was to be implemented throughout schools, either on a mandatory or random basis, it would have serious consequences for the second level system. In view of this it is important that the Minister should indicate, either in the House or elsewhere, his views and that of his Department on this issue. It is important that there should be no repetition of what recently happened in Bray.</P>

I understand that the progress of the commission is very slow, not because of Ms Justice Laffoy, but because it faces constant legal challenge. I have read reports that some of those waiting to be seen by the commission have taken their own lives, so this is a serious matter. I ask the Leader to arrange for the Minister to attend the House to outline the progress made by the commission.</P>
      <P>Since the relevant legislation on the BreastCheck programme was introduced by the then Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, I have been asking when a population register will be introduced. Most countries have such a register and if we had one we would have information on matters which have caused difficulties, such as the lack of knowledge on the number of medical card holders.</P>
      <P>I spoke about this in the past when it was the responsibility of the current Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan. I presume that it now comes under the remit of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Cullen. A population register is necessary in order to know the details of the country's population. It led to the Department of Health and Children running into trouble when it emerged that there were far more people than expected aged 70 years and over and, therefore, eligible for a medical card.</P>

      <P>I support the call of Senator Hayes in regard to the matter of drugs and drug barons. I imagine it would be the unanimous wish of this House that the State would appeal the High Court judgment in so far as the decision went against it. The Leader said we would have to await legislation, but, as I understand it, the Government made a definitive announcement in regard to the corruption assets bureau, as distinct from the Criminal Assets Bureau. Senator Hayes has referred to the two statutes the State has at its disposal. Correct me if I am wrong, but I understood that someone on behalf of the Government had indicated that the heads of a Bill had been agreed at Cabinet. Perhaps the Leader will comment further in her response.</P>

      <P>Another matter was brought to my attention yesterday. The organisers of Community Games have expressed concern that they do not have a home from the end of this year as Mosney will be dedicated to the housing of asylum seekers. Over 500,000 young people between the ages of six and 16 years take part in the games every year which are an integral part of communities. There is, therefore, an urgent need to find a permanent home for the games.</P>

      <P>While getting my hair cut today, I was informed by my hairdresser of the major difficulty in regard to adoption. She is trying to adopt and was told it would take her at least three years. There is a one year delay between applying and the first contact from the relevant authority.

      <P>There is much public disquiet regarding the amount of fluoride in our water supply. I tried to raise this issue last week. The Belgian health minister has banned all products containing fluoride and most European countries have banned this product. I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Health and Children to the House to explain the Government's position on the adverse effects fluoride can have on the nation's health. It is an important issue in both rural and urban areas. It was raised on six occasions at clinics I held in my constituency last weekend.</P>

      <P>Senator Brian Hayes raised the matter of a State appeal to the recent decision of the High Court in the case of a man convicted of drug trafficking. We were all shocked at the result of that appeal. I will endeavour to establish if an appeal is to be made. The Senator rightly pointed out that when people involved in trafficking drugs or young people see the goods being confiscated they know something real is happening.</P>
      <P>Senator Hayes also said that one Minister dealt with three Adjournment Matters on consecutive days last week. I suggest that the matter could be raised in tomorrow's meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. The same will often happen in the Dáil. I agree that a Minister of the relevant Department dealing with the Adjournment Matter is more meaningful.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris asked about the civil registration Bill. I will endeavour to establish when that will be brought before the House. He asked for a debate on the media and the Press Council and that was echoed by Senator Ryan. Both said they were affronted by recent media appearances. Nobody was forced to make themselves available to the media. The person made her own choice to do so; whether we think it is wise or not is another matter. Senator Ryan would have a lot to say if someone was muzzled. Because it is an interim report we were advised to use that terminology.</P>
      <P>Senator Ulick Burke raised the matter of the drugs policy that was announced by private schools. I understand it to be voluntary; it is certainly not mandatory. It is an issue that will be much debated. The Fianna Fáil Senators debated it at our meeting today. There is room for full discussion on this issue and I hope we can get clarification on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Henry raised the slow progress of the Laffoy Commission. I do not know at what stage it is. It has being challenged on several occasions &ndash; people have the right to do that &ndash; and that must have led to its slow progress. I will inquire <Col N="789" />about it. Senator Henry also asked about the population register. I do not know where it differs from the census but it clearly includes ages, status, etc. I will determine what is happening with it.</P>
    <P>Senator Coghlan supported Senator Hayes regarding the apportionment of the proceeds of drug trafficking. It was announced that the heads of a third Bill in this area were being progressed. I do not know at what stage they are but I can ask.</P>
    <P>Senator Coghlan also supported Senator Mansergh's call for a debate on the Estimates next week. Senator Mansergh is our finance spokesperson and he rightly raised the need for a debate. I will pass on his request and I hope the Minister for Finance will come to the House to talk to us about the Estimates.</P>

I hope the debate can be extended to include statements and questions on the fishing industry.</P>
      <P>My colleague, Senator Dardis, has informed me that the EU Agriculture and Fisheries Commissioner, Mr. Fischler, appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs yesterday and he was left in no doubt as to how the committee, which represents the people, felt about his far-reaching proposals. I am glad he was exposed to the criticism, rather than the Minister.</P>
      <P>Senator Leyden raised the issue of Iraq, about which he feels passionately, and perhaps the Minister for Foreign Affairs can be persuaded to attend the House to discuss it.</P>
      <P>Senator Feighan mentioned that supervisors in community colleges have not been paid and I am dismayed that is the case. It would be useful if the Senator tabled a motion on the Adjournment on this issue for the Cathaoirleach's consideration. It is a precise issue, to which there must be an answer because supervisors fit the bearna baoil and they are entitled to their pay.</P>
      <P>I contacted the office of the Minister for Arts, Tourism and Sport last week regarding the Special Olympics, on which Senator Phelan sought clarification, and I will do likewise this week regarding a proper home for the Community Games.</P>

    <Title>Second Interim Report of the Tribunal of Inquiry into Certain Planning Matters and Payments: Statements.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to be back in the Seanad and I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this important matter.</P>
      <P>The Second Interim Report of the Tribunal of Inquiry into Certain Planning Matters and Payments has rightly been described as a highly significant contribution to public and political life. Its findings on the modules completed to date are unambiguous and show the thoroughness with which the tribunal has carried out its investigations. Mr. Justice Flood has sent out a clear message to anyone who has any corrupt dealings or is contemplating such dealings in relation to the planning system that they will not get away with it. As Minister with responsibility for the operation of the planning system, I fully support that message.</P>
      <P>Corruption and the act of hindering or obstructing a tribunal are criminal offences and the law in this regard must be enforced. The findings of the Flood tribunal are a blow to the political system. It is unacceptable for any person who holds high office and the trust of both the Government and the public to accept corrupt payments in return for political favours. The Garda Commissioner, the Criminal Assets Bureau, the Revenue Commissioners and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement are examining the interim report. Mr. Justice Flood has already sent the report to the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an interim report and, at this stage, Mr. Justice Flood has not made any specific recommendations in relation to amendments to planning, local government or ethics in public office legislation. However, although much important work remains to be completed by the tribunal, some ongoing improvements of planning law and <Col N="791" />procedure can still be beneficially advanced by the Government in the meantime.</P>
    <P>The Government has already made a series of significant changes to planning legislation in the Planning and Development Act, 2000. We have introduced more opportunities for public consultation, made the system more open and transparent, introduced measures to ensure we have up to date development plans and updated procedures for the making of declarations of interest by elected members and officials. The Local Government Act, 2001, has also brought about change. It sets out comprehensive ethics provisions for local government staff and members in relation to the operation of all their functions and not just planning ones. National codes of conduct are currently being drawn up by my Department to give effect to these provisions and are being finalised as a matter of urgency. In the context of an ethical framework, it is not merely enough to avoid actual impropriety. The actions of all participants must also be seen to be above suspicion. In order to avoid any risk of damage to public confidence in local government, any appearance of improper conduct must be avoided.</P>
    <P>In light of the findings of the tribunal, the suggestion has been voiced that land use zoning functions should be made, or at least overseen, by a national zoning committee, possibly chaired by a High Court judge and staffed by planners. The central tenet in these suggestions is that zoning is not appropriate to local authorities or councillors. On this issue, it is important to note that Mr. Justice Flood has not made any findings in his interim report that the rezoning of land was procured corruptly. He found that Mr. Burke assured those present at the time of the payment of moneys to him that he understood the payment was being made to him in connection with the proposal to alter the planning status of the Murphy lands and further assured those present that he would honour his commitment to do so. Mr. Justice Flood found that the payment received by Mr. Burke amounted to a corrupt payment and all present were aware that it was such. However, the lands in question were not rezoned. The provisions of the Planning Acts contributed to this outcome. Zoning is carried out in public, following public consultation, and by majority decision of the elected members. No one person can, therefore, ensure the outcome of a proposal to zone land. That is as it should be. The majority of local councillors are honest people who carry out their functions faithfully and with no personal gain.</P>
    <P>Subsidiarity in the taking of decisions at the lowest appropriate level is a principle which has been endorsed at international and national levels. It is a basic consideration, for example, in the definition of our relationship with the European Union and in charters for good governance issued by the Council of Europe and other bodies. However, it also guides Irish policies on good <Col N="792" />governance. We can all recall that in 1999 the people voted at a referendum to enshrine a role for local government in our Constitution. It is also the case that land use and zoning decisions are generally local government functions in other jurisdictions.</P>
    <P>For all these reasons I am inclined to the view that land use planning is generally appropriate to decision making at local level. The key challenge, therefore, is to ensure openness, probity, fairness and efficiency in the operation of the planning system. It appears better, therefore, at this stage to press ahead with the recent reforms of the 2000 Act, while also awaiting the recommendations of the tribunal in due course.</P>
    <P>The development plans to be adopted under the Planning and Development Act, 2000, are due for completion by the end of 2003. We will assess the process in the light of that experience. As the revised development control procedures only came into force on 11 March this year, it is a little early to judge their impact on increasing efficiency.</P>
    <P>Aside from the planning code, the Taoiseach outlined in his public statement of 26 September 2002 the intensive campaign of legislative reform which has been launched to ensure the highest standards in public office. Three Acts, the Prevention of Corruption Act, 2002, the Standards in Public Office Act, 2001, and the Oireachtas (Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices) Act, 2001, have all been passed into law recently.</P>
    <P>A key element of this legislation is the establishment of the Standards in Public Office Commission as a permanent statutory body set up to monitor, investigate and regulate the conduct of those elected to serve the people or who are employed in the public service. This is to ensure the maintenance of proper ethical standards. The Act imposes on politicians and others an obligation to have one's tax affairs in order and to swear a statutory declaration that this is the case. An independent and powerful body, such as the Standards in Public Office Commission, with an ongoing mandate to supervise and maintain proper ethical standards is the best guarantee that what has happened in the past will not be permitted in the future.</P>
    <P>The Government also intends quickly to enact legislation to recover assets obtained by or enhanced through corruption. A corruption assets bureau will be established which will recover assets corruptly obtained and any increase in the value of an asset obtained through corruption. Under the new legislation, when a tribunal reports that, in its opinion, persons received or gave corrupt payments or received benefits as a result of corrupt practices in which they participated, a chief superintendent, acting as an officer of the corruption assets bureau, can go to the High Court and obtain freezing orders in respect of assets corruptly obtained or whose value has been corruptly enhanced. This is an important point which will apply whether the tri<Col N="793" />bunal reported before or after the passing of the legislation.</P>
    <P>The proposed new legislation will empower the High Court to appoint inspectors to the affairs of an individual or a company whose task will be to trace assets which have been corruptly received or whose value was corruptly enhanced through acquisitions and disposals and to report to the High Court on the current value of assets obtained with assets-funds which represent the direct or indirect proceeds of corruption. The High Court will be given specific statutory power to adjust the value of assets corruptly received into current day values. For example, if a person corruptly received £1,000 in 1960 and bought a house with that money, the High Court will be entitled to order that the current day value of the house be frozen or forfeited.</P>
    <P>The Proceeds of Crime Act, 1976, applies to property which directly or indirectly represents the proceeds of crime. The proposed legislation will extend that definition to include reference to property, the value of which was corruptly enhanced. It is, therefore, clear that the Government will not tolerate corruption in public life.</P>
    <P>The Government is wholly committed to providing the tribunal with the resources it requires to continue with work set out in its terms of reference in order that these matters can be resolved once and for all. To assist the tribunal, it has been enlarged by the addition of two new members. On 24 October I made an instrument appointing Judge Alan Mahon and Judge Mary Faherty as full members. I have also appointed Judge Gerald Keys as a reserve member. Judge Keys will sit with the tribunal to hear evidence with the intention that he will become a full member in the event that any existing member is unable to act for any reason.</P>
    <P>The newly enlarged tribunal will recommence public hearings on Wednesday, 20 November, and I wish it well in its future work. There is no excuse for failure to provide information to the tribunal or hinder its work and I call on all those asked to co-operate and assist to do so in a full and truthful manner. The Government welcomes the interim report of the tribunal and the clear message it sends to all who engage in corrupt practices that wrongdoing will be exposed. The legislation proposed, enacted and enforced by this Government will ensure we have anti-corruption provisions appropriate to a modern democracy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon" hpid="Mr. Bannon Mr. Bannon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior to becoming a Member of the Oireachtas, I looked forward to the exciting responsibilities and challenges that would come with election, but since entering this House I have been saddened to note that the issue causing most concern to the public is the trustworthiness of the Government parties and their public representatives in the Oireachtas and on local authorities. I agree with the Minister that the vast majority of representatives are honest and decent people, but the wrong ones cast a shadow over us all. Again <Col N="794" />and again, the trustworthiness of certain politicians is questioned on doorsteps, at political meetings and clinics to the extent that it seriously impedes the functioning of the body politic. It is to be hoped that after Mr. Justice Flood has rattled the Celtic tiger's cage, we will have woken up to the damage corruption wreaks in any society and will do our utmost to stamp it out. Exchanges between cowboy builders and Ministers of brown envelopes full of cash make for good television and radio, but it is always the case with corruption that the public picks up the tab eventually. Corruption is the abuse of power and it is always those without it who suffer the consequences.</P>
      <P>Having read the conclusions on pages 138 to 140 of Mr. Justice Flood's comprehensive and excellent interim report, it is more than clear to me why there is such public concern. In those pages is outlined a damning series of conclusions in relation to the activities of Mr. Ray Burke, a man I have never met yet whose activities threatened to undermine my efforts on behalf of the people and the efforts of us all faithfully to carry out our work. It is the opinion of the tribunal that the transfer of Briargate to Mr. Burke amounted to a corrupt payment to him from Mr. Tom Brennan and his associates. Payments were made into offshore bank accounts controlled by Mr. Burke which were funded jointly by Mr. Tom Brennan and Mr. Joseph McGowan and the tribunal is satisfied that on the balance of probabilities these payments were made in the interest of these men in relation to the performance of Mr. Burke's public duties. The tribunal also reports that a payment of £35,000 was made to Mr. Burke by Mr. Barry and Members and the public will be aware of what happened to RTE after that. Mr. Justice Flood further reports that what amounted to a corrupt payment was made at Briargate to Mr. Burke in June 1989. All of this leads me to request the Taoiseach and the Minister to investigate the key decisions made by the then Minster for Communications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a thread underlining all democracy that people must trust politicians but there has clearly been a grave breach of that trust and people are rightly concerned that the cause of their misgivings may extend beyond what has already been found. Therefore, it is right that those in power and in positions of public trust should properly answer the questions of representatives when they are put. It is alarming to note a reluctance from those in the highest office to answer the questions the Opposition wishes to put on behalf of the people. The Taoiseach has informed the Dáil that he has no questions to answer on this matter, even though many of his multi-million pound tax evading party hacks were slammed by the interim report of the Flood tribunal which found that they had obstructed and hindered its work by giving false statements. His answer is simply not good enough given that his position must be beyond reproach. To block serious and constructive questioning is very alarming and it <Col N="795" />will not do any longer for Fianna Fáil Ministers when challenged to continue with the often reeled out attacks on one or two past miscreants from the Fine Gael Party. Fianna Fáil is the party about which very serious questions in regard to propriety and proven impropriety have arisen and the repeated proclamations of willingness to answer questions while ducking them at every step must end.</P>
    <P>The actions of some Fianna Fáil parliamentarians and Ministers have led to Ireland being seen as one of the more corrupt countries of Europe and the fall out from the Flood tribunal still continues. Traditional notions of integrity, honesty and decency in public life have been hit badly by a succession of such tribunals which have cost millions of euro. Young and old from all walks of life are fed up that no penalties have been imposed to date, no measures have been taken to prevent corruption and no real reforms of the system have been put in place. The public is rightly cynical about what is going on, but unless proper accountability and answers come from those in high office this dangerous public antipathy towards the body politic will only fester and grow. These issues travel like an infection through that body and the view obtains that if you know the right people you can get a job done in relation to, for example, the planning process. These questions will creep through the body politic until there is complete transparency. Therefore, let us hear the answers from the Government.</P>
    <P>What would our former leaders who fought for this island and gave us our independence say if they were around today? I heard as I travelled here that the first Taoiseach went to America to promote Ireland and was proud to describe it as a nation of integrity and decency with a Government possessing the same qualities. What has happened is shameful and I hope we will begin today to clean up our system and look to the future with confidence. The carry on of some of our Ministers is having an effect on investment and I expect to hear what the Minister intends to do. It is to be wished that the blight the Government has cast on our nation does not continue.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. I should mention that the Flood tribunal has been in communication with me regarding one of the 184 matters referred to in chapter 19 of its interim report. I would have no difficulty in saying what the matter concerned is, but believe the tribunal &ndash; I have no doubt the same applies to its other correspondents &ndash; wishes me not to do so. What I have to say during this debate will not be informed one way or the other by the fact that the tribunal has been in communication with me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The interim report of the Flood tribunal is a major work of investigation. The results have been put before the public and the judgments are dramatic and of considerable importance. One of <Col N="796" />the salutary lessons of the interim report, which will apply to other tribunals and also the future work of the Flood tribunal, is that it gives a clear answer to those who might be tempted to give tribunals the run-around, concoct fantastic or preposterous stories to explain inconsistencies or, in general, show contempt, through the tribunals, to the Oireachtas and the people.</P>
    <P>The Minister has outlined the many measures taken in recent years to tighten up regulation in the area of public ethics and, in particular, referred to the establishment of the corruption assets bureau, which I welcome. The Legislature now has a strong armoury which will ensure it can uncover anything else that needs to be uncovered, but, equally and perhaps more importantly, which will allow us to deter anything in the nature of corruption in the future.</P>
    <P>A prominent member of the British Government, though he would not be well known here, made the point a few weeks ago to the Leader and me that tribunals were doing Ireland's reputation a great deal of damage. That may or may not be so, but I do not look at it in that way. We are demonstrating, in practically a better way than any other country, that we are not afraid to investigate any form of corruption, wrongdoing or maladministration by whomsoever it was committed.</P>
    <P>No one is above or beyond the law. That was intended to be the original ethos of the State and all parties therein. If there were particular non-political spheres to which perhaps that might once have applied, it is certain that there are no untouchables now. I refer to a period when the separation of church and State was observed in a manner that would not commend itself to modern liberals.</P>
    <P>In many other member states of the European Union doors are closed on investigations either because of the eminence of the person or body involved or because of the existence of public immunity certificates, D notices, etc. I note &ndash; this matter was raised on the Order of Business &ndash; that, notwithstanding complaints about the libel laws, Ireland is now ranked in third position as regards freedom of the press. That is as it ought to be.</P>
    <P>There was a more authoritarian ethos in the past, as, for example, when I joined the public service 25 years ago. However, it has now largely disappeared. Perhaps that ethos at times discouraged questioning and discussion and, on occasion, created scope for untoward activities on the part of a small minority. I still occasionally see signs of it being an unhealthy attitude in some public bodies in terms of their reaction to genuinely motivated whistle-blowing. It is not limited to these bodies, but extends to commercial bodies also. I refer to the evidence uncovered by the DIRT inquiry.</P>
    <P>The lesson which must be learned from the various tribunals and inquiries is that we should not repress awkward queries because they will come back to bite us much harder at a later date. We <Col N="797" />have come considerably closer &ndash; we are by no means perfect in this regard &ndash; to the ideals of openness, transparency and accountability in government. However, there is at times an instinct to transfer responsibility to independent bodies which may or may not practice those virtues as well as the political system.</P>
    <P>Many complaints have been made about the cost of tribunals. Even though it has been pointed out that such costs have been more than covered by items such as tax bills arising from evidence uncovered by the tribunals, there is no doubt that lawyers' fees are extremely high. This essentially raises broader issues, which I do not propose to debate today, about the high cost of justice which would deter most from going to court if it can be avoided. Eight years ago, when reports appeared in tabloid newspapers north of the Border alleging that I had engaged in meetings with certain paramilitaries, I approached the then Attorney General and quoted to him my father's advice that if one could avoid it, never go to law. He informed me that my father was a wise man.</P>
    <P>There are lawyers and former judges who disapprove of tribunals because they are less rigorous in terms of the proof sought, a matter on which I have mixed views, partly based on history, and about what can, in effect, be political trials. On the other hand, in the absence of virtual proof or overwhelming <i>prima facie </i>cases, how does one get to the bottom of matters arousing great public concern in a democracy? These matters do not always relate to politicians. I refer to current or recent tribunals relating to the conduct of the Garda, the Blood Transfusion Service Board, etc.</P>
    <P>Tribunals are fact finding inquiries which try to arrive at considered judgments on the basis of the evidence. They have value. However, great care and responsibility must be exercised because great power is placed in the hands of tribunal judges and lawyers. As a result of the eagerness of the media for sensational findings, a person's reputation can be irretrievably destroyed in an instant. I have never liked it when what is called a &ldquo;feeding frenzy&rdquo; is directed against an individual. Those of us in public life, whether in elected or unelected positions, know that sometimes it is a case of there but for the grace of God go I.</P>
    <P>The bank accounts of my friend and colleague P. J. Mara &ndash; even if details of one, as he claimed, had been omitted by oversight &ndash; showed no irregular payments of any kind and he was hard done by. I recall an interim statement from a senior person in opposition a few years ago to the effect that &ldquo;Heads in baskets, that is what politics are all about&rdquo;. I fundamentally disagree with that assertion, but I remember, approximately 15 years ago, giving my children a boardgame called &ldquo;Scandal&rdquo;. The principal characters one played were Ronald Reagan, the Pope, Mikhail Gorbachev, Margaret Thatcher, etc., and the object was to uncover a scandal that would knock out one's opponent. One cannot entirely overlook the fact that one of the motives, perhaps, in establishing <Col N="798" />tribunals has been the hope of achieving that type of knock out. Indeed, one can argue that the beef tribunal did, in one case directly and in another case indirectly contribute to the fall of Governments. However, it is a pity to see any party investing its hopes in that type of <i>deus ex machina</i> rather than in its own political platform and programme.</P>
    <P>Since 1982, most of the alternatives to the principal party in Government being Fianna Fáil have come in periods of what one might call temporary disqualification of Fianna Fáil. I would like to see parties come into Government through their own positive merits. In the system that existed there was no regulation and everybody made up their own rules. Short of blatant bribery, anything went. That was not satisfactory. I welcome the reforms that have taken place. They put people in less awkward situations where they are not under any obligation, real or perceived. The late Kevin Boland said in the 1960s, when observing some of the new methods of fund raising, that a large number of small contributions is better than a small number of large contributions.</P>
    <P>As an elected Member of Fianna Fáil, I am sorry our party should have a role of any kind in wrongdoing or corruption, particularly as it relates to a former prominent member of the party. However, I do not believe it or any other instances that can be cited were a reflection on the character of Fianna Fáil any more than other fund raising of a dubious kind reflects on the nature of other political parties.</P>
    <P>The often asked question is why Ray Burke was appointed. The answer is simple. He was capable and had much experience in different Ministries. Indeed, as a young diplomat, I first remember meeting him when he was a junior Minister to the then Minister, former Deputy Des O'Malley, coming back from a trade mission abroad. He was an exceptionally forceful person. He made a great contribution to the establishment of local radio, which has been of lasting benefit. When Brian Lenihan was ill during the Anglo-Irish conference, I remember Tom King breathed a sigh of relief when those bruisers, the former Deputies Collins and Burke, had to make way for him when he had recovered. It is interesting to recall that at the time of the beef tribunal Ray Burke was painted as being on the side of the angels in relation to export credit relief. My experience of him in the Department of Justice is that he was cautious.</P>
    <P>When he was appointed in 1997 there were newspaper reports and doubts expressed about the past. He had been a good spokesman on Northern Ireland and Foreign Affairs in Opposition, guiding a new leader who had not had many dealings in those areas. He was generally sound and, as the Taoiseach pointed out in the Dáil, his appointment was welcomed on the Opposition benches, notwithstanding the rumours. I was in Stormont and the multi-party talks had just been established when he resigned. His resignation was regretted. At the time I won<Col N="799" />dered whether he should have resigned, thereby creating difficulties for the party in a minority Government and causing a by-election. With the benefit of hindsight, however, one can see why he took that decision. It is clear that he misled the Dáil and that he held bank accounts abroad in breach of foreign exchange regulations.</P>
    <P>Ray Burke did not have an extravagant lifestyle, even though he received large sums of money. Somebody put it to me that he was in the habit of squirrelling things aways. Squirrels do go up trees in north Dublin but the nuts tend to be hidden in the ground. The details do not present an edifying picture. However, businessmen can be extremely naive when it comes to politics. Of course, as is clear from famous cases in the past &ndash; and I am thinking of the French playwright Beaumarchais &ndash; if a payment is corrupt, not only the person receiving it is corrupt but also the people giving the payment, even including people who may be tribunal heroes.</P>
    <P>There is a yawning gap in the trubunal report. A great deal of research and effective investigation took place into the payments side of the issue. However, as the summary states: &ldquo;The Tribunal has been unable to discover what specific action Mr. Burke took to advance the interests of those who had paid him those monies&nbsp;. but is satisfied on the balance of probabilities, that he acted in their interests in the performance of his public duties&rdquo;. In a sense, the tribunal drew a blank on what was done for the payments and that must raise large questions, particularly in relation to any legal proceedings. However, Mr. Burke is well able to look after himself in that regard.</P>
    <P>The chapter on broadcasting and Century Radio is entirely divorced of its political context. Political context is not something of which I would be particularly proud but it is relevant to the decisions. RTÉ was blamed by Fianna Fáil for causing the unsatisfactory 1989 general election result, particularly the constant hammering about the crisis in the health services. There was quite a vindictive mood afterwards. There is no reference of any kind to that in the tribunal report. I do not believe the actions that were taken can be entirely attributed to financial contributions.</P>
    <P>I welcome the report. It has had a healthy and salutary effect. I am glad the Government of the last five years has had no allegations of the type dealt with in the report made against it. That is a great tribute to the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste.</P>

      <P>As always, Senator Mansergh's defence of Fianna Fáil is the party's most sophisticated and impressive. He comes from similar roots to myself, perhaps, in terms of his background and therefore understands Fianna Fáil as well as I do. I take no pleasure in what I must say now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I learned my socialism, my republicanism and my commitment to the Irish language through Fianna Fáil. Those three values are based on the <Col N="800" />idea that politics is about making things better for everybody in society. My father served briefly as a member of a local council in the 1940s. His view would have been that it was an honour to serve. My father's greatest boast about Fianna Fáil was to point out in my home town of Athy, County Kildare, the houses that had been built which transformed the lives of people who, effectively, had lived in the late 1920s and early 1930s in mud huts. For the first time such people were living in decent housing and within a generation their lives were transformed. That is the sort of Fianna Fáil that I was brought up with.</P>
    <P>My father died 25 years ago and for the first time since he passed away I am almost glad that he is not around. That is because I would have hated my father to read the report of the McCracken tribunal and the interim report of the Flood tribunal. I know there are many good people in Fianna Fáil, and Senator Mansergh is a good example of that sort of person. It is time, however, that Fianna Fáil members looked at where they are because one cannot simply consider this as some spectacular exception. I am not saying that everybody in Fianna Fáil has the ethical standards of Mr. Burke, but that party seems to be unable to separate its interests from the basic idea of right and wrong.</P>
    <P>During my period in the House, Seán Doherty was elected Cathaoirleach by the votes of Fianna Fáil Members, although the alternative was that good and decent man, Des Hanafin. Mr. Doherty became Cathaoirleach in the face of appallingly bad behaviour and the abuse of his position while Minister for Justice, yet his position was defended by Fianna Fáil Members of the House.</P>

      <P>One cannot pretend that each of these cases was an exception. This was not some marginal figure; it was a figure central to Fianna Fáil whom Mr. Justice Flood found to have taken corrupt payments and bribes. Those findings should produce outrage rather than the sort of innocuous speech the Minister of State delivered here. They have produced outrage among the public but, understandably, the public has a short memory. We must judge what was in those reports as well as what led up to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe it was an accident that the request for additional members for the Flood tribunal was delayed for six months; it was a deliberate tactic to slow down the tribunal's work so that such findings would not emerge until after the general election. Of that there can be no doubt, so let us not play act. Fianna Fáil knew what was coming and the shock, horror duly <Col N="801" />arrived. From the moment Ray Burke was reappointed to the Government in 1997, Fianna Fáil had every reason to be wary that this might come about because there was ample evidence.</P>
    <P>I was a Member of the House during the 1980s when everybody outside Fianna Fáil could pick up vibes that were not conducive to a sense of open democracy. Everybody could see it and it was inevitable that more than a few people in that party were corrupt. From 1977 to 1997, members of my party served in Government for longer than Fianna Fáil; they did many things with which I disagreed and they made many mistakes. It is a fact, however, that none of them has been accused of any of these sorts of offences. Members of the Progressive Democrats, who will have served close to ten years in office if the present Government sees through its current term and does not fall apart, will not be accused of similar things either. Fine Gael has one problem in its ranks which will have to be dealt with, but outside that there will be none.</P>
    <P>In 1997, at the same time that Mr. Burke was appointed a member of the Government, the Taoiseach appointed Liam Lawlor as a member of a Dáil committee on ethics. Members of Fianna Fáil will say, &ldquo;But we didn't know anything about Liam Lawlor. We didn't know anything about Deputy Ellis's peculiar business arrangements, and we didn't know anything about Deputy Foley's peculiar banking arrangements. We didn't know anything about Frank Dunlop's activities in Dublin County Council, either.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Many of us did know, however. When my party colleague, Deputy Burton, suggested that people were receiving money in return for the way they voted on planning decisions, she was inundated with writs by people who said that such an accusation was without foundation. That is the context in which all this needs to be judged. I invite Fianna Fáil &ndash; particularly its Ministers and spokespersons &ndash; to do a bit more than simply tell us what they are going to do in the future. Ultimately, public feeling about this will penetrate the consciousness of Fianna Fáil, that most defensive of organisations. I am sick of the fact that because Fianna Fáil nurtured corruption in its core <i>via</i> people like Ray Burke, the rest of us are smeared with that man's values and the values of those who surrounded him, such as people who, for unfathomable reasons, went to jail to protect bank accounts. That sort of culture besmirches the rest of us.</P>
    <P>There are indications of the sort of approach Fianna Fáil would wish to take, and they are not very nice. The former Supreme Court Judge, Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty, wrote an article for <i>The Dubliner</i> magazine, which was quoted in <i>The Irish Times </i>on 4 November. In the article, he chose to cast aspersions on tribunals, commenting:</P>
    <P>The fact that there are very serious findings made against individuals is of great consequence to them and to their families. That's <Col N="802" />why findings of guilt on serious criminal charges can only be made at trials with judge and jury &ndash; not tribunals.</P>
    <P>Do members of Fianna Fáil agree with Hugh O'Flaherty that nothing has been demonstrated on the part of Ray Burke to have been wrong? Do they agree with a man whom they wished to make Chief Justice, yet who said:</P>
    <P>It needs at least three people to consider evidence. I don't believe a judge can decide by the demeanour of a witness whether he is telling the truth or not.</P>
    <P>That statement is erroneous because in every District Court in the land, and often in the High Court, a judge does decide from the demeanour of a witness whether he is telling the truth. Apart from that, however, do Fianna Fáil members agree with their protégé &ndash; who they were going to appoint as Chief Justice and later tried to appoint to an enormously well paid job in Europe, until public outrage descended on their heads &ndash; that it was wrong to allow one judge to make those findings of fact about Ray Burke? Is Hugh O'Flaherty representative of the thinking in Fianna Fáil? Or is it the usual thing, that if they do not like the message they shoot the messenger via sophisticated legal reflection by somebody who turns out to represent the intellectual wing of Fianna Fáil? What he said &ndash; I say it only because he volunteered it; it would not be right otherwise &ndash; was profoundly wrong and was obviously something that was thought out and was intended to undermine the public confidence in tribunals. Tribunals are not perfect.</P>

      <P>Senator Ryan, I would like to remind you that Mr. O'Flaherty is not a Member of the House and therefore cannot defend himself here. Mr. Justice Flood is in the same predicament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will say no more than what I have said, in deference to your views, a Leas-Chathaoirligh.</P>
      <P>On the same topic, I want to suggest to the members of Fianna Fáil that there is much they can do if they want to reassure us. I have the distinction, if that is what it is, of having been expelled from this House because of things I said about Mr. Burke. I said he was a disgrace as a Minister. I was inclined not to withdraw the remarks so I ended up being expelled from the House at the proposal of the then Cathaoirleach. I believe Mr. Burke was a disgrace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be very simple to relieve much of the concern. There is a Freedom of Information Act, which came into force some time in 1998. It would require nothing more than a ministerial order to allow it to apply retrospectively to all matters in which Mr. Burke had influence. That would be in the area of communications and in the area of the distribution and sale of passports and things like that. It would let the public see that nothing else that was done was wrong or <Col N="803" />influenced by anything untoward. It would be simple to do and would not take major legislation. If we want to do more than respond to existing public concern and if we are really concerned to cut this particular offensive canker out of the political system, I would invite Fianna Fáil to commit themselves to that because it is not just about one person. Let us see what is in the file on passports. Let us see the records, not of the slightly diluted interpretations of the Minister but of the area of developing communications even before the tribunal investigated them. I suggest this because one of the aspects which has intrigued people is the way Mr. Burke carried the portfolio of communications with him wherever he went. That portfolio was enormously influential and full of possibilities for the future.</P>
    <P>Then I would invite my friends in Fianna Fáil to do something else, to explain to me how come, as was obvious to us all and as was concluded by Mr. Justice Flood, some of Mr. Burke's associates were still honoured guests in the Fianna Fáil hospitality tent at Galway races. They were honoured guests making apparently substantial donations to Fianna Fáil long after it was obvious to the rest of us that something very dodgy was going on. We cannot have this, where things happen and they are condemned and then we are invited to ignore them.</P>
    <P>While Fianna Fáil has undoubtedly survived electorally the scandals that have so horrified us all, the price that has been paid in terms of public trust in politics and in the capacity of politics to deal with difficult issues has been profoundly undermined. It would be naive of me to say that only Fianna Fáil can remedy it. My own view is that the best way we could remedy the smell of corruption in which Fianna Fáil has enveloped us all would be for Fianna Fáil to spend about ten years in Opposition. If they did so, they would discover how few friends they had when they had no power.</P>
    <P>In the meantime we can only repeat that what Mr. Justice Flood found was not an isolated individual behaving badly but a particular ugly example of a culture which has taken over a once great movement. It is a culture of mé-féin-ism which seems to motivate more of that party than one would like to think and which believes that the interests of Fianna Fáil lie ahead of all standards by which the rest of us would believe ordinary people would wish to be judged.</P>

    <P>I came to local politics in 1991 having been involved in community residents' associations activity in Dublin for the previous ten years. Having served on the old Dublin County Council and the recently formed Fingal County Council, from my own personal experience at a micro level I did not see any great conspiracy by councillors as is alleged by Mr. Frank Dunlop. I am not here to defend Mr. Frank Dunlop or other councillors, <Col N="804" />but I will give examples to this House of some of my experiences of the context, as Senator Ryan mentioned earlier, of the time in which we were dealing.</P>
    <P>Some of these issues relating to the Blanchardstown area may come before the Flood tribunal. I am not aware that they are there yet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with it in the context of how Dublin County Council ran its affairs and was taking advice from its officials &ndash; the same officials who would have served the council prior to my time &ndash; on matters which are ongoing in the Flood tribunal. At the time there was a culture of council officials saying that certain lands were not to be zoned. Some councillors took that view because it was coming from officialdom. Other councillors took a different view and at times it became a war of attrition in the council chamber. As a result, some developers decided they had to go about getting their motions up for discussion and trying to influence people.</P>
      <P>For example, the site of the proposed North-West Business Park in Blanchardstown was unserviced lands and the council decided there was no need for additional land zoned for industry in the Blanchardstown area. Ten years later that land is occupied by many businesses. I have been told only this afternoon by Fingal County Council that the rates base from that area in 1994 was &euro;0.54 million and today it is &euro;4.7 million. While the council officials would not have had us rezone those lands, the industries and the jobs in that area are making a contribution, both in tax to this economy and in rates to the county council. If councillors like me and others had not zoned those lands for industrial development, we would not have that rates base or that employment in Blanchardstown and it would not be the vibrant place it is today. No doubt that example can be found in other areas of Dublin, from Carrickmines as far as Balbriggan, but I would not be as knowledgeable about other local electoral areas as I would about my own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know the housing crisis has developed because of a lack of supply. This has been the conclusion of the three Bacon reports. Had we followed the advice of council officials at the time, land which is currently being developed would not have been rezoned for development. At that time council officials said the Ongar lands in Blanchardstown should not be developed for housing because a substantial land bank was available for that purpose. Those lands have since been developed. Council management said in <Col N="805" />1993 that a substantial land bank was available and there was no need for further land to be rezoned, yet in the recent development plan management granted permission for the development of 2,200 houses in Tyrrelstown, 100 acres for housing on the former Phoenix Park racecourse and 100 acres on the site of the James Connolly Hospital. Less than ten years ago we were told by council management that there was no need for further residential land in Blanchardstown.</P>
    <P>Dublin west is an area of major house building. If lands had not been rezoned by councillors against the advice of officials, the people who are now living in west Dublin would probably be living in counties Meath or Kildare, commuting to Dublin city and causing further problems.</P>
    <P>I was delighted to hear the Minister, Deputy Cullen, say no one person can ensure the outcome of a proposal to zone land and that he would stick to the present situation. I would have said that was the situation in the old Dublin County Council when I served there, although there was one attempted exception. Prior to the discussion on the Swords development plan in 1993 a meeting was held at Mr. John Bruton's request in an upper room of Conway's public house, which I and other Fine Gael councillors attended. We were told &ndash; not requested &ndash; to vote as a bloc in the council. We were told that there was no place in the party for those of us who could not agree with the majority decision. The following morning, when many of us had decided to vote as a bloc, Councillor Cathal Boland resigned the Fine Gael Whip because the agreement of the night before had been broken by a subsequent meeting. I wonder why the resignation of a senior party member has never been discussed. I hope this matter will be investigated.</P>

      <P>Large portions of the Flood tribunal interim report are given over to the question of co-operation with the tribunal. In 1995, before any tribunal was established, I made the then Taoiseach aware of a highly inappropriate approach made to me. Since then I have not been asked to make a statement on that matter and I am not aware of other council members being asked to do so. I hope this matter will be also be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the report. I am delighted with some of its findings. It has demonstrated the fact that no one is above the law. I hope the proposed corrupt assets bureau will find a home for some of the money which was ill-gotten. I am delighted to hear the Minister for the Environment and Local Government say he would stick to the current proposal in relation to the zoning of land and that he sees zoning as a function of local councillors. This contrasts with a previous Minister for the Environment who took a populist approach and <Col N="806" />said zoning was a debased currency. It was certainly not debased by the majority of councillors.</P>
    <P>The question of influence being brought to bear on councillors must be addressed. The Flood tribunal is attempting to address the question of why some councillors were influenced while others were not and what inappropriate approaches were made. I have never received a political donation from Mr. Frank Dunlop. However, I would be horrified if Mr. Dunlop said those who did receive such donations did so for corrupt motives. If my colleagues on the council received political donations at the time of elections I do not believe they did so on a corrupt basis. I am not here to defend their actions. They will have an opportunity to do so if they appear before the Flood tribunal. If that is the angle taken by a person who is now before the tribunal it questions the activities of many local councillors who acted in the best interest of their communities and of Dublin. If lands had not been zoned at that time for housing and industry against the advice of council management we would not have the large tracts of industrial and housing development across County Dublin and particularly in Dublin west.</P>
    <P>The interim report has given us a good road map. I hope those who are asked to attend the tribunal will co-operate fully with it and will not hinder the work of the tribunal which was established by the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, to the House. I compliment the Minister for the Environment and Local Government on his speech. We can all subscribe to his comments when he describes the report as a highly significant contribution to Irish public and political life.</P>
      <P>In the preface to the interim report Mr. Justice Flood refers to the Brennan and McGowan module, the Century Radio module and the Gogarty module. The Minister pointed out that Mr. Justice Flood has given a clear message to anyone who has had corrupt dealings. He made it clear that he supports that message, as I am sure this House does. He pointed out that the act of hindering or obstructing a tribunal is a criminal offence and remarked that the findings of the Flood tribunal are a blow to the political system. He went on to say it is unacceptable for anyone who holds high office and enjoys the trust of the Government and the public to accept corrupt payments in return for political favours.</P>
      <P>In our political lives we have all had to be wary and conscious of the fact that there is hardly ever such a thing as a free lunch. I agree with some of what Senator Mansergh has said. Corruption is not confined to politicians. Officials have been involved as well as those business people and developers who made corrupt payments. Unfortunately, some in the political arena operated in the manner of <i>qui tacit consentit </i>or he who keeps silence consents. We must be on our guard constantly.  </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="807" />I welcome much what the Minister said about the Garda Commissioner, the Criminal Assets Bureau, the Revenue Commissioners and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement. They are examining this interim report and he pointed out that the judge has already sent the report to the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
    <P>As has been stressed several times, this is an interim report. Hence, it might not have been appropriate and might have been wrong that such a report would contain recommendations. The Minister dealt with this to some extent in his speech. If something must happen, it is a matter for Government. It must be a political judgment at that stage.</P>
    <P>I generally agree with Senator Morrissey and I listened with great care and interest to his speech, particularly what he had to say about the culture and climate of the old Dublin County Council at the time in question. I agree that it should be a matter for elected local people in whatever authority to which they are attached, whatever part of the country that may be. Politicians must always be wary of what is developer led. The politicians must decide and should be free to do so in consultation with their officials. I hope the officials would be above reproach but, as we sadly know, maybe there were not in all cases.</P>
    <P>The Minister rightly referred to the weapons the State has at its disposal in respect of laws to deal with corruption and wrongdoing. The Prevention of Corruption Act, the Standards in Public Office Act, 2001, and the Oireachtas (Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices) (Amendment) Act, 2001, are tools at the disposal of the State, and properly so.</P>
    <P>I asked the Leader of the House on the Order of Business today about the Corruption Assets Bureau, with which the Minister dealt in his speech. That is going ahead and is very much to be welcomed. He pointed out that proposed new legislation will empower the High Court to appoint inspectors to the affairs of any individual or company where necessary and appropriate.</P>
    <P>I welcome the ministerial order made on 24 October, in which the Minister appointed Justices Alan Mahon, Mary Faherty and Gerald Keys as members and reserve member, respectively, of the tribunal. Again, I echo and endorse the Minister's<b></b>closing remarks in wishing the enlarged tribunal well in its future work. The Minister spoke of the Government very much welcoming this interim report, as I am sure we all do.</P>
    <P>I am thankful the report spared us a recall of all the evidence, but we understand from the preface that the record of the testimony extended to over 35,000 pages. It is also true to say that they sat in public on a record number of sitting days. Matters have been reported on comprehensively. The conclusions, as the judge has said, are borne out by the evidence. He has expressed great regret about the level of non-co-operation and that people having been duly sworn did not tell the truth. He makes the point that the report <Col N="808" />has gone to the Director of the Public Prosecutions and he must decide, at his discretion, what appropriate action to take.</P>
    <P>The judge points out that his duty was to report back to the Oireachtas. That was his obligation and he has done so. Senator Mansergh referred to the cost, about which we are all concerned, and that if there were a more efficient way for the State to do its business through Oireachtas inquiries, we would prefer that. However, it is consoling to note that to which Senator Mansergh drew our attention and what the judge refers to in the preface &ndash; in excess of &euro;34.5 million has accrued to the Revenue Commissioners arising directly or indirectly from the work of the tribunal.</P>
    <P>My friend Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty referred to this matter in an article recently, a press cutting of which I have in front of me. I disagree with him because he says the purpose of the tribunal was to conduct an investigation and to inform Members of these Houses of the state of affairs. As has been pointed out by Senator Ryan, judges in Irish courts make decisions on and evaluate the credibility of witnesses every day of the week on the basis of evidence offered. They have to make that call and they do and we have not heard there was anything wrong with any of those decisions over the years. In any event, they would be open to challenge and to appeal.</P>
    <P>Great credit is due to the tribunal. It had to start from scratch without a book of evidence. The DIRT inquiry had the great advantage of having the Comptroller and Auditor General's report. As we know, all previous Garda investigations failed &ndash; so much for climbing up trees in north County Dublin. Senator Mansergh also quoted points that interested me as well.</P>
    <P>On page 138 the report says it was unable to discover what actions were performed for Mr. Tom Brennan or his associates. It goes on to say that &ldquo;the benefit which was conferred on Mr. Burke was conferred in circumstances which gave rise to a reasonable inference that the motives for making and receiving this benefit were connected with the public office held by Mr. Burke&rdquo;. </P>
    <P>I would like to develop the theme that nobody is above the law, but we all accept it and I will postpone my further remarks for another day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, to the House and I thank the Minister, Deputy Cullen, for the contribution he made at the start of this debate. We certainly owe a profound debt of gratitude to Mr. Justice Flood on the interim report he has produced. He has established very clearly in that report the facts regarding happened in respect of certain planning matters and payments.</P>
      <P>Politics are about public service first and foremost and not about personal profit. They are not about power for the sake of power but about people doing business honestly and respecting the trust of the communities who have elected members to a particular forum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="809" />One of the great benefits of the interim report is that Mr. Justice Flood has been able to discover documents. We have seen witnesses come in to be cross-examined. Even the banks have been required to deliver up private accounts. There are now clear and conclusive findings of corruption. It is evidence of the State's determination to root out and expose corruption and shows that nobody is above or beyond the law.</P>
    <P>The most important issue to arise from the report is the appropriate action to be taken by the Government in response. The Taoiseach has outlined the number of tribunals established by the previous Government with the co-operation of the Oireachtas. It is also worth noting the legislation introduced on foot of reports made by the various tribunals.</P>
    <P>In various media programmes dealing with the tribunals it has been pointed out that baseless allegations can be made which are founded on nothing more than rumours. The Taoiseach has been the victim of many of them, for example, he was unfairly attacked for a contribution he is supposed to have received from a Mr. O'Brien. It is similar to an American politician who, when challenged by a friend, confirmed he did not believe his allegations, but wanted to hear the accused deny them. By contrast, the Flood tribunal has examined a serious issue and we owe it our thanks and gratitude for what it has done so far.</P>
    <P>Tribunals are costly, but have recovered a lot of money in the form of lost revenues. Examples include the DIRT inquiry and the Flood tribunal. It has often been suggested that the Seanad would provide a suitable forum for conducting such inquiries because, unlike Deputies, Senators are not directly reliant on the electorate for their position. Be that as it may, tribunals provide good formats to inquire into issues of controversy.</P>
    <P>Tribunals can also have other good consequences. For example, the standards in public office legislation would not have been introduced without them. The last general election represented the first occasion on which the people voted with a comprehensive range of legislation enacted to address issues raised in the various tribunals, including requirements on disclosure and accountability in politics.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that responsibility for land rezoning could be removed from local authorities. The Minister is of the view that it is inappropriate for them to be involved. I have been a member of Galway County Council for over 17 years during which many conflicts over planning arose. It is still a big issue in the county, especially in west Galway. Many years ago the production team for the television programme &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; researched a programme on what was then known as section 4 motions under the planning Acts, but found no evidence of abuse or corruption. Section 4 motions are no longer used, in County Galway or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>County councillors, however, must continue to play a major role in land rezoning, especially <Col N="810" />when circumstances are continually changing. Many young people and returned emigrants are seeking planning permission to build houses. There is a need to find an answer to the serious housing shortages. It has been reported that some local authorities will only process applications made by natives of their own county, which is a serious development.</P>
    <P>There is a need to hold a full debate on planning. Some Senators have pointed out that the failure to secure planning permission in local towns means people have to seek to build houses further away from their place of work. This is especially relevant in the greater Dublin area where many are frustrated at having to travel long distances to and from work. This gives rise to many social problems.</P>
    <P>It is not only politicians who have been involved in corruption. Officials have played a role, as have business people, who have been prepared to provide money in return for favours. There is a need to address this.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach was criticised for appointing Mr. Ray Burke to the Cabinet in 1997. He asked the necessary questions and described Mr. Burke as an honourable man, having believed the assurances he was given. He also said he felt a sense of betrayal at Mr. Burke's actions.</P>
    <P>I welcome this interim report. Our thanks are due to Mr. Justice Flood for the work he has done. The tribunal must now deal with other issues. I look forward to seeing us deal with the consequences of this and other reports from the tribunal. The process in which Mr. Justice Flood is involved will help restore the trust and respect of the people in the conduct of public life.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry" hpid="Ms Terry Ms Terry">
      <NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. Justice Flood must be commended for his excellent work in producing his important interim report. It is an act of public service to the State. Many of those who read the report are justifiably outraged at its content. It is a source of hurt to me that I am a member of a profession in which there is so much corruption. Having said that, there are very few corrupt politicians, but this is a damning report on Mr. Burke, a former member of our profession. I have been an elected representative since 1991 and perhaps if I had known then what I know now, I might have chosen another profession or at least decided not to become a politician.</P>
      <P>I believe the vast majority of politicians enter public life to deliver what is best for their communities. Unfortunately, the wrongs committed by one individual have tarnished everybody. We are all tainted. It is up to each one of us to prove we are not corrupt. That is an indication of how low we have sunk in the public's estimation. This report is the first step in cleaning up our act. It gives us hope things will get better and that there will not be a continuation of the shady deals that were sometimes done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a certain culture that was accepted by some as the way to do business. It is clear from the report that that is how Mr. Burke operated. <Col N="811" />He subverted people who were trying to carry out their lawful business by demanding payments from them. I voted for many rezonings as a member of Dublin County Council and, subsequently, Fingal County Council. The decisions I made were based on what I saw as the merits of each case. I shudder to think that there were people present who were steering rezonings through for their own ends and that I may inadvertently have been a party to their designs. I have no doubt that this happened on occasion.</P>
    <P>I support the call by the Fine Gael Party, which was also made previously, regarding the establishment of a land use commission in order that all future rezonings will be certified. This would allow us to be sure that there was no shady dealing involved. As a county councillor, I would welcome such a development and not see it as undermining my work but rather guaranteeing that everybody involved in the process did an honest job and that rezoning decisions were taken for all the right reasons. It will be too late if, in ten or 20 years time, we are to discover that there were shady deals behind some current rezoning decisions.</P>
    <P>We also need to establish an anti-corruption office which would investigate all allegations against public officials and elected representatives. This would provide a sense of security that honesty and fair play were at the basis of all decisions taken on behalf of the people. It would also ensure any wrongdoing could be weeded out at an early stage, rather than waiting for many years for it to emerge.</P>
    <P>This a very damning report and we can all hang our heads in shame at what went on. The investigation will get at the truth and help restore ethics in politics as well as public confidence. This is the beginning of a process that will clean up politics at all levels.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I live in and represent Lucan and Quarryvale, areas currently the focus of investigation by the Flood tribunal in regard to political decisions made in respect to land rezoning. This area has a huge population and the decisions had a major effect on people's lives, sometimes for the worst. There have been implications for the availability of housing, house prices, facilities or lack of, and planning for communities. It is important for the communities concerned and the future of politics that the tribunal gets to the bottom of the reasons decisions were taken, if they were taken for the right reasons or if there were other agendas at stake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that reforms are implemented on foot of the Flood tribunal report. Fianna Fáil has a particular responsibility in addressing the issues arising from the tribunals. While it is not the only party whose members are being taken to task by the tribunals, it is the main one. It has to be upfront about its responsibility for a culture that is conducive to corruption. Other parties have a responsibility in this regard also. This is <Col N="812" />important for the sake of politics, but also for the lives of those affected by the decisions made on their behalf.</P>
    <P>I agree with the point made by earlier speakers that most politicians act for the best of reasons, but the fact remains that some politicians were free to be corrupt and others were caught up in the grey area. The Flood tribunal will eventually make recommendations, but there are many reforms that can be made in the meantime. The process has already begun and the Labour Party has taken the lead in terms of the openness and accountability of politics in regard to election expenditure and so on. I condemn any attempts to increase election expenditure limits from their current levels. Something must be done about the loopholes that allow parties to spend whatever amounts they like before an election is called. The link between business and politics has also to be addressed. I support the Labour Party's proposal to ban corporate donations and limit personal donations. Public funding is the preferred option. While work has begun in that regard, much remains to be done.</P>
    <P>The other issue that needs to be addressed is that of planning and housing. I agree with the point made by the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Noel Ahern, that we should not take away the power to rezone land from local councillors. It is one of the few powers that they have and it is important for local democracy that councillors retain this power. The main problem with rezoning decisions is the huge profits that can be made by landowners, the knock-on effect of which has been to drive house prices out of control. Among other measures, we must do something about windfall taxes, the State acquisition of land for the provision of housing and ensure small builders are brought in for the provision of housing. Housing is a right and decisions concerning it should not be about profit, but about the need of people to have a proper community.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State mentioned significant changes to planning legislation in the Planning and Development Act, 2000. He said more opportunities for public consultation have been introduced, but they have also been taken away. One now has to pay for a submission on a planning application. This is a move away from making public consultation more open and transparent.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has also said it is better to leave responsibility for rezoning in the hands of councillors. I agree and believe it is very important for representative democracy. I disagree with the move by the Minister for Transport to introduce quangos to take planning decisions. We already have this in the shape of the DTO and the NRA and it is not good for representative democracy. I suggest the money from corruption proceeds be put into the communities affected by corruption where it should be used to provide facilities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this report &ndash; it is high time that we did so. I pay tribute to the work of Mr. Justice Feargus Flood and his team and wish the judges recently appointed to the tribunal well.</P>
      <P>The interim report sets out, in graphic detail, one of the most shameful episodes in Irish political life. It is an episode which one would like to say is over, but it is not given the reporting and investigation of corruption in planning in Dublin County Council and the decisions made by Mr. Ray Burke during his tenure as a public representative. We can only comment on what has been investigated so far. This episode has had an undermining effect on Irish politics and our role as public representatives &ndash; there is no point in pretending otherwise. Unless we accept that this is the case we will not move on or be able to repair the damage done to the perception of public representatives &ndash; councillors, Members of the Oireachtas and Ministers &ndash; with power to make decisions and, as we know, misuse that power.</P>
      <P>We must examine this matter very carefully. I have noticed that some members of Fianna Fáil have an ability to distance themselves from the events of the Ray Burke era. The culture in which he thrived was the culture of the party. The dogs in the street openly discussed his decisions and activities and what was happening within Dublin County Council. It went on openly, but it appears nobody believed it until Mr. Justice Flood put it in writing. Mr. Burke was appointed Minister eight times by successive leaders of Fianna Fáil. He was most recently appointed by the Taoiseach at a time when the noise from the public and the reports in the media had reached such a crescendo that even he could not ignore it. The manner in which Mr. Burke was appointed Minister does not represent the high point of the Taoiseach's career.</P>
      <P>Trust in politics, particularly in local representatives, has gone. Trust in local representatives to make decisions regarding planning has certainly gone. Rezoning is a debased currency. While we might like to hope this might change, there is no sign of it doing so. There is a perception that rezoning decisions made openly and democratically were made against a background of favours. I have noticed this in my area. There is absolutely no evidence to support this, but it is the legacy we now face. How it is addressed is a very difficult question. As a public representative, I would like to think we can be trusted to make decisions. We are elected by the people and, when we make decisions, attempt, as far as possible, to look at the benefits that will result. The public does not have the same attitude to it. We will have to work very hard to change this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While we allow political donations to be made to parties or individuals, we cannot expect this perception to change. We must move to introduce a ban on political donations. It was very disappointing to see the second largest political party in the State changes its policy on the matter. The introduction of a ban on political donations must <Col N="814" />be accompanied by the proper funding of political parties and political activity. We should not run away from this. To create total transparency in the system we must remove any question arising from political donations. We are fooling ourselves if we think political donations do not have price tags attached to them. Who will believe this having heard everything revealed in the tribunals? It will not wash any more. This would be a useful starting point if we are serious about restoring trust and transparency to Irish political life. If we want the people to believe political parties are in the business of public services, that is essential.</P>
    <P>The programme of reform that arises from reports such as this will be a measure of how seriously we take the findings and how serious we are about restoring trust to Irish political life. Our democracy has been undermined by the breaking of the trust between public representatives and the public. Until that programme of reform is rolled out the public cannot be expected to believe the political system is willing or capable of reforming itself.</P>
    <P>The actions of Mr. Ray Burke extend beyond planning decisions made by Dublin County Council during his time of influence. They extend to his tenure as Minister for Communications and his decisions regarding Century Radio. I worked in RTÉ in 1990 around the time Mr. Burke was Minister. I remember the atmosphere in the station, the sense of utter shock at the decisions being made and the horrendous undermining of the public service broadcaster which took place. The findings of Mr. Justice Flood and the ongoing investigation bear out the suspicion very strongly held at the time that Mr. Burke was abusing his power as Minister, that he used his position to support his friends and, in so doing, undermined the public service broadcaster. We must carefully examine how a public service broadcaster, operating for the people, was undermined so badly through the extraordinary abuse of power by one individual. This marks a shameful episode in domestic political life, the effect of which must be examined.</P>
    <P>As my colleague, Senator Tuffy, pointed out, the programme of reform that results from the ongoing tribunal will be the mark of how we intend to move forward, whether we take these findings and the need to restore strengthened democracy in Ireland seriously and whether we can learn the lessons that Mr. Justice Flood has set out clearly for us.</P>

      <P>Mr. Justice Flood and his tribunal have done a great service to the State. The thoroughness of the investigation conducted by him and his staff and the clarity of his report were appreciated. He ensured the people could have access to the report by making it available at a cost of &euro;1. We can all recall the queues outside the Government Publications Office on the day it was published as people ensured they could read all the detail of his findings. The entire nation was waiting for the findings of the tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="815" />I am glad the Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs is present. Five years ago he stated in the Lower House that he was confident the Flood tribunal would vindicate Ray Burke. He must wonder how wrong he could have been given that words have a habit of coming back to haunt us. Hindsight is beneficial and we all make judgments in politics. However, the Taoiseach's decision to appoint Ray Burke was misguided. In appointing an individual to the third most senior political position in the State, one must wonder how much research is undertaken to ensure the credentials of the individual are above board. The Taoiseach received several warnings in this case, including from his predecessor, Albert Reynolds, and the Minister for Defence. Another person revealed recently in the media how he had warned the Taoiseach regarding the appointment of Ray Burke and many people still ask why he appointed him.</P>
    <P>The Flood tribunal has been running for a long time but many of those who were called before it wanted to thwart its investigations and to terminate it as quickly as possible because they were afraid of the revelations that might emerge. It took more than six months for the Government to appoint the extra judges requested by Mr. Justice Flood. Was it not convenient and timely that this was so? The Fianna Fáil-PD Administration must have breathed a sigh of relief when the findings were published in June and not prior to the general election. What would the public have thought if they had been published in April or May?</P>
    <P>Most people were amazed by the findings in the report and the simplicity and directness of Mr. Justice Flood's contribution to the report was appreciated. This was in sharp contrast to the voluminous tome that was published following the beef tribunal. The report cost £20, probably to ensure fewer people purchased it. However, the report did not pinpoint anything and the only people targeted in it resided in my constituency and worked for the Goodman company. They took most of the rap following the lengthy investigations of the tribunal.</P>
    <P>The public appreciate Mr. Justice Flood's report. Following its publication, the mantra repeatedly uttered by the Government Chief Whip, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and others was that the Taoiseach was to be congratulated on setting up the tribunal. The Dáil set up the tribunal, not the Taoiseach, and there was a great deal of debate in the House before it was established. The Taoiseach was forced to include the activities of Ray Burke in the terms of reference of the tribunal following pressure exerted by the Opposition in the Dáil and the publication of an article in <i>Magill</i>. Let us be honest about what happened.</P>
    <P>Mr. Burke was criticised in Mr. Justice Flood's report, particularly in regard to planning decisions. Many people feel the entire planning <Col N="816" />process stinks but it does not. Most local authority members do the best they can. They are dealing with small communities and when it comes to drafting development plans the rezoning aspect is not of great importance. Politicians are consulted and amendments are drafted to such plans. However, development plans and the planning process belong to the public, not to officials or politicians.</P>
    <P>For example, as Senator Brennan alluded to earlier, a debate is raging in Adare about whether the village can cope with the dramatic expansion in housing and so on envisaged under the new draft development plan. There is still a great deal of congestion in the village because the Adare bypass has not yet been built. Draft development plans are published every six years and I wonder whether it would be better to build bypasses first so that their impact on the community could be assessed and zoning decisions would be better informed. Further discussions will take place in Adare regarding the development plan and they should be monitored closely.</P>
    <P>As Fine Gael spokesperson on the Marine and Natural Resources in the last Dáil, I took a great interest in oil and gas exploration activity. While the Century Radio licence and planning decisions feature prominently in Ray Burke's activities, significant policy changes were made to the requirements for oil and gas exploration licences, which were beneficial to those involved. It was proposed that if taxes were not placed on the profits of oil and gas exploration companies, many of them would take up licences. This did not happen. The companies took out licences but 15 years later they still have them and we are still waiting for results. However, people involved in these oil and gas companies have been good to Fianna Fáil and I wonder whether this issue should have been covered by the Flood tribunal. If there was interference in the awarding of the licence to Century Radio, who is to say similar interference did not occur in the awarding of oil and gas exploration licences?</P>
    <P>I am sure everyone is delighted the first phase of the tribunal's work is complete, although further phases must follow. We do not know the ramifications yet. Some people regard the expenditure of &euro;24 million as excessive. However, it has not been excessive because it has been a cleansing mechanism for the public. I wish Mr. Justice Flood and his officials well in their further pursuit of the truth. I compliment him on the clear language he used in the report and the thoroughness of the investigation to date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for giving me the opportunity to contribute to this important debate. I was taken aback by the statement made by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government that the &ldquo;findings of the Flood tribunal are a blow to the political system&rdquo;. However, but for the Flood tribunal and its interim findings, the political system would be under suspicion. It is important that the people <Col N="817" />responsible for wrongdoing have been identified. I am not sure what the Minister meant when he said the &ldquo;findings of the Flood tribunal are a blow to the political system&rdquo;. The political system needed to be dealt a blow. Unfortunately, that blow affected everyone until those responsible were identified. I have confidence that the Flood tribunal will root out those who have not yet been identified.</P>
      <P>It is important for the Minister to make a clear statement that the Flood tribunal will investigate wrongdoing in any part of the country, not only in Dublin. Some people maintain that planning irregularities occurred in the past in other parts of the country. If that is true and if they can be identified, it is important for the Flood tribunal to investigate them. We must face the difficulties and clean up the political system, otherwise people will continue to be suspicious and certain sections of the media will continue to make innuendoes about the activities of councillors.</P>
      <P>I was a new Member of the other House when Ray Burke addressed it. I clearly remember him giving an emotional address about himself, his activities and the contribution he had made to public life. I felt sorry for him because he was near to tears and he seemed to be dragged into a position where he did not belong. Statements and innuendoes were made about his integrity and he referred to that in his speech. I did not know then that he was involved in corruption. I did not believe that a tribunal, regardless of its powers, would be able to extract the detailed evidence which the Flood tribunal extracted. We must thank Mr. Justice Flood and his team for the work they did and the way in which they did it.</P>
      <P>It is beyond belief that in the past week another former judge, Mr. O'Flaherty, castigated Mr. Justice Flood and queried his capacity to make a judgment. I wonder if Mr. O'Flaherty is suffering from &mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear from the report, which is 30,000 pages long, that people were only required to tell the truth and to do so as quickly as possible. The machiavellian actions of those who tried to disrupt the work of the Flood tribunal have annoyed <Col N="818" />many people and caused an outcry at its cost. People forget that more than &euro;34 million has been recovered as a result of the activities of the Flood tribunal in highlighting corruption during the years under investigation. If the Flood tribunal continues for five more years and unearths more corruption, it will be doing a wonderful job, not necessarily for politics but for the country. It is important that everyone in the House and in public life states clearly and unequivocally that the work of the Flood tribunal is important and necessary to eliminate corruption in politics which has been prevalent for the past 35 years.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the Government has done everything possible to facilitate the work of the Flood tribunal. It is a pity the Taoiseach has not been upfront and answered a straight question. The Minister engaged in double speak today, as the Taoiseach has done on a number of occasions. At the time, it was imperative the Taoiseach send out the message loud and clear that Mr. Burke would be forced out of the Cabinet if the rumours were substantiated. Instead, he covered for Mr. Burke stating that a good man was being hounded. Even at this late stage, the Taoiseach should come forward and declare what he knows.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief to avoid going over the ground covered by earlier statements. I am disappointed it took so long to have a debate on the interim report of the Flood tribunal which has been in the public domain for about a month and a half. It is inappropriate that the House is only discussing the report now given that the tribunal was established by both Houses of the Oireachtas. It should have been discussed at an earlier opportunity. I congratulate my colleague, Senator Coghlan, who has pushed to have a debate on the report since this Seanad's first meeting.</P>
      <P>I join previous speakers in complimenting Mr. Justice Flood on his interim report which has done the country a great service. I also compliment Mr. Gogarty, the star witness at the tribunal, for doing the country a great service. He is an elderly man who came forward, alone, and called a spade a spade in the face of very strong opponents.</P>
      <P>Many speakers argued that nobody could reasonably have foreseen the outcome of the Flood report when Mr. Burke was appointed to Cabinet. The fact is, however, that the reports and rumours surrounding Mr. Burke were in the public domain in the early 1970s, with newspaper reports expressing concerns about rezoning in Dublin as far back as 1972.</P>
      <P>Members of the Government have been engaged in much mutual back slapping, almost to the extent of suggesting that the establishment of the Flood tribunal was a Government initiative. The Government was pushed into taking action. It is important to remember that Mr. Burke left office voluntarily, not at the request of the Taoiseach or anybody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="819" />In hindsight, the appointment of Mr. Burke to the Cabinet in 1997, when he was surrounded by rumours, beggars belief. In addition, the former Taoiseach, Mr. Reynolds, recently stated on the public airwaves that he brought his suspicions to the Taoiseach at the time of the appointment. Why did the Taoiseach not act when one of his predecessors raised these matters with him? </P>
    <P>I did a little research into the Official Report in respect of the debate in the Dáil on the interim report of the Flood tribunal. During the debate a speaker cited the Taoiseach in the House on 8 October 1997, the day of Mr. Burke's resignation, when he stated: &ldquo;History will judge him for his achievements, not the unsubstantiated innuendo that may fall away now that its purpose has been achieved&rdquo;. This statement is most interesting in light of what we now know. I am glad we now have the interim report from Mr. Justice Flood because it shows that the allegations made against Mr. Burke were not unsubstantiated innuendo but fact. I wish Mr. Justice Flood well in carrying out the rest of his task and I hope he takes as long as he needs to complete it.</P>
    <P>I am a 24 year old politician who is proud to be a member of Kilkenny County Council. The rumours which surrounded Mr. Burke and other members of Dublin County Council regarding rezonings reflect on all members of local authorities. The only way to eradicate corruption from public office is for younger people to get involved in politics, whether through a political party or outside the party system. This will only happen if they have confidence in the political system. I congratulate Mr. Justice Flood on bringing these matters into the public domain. Through his work he may encourage young people to enter political life and eradicate all forms of corruption in our political system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>While I concur with previous speakers in commending Mr. Justice Flood for a very wide ranging and forensic analysis of the behaviour of a number of people who, unfortunately, could describe themselves in their <i>curricula vitae</i> as public representatives. When one refines the role of the public representative, one discovers the majority of them are councillors. The figure central to the interim Flood report was also at the heart of suspicions that, at minimum, a large number of votes on rezoning in Dublin County Council were questionable.</P>
      <P>The report raises very serious issues. On some occasions the gallery was packed with lobbyists and people employed by another august organisation. The votes on land rezoning were taken contrary to all good planning regulations and against the advice of the officials and management of the council. It then fell on the Houses of the Oireachtas to establish the Flood tribunal. Nobody should believe that the tribunal was set up by the Government or the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern. It was established by the Houses.</P>
      <P>Last year, some 12 months before the general election, Mr. Justice Flood requested extra personnel to assist him and his team. Conveniently, because the personnel in question were not allocated, we first had the benefit of the report in September this year, several months after the election. There is more than a hint of coincidence in the timing of the report's publication and the denial of additional legal expertise to assist the most significant figure unearthing planning scandals in expediting the workings of his tribunal.</P>
      <P>When we saw the report, none of us was surprised. It was a damning indictment of Ray Burke, the Government in which he served and the man who had brought him back from political obscurity to appoint him Minister for Foreign Affairs, one of the most significant portfolios in Cabinet. Despite the fact that major questions had not been answered regarding Mr. Burke's activities as a member of a Dublin local authority, the Taoiseach pressed ahead with his appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following on from that appointment and in connection with the excellent work of Mr. Justice Flood, there have been a number of very strange comments from our great Taoiseach. On 28 May, during a Dáil debate, he said on the day he appointed the then Deputy Burke as Minister he was working on the understanding that no money had been given to him. On the same day he stated Ray Burke had told him the story before he came into the House of how he had received a contribution of £30,000. However, on the day Mr. Burke resigned his ministry and membership of the Dáil the Taoiseach referred to &ldquo;the persistent hounding of an honourable man to resign his <Col N="821" />position on the basis of innuendo and unfounded allegations&rdquo;. What a turnaround that is in the fortunes of the wisdom of none other than the Taoiseach. Are we not lucky? He has the benefit of hindsight, even though he was being told the indicators did not point in the direction he was pontificating.</P>
    <P>What the tribunal has unearthed is absolutely scandalous and disgraceful no matter what side of the House one is on, or what political party one belongs to. Its report is a damning indictment of the behaviour of people who choose to abuse their positions in local government. At a time when local authority members are trying to forge ahead with reform of local government, the report makes it quite difficult to make the case that councillors need more power given the way in which some used their offices to line their pockets. That is just one minor implication of the report and the activities of the Ray Burkes of this world.</P>
    <P>The report is substantive and requires full and proper consideration, but it was evident even before Mr. Justice Flood had compiled it that people who were absolutely disgusting in their actions were going to be rooted out. Such people took it upon themselves to enter council chambers to vote contrary to the advice of planners, management and officials who were suitably qualified. They benefited no end as Mr. Justice Flood has proved that they accepted corrupt payments. That is the crux of the issue. His report states the case quite clearly and therein lies the appalling vista of the behaviour of some on the county council in question.</P>
    <P>It gives me no great pleasure to attack anyone and my speech is political, not personal. However, I must not pull punches. It does not give anyone great joy to speak passionately about an issue which concerns individuals, but the actions of those in question have led debate in both Houses to take this direction. Political office is an honour bestowed on us by the men, women and young adults across the 26 counties who place their faith and courage in us and elect us. With the trust they place in us comes a mandated sense of honour, but if someone proves he or she cannot be honourable and betrays the trust of those who put him or her in office, he or she does not belong in political institutions, or elected political groupings.</P>
    <P>Given that Ray Burke was plucked from political obscurity and returned to high office, one has to ask what he and the Taoiseach knew the day he was appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs. The previous Taoiseach, Mr. Albert Reynolds, in his wisdom chose not to include Mr. Burke in his Cabinet, a decision taken on foot of advice from a number of people, not least a potential running mate of Mr. Burke in north County Dublin.</P>
    <P>In the days, weeks and months ahead, if Mr. Justice Flood requires extra resources, be it expertise or more judges, to assist him in expediting the excellent work of his tribunal, I will implore the Government to accede to his <Col N="822" />requests. The report we are discussing is an interim one and one can reasonably assume that &ldquo;we ain't seen nothing yet&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins" hpid="Mr. Cummins Mr. Cummins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief as most of what I wish to say has been covered by the last two speakers in particular. The antics of Ray Burke in receiving corrupt payments for planning and the licence for Century Radio have destroyed trust between politicians and the electorate. When I hear people on doorsteps say we are all the same, it sickens me because we are not. I am not a corrupt politician, I have never taken a bribe, which is the case for the vast majority of my colleagues the length and breath of the country. That has to be said over and over again because of how we are perceived due to the likes of Mr. Burke. We are certainly not the same and do not want to be. The disservice to democracy and the body politic resulting from Mr. Burke's actions will never be forgotten and will go down as a disgraceful period in our history. Other speakers asked the reason Mr. Burke was appointed and the Taoiseach's words describing how we were hounding an honest man out of office will ring in the ears of many for years to come.</P>
      <P>As has been stated, this is an interim report which means that many questions have yet to be asked and many answers have still to be given. Corrupt politicians, no matter from where they come, should be rooted out. I hope Mr. Justice Flood will flush out any others who were involved in similar activities to those of Mr. Burke. That is his job which he has handled excellently to date. One could use the slogan Fianna Fáil used in the recent general election campaign in relation to the tribunal's work and state there is a lot done and a lot more to do. That is certainly the case where Mr. Justice Flood is concerned. I wish him well in the rest of his endeavours to flush out the truth which is absolutely necessary in this democracy of ours.</P>

      <P>I am pleased the Minister of State is taking this matter because he is familiar with St. Ita's Hospital, Newcastle West, which he visited on the return journey from his recent trip to Killarney. I am sure he saw the facilities there. During the past four years the hospital has also been visited by the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, and the Taoiseach. The Minister of State's party is familiar with the <Col N="823" />requirements of the Alzheimer's unit at Newcastle West.</P>
      <P>St. Ita's Hospital was constructed in 1840 and was renovated in 1975. Many parts of the hospital require constant refurbishment. There is a great deal of pressure on St. Ita's in terms of coping with the elderly population in west Limerick which, potentially, could be over 7,500. Public representatives from the area are frequently contacted by people whose relatives have the advanced form of Alzheimer's disease.</P>
      <P>The necessity for an Alzheimer's unit has been well proven and well documented by the Mid-Western Health Board over the past five years. A number of hiccups occurred in respect of the design of the new unit and money allocated by the Government was spent on refurbishment. What St. Ita's needs is a dedicated unit because, at present, doors have to be locked in certain parts of the hospital, which is unfair to people who do not have Alzheimer's and those visiting them. There is an urgent need to put the unit in place.</P>
      <P>That staff at St. Ita's are very dedicated and they and members of the wider community are disappointed that a specialised unit has not yet been put in place. In many instances, private nursing homes can provide facilities to cater for Alzheimer's patients but the premier hospital dealing with the elderly in the mid-west region cannot do so.</P>
      <P>I raised this matter in the Lower House on 12 December 2001 with the then Minister of State, Tom Moffatt. I had believed that progress would have been made on this issue prior to the election. I understand that a planning notice was posted recently and perhaps this is an indication of forward movement. I hope the Minister of State is in a position to provide a positive response.</P>

      <P>The provision of health services in County Limerick is a matter for the Mid-Western Health Board. It is a matter for the board to decide its priorities within the national development plan allocation it received. The Mid-Western Health Board has been notified of indicative funding of &euro;20 million under the NDP for services for older people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Additional funding for the development of services for older people has increased significantly since 1997 to £57 million, &euro;72.9 million, in 2001. Additional funding of £69 million, &euro;87 million, has been made available in 2002 for services for <Col N="824" />older people. Of this, over &euro;7 million has been allocated to the Mid-Western Health Board.</P>
    <P>In 2000, as part of the national development plan, it was agreed that a project team be established for the development of a ten bed elderly mentally infirm unit at St. Ita's. It has been agreed that this development should be increased to a 12 bed unit. In January 2000, a capital grant of over &euro;500,000 was provided for the unit. A number of design issues were raised during 2000 which required careful consideration. It was agreed that the design brief would require redrafting.</P>
    <P>The amended draft brief submitted to the Department by the board in early 2001 was approved and a suitable site identified on the grounds of St. Ita's Hospital. In 2001, a project team was established and this was followed by the appointment of a design team. In September 2002, approval was given by my Department to proceed to stage 4 &ndash; the detailed design stage, drawing up of plans, etc. &ndash; and stage 5 &ndash; preparation of bills of quantities &ndash; of the project. In addition, the board has been given approval to apply for full planning permission. As the Senator indicated, that process has already begun.</P>

      <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise this important issue, the interruption in the breast service at Nenagh General Hospital. I will outline the background to this issue to the Minister of State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="825" />About 12 years ago a number of formidable ladies in an ICA guild &ndash; the Leader of the House will know the type of person I mean &ndash; formed a group to fund raise for the establishment of a mammography service in Nenagh General Hospital. One of the group's members had developed breast cancer and, arising from their concern about this issue, the group started its fund raising campaign. As a result of the successful campaign a group called the Friends of Nenagh Hospital was established. This group is still in existence. It is a powerful lobby group on behalf of the hospital and has worked extremely hard to ensure that equipment is kept updated and that the staff and infrastructure of the hospital are supported. The group has been most successful in this.</P>
    <P>It was a matter of grave concern and huge disappointment to learn about eight weeks ago that the mammograph machine had come to the end of its natural life but that the Mid-Western Health Board had no intention of replacing it. Eighteen months ago the same series of events occurred in Ennis General Hospital. The mammograph machine there had come to the end of its life but the health board took the view that it should be replaced. The decision regarding Nenagh General Hospital, however, was negative. No consultation took place with the local community or the Friends of Nenagh Hospital. The news was released via the local media. This happened at about the beginning of October.</P>
    <P>Being a public representative and a woman, I received a huge number of calls, letters and personal representations about it. As a result I organised a public meeting which was held about four weeks ago. There was a huge attendance, about 98% of whom were women. That reflects the major concern in the community about not only the loss of the service but also the fact that there is no interim service to replace it.</P>
    <P>Until about a year ago Nenagh General Hospital provided a fine breast and smear clinic. It was run within the hospital and was available to anybody who sought it. The mammograph machine was an important element of the service. The smear clinic was replaced by the national screening programme. It is a good programme although I do not approve of some elements of it. The screening programme has been implemented nationwide and is being provided through general practitioners. Hopefully, it will be an effective service.</P>
    <P>The BreastCheck programme is not available in the Mid-Western Health Board area. I have been in contact with the BreastCheck service and have been told that from the date the service receives funding, it will take a further two years for the roll out of the service to reach north Tipperary. There is a minimum wait, therefore, of two years for a breast screening service.</P>
    <P>North Tipperary has no breast screening service at present. This is an issue of great concern to many women. Yesterday a petition was launched to seek a restoration of the breast <Col N="826" />screening service in Nenagh hospital. It is extremely important that there be an interim arrangement based in Nenagh until the national programme is implemented.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State will probably refer to the centre of excellence based in Limerick Regional Hospital. We welcome that development but it is not yet a centre of excellence and it will not be until it is given full funding. There are concerns about the availability of funding, particularly in the coming year or so. We do not, therefore, have a centre of excellence and there is no screening service. It should not be too much to ask that an interim arrangement be established in Nenagh General Hospital to provide a service to women in the north Tipperary area.</P>
    <P>I have seen a number of letters on this matter which were brought to me by women in the area. One woman showed me a letter in which her GP had asked, on her behalf, for a mammograph in Limerick. The reply said she was not to get a mammograph because she did not display any signs or symptoms. She is hugely upset by the letter, as any woman would be. It is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>The experts tell us that requests for mammographs in Limerick are being screened, in other words, the letters being sent to Limerick are being sifted and decisions are made on them. That is unacceptable. This is happening against a background of high public awareness about breast cancer, as there should be, and a high level of public attention to the issue. There is also a high level of public concern and disquiet, particularly in north Tipperary, that the health needs of women are not being met by the service.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to ensure that some type of interim arrangement is put in place. I will be part of a delegation which will go to the December meeting of the Mid-Western Health Board. This is the argument we will make. We will also put forward more points which I do not have the time to put forward now. We will not stand idly by and allow this situation to continue. It is not acceptable. Women's health is in danger and there is much public disquiet about it. I ask for a positive response.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter on the Adjournment and for giving me this opportunity to set out the current position in relation to the development of breast cancer services generally and in the Mid-Western Health Board in particular. I also thank the Senator for outlining the background to this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national breast screening programme was established only as late as 1998, under the last Fianna Fáil led Administration, with the aim of reducing mortality from breast cancer by 20%, by screening women in the age group of 50 to 64 years of age. BreastCheck commenced screening in March 2000 with phase one of the programme covering the Eastern Regional Health Authority, the Midland Health Board and the North-Eastern Health Board areas. The decision to proceed on a phased basis is a reflection of the complexities <Col N="827" />involved in the screening process. It is essential that the programme be driven by international quality assurance criteria and best practice.</P>
    <P>Successive Governments had the opportunity to put in place some type of breast screening programme but failed to do so. It only commenced, therefore, in March 2000 on a phased basis. The experience gained in phase one will facilitate the process of planning and organising the roll out of the programme nationwide. We have to start somewhere and we have to accept that there must be a phase one. From that phase we will gain the experience that is required to roll out a national programme. To the end of August this year, almost 92,000 women had been called for screening and over 68,000 women had been screened, representing an uptake of 74%. That will assist in ensuring the active rolling out of the nationwide programme.</P>
    <P>My commitment and that of the Department of Health and Children to BreastCheck is evident from the significant funding which has been provided for the programme. This year, additional funding of &euro;1.5 million was provided to BreastCheck for the continued development of the programme, bringing the total allocation to &euro;8.7 million. I am fully committed to the development of quality services to achieve best health outcomes. In relation to the development of cancer services generally, this commitment can be seen in the level of funding provided. Since 1997, over &euro;103 million has been invested in the development of services, well in excess of the £25 million initially envisaged in the national cancer strategy. This investment has enabled the funding of 76 additional consultant posts in key areas such as medical oncology, radiology, palliative care, histopathology and haematology. This includes approval which has been given for nine new consultant posts with a special interest in breast disease.</P>
    <P>The investment is a major element of the implementation of the recommendations of the report of the sub-group on the development of services for symptomatic breast disease. Professor Niall O'Higgins was the principal architect of this report and is also a member of the board of BreastCheck. My Department has invested considerably in this programme for the provision of services for symptomatic breast disease in recent years and it is acknowledged that further investment is required. I realise that while much has been achieved in recent years in relation to the development of the health services, there is much still to be done. In recognition of the need to further develop cancer services, the national health strategy has identified the need for the preparation by the end of 2002 of a revised implementation plan for the national cancer strategy.</P>
    <P>The national cancer strategy, 2003-10, is being prepared by the national cancer forum under the chairmanship of Professor Paul Redmond of Cork University Hospital in conjunction with my Department. The new strategy will set out the key areas to be targeted for the development of cancer services over the next seven years. This will have regard to existing policies in the areas <Col N="828" />of symptomatic breast disease and palliative care and the forthcoming recommendations of the expert group on radiotherapy services.</P>
    <P>The board of BreastCheck has submitted a business plan for the national expansion of BreastCheck to the remaining counties, including the mid-west region. The total cost of the extension as calculated by BreastCheck is approximately &euro;27 million, including capital costs of &euro;13 million. The annual cost of the current programme is &euro;8.7 million. The Department of Health and Children is in discussions with the executive of BreastCheck in relation to the expansion of the programme and especially the linkages with the existing symptomatic services. The Minister is committed to the national expansion of BreastCheck at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>As regards breast cancer services generally, the Mid-Western Health Board formally adopted a report on the development of symptomatic breast disease services for the region on 8 December 2000. The board has agreed to develop its symptomatic services at Limerick Regional Hospital. Referral to the breast clinic at the hospital allows rapid access to a consultant surgeon, mammography and rapid processing of results. I see that the Senator is nodding, in disagreement with me.</P>

      <P>I note the Senator's concern that there will be a minimum wait in excess of two years. If that is so, she should please let me know because that is not my understanding. The service provider in the area is the Mid-Western Health Board which has provided us with this information. I have been advised that there is rapid access to a consultant surgeon. If that is not the position, the Senator should write a note to me and I will be happy to revert to her positively about it. The delay should not be two years. I will not preside over such a delay.</P>

      <P>I will not preside over unacceptable delays. A weekly multidisciplinary meeting commenced in June 2001 and is attended by all relevant members of the team. Financial approval has recently issued to the Mid-Western Health Board for the appointment of a general surgeon with a special interest in breast surgery. In addition, two breast-care nurses have been appointed to Limerick Regional hospital.</P>
      <P>In relation to mammography services available to women in North Tipperary, the Mid-Western Health Board has informed me that patients are now being referred to the centre of excellence at Limerick Regional Hospital. Any woman, irrespective of her age or residence, who has immediate concerns or symptoms, should contact her general practitioner who, where appropriate, will refer her to the symptomatic service in her area for immediate attention.</P>

      <P>This is a serious issue, not just for the 12 postgraduates involved, but also for the country at large, given the serious shortage of clinical psychologists. The Northern Area Health Board of the Eastern Regional Health Authority established a doctoral programme in clinical psychology in Trinity College. The organisation came into play in January when various graduates were interviewed and selected. On 1 July they were informed they had places. Many of them gave up jobs to take up these college places, and the staff were put in place. One person was recruited from Queens University, Belfast, to come to Trinity College by which the staff were employed. In mid-September, with the course due to commence at the beginning of October, Trinity College was informed by the Northern Area Health Board that it had no funds to meet the salaries and fees of the new intake of students on the course. Over two months ago the board was seeking a meeting with the Department of Health and Children to try to secure the necessary funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Trinity College has the staff in place to offer the course, but students can only be enrolled if they are contracted employees of the Northern <Col N="830" />Area Health Board. Thus, in the light of the financial delays notified by the board, unfortunately, the course did not begin in October. Professor Robertson told the students that as soon as he had further information from the board, he would write to let them know when the course would start. I have been writing to the health authority and the relevant health board to find out when it will start.</P>
    <P>This is a serious issue for the 12 students involved, but it is also a very serious one for all of us. This is because the number of clinical psychologists employed by health boards to deal with the most serious problems is down 50%. It is not as if psychologists were add-on extras &ndash; they are badly needed. Efforts are being made to recruit clinical psychologists abroad, but even with this intake we will not have a sufficient supply until 2005.</P>
    <P>It is not just a problem for the health boards because the courts are in serious difficulty without them also. In fact, there are no clinical psychologists to assist children, which is putting family courts at a serious disadvantage. There are no clinical psychologists for the prisons either. I was rather amused to read an excellent report by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in 1999, when it assessed the IQ of 10% of the prison population. The report found that 28% of prisoners had an IQ below 70, which is quite astonishing and totally out of line with the position in any other country in Europe. One wonders, therefore, what good prison terms are doing for prisoners.</P>
    <P>I was fascinated by one of the report's recommendations that all prisoners under 21 years should be assessed by a clinical psychologist. One Department, therefore, is recommending something that cannot possibly be done because another Department is removing money from the system.</P>
    <P>Another problem arises because in some psychiatric hospitals, unless one has a sufficient number of clinical psychologists, one cannot apply for accreditation for the training of young psychiatrists. Therefore, we could end up magnifying the problems we already have in recruiting junior staff for psychiatric institutions outside the major centres because we do not have psychologists for accreditation to take place.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State will be only too well aware that accreditation for training is one of the buzzwords with non-consultant hospital staff. It is a serious problem because the Royal College of Physicians, the Royal College of Surgeons, the Royal College of Anaesthetists and the Royal College of Psychiatrists are all advising people not to take posts that do not have accreditation. The Medical Council is also saying it will not subscribe to temporary registration of these posts if there is inadequate training. If there are no clinical psychologists there, it is described as inadequate training.</P>
    <P>I applaud the Northern Area Health Board for trying to get a grip on the problem by training some clinical psychologists. I do not know whether they got the approval of the Department of Health and Children to fund the training of <Col N="831" />these 12 people, but really this is a case of biting off our nose to spite our face. We need to get money rapidly so that perhaps the course might get going at Christmas because they will hardly get much done now. It is ridiculous to pay staff to run a course because we have to fulfil their contracts while we have no students on the course.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to outline the background to this issue of the funding of the postgraduate course in clinical psychology in Trinity College Dublin. In 1995, the Department of Health and Children agreed that there should be a review of psychological services in the health service. For a number of reasons it was not until the second half of 1999 that the group commenced detailed work on its agenda. Given the considerable length of time that had elapsed between agreement in principle to establish the joint review group and the actual commencement of its work, and the evidence of growing pressures on the provision of psychological services, the joint review group decided that actions urgently required to address specific issues falling within its remit should not be delayed by the need to complete all of the group's work and prepare a final report.</P>
      <P>As far as workforce planning was concerned, it was clear to the group that, on the supply side, the key factor was the inadequate number of postgraduate training places in clinical psychology. The joint review group therefore estimated, on a preliminary basis, that the health services would have a requirement for at least 50 new professionally qualified clinical psychologists per annum &ndash; about 30 training places over the level of provision at that time &ndash; in order to bring about an improved balance between the supply of and the demand for qualified staff.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health and Children responded swiftly to the requirement for the provision of extra training places. In September 2000, the Department invited bids from all health agencies, including voluntary bodies, to provide additional trainee clinical psychologist posts in association with any of the recognised postgraduate training providers. Since the other existing training providers were not in a position at that time to provide the places within the required timeframe and given the urgency of providing the additional training places, all the increased training places were allocated to the Psychological Society of Ireland's postgraduate diploma course for a period of three years, commencing in the autumn of 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Funding was allocated by the Department in November 2001 to the successful health agencies for the creation of 30 trainee clinical psychologist posts and also for the payment of course fees. The effect of this new funding has been to bring about a rapid increase in the numbers enrolled on the <Col N="832" />Psychology Society of Ireland's professional diploma in clinical psychology.</P>
    <P>The Department is, therefore, currently supporting the provision of 30 additional postgraduate training places in psychology at the annual cost in excess of &euro;1 million. There is no question of this funding, which is playing a key role in meeting the human resource needs of the psychology services, being withdrawn at this time.</P>
    <P>Although a large number of agencies applied to avail of the increased places in autumn 2001, expressions of interest were not received from the area health boards in the ERHA region. In August 2002, the Northern Area Health Board applied for additional funding to be made available to support the provision of six extra places on the TCD doctoral programme.</P>
    <P>The notes provided to me make reference to 2000 and then go on to state that in 2002 the Northern Area Health Board made provision for funding. The Senator may recall that prior to the creation of the ERHA, there was the Eastern Health Board which was abolished in 2000 and the Northern Area Health Board would not have been in a position to apply for funding at that time. It is something at which I must ask my Department officials to have a closer look. The management team and the officials of the Northern Area Health Board are doing a Trojan job in the infancy of their work in the creation of the new area health board, the NAHB.</P>
    <P>As the substantial funding allocated by my Department, currently supporting the extra thirty PSI training places, has been distributed to those agencies that participated in the bidding process two years ago in 2000, this request is currently being examined in the context of the 2003 funding position made by the NAHB.</P>
    <P>I understand that strenuous efforts are also being made to address the particular issues arising for the current TCD programme by the Northern Area Health Board and the other area boards, along with the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the other interested parties. It is hoped that these discussions will facilitate the commencement of the course at an early date. The Department remains committed to working on an ongoing basis with health agencies, educational providers and the education authorities to ensure adequate provision of training places, consistent with the human resource requirements of the health services.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for pointing out that the Northern Area Health Board would not have been in a position to apply for funds in 2000. I agree with him that they work very hard and are a very progressive board. I hope he will reach into his long pocket and get something to give them so that they can get this course under way.</P>
