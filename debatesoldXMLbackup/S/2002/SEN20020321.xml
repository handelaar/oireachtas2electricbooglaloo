      <P>I have received notice from Senator Connor that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to provide funding for stages one and two of the Castlereagh sewerage scheme.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Costello that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs to address the issue of social welfare entitlements for a former taxi driver, details supplied, now disabled, who is on hunger and thirst strike.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Henry that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development to promote all-island animal tracing schemes.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Taylor-Quinn that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development to address the delays that exist in his Department relating to payments to farmers, including headage, ten and 22-month premia, suckler cow and extensification grants, the reason for those delays and whether he is aware of the financial hardship experienced by farmers as a result of such delays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and I have selected Senators Connor's, Costello's and Henry's matters and they will be taken at the con<Col N="930" /> clusion of business. Senator Taylor-Quinn may give notice on another day of the matter which she wishes to raise.</P>

      <P>Yesterday, I asked the Leader if he would consider the concept of introducing the Convention on Human Rights into Irish law and he assured me that he would let me know this morning whether the Government intended to do so. The Leader will be aware that this Bill has been on Committee Stage since October 2000, by which time it was supposed to have been completed. The Leader has failed to respond to my question on this matter.</P>
      <P>Would the Leader consider holding a debate on the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 2002 on 26 March? There is a certain depth to this Bill and the concept of rushing it through at the last minute tomorrow is not the way to deal with business in this House. In the interest of dealing with this matter properly, the Leader should hold a debate on 26 March and we will facilitate this by sitting at 10.30 a.m. on that Tuesday morning.</P>
      <P>Following statements by the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy, there is a great deal of confusion among members of the public regarding what exactly constitutes a hands-free telephone. When the Minister stated that a hands-free phone was one which was attached to a car, did he mean that it is attached completely or can it be detached by the person who owns the phone? Does such a phone have an ear-piece and is a person likely to be charged for not having such an attachment while using their phone? The Minister's statements are so ambiguous as to be ridiculous. His statements look like they were just pulled off the shelf as an experimental measure prior to the general election. The Minister should come into this House, explain his proposals and listen to some practical advice on how his scheme could be implemented, because we all support the idea.</P>
      <P>Again, I call on the Leader to give me his assurance regarding a debate on the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 2002, tomorrow.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I share Senator Coogan's reservations on the wisdom of pushing through the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 2002, tomorrow. I recognise the urgency of the matter and do not <Col N="931" /> object to its being dealt with, but I do not think that there has been sufficient debate on it. People were not aware until quite recently that this Bill was to be dealt with this week.</P>
      <P>The debacle in Campus and Stadium Ireland has to be considered by this House. I ask the Leader to request the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation to come before the House. This issue has been dealt with by the Committee of Public Accounts, but that is a committee of another House. I am gravely concerned on a variety of levels. This House should have a discussion on the issue.</P>
      <P>A man whom I consider a diligent, efficient and loyal civil servant is being pilloried publicly, made a whipping boy and a sacrificial lamb. If wrong has been done it should be dealt with in an open and efficient way. This House deserves an explanation. Rather than speculation and people having to look for information, let us instead have openness. Let us ask the Minister to come before the House and outline what happened regarding Campus and Stadium Ireland, rather than having the entire media conducting a sort of kangaroo court, a public hanging of a man who is doing a job. If he has made mistakes let him pay the price; if he has not, we should know that. Either way it should be dealt with openly and publicly, with accountability and responsibility.</P>
      <P>I have raised many times the issue of waterways and the Shannon. There has been a huge development in that area, the establishment of Waterways Ireland. It has never really been fully discussed here, despite Senator Finneran and I having raised it time and again. It would be very helpful if the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands would come before the House and give a full report on the development of Waterways Ireland, north and south. It is the most effective North-South body I am aware of. It is working very efficiently and people living on the Border recognise the effects. We should celebrate that and discuss it in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Coogan in relation to the Convention on Human Rights. Having gone to the trouble of asking the people to decide on it by referendum, the least we should do 18 months later is ensure that legislation is put in place to make it operable. About 55 countries out of the required 60 have already signed it, and it is urgent that we get 60 signatures so that it becomes an international instrument. The Government should bring forward such a Bill before the dissolution of the Dáil.</P>
      <P>Regarding the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 2002, I agree with two other speakers that this should be left until next week. Currently we are to take all Stages, but even since then very important amendments have been introduced. The amendments seem more important than the Bill itself. We should have an opportunity to consider them without Committee and Report Stages being taken on the same day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="932" />I support Senators O'Toole and Coogan's comments regarding the national aquatic centre. It seems that one person is being hung out to dry on this issue, and we need a debate in the House. The Taoiseach's Department was responsible for the issue when the initial decision was made. The Taoiseach then passed the buck to the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, and he in turn has passed it to a civil servant. It seems this civil servant is being left to carry the can, which is not good enough. The matter needs to be teased out fully. It is not satisfactory that it simply go before the Committee of Public Accounts because the Seanad has no input into that. This House has a role to play, and I would ask not only that the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation come before this House but that the Taoiseach likewise so that he could explain what happened when the issue was under his watch. That was when the decision was made.</P>

      <P>The Select Committee on Foreign Affairs yesterday discussed the budget of the Department of Foreign Affairs, a process in which Senators have no input. I am a member of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, as are a number of other Members of this House, and we play a strong part in discussions and decision making. However, when it comes to the spending of money we have no input.</P>
      <P>I particularly want to relate this to our spending on overseas development. I am just back from Mozambique, where we are spending £30 million this year. I remember a time when even the Department of Defence did not receive such a sum of money. It is important that the Seanad should have an input into the decision making process when it comes to such expenditure. I put it to the Leader that detailed discussion should take place as to the future role of the Seanad in these areas.</P>
      <P>The discussion on the national aquatic centre brings to mind the book <i>At Swim Two Birds</i>&mdash;</P>

      <P>Following a report in <i>The Irish Times</i> yesterday I ask that the Minister for Finance be invited before the House to discuss Fine Gael's plans to make Ireland the envy of Europe. Since Ireland is currently the envy of the world, why does Fine Gael want to downgrade us to merely the envy of Europe?</P>

      <P>I share Senator Coogan's concern regarding the Convention of Human Rights. The Leader promised to inform us when it is planned to incorporate the convention into Irish law. I ask the Leader when he expects the Seanad will deal with the Courts Bill, 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="933" />I agree strongly with Senator O'Toole's comments on Campus and Stadium Ireland. The Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation should come before the House to discuss the issue because if corners have been cut, and this has been admitted, we have a right to know precisely which corners. There must be total openness and transparency on the matter, including information on what fees have been paid to individuals. I ask the Leader to arrange for the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation to come before the House.</P>

      <P>I agree with colleagues that we should have a discussion regarding the national aquatic centre and entire proposed development in Abbotstown. The basic question is who is in charge. Blame seems to be apportioned to various quarters but nobody seems to want to embrace responsibility.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come before the House to discuss the whole area of disability legislation, and the huge distress, disappointment and anger felt by people with disabilities and their carers that we have no rights-based legislation in this area, nor will we have before the end of this Government.</P>

      <P>I join the call for a debate on Waterways Ireland and ask that the Minister, Deputy de Valera, come before the House. It has been a success story, as Senator O'Toole said, and the levels of co-operation and activity are to be admired.</P>
      <P>One area which does not seem to have been addressed by Waterways Ireland is the control of water levels, in particular how they affect different communities, a matter to which the Leader should ask the Minister to pay particular attention as it is causing great concern and hardship to those living in the catchment of the Shannon and the Suck where in recent weeks people were isolated, some of whom were ruined. It is an important issue which, although there are broader aspects, I would like the Minister to address.</P>

      <P>Last weekend there were again many deaths on the roads and, as usual, there was one culprit, Mr. Alcohol. We do not seem to be taking alcohol abuse seriously, a matter on which I seek a debate. The position seems to be as bad now as it was 100 years ago in the days of poitín and shebeens. The Government at the time brought forward stringent rules to put an end to that system. We now need to put an end to the current abuse as too much sorrow is being visited upon families due to the abuse of alcohol. We have had several debates on the matter which the media are now headlining. We should continue the fight to bring to a halt the carnage on the roads. We are told that 70% is the result of alcohol abuse.</P>

      <P>Senator Coogan and others raised the question of the European Convention on Human Rights on which I hope to have an update on tomorrow morning. I thank Opposition leaders for their promise of support for any legislation that might be necessary in relation to it.</P>
      <P>Regarding the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, I am taking directions from Government on a daily basis and the Bill has been ordered for tomorrow. I will take into account the views expressed by Senators, but the Minister's diary already has a timeframe and the Bill will be taken tomorrow when there will be no restrictions on time. The debate on Second Stage will be open-ended, if Senators believe they can attend.</P>
      <P>Senator Coogan made a valid point about the Bill dealing with hand-held mobile phones, a matter about which there seems to be enormous confusion. It appears that if a person has a mobile phone in his pocket, turned off, while sitting in a car, it will be an offence. All legislation must make common sense. The public has taken much exception to the Bill in question and I hope the difficulties can be addressed before it reaches the House. Measures must be workable and common sense must prevail.</P>
      <P>Senators O'Toole, Coghlan and Keogh called for a debate on Campus Ireland and asked for the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation to update the Seanad on the present position. I will endeavour to make this happen and in the event of time not being available I will look at using Fianna Fáil Private Members' time next Wednesday. I take Senator O'Toole's point regarding alleged difficulties and one person being vilified in the media. I will make time available next week and discuss the matter with the leaders and party Whips.</P>
      <P>Senators O'Toole and Finneran asked for the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands to come to the House to update us on Waterways Ireland and control levels in our waterways, particularly the Shannon. I will try to ensure this takes place.</P>
      <P>I will consider the views of Senator Lanigan on the role of the Seanad in forming committees and pass them on to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. The Senator is a former Leader of the House and member of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and has lifelong experience in the House. His views could be discussed further by the committee, which could see how the matters in question could be dealt with.</P>
      <P>Senator Coghlan asked when the Courts and Court Officers Bill will come before the House. I will let him know later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Keogh asked for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come to the House for a debate on disability. I will have no difficulty in trying to arrange such a debate before the general election if possible, but not before the Easter recess. Those of us who are members of local authorities know that they have been asked to sign up to the Barcelona Convention on the disabled, a matter on which I opened <Col N="935" /> a seminar in Athlone last Friday. I fully support the aspirations of the convention.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrell sought a debate on alcohol abuse and the number of deaths on our roads. Those who listened to the Minister of State with responsibility for road safety, Deputy Molloy, on Monday night heard him outline the reduction over the last five years in the number of deaths on the roads. However, there is massive abuse of alcohol and excessive drinking. I hope the Bill dealing with the matter will be brought before both Houses before the general election. It addresses abuses such as late night noise and other areas where the Garda has no powers at present.</P>

    <P>This recommendation seeks the creation of a middle tax band between the 20% and 42% bands. Those on middle incomes are still paying a much higher proportion of their income in taxes than those on lower or higher incomes. The recommendation endeavours to push out the limit from &euro;20,000, the cut-off point for the 30% rate of tax. It seeks to have the next &euro;15,000 taxed at 30% and income thereafter taxed at 42%. This would create a reasonable amount of income before taxpayers enter the top level of tax.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of these recommendations is to provide for a third tax band of 30% interposed between the standard rate band of 20% and the higher rate band of 42%. As I have said on the many occasions we have debated this proposal, I have been engaged in a radical reform of the tax system during my tenure as Minister for Finance. Tax credits have been introduced and increased, tax rates have been substantially reduced and there has been significant widening of the standard rate band. All these measures have made the tax system inherently fairer, improved the incentive to work and contributed to the development of the economy. In particular, the changes in bands and credits have been of considerable <Col N="936" /> benefit to those on lower incomes, over 380,000 of whom have been removed from the tax net altogether since I took office.</P>
      <P>In the Dáil we had a discussion on amendments identical to these recommendations which were tabled with a view to assisting those on middle incomes. Regardless of what one might regard as middle income, the fact is that the focus of the Government's actions over the last five years has been to reduce the tax burden for the large number of taxpayers whose earnings are below the minimum threshold for the middle rate proposed by the Senator, that is, &euro;43,000.</P>
      <P>The Senator will be aware of the Government's target endorsed explicitly by the social partners in the PPF to move over time to a position where at least 80% of taxpayers pay tax at no more than the standard rate. Senators might also be interested to learn that for the present year the Revenue Commissioners estimate that close to 80% of taxpayers will earn less than &euro;40,000, or about £31,500. These are the people the Government has specifically targeted in its tax reforms over the last five years. I said before that I am not opposed, in principle, to a third rate, but I also said this should only be considered when the present process of reform is completed. The fact is that in present circumstances the proposal would mean, in effect, a cut of 12 percentage points for higher rate taxpayers at a time when greater prudence in managing overall Government finances is called for. The proposal would cost &euro;750 million in a full year &ndash; more than the entire income tax package of budget 2002.</P>
      <P>Internationally, we are now ahead of the field in terms of the tax burden imposed on those who might be regarded as being on middle to low incomes. According to OECD data, a single person on the average production or industrial wage known as APW in Ireland has the lowest tax wedge in the European Union. The European Union average tax wedge is 45% while the figure for Ireland is 28.8%. Provisional data from the European Union relating to the same year show that the EU average tax wedge for the year 2000 for the single low paid person on 50% of the average production or industrial wage is 35% while Ireland's tax wedge on the same income is only 14.8%. For a married couple on 50% of the average production wage, the tax wedge in Ireland is 3.8% while the EU average is 32.2%. On incomes up to &euro;30,000 for a single person and &euro;50,000 for a married couple persons are better off in Ireland than in the United Kingdom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The approach to tax reform comes down to one's judgment. I have often said that I will be happy to be judged on the combined effect of the five budgets for which I have been responsible. Each of my budgets must be taken as part of a sequence. The tax strategy I have pursued is bearing fruit in terms of higher take home pay and increased incentive to work and I am confident that the considered judgment of the electorate will be favourable when the general election is <Col N="937" /> held. It is not possible to do everything at once. I am prepared to consider the question of a middle rate in a future budget.</P>
    <P>We have debated this question before in this and the other House when the Fine Gael Party brought forward this proposal for another rate of tax and could debate it at length today. Some of my most strident critics would have to say I have done something to alleviate the tax burden. I think the people have noticed this. If one has been carrying an eight stone bag of potatoes on one's back for a couple of years, one will definitely notice when it is removed. The tax reductions have been so significant that people have noticed the difference in their take home pay and there are indications that they are appreciative of this and recognise that there has been an effective cut.</P>
    <P>In previous years former Ministers for Finance, because of pressures from their parties, Cabinet colleagues, the social partners, lobby groups, etc., tinkered around with the tax system in that whatever amount one was going to put into tax reduction, whether £50 million, £500 million or whatever, one gave a little bit to everyone and one did a little bit here and there. I decided a long time ago when in Opposition, for the best part of my political career, that this approach was to be avoided and that one would never achieve anything by going a little way down the road with everyone, although one would certainly not cause oneself any political difficulties by so doing. That is a golden rule of politics, if one makes no radical decisions, one hits no trouble. However, the only way to avoid controversial decisions is not to make any. If one makes 100 decisions, one is doing well if 51 or 52 are right, although 48 or 49 will be wrong. The only way to avoid making 48 wrong decisions is not to make any decisions. That is the textbook approach to politics taken by politicians the world over, by some in Ireland also. I do not subscribe to it.</P>
    <P>Due to pressures successive Ministers for Finance have always done small things, whether they had a small amount of money or no money. I decided we would never reform the tax system if we took that approach. I, therefore, adopted this approach and I am nearly at the end of the process. My goal has been to put the tax system on proper, sound and solid foundations which will make it easier for subsequent Ministers for Finance in that it will prove exceptionally difficult to make another hames of it, because it will be so simple and effective and one will be able to do particular things within the tax code. With a little more work it will be possible to use it to do a lot of different things, including marrying it with the social welfare code and integrate with other areas to do specific things.</P>
    <P>I said during a Committee Stage debate on one occasion that one would be able to give tax relief to those with curly black hair if one chose to do so if one made the taxation system simpler. To do this, one has to make a number of big changes, of which I have made some, some of which have <Col N="938" /> landed me in political hot water. However, no one ever made an omelette without cracking a few eggs. One cannot get to the end game, or what I hope to achieve, unless one does a few big things.</P>
    <P>As regards tinkering with the system in having part of a middle rate band &ndash; the proposal in the recommendation is the same as that made in the other House which would cost &euro;750 million, but what the Senator has in mind is a middle rate band for a small amount of income &ndash; that is a mistake successive Ministers for Finance have made, that is, doing a little bit for everyone. If one does a little bit here and there, one moves away from the main goal. If I had started to do things like that, I would never have got the standard rate of tax down to 20% and the top rate down to 42%.</P>
    <P>It is simple enough to reduce tax rates, but I did not do this. I increased the amount of income one has to earn before one reaches that stage by increasing the tax bands or credits as they are now known. The great advantage of tax credits will be that when one gets to the end game, one will be able to identify those with black curly hair and give them a tax break. The other aspect is widening the standard rate band from 1980-81, the dark old days in terms of equality and everything else, but that was the tax system in place. No one ever suggested that we should double the tax bands. For some reason the Government at the time decided not only to make an adjustment for the Murphy judgment, which was necessary, but also to double the tax bands for the first time in the income tax code. I have just returned to the way it was &ndash; one band for everybody, although I have not completed the process and have yet to remove more items from tax allowance certificates. Mortgage interest relief and medical insurance relief, which are deducted at source, are no longer included in one's tax credit document as it is now called. I have also streamlined items such as medical expenses, etc.</P>
    <P>My goal is to have a simple and effective system with a low tax rate which leads to a high compliance rate. I have said over the last year since Fine Gael announced a proposal for a middle rate that there is nothing sacrosanct about the rates payable. Why 20% or 42%? Before I was elected to the House, between 1973 and 1997, the top rate of tax, payable on very small income, was 77%. A 10% surcharge was levied in order that the 70% rate became 77%, the 35% rate became 38.5% and the 45% rate became 49.5%. It lasted for a number of years. The rates were reduced to 58% before we came into Government in 1987.</P>
    <P>Those on the left have always amused me because they have never said that a tax reduction by a Government is wrong. Yet I have never seen them put it up when they came into Government. It has always been wrong. The 77% rate was thought to be sacrosanct and the 58% rate even more so. Why should the 58% rate be sacrosanct? Why should it not be 68% or 59.5%? God gave us the Ten Commandments only; he did not send <Col N="939" /> us the tax bands &ndash; we had to make up those ourselves. These are not tablets of stones which must be abided by and they are not in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Look at the furore I caused when I reduced the rate from 48% to 46%. I did that because we had promised to do so during the general election campaign. Was I to ignore our manifesto and the vote of electorate and go along with some of the social partners who did not want to do it that way? There is nothing sacrosanct about tax rates. I could have easily reduced the rate to 42% if I did not increase the bands. There is nothing sacrosanct about the 20% rate either. If I accept this recommendation and make adjustments, I would dilute my resources rather than clearly focus on what I want to achieve.</P>
    <P>I do not have a principled objection to a 30% tax rate at some time in the future, but my goal was to reduce the rates to 42% &ndash; or 40% if possible &ndash; and 20% during my term of office. The rate has been reduced to 42% as promised. Economic circumstances meant I was not able to reduce it to 40% in the last budget. I have reduced the PRSI rates for employees quite significantly. Our main adjustment of abolishing the existing self-employed and propriety director thresholds only requires a few more steps to be completed.</P>
    <P>I have not completed the reform of the desperately complicated PRSI system. I intended to do more with this in the recent budget. Depending on the electorate I might be in a position to complete the programme. I regard PRSI reform as part of the reform of the taxation system. I oppose this recommendation.</P>

      <P>As the Minister knows, this subject is very dear to me. As a practising accountant, I have dealt with many clients who were resident in the Republic but worked in Northern Ireland. The Minister has almost equalised our tax rates with those in the North during his term of office. When I first entered the House, the difference between the take home pay of those on either side of the Border was tremendous. The Minister and I agree with this recommendation in principle. If we are serious about equalising our <Col N="940" /> rates with those in Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the first thing the Minister should do is reduce the top rate of tax to 40%, as it is in Northern Ireland, when funds become available to him.</P>
      <P>The tax credits system and increase in the bands have ensured that individuals earning up to &euro;30,000 or married couples earning up to &euro;50,000 are now better off than people in Northern Ireland. When the Minister is back in the House this time next year, I hope that he will have reduced the 42% rate to 40%. He can then consider a third band.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I move recommendation No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 13, before section 6, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;6.&ndash;The Principal Act is hereby amended by the insertion of the following section after section 476:</P>
      <P>476A.&ndash;Where an individual who subscribed, as part of the initial public offering, for shares in Eircom plc, has sustained a loss (&ldquo;the loss&rdquo;) and such individual is not entitled under any other provision of this Act to relief for such loss than for the 2002 year of assessment the individual may in computing his or her liability to tax take a deduction equating to the amount of the loss at the standard rate.'.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This seeks to give effect to the Fine Gael proposal that those who bought Eircom shares and cannot avail of the capital gains offset should be allowed to offset their losses against other income taxes. I have no doubt that institutional investors in Eircom would be able to offset their losses against capital gains taxes. I suspect that most institutional investors sold their shares when they showed a profit. The Minister will rightly say that <Col N="941" /> other ordinary shareholders could have done the same.</P>
    <P>I speak on behalf of those who invested in Eircom with a view to a long-term investment. They did so because the Government promoted the scheme heavily and some investors might have believed the Government was underwriting the shares. The majority of people who lost money in the Eircom floatation were probably buying shares for the first time. A relation of mine invested his entire retirement lump sum in Eircom in the name of his three children, believing that he was making a long-term investment for them. Buying shares was the easiest thing for these first time share buyers to do. Having bought the shares, however, many of them did not know how to dispose of them. They were not familiar with stockbrokers, etc.</P>
    <P>There is a difference between capital gains and income taxes and I know the Minister will have a difficulty with this recommendation. I believe there should be some concession for the ordinary person who bought Eircom shares and lost about one third of their investment. In view of that, I ask the Minister to look sympathetically at this recommendation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>This is possibly the barmiest suggestion I have heard in this House in nearly 20 years. I thought the Fine Gael Party had dropped the idea that those who lost money on the stock exchange should be compensated by the taxpayer. I gather it is still party policy. I am an Eircom shareholder and I have lost at least one third of the value of my investment. If this compensation was to take place, it would be the most diabolical precedent not only for future privatisations, but for any kind of investment in the stock exchange by individuals who are supposedly not aware of the facts and dangers of dealing. If this was to happen, all future privatisations would be subject to the caveat of the Government bailing people out if they lose money. All future Governments would say that they would not do this and that this was a once off. However, all future would Governments would be under pressure and parties would probably promise to do so at election time.</P>
      <P>Although the Minister cannot say it, this must be seen as a straightforward electoral bribe of 485,000 discontented people who lost money. It is the action of a troubled Opposition party wondering who are the malcontents in society, identifying them and telling them they will give them their money back. That is what has happened. It is unscrupulous, unfair and will not happen. It will not happen because the Government has had the guts to stand up to it. If Fine Gael gets into power, no coalition partner will agree to it. It is another little flag flown by Fine Gael to titillate the electorate which will be dropped after the election because, in negotiations, the Labour Party, the Green Party or perhaps even the Progressive Democrats will reject it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="942" />It is a non-runner politically and financially because nobody in any country in the world that I know of is compensated for capital losses of income on the stock exchange. It is a ludicrous and lop-sided suggestion, as the party itself knows. The problem is that it lacks credibility, which is why I am surprised that it is being proposed today. Even those of us who lost money, substantial sums in some cases, do not believe that the taxpayer owes us compensation.</P>
    <P>I went into Eircom, as did everyone else, for a quick gain because I thought it was cheap. Let us be honest and admit that it was cheap. There is a myth being peddled, mainly by those proposing this motion, that it was too expensive. Eircom shares were cheap on the day and the evidence is clear. For nearly all the first year, they were far above the &euro;3.90 flotation level. We forget this now because we are haemorrhaging losses. Those who bought at that price had the opportunity to get out at any stage during that period, but we did not because we were greedy and wanted more. The myth is abroad that the Government sold it at too high a price and that there was too much hype. However, the institutions, to which Senator Doyle referred, the experts themselves, bought in at the offer price and the majority did not sell, but held on and suffered losses also. We bought them and lost out. That is what happened.</P>
    <P>Imagine if we lost money on Aer Lingus, Aer Rianta, the ESB, or any other company that was floated. Would we be compensated for it? Where would it end? If we bought shares in the banks because they were hyped and made a loss, would that be next?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed. That could be next. We could claim to be poor, unfortunate people who did not realise what we were doing when we followed the advice of the stockbrokers who were promoting the shares. Will we tell the Government that, because it compensated people for Eircom losses, it must compensate us for this and every loss on the market? It is cloud cuckoo land and pure bribery of an electorate which does not attach any credibility to this proposal. If it was credible, people would be tempted by it. It has flopped like a burst balloon as it should have done once it was seen for what it was.</P>
      <P>We must put a lie to the claim that the shares fell because of the Government. We cannot honestly make political capital by sustaining that case. In retrospect, we know the reasons the shares fell were multitudinous but were nothing to do with the Government as it was totally out of the scene. It did its best by the taxpayer and attempted to give a reasonable price to the buyers. The Government's first duty, as it is of any Government, was to the taxpayer. If Fine Gael in Government acts as if its first duty is to those to whom the company was sold, then Eircom will have been given away for nothing with no return to the taxpayer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="943" />The price of the company's shares was fair, as the Minister can confirm. There were two conflicting pieces of advice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>One recommended about &euro;4.20 and the other about &euro;3.70, while the offer price was &euro;3.90. The Department of Finance was said to favour the higher price with the Department of Public Enterprise suggesting the lower price, but a compromise was reasonably chosen. Senator Doyle should remember the taxpayer. A fifth of the people bought these shares meaning that the other four fifths sold them to us. It was the property of taxpayers and the Department of Finance, whose duty it was to seek the maximum price from institutions all over the world, not just from Irish buyers.</P>
      <P>Those of us who bought it were very sore. It may have been the biggest investment of our lives, but, having seen a large profit presented to us, we cannot ask for our money back because we now have a loss. That would be against every rule of the market economy. No stock market, exchange or shares could operate under such a system. We should not believe that this is a once-off because there are no once-off deals in Government. I remind Senator Doyle that income tax was a once-off deal. It was meant to be a temporary measure.</P>
      <P>Let us put this one to bed. It was a bad company. What was wrong was that it was badly managed and had a bad board of directors. There were other reasons as well. Telecommunications companies plunged in the market at that time. Eircom was taken over because it was badly managed and the board threw in the towel. We are sorry and angry that we invested in it, but our anger should be directed against those who directed and managed the company, not the Government. We should not join in the cry of those who say that they should get their money back from the Exchequer every time they lose on the Stock Exchange. It is a non-runner and should be killed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention of this recommendation is to give income tax relief at the standard rate to individuals for the amount of any capital loss sustained on the disposal of Eircom plc shares, provided that the individual had subscribed to those shares as part of the initial public offering of them. The text of the recommendation also provides that the capital loss must not otherwise be capable of being relieved for tax purposes and that the loss relief should be given for the 2002 income tax year. It is not clear if the intention is to give income tax relief only for the element of the capital loss incurred on the Valentia takeover or how individuals who suffered a loss on the disposal of the Vodafone shares &ndash; the shares received by Eircom shareholders following <Col N="944" /> the disposal of the Eircell business &ndash; would be addressed.</P>
      <P>In considering an identical proposal on Report Stage of this Bill in the other House, I explained that, apart from those persons who are actively engaged in a trade or profession of dealing in shares, any gains and losses arising from shares come within the capital gains tax system. Our income tax and capital gains tax systems, which have co-existed since 1975, do not allow crossover for income tax purposes. As far as I know, that is also the norm in other jurisdictions. Even within our own income tax system, there is only limited crossover between different categories of losses and income. For example, a landlord who incurs a loss in renting property can only set that loss against other rental income. He cannot set the loss sideways against any other income he may have.</P>
      <P>The recommendation proposes ignoring these long standing principles in the specific case of Eircom shareholders. Apart from undermining fundamental principles in the tax code, such a measure would be unfairly discriminatory. Many individuals other than Eircom shareholders have suffered capital losses on their shares in recent times and they will not necessarily have other current or future capital gains to absorb these losses. It must also be added that the recommendation does not deal with Eircom shareholders outside the tax net.</P>
      <P>The House will appreciate that, while it is targeted at the specific case of Eircom shareholders, the recommendation, if accepted, would inevitably trigger calls for special treatment for other investors who find that the value of their investment has fallen and that such requests would be difficult to resist once a high profile precedent, such as this, has been set. If the case is conceded once, it would, in equity, have to apply to all capital losses and this could have serious potential costs to the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>Investing in shares always carries a risk in that the price of shares can, and does, fall as well as rise. Compensating individuals for stock market losses, even in the single instance now being proposed, would entail taxpayers in general having to make good losses incurred as a result of a stock market gamble by others. Expecting the generality of taxpayers to do that is not realistic and it is certainly not equitable from the viewpoint of the many taxpayers who decided not to invest in the shares in question.</P>
      <P>Persons who invested in Eircom shares did so for the same reason as anyone buying shares, that is, to make gains and earn dividends from their investment. Some Eircom shareholders made a profit when they sold their shares after the initial flotation. Others have incurred losses but providing them with compensation by means of the proposal now before the House would, apart from the other considerations I already touched upon, represent a commitment of Exchequer resources for which there are many more pressing and deserving demands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="945" />The proposal in this recommendation would also call into question the position of future flotations of State owned companies. This could not be a one-off arrangement. A precedent allowed for Eircom shareholders would inevitably compromise future Governments in relation to further State company flotations and for these reasons I will not support the recommendation, which is not a surprise.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross outlined most of the arguments I made against this measure on Committee and Report Stages in the other House as well as the comments I made at press briefings in response to questions about the Fine Gael proposal. There is no point going over them again except to refer to the point the Senator made in his later contribution about the price at which the Eircom shares were set. If I recall correctly, approximately 550,000 persons initially applied to participate in the IPO but we must remember what happened immediately after that. The first accusation made was that we set the price too low.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>That was right because for the first 11 months the price was way above that; it went as high as 20% or 25% above the IPO price. The initial accusation was that the price was set too low, but it is amazing what happens in politics. A Cabinet sub-committee was charged with looking after this particular matter whose members included the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, the Minister for Public Enterprise and myself. There were two sets of advisers in this matter &ndash; Merrill Lynch and AIB Capital Markets &ndash; and Senator Ross is correct that one recommended a higher price while the other recommended a lower price. This has been used by Fine Gael in the recent past and I heard its spokesperson say in the other House that the board recommended the lower price and, in future, the board should set the price. I have heard many strange comments in my time in politics but asking a board appointed by the State to decide the price at which shares will be set, while ignoring the owner of the shares, is unheard of.</P>
      <P>I have engaged many advisers in my past professional life, from auctioneers to solicitors, but the call rests with the client who owns the house, bit of land, shares or whatever. The adviser, be it an accountant, solicitor or auctioneer, can advise the client to accept a certain price but it is the client's asset. As this was our asset, the right would have to be retained where the Government of the day, representing the people of Ireland, decides the price, not the board. To be sure that we were getting a fair price, however, we had all these advisers and the board had advisers as well. Approximately £80 million to £90 million &ndash; I will have those figures checked &ndash; was paid out to those advisers for their great advice over a period of years and to other people as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="946" />When the price was higher, everybody basked in the glory and said it was a great idea, but a funny thing happened when the price went the other way after about 11 months. It appeared in articles in newspapers that the person who was the cause of all this difficulty was the Minister for Finance, who held out for the higher price. That is correct but the article was not written to compliment me. I did not settle for the lower price, as other people wanted to do, because I was not prepared to wait all day. I come from a very old tradition, recognised by Senator Hayes and Senator Ross, in that my father was a small farmer and cattle dealer who believed that on the day, the man who turns up gets the bullock at the best price. If only one person turns up and the farmer is not satisfied with the price offered, he walks away and marches his bullock home again. When a price is agreed, the farmer shakes hands on it and if the price goes up, the best of luck to the person who bought it from the farmer. I come from that very old tradition so I was prepared to sit it out forever and a day to get what I thought was the best price because approximately 500,000 people applied for the initial offering but the other 3.2 million people were not in a position to go to their bank, financial institution, credit union or life assurance company to borrow money to effectively speculate.</P>
    <P>What amused me about those on the left wing of Irish politics, the great socialist people, was that they wanted everybody to be little capitalists for a day and make a great profit. They even wanted to sell off the shares cheaply so that they could make even more profit. I am a student of the 1960s and I thought these people were against capitalism. There is no better form of capitalism than the stock market because people take a gamble. That is what happened but it went the other way and we have seen the consequences. People took the position that the price would increase, and it did increase.</P>
    <P>I was standing in the breach for the 3.2 million people who were not in a position to speculate and I used the money I got wisely. The major tranche went into the National Pensions Reserve Fund and it also allowed us to do many other things. That is why I held out for the highest price and I make no apologies for that. I said at the time that I held out for the highest price and I am proud of doing so. I got the best price on the day and I agree with Senator Ross that we could have got an even higher price. One of the advisers said we would be able to get a higher price but as Senator Ross rightly surmised, we reached a compromise, which was a reasonable way to proceed. We settled on a price in the middle range. I did not want to be in a position where the price would rise by about 100% over the following year because people would then have said that I sold off the State silver too cheaply, so I held out for the higher price.</P>
    <P>On the question of the advisers, I read a note written in 2000 into the record in the other <Col N="947" /> House. The Government could have chosen to float the company at a higher price than it did, but chose not to do so. The Government received advice from one of the giant global co-ordinators for the offer, Merrill Lynch, to float the shares at £3.27 but set a flotation price of £3.07. The other advisers recommended a lower price than the Merrill Lynch proposal. In the immediate aftermath of flotation, the shares rose in price by 20%. The shares traded well above the flotation price most of the time since flotation. In the first nine months since flotation, from July 1999 to April 2000, the shares traded at or above the flotation price on all but 12 out of the 294 trading days. The average price at that time was £3.37, a premium of 10% on the flotation price. A total of £77 million was paid to advisers, and that includes those advisers, advertising and PR consultants, etc, so it was a profitable day out for all the advisers.</P>
    <P>Apart from those principles, I could not possibly allow a total no lose bet in terms of any future flotation because one would have to be an idiot not to subscribe. They will say that if the price goes down, the Government will compensate us. That would not be a flotation. People bought the shares and many of them got out after the first year and made a profit and some people held on.</P>
    <P>Due to the impending election, over the past number of months I have visited various parts of the country, including Roscommon, with various candidates, including a fair part of my own constituency. I think I met only one person who did anything about his or her Eircom shares. I am not sure where that was, but certainly this is not an issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">

People are far more level headed on a wide range of issues than politicians of all parties and the media, who report on such issues, think they are. If one were to ask an Eircom shareholder if he or she would like to be compensated for the money he or she lost, he or she would be a right fool not to say &ldquo;Yes, of course&rdquo;. It is same as saying to someone, &ldquo;Here is &euro;100. Would you like to take it with no strings attached?&rdquo; Most normal people would grab at that chance. I do not think the people of Ireland are exercised about this matter. For these and other reasons, regrettably, I am not in a position to accept Deputy Doyle's recommendation.</P>

      <P>These are shares with a difference. Those who bought them were amateurs. They were advised to buy them and believed the offer was backed by the Government. Great propaganda surrounded it. I know of people throughout the country who invested a great deal of money in them. Some borrowed money to buy them. Many on social welfare also bought them, but they got caught because they were not familiar with the technicalities surrounding shares. I bought some of them, although I am not a big shareholder. The only other shares I bought were Bula shares and I have been waiting 20 years in anticipation of a big kill. Senator Ross may tell me when is the right time to sell them.</P>
      <P>Many who had not bought shares previously bought these shares. They were not familiar with the technicalities surrounding shares, the position regarding stockbrokers or the ins and outs of when and when not to sell. It must be admitted by the Minister and everybody else that quite a number of ordinary people who were not familiar with the share scene were caught out. They bought the shares because they believed they were a safe investment due to the propaganda and Government and media backing of the share offer. They believed they could make decent money on their investment which could go towards the education of their children, but they were caught.</P>
      <P>Their position is not the same as that of a person who lost money having backed a horse that did not win. The position regarding these shares is slightly different. The Minister must accept this. Many who bought them were first time shareholders who got burned and will never buy other shares. That is not good for the share market and it will not be good for future flotations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am talking about first time shareholders who were caught out due to their amateurism. I feel <Col N="949" /> sorry for them. I know quite a number, including many friends, who got caught. Their position is more serious than that of a person who lost having backed a horse that did not win. This is a question of first time shareholders getting caught. They lost out through their amateurism. They bought the shares due to the propaganda surrounding their promotion. That is what Fine Gael is talking about and what Senator Doyle spoke about in regard to his recommendation.</P>

      <P>Let us be clear on this. If the Senator was a dealer in shares like, say, a stockbroker, that would be his trade, the same as buying and selling sweets or paper, and he would be taxed on his trading profits. If, however, he was a casual investor in stocks and shares like most people here, the transaction would be a capital gain for him. All he would be allowed to offset would be his capital loss against his capital gain within the capital gains tax code. He would not be allowed to transfer the loss. If, say, he bought bank or Eircom shares and made a loss on some of them, he would not be allowed to offset the losses against his income tax on his earnings as a Senator.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>A bank or financial institution is in the business of lending money. If a bank gave the Senator a loan of &euro;5,000 and he was not in a position to repay it, it would become a bad debt which would be written off as such in the bank's profit and loss account. If, however, out of the goodness of my heart, I decided to give him a loan of &euro;5,000 because I like him and he was stuck and he did not repay me, that would be a loss for me. I could not write that off against tax on my earnings as a Minister because lending money is not my business. I am trying to explain what the differences are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An analogy was made by the Senator's party in some of its commentary that pension funds would allow for such a provision. I have provided for a gross roll up where income or capital gains tax does not apply to pension funds, but an executive <Col N="950" /> tax applies when one benefits. Therefore, the situations are not the same.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that. I was just making the point that if I had a portfolio of shares, I could write off losses against gains for capital gains tax purposes. If a person had only one share and made a loss on it, he or she could not write off that loss against capital gains because he or she had not made any other gains.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite clear about the difference between capital gains tax and income tax. I said the Minister would have a difficulty in accepting this recommendation and understand that. What Fine Gael is stating is that if people who buy and sell shares can get relief by way of capital gains tax by offsetting their losses against their gains, if a person has only one share and makes a loss on it, some provision should be made to allow him or her to offset that loss against tax, although I accept it could not be capital gains tax.</P>

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 6 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised the question of tags yesterday and will give an example. Some local authorities moved from providing a refuse collection service to privatising it. The Waste Management Bill is important in terms of what is happening. Obviously, major expenditure will be made by local authorities to address the position. In my local authority in County Donegal over the past two years refuse collectors have had to pay an extra £15 per tonne to place waste in the council's landfill sites. Whether in providing for incineration or better engineered landfills, major expenditure will be made in this area. Our local authority intends to increase it by a further £15 per tonne over the next seven or eight years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A refuse tag cost 50p three years ago, before it was increased to 75p. I could not believe the increase in the price of a refuse tag when my wife asked me to buy one on my way home last week. A tag now costs &euro;2.50 and one has to pay &euro;5 to fill a wheeled bin. Residents of counties where the service has been privatised by the local authority pay more than those in counties where ser<Col N="951" /> vice charges are paid to the local authority. I cannot understand why this distinction remains, but I understand that the Minister has made a commitment to examine the matter once more. I envisage that refuse tags in County Donegal will cost between &euro;7 and &euro;9 by the end of this decade. The residents of counties where the service has been privatised face a huge disadvantage as they do not enjoy the same tax relief as those who pay directly to local authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 6 of this Bill amends section 477 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, and provides for a tax credit for local authority service charges. The maximum amount of service charges qualifying for credit at present is &euro;195. Last year, I increased the credit in respect of private domestic refuse collections and the bin tags system for taxable purposes to &euro;195, bringing it into line with that available for local authority service charges. I am now abolishing the ceiling proposed for local authority service charges and private domestic refuse collection other than the charge under the tags system, which will remain at &euro;195. Section 6 also brings forward the date by which local authorities must provide the relevant returns to the Revenue Commissioners from January to November to take account of the alignment of the income tax year with the calendar year.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of this year's changes was to give unlimited relief for service charges paid to local authorities or private contractors. I retained the tax relief of &euro;195 because of increases last year which resulted from difficulties in policing the tags system. Kildare County Council's charges have increased dramatically this year, for the reasons outlined by Senator Bonner, although I have not received my bill yet. I have introduced unlimited relief as various pit charges have increased and new rules and regulations have been introduced. I did not change the figure of &euro;195 in deference to how this could be policed. Kildare County Council has privatised many of its services and one can claim tax relief on the fixed amount one pays to the private contractor. We will have to think of some way of policing a similar method of relief to apply under the tags system.</P>
      <P>I will look at the matter in next year's budget with a view to substantially increasing reliefs, possibly in line with those which apply to the average one-off payment to local authorities or private contractors. Senator Bonner is correct that service charges have increased dramatically. I was not aware that the price of tags has increased in County Donegal, but I should have assumed that they had as overall costs for private contractors have grown. I cannot make changes at this stage, but I can make a commitment to make a change in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator might remember that I made significant changes to the tax relief for the self-employed and directors in a Finance Bill two or three years ago. I introduced a new age-related sliding scale to determine the amounts on which one can get tax relief, I freed up the ownership of the fund and I established the improved retirement fund. The provisions of section 10 of this Bill relate to the relief on occupational pensions and additional voluntary contributions and the age-related mechanism for the self-employed in section 780 of the Taxes Consolidation Act. Self-employed people with an occupational pension will be allowed to retain any retirement annuity contract they may have, which they are not allowed to do under existing Revenue rules. The purpose of these changes is to encourage people, through the tax system, to provide for their own pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I spoke earlier about putting aside money for the future, using the National Pensions Reserve Fund. I have believed for a long time that we will face a pensions crisis 20 or 30 years from now. We will have enough time to prepare for it, unlike Germany and France which did not look forward when they had largesse and are now paying a heavy price. There has been some controversy recently as regards defined benefits schemes, but I have believed for a long time that people will have to provide for their own pensions in the future. Defined benefit schemes, which are enjoyed at present by Deputies, Senators and civil servants, will be replaced by defined contribution <Col N="953" /> schemes. A number of major companies have offered defined contribution schemes to new entrants in recent months, rather than defined benefit schemes. The growth of the fund will depend on how much one puts into it.</P>
    <P>I have forecast for some time, long before I became Minister for Finance, that such schemes will be an increasing feature of Irish pensions policy. I have used the tax code to encourage people to provide for themselves, a principle which I am keen to uphold. Senator Doyle does not have any difficulty with my economic and political philosophy, although left-wing politicians and newspaper commentators seem to have such difficulties in abundance. People should be encouraged to look after themselves and this can be achieved in relation to pensions by using the tax code. I have made some changes to occupational pensions schemes to that end, although I would have liked to have done more. Further significant changes which were under consideration have been set aside for my second coming, as they would have complicated the pensions system to too great an extent at this point.</P>

      <P>I move recommendation No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 21, between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(11) Provision shall be made for&ndash;</P>
      <P>(<i>a</i>) a tax credit of up to &euro;2,000 per annum for individuals engaged in the sports of Gaelic football and hurling,</P>
      <P>(<i>b</i>) the relief to apply for those individuals whose names have been submitted to the Revenue Commissioners by the County Board for each County.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This recommendation arises from the Minister's proposal to repay 40% of tax paid over a certain period by élite sportspersons resident in this country. I welcomed this measure in my Second Stage speech yesterday, although I am not sure that it has attracted a great deal of support among Government Senators.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister's comments yesterday that international golfers, athletes and jockeys have a short professional lifespan. As far as I understand it, the Minister proposes that they will be allowed, when they retire, to reclaim the tax they have paid. My recommendation proposes to give a tax credit to amateur sportspeople, the most prominent of whom are GAA players. I ask the Minister to a consider such a tax credit as a small recognition of those who entertain thousands of people on a weekly basis and as a gesture of goodwill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="954" />I was surprised by some of the Second Stage contributions of Members on the Government side. I think the Minister was in the House for the short intervention of Senator Hayes, who is a well respected Member. The Senator appealed to the Minister to protect the principle of amateurism and asked him to consider the importance of cultivating and strengthening the capacity of amateur sports and the contribution they make to the community.</P>

      <P>As a former GAA player and administrator, I support this recommendation. Hurling is the greatest field game in the world. GAA footballers and hurlers are a wonderful group of athletes and they have brought much pleasure to many people for over 100 years.</P>
      <P>I have watched the recent progress of Clarinbridge parish club in County Galway which took part in last Sunday's all-Ireland club final. This is a wonderful group of players from a small parish who trained diligently and effectively and won their first county title in 100 years. They trained through the winter and played in the rain last Sunday in Thurles. The same goes for Clarinbridge's opponents, Birr. These are wonderful athletes and great people, but they have families and jobs to go to. Given that there is so much money in the economy and things are going so well, some recognition should be given to GAA players. This recommendation is reasonable. It is a token and a gesture of appreciation for the wonderful entertainment these players provide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One page of the recent <i>Sunday Independent</i> could have discussed the match between Clarinbridge and Birr while another page might have <Col N="955" /> carried a headline to the effect that Roy Keane has negotiated a £78,000 per week contract. Professional golfers, soccer players and those in racing earn much money. I accept that they are professionals and I have an interest in all sports. However, the GAA is the poor relation. The Minister is a good GAA man and I appeal to him to examine the position of the GAA and recognise the magnificent work it has carried out. The association had a marvellous recent president in Joe McDonagh from Galway who introduced new ideas. The current president is also very good.</P>
    <P>The time has come to recognise clubs and players such as those in Clarinbridge for the enormous contribution and the wonderful entertainment they provide. It is no longer sufficient to suggest that they can remain as amateurs. If they are left that way, many of them will fall away. That would be a great pity as the GAA is part of our heritage. It is important that the association is recognised and I appeal to the Minister to consider this recommendation which will be supported by many Members on the Government side. Deep in his heart I am sure the Minster will also see merit in the recommendation.</P>

      <P>I gained the reputation of being a players' man as I was anxious to look after them. Players might be demanding and angry when one does not meet all their demands, but when I ended my year the players all recognised that I was with them. The Minister has met them and I am sure they would tell him the same.</P>
      <P>I would support any recommendation or measure which helped GAA players, but the recommendation before the House is flawed. It proposes a tax credit of &euro;2,000 per annum for individuals engaged in the sports of Gaelic hurling and football. However, is this open-ended? We are all engaged in the GAA. That is even the case with county and club officials who work with élite players when they start at under age level and when they cost money. Will such officials receive tax credits?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recommendation also suggests that the relief should apply to those individuals whose names have been submitted to the Revenue Commissioners by the county board for each county. It is unfair to ask county boards to submit names as there are so many names they could submit. There is a large number of registered GAA players. Will all their names be submitted? The problem is that some players might not be as active as others. Will those who played in the club finals receive tax credits? I would support any practical <Col N="956" /> recommendation which would benefit players, but this recommendation is not practical.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonagh referred to the GAA as the poor relation, but that is not the case under this Government which has given more than any other Government to the organisation. That fact is appreciated by the GAA. The previous Government gave nothing to the GAA, but this Government has looked after the organisation. We must also consider the fact that the GAA is a 32 county association. I am in favour of looking after GAA players in a practical way and I will support any such recommendation. However, this recommendation is too flawed to be supported.</P>

      <P>In my Second Stage contribution to the Bill I went much deeper than the GAA. The Minister's proposal was introduced suddenly and the first I heard of it was from Des Cahill on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;. However, when I examined the proposal I came to the conclusion that it was introduced to help the small number of élite sportspeople. The idea was that they are big earners who reside in Ireland and pay a substantial amount in tax. As their sports careers only last a number of years the idea was to give them a savings through the tax system rather than saving money through their own system. I still believe that is the case as can be seen from the sports which are included. For example, the two best cyclists we produced could not have been resident in Ireland. Most of our top athletes would not have been resident in Ireland while earning their money. The new breed of rugby player might be resident here. Our golfers would qualify&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I am aware only one of our top golfers is tax resident in Ireland.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct. Quite a few jockeys are also resident. It is a good idea but it has hit a snag in relation to the GAA.</P>
      <P>When I spoke on Second Stage I made the point that the top class footballers are not resident here while they are earning. My cousin, Packie Bonner, was not resident here. Although he is employed on a part-time basis by the FAI he will not gain any benefit from this because he has been resident in Britain for most of his career.</P>
      <P>This might help some League of Ireland soccer players but I cannot see how it will help most of them because of the way they are paid and the amounts they receive. They are not élite sportspeople able to employ accountants. I doubt many of them would be in a position to produce documentation after ten years to claim tax relief. All League of Ireland clubs have had great difficulties with PAYE and PRSI. Senator Doyle's proposal of a tax free allowance or tax credit for soccer players might eliminate liabilities for the clubs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="957" />Every county player when selected is as proud as we all were years ago when there was no money in the GAA. The times have changed, however, for élite GAA players. All county teams put in a great effort, particularly in the open championship and training, but only one team can win the All-Ireland Final and only a number of players in each team can reach superstar status. The only way GAA players get an income is through sponsorship, endorsements and advertising. If that were removed, however, the income of élite golfers and other such sportspeople would be increased. GAA players in full-time employment lead a hectic lifestyle and put in a great deal of effort through their jobs in the PAYE sector.</P>
    <P>The recommendation fails in that it does not address the issue of policing. Who is engaged in the GAA? County panels are constantly changing. Will the lists be sent to the Revenue Commissioners every time there is a change? Also, many club players put in the same effort. Will they be cut off? Those players who played in Semple Stadium on St. Patrick's Day for their clubs put in as much effort as county players. Will they be eliminated? </P>
    <P>I cannot vote for Senator Doyle's recommendation but the Minister should consult the GAA. I am not in favour of the GAA becoming a professional organisation with weekly wages for players. Some players are pushing for that but they would not do so if they did not make the county team. They are not pushing for it for the ordinary player. I have argued about this with members of the Donegal team which won the All-Ireland Final in 1992. One or two of them had a higher profile than others and their pals were left sitting in the background when trips to America and such like came up.</P>
    <P>I argued with my own club man, Tony Boyle, about the idea of paying players. The GAA is a locally based, amateur organisation and I hope it never changes. I would like, however, to see a discussion with the hierarchy in the GAA and the League of Ireland. While players in the league are getting paid, there will be little in this for them. I hope the Minister will discuss the issue over the next year with the possibility of a change in the scheme in future that might assist League of Ireland and GAA players.</P>

      <P>I have had no involvement at all with the GAA apart from stitching up the heads of those who play hurling and I am relieved to see more of them are wearing helmets. I echo Senator Bonner's sentiments that the Minister should consult the GAA to see what can be done. Senator Doyle's amendment deals with players engaged in the sport. They have made an enormous contribution to the cultural and sporting life of this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I dealt with this amendment on Report Stage in the other House. It is not clear if the relief being proposed is intended as a tax credit of &euro;2,000 per annum, as an annual allowance at the standard rate or as a sportsperson's marginal rate. While the relief is intended to be limited to Gaelic footballers and hurlers nominated by their county boards, it does not appear to be restricted to senior inter-county players and is open ended as regards the number of players from each county that can be nominated.</P>
      <P>My unwillingness to give tax relief to amateur sportspeople has been portrayed in some quarters as a snub to the GAA, specifically its top hurlers and footballers. Tax relief for targeted sportspeople, which I introduced in section 12 of this year's Bill, is restricted to direct earnings from participation in sport. It is wrong to suggest that it can in some way simply be extended to cover amateur sportspeople. It does not, and cannot, apply where no earnings exist.</P>
      <P>I am happy to stand over my record of support for the GAA. I came in for a fair amount of criticism when I granted the GAA &euro;25 million in the 1998 budget to aid in the redevelopment of Croke Park. I am aware of the effort and commitment top players make in training and preparation and the pleasure they give to the sports-going public. These players have been referred to as élite athletes and I do not disagree with that description.</P>
      <P>There are, however, sportsmen and women in other amateur codes whose dedication and commitment to their chosen sport is equally impressive and they were also excluded from availing from this relief. The question of whether these sportspeople should be paid or not is entirely a matter for their governing bodies, just as it is for the GAA with regard to its top players.</P>
      <P>I am not prepared to agree with this recommendation. Even if I were, it could not be limited to GAA players. Once the link between tax relief and sports income is broken, it will become difficult, if not impossible, to stop its extension to people engaged in sport as a leisure activity rather than a competitive one. This would prove very costly to the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The GAA is already well treated in the tax code. The current tax exemption for the income of sports bodies was introduced in 1927 specifically for the games of Gaelic football, hurling and handball, and was extended to other sports in 1963. Where a sports organisation wishes to reimburse its members, be they players, coaches, selectors, referees or officials, for bona fide reasonable expenses they incur in attending training sessions and matches, those payments are not assessable for income tax. There is no set limit <Col N="959" /> which can be reimbursed tax free in any year; it depends entirely on the facts of each case.</P>
    <P>The tax code cannot be expected to contribute more than this to amateur sports. I do not intend to give further tax relief in these circumstances as a substitute for salary and for these reasons I cannot accept the amendment. The debate on this issue has been ongoing and I take on board what Members have said. The purpose of this section is to give a tax break to people who earn income from sport and who have short earning careers. It is not to compensate people who give of their free time to excel at any particular sport, be it tennis, handball or golf.</P>
    <P>Many amateur sportspeople throughout the country spend hours each week in preparation for their sport. Their dedication makes them get up very early, take time off from work, attend special training courses and forego overtime and other earnings. Canoeists and many young swimmers in their teenage years get up at 5.30 a.m. to train to be good at their chosen sport.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this tax break is not to reward people for volunteering in their chosen activity, it is to reward those who earned all or part of their living from sport and paid tax. At the end of their career they will be entitled to select ten of their tax earning years and have their tax liability recomputed. If they paid no tax in those years, they will not get any back tax. For example, if they had at their disposal the services of an excellent accountant like Senator Bonner, who organised their affairs in such a way that they did not have to pay tax, this tax break would be of no use. Many sportspeople, such as boxers, rugby players, soccer players and jockeys, who earn money from their sport have a very short earning career. In most instances advancing years means retirement from the sport and in many cases injury means premature retirement. The purpose of this provision is to allow for their tax liabilities to be recomputed at the end of their careers.</P>
    <P>While other jurisdictions do not have tax reliefs such as this, they allow people to average their income over a number of years so as to ensure they do not have to meet all their tax liabilities in one year. I know many people who tried to make a living from their sport, but at the age of 23 or 24 years had to retire from it. They did not do their leaving certificate, nor did they pursue a profession. As a result they had no career to look forward to and ended up in menial jobs. They gave great enjoyment to us all for a short period of their lives during which time they also had to pay a lot of tax. This scheme attempts to give them a break. It is designed to be of benefit at the end of their careers, when it may be better appreciated.</P>
    <P>The provision cannot be extended to amateur sportspeople, including those involved in the GAA, because they are not paid. If the GAA or any other organisation decides to pay its players, they will automatically qualify under the scheme. The provision refers to footballers, it does not specify that they should be soccer, rugby or gaelic <Col N="960" /> players. However, if it was extended to amateur sportspeople, it would mean, for example, that someone like Senator Bonner, who was an excellent gaelic footballer, would, on retirement from his sport, be able to claim tax relief on the earnings from his chartered accountancy practice. I know of two eminent barristers who played gaelic football for their counties. Is it suggested that they should get tax relief on their earnings as barristers? Does anybody suggest that prominent amateur sportspeople who become Deputies should be able to claim tax relief on their Oireachtas salaries?</P>
    <P>If a person is reimbursed reasonable expenses for travelling to matches and so on, the Revenue Commissioners do not pursue him or her. However, a tax liability will apply to the reimbursement of unreasonable expenses as that implies that a profit element has been incorporated. That applies across the income tax code.</P>
    <P>Senator Bonner pointed out that the provision applies only to those who are tax resident in this country. One of my purposes in introducing it is to encourage sportspeople to reside in Ireland. Charles Haughey's introduction of a similar measure for artists in the 1960s encouraged artists to relocate in Ireland and has given the country a very good name. If sportspeople wish to reside in this country, they will be able to avail of this tax relief. They would also pay income tax at the rate of 42%. The provision may encourage Irish sportspeople to be tax resident here.</P>
    <P>Senator Bonner mentioned rugby and soccer players. The provision will apply to soccer players because, owing to the diligence of the Revenue Commissioners, most soccer clubs make PAYE returns on players registered as employees. Others are on contract and would be paid on a self-employed basis.</P>
    <P>Senator Rory Kiely and others referred to the position of the GAA. As Minister, I have been generous to the GAA. In 1998 I was heavily criticised from the expected quarters when I gave £20 million for the redevelopment of Croke Park. The allocation was spread over three years in payments of £7 million, £7 million and £6 million. However, I announced it as one sum because I knew I would be heavily criticised from the same quarters, regardless of whether I gave £1 or £20 million. When we do the same for other organisations the same rules do not apply, but official Ireland gets very exacerbated when the GAA receives anything. The best comment on the debate at the time appeared in a letter to one of the national newspapers. The correspondent pointed out that according to his calculations, in the three years from the awarding of the grant, approximately £50 billion would be given by the Government to public services. He went on to say he now understood that the GAA was responsible for homelessness, low social welfare payments, accident and emergency problems in the hospitals and hospital waiting lists because it had received £20 million, whereas the balance of £49,980 million was of no consequence.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="961" />I am well aware of the criticisms that can be made when anything is done for the GAA, but it is unreasonable to expect the tax code to reward people for giving up their free time. If the GAA or any other amateur organisation wants to reimburse its members, it is a matter for it. Senator Bonner referred to the leasing proposal made by Senator Doyle and his party. It is not practicable.</P>
    <P>Some years ago I wondered if it was possible to introduce a tax regime to honour sportspeople. When I mentioned it in my Department it was pointed out that a predecessor had considered the idea but did not pursue it. I decided that this provision was the most appropriate way to proceed and hope it will be a success.</P>
    <P>I am not in a position to advise the GAA on how it should deal with the remuneration issue. I am aware of the arguments made by Senator Bonner and others. Like him, I believe that people will want to wear their county jersey, irrespective of the cost. I know many people throughout the country who have sacrificed businesses, family and personal relationships to pursue their chosen career and never got any payment. People like Senator Rory Kiely have been involved in the GAA for a lifetime and given up many of their free hours for the love of the game. As far as I am concerned, that continues to be the situation.</P>
    <P>I missed Senator Bonner's nice remarks yesterday. He and I were in school together and played sports alongside one another as well as against each other. We had such enthusiasm for sport that even if we had to pay to take part, we would <Col N="962" /> have and I think that almost all people who play sports would share this attitude.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed with Senator Kiely's contribution. Of course this proposal is flawed; the Opposition's proposals are always flawed, because we do not have the backup services that are available to the Government. We have put forward this proposal on principle and I thought that people would support us on this. I know that Senator Bonner, in his heart, supports it. However, when I call the vote, his heart will go one way and his feet the other.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 14 is essentially an anti-avoidance mechanism. It inserts a new section, 409C, into the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, for <Col N="963" /> the purpose of restricting the use, by passive investors, of relief under section 482 of that Act. This relief is available in respect of expenditure on the repair, maintenance or restoration of certain buildings by the owner or occupier of such buildings. The buildings concerned are those which have been determined by the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands to be of significant scientific, historical, architectural or aesthetic interest and determined by the Revenue Commissioners to have reasonable public access.</P>
      <P>The way that relief is given is to treat the amount of such expenditure as an amount of loss in a trade which under the Tax Acts can be used to reduce a person's income liable to income tax. Subject to certain transitional arrangements an individual, who as a result of participating in a passive investment scheme claims relief under section 482 as owner of such a building, will be limited to &euro;31,750 in the amount by which he or she can reduce his or her taxable income. Broadly, a passive investment scheme is defined as arrangements under which:</P>
      <P>A person (who will make a claim under section 482 as owner) takes an interest in a building from its original owner;</P>
      <P>At that time, or in the next five years, the building is determined to be an approved building for the purposes of section 482; and</P>
      <P>The arrangements are such that the original owner has influence over how expenditure on the building is to be incurred; or, the original owner is entitled to participate in the tax benefits; or the original owner may reacquire the interest.</P>

      <P>I move recommendation No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 29, before section 16, but in Chapter 3, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;16.&ndash;Section 45(I)(iii) (Donations to approved bodies, etc) of the Finance Act, 2001, is hereby amended by the insertion of &ldquo;or shares, property or other investments whose value is not less than &euro;100&rdquo; after &ldquo;sums of money amounting to at least £200.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This recommendation is due to a letter all Members received from the Irish Charities Tax Reform Group which asked that the Finance Act, 2001, be amended to reduce the minimum level <Col N="964" /> for an individual donation to a charity from &euro;250 to &euro;100. The vast majority of donations received by the sector are in the &euro;65 to &euro;125 bracket which, as the law stands, are not tax effective, either for the donor or the institution concerned. The group also asked that the legislation be changed to extend the meaning of the relevant donation from cash only to cover gifts and donations of non-cash assets such as shares, securities, property and other investments.</P>
    <P>The Minister said yesterday that a number of Members had raised the issue on Second Stage. I have tabled this recommendation as requested by the Irish Charities Tax Reform Group. If the Minister is not prepared to accept it, I ask him to look favourably on it in next year's Finance Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>This recommendation has been well explained by Senator Doyle. Despite the great increase in incomes in recent years, there has not been a great increase in the amounts people are giving to charity. This recommendation is to take account of the fact that donations are perhaps at a lower level for those charities which would benefit. The Minister should take account of the fact that most of what is allowed will not cover most of the donations made and reduce the level to &euro;100.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I also spoke about this matter yesterday following receipt of the letter from the charities organisation. The lower one goes the more likely one is to get claims. Perhaps administratively that is the reason the level is in place. While I cannot support the recommendation, the Minister indicated yesterday that he would look at the matter again. I asked a question about subscriptions to the church &ndash; if subscriptions are over &euro;250, they are eligible for tax relief and if the limit was &euro;100, the church would be in a position to gain more. My local church in Dungloe is newly designed by modern architects, but the roof must be replaced after less than 30 years. People would gladly give additional money if there was tax relief. It would be a great way to encourage local people to contribute more money to reroofing the church. I agree with this, in principle, and hope the Minister will look at the matter again before next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The first recommendation proposes to allow income tax or corporation tax relief for donations of non-cash items to charities, while the second proposes reducing the minimum qualifying donation from the current level of &euro;250 to &euro;100. Regarding the donation of non-cash items, under existing law donations must be in the form of money in order to attract income tax or corporation tax relief. Capital gains tax relief does apply at present to a non-cash item donated to a charity. In such cases the donor is exempt from CGT on making the donation while the charity is also exempt from the tax in the event of the subsequent disposal of the item for cash and it uses the proceeds for charitable purposes. <Col N="965" /> I am not prepared to go further than this at present.</P>
      <P>There could be difficulties with income tax or corporation tax relief, for example, when the value of an unusual donation is open to question. No such difficulties arise when the donation is in the form of money. In addition, the means whereby the relief is given in the case of a PAYE donor presupposes the individual has paid income tax to the value of the relief being claimed. While there is some prospect that this is so when the donation is in the form of money, such relief may be broken where non-cash items are involved.</P>
      <P>Regarding the second recommendation, I have given some thought to the idea of reducing the <i>de minimis </i>amount. I have also received representations from the Irish Charities Tax Reform Group on this point. However, I have decided against making any change for the time being for the following reasons. The relief is already very generous, being at the taxpayer's marginal rate of tax. For an individual donor this could be as high as 42%. A reduction in the minimum donation would have the effect of increasing the number of donations qualifying for relief and be costly to the Exchequer. Donations in any year may be on a cumulative basis. Therefore, a monthly donation of &euro;20 would qualify for the relief.</P>
      <P>This new scheme of tax relief for donations has only been operational for about one year. While I understand the desire of those concerned to have the lower limit reduced further, I am not aware that the &euro;250 limit has had any negative impact on the level of donations to charities. The Irish Charities Tax Reform Group has informed my officials that charities have found the new relief very useful in obtaining donations.</P>
      <P>I am also concerned that any reduction in the minimum donation could significantly increase the administrative burden on the Revenue Commissioners in dealing with a large number of small claims, particularly regarding donations made by the PAYE sector, which would have to be claimed by charities at year's end. The cost to the Exchequer of the donation scheme, as expanded last year, will not be known until after the end of the current year and any reduction in the minimum qualifying donation would increase the cost to the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>In summary, as a scheme of tax relief for individual donations to charities was only brought forward last year, it seems much too early to make the kinds of changes being proposed. For these reasons I am not prepared to accept the recommendations at this time.</P>

      <P>I imagine there would be. Some years ago I reduced it to its present limit. It was £250,000 or &euro;370,500 and I decided to increase it. It had been reduced some years ago because the recommendation was to target BES schemes at small businesses, which was what they were originally intended for. Before making the changes the BES scheme was being used very effectively, but for non-risk business activities other than small businesses. I believed reducing it to a lower level would target it where it was desired to impact in the first place. I have now decided, after the recommendations of others, that the limit is a bit low and have decided to increase it to &euro;750,000. I suspect there will be a considerable level of increased interest since the level was reduced, but I do not want it to be too high as the reason I reduced it in the first place in my second Finance Act was to target those small businesses in need of BES-type schemes. I imagine there will be considerable interest again now that the limit has been upped.</P>

      <P>I have only introduced five budgets but seven Finance Bills. I introduced a second Finance Act in 1998 on foot of the Bacon recommendations and a second in the year 2000 on foot of the other Bacon recommendations. Most items in both Bacon reports related to increases in supply, but some fiscal changes were also recommended. The Government decided on further changes. This led to second Finance Acts. We changed stamp duty regulations, increased relief and so on. The whole purpose of Government policy in this area was to allow first-time buyers an opportunity to get a foothold in the market in which we deemed it correct at the time to interfere. I decided at the end of last year that <Col N="967" /> the market had become very flat and that it was necessary to get the investor back in, so I have allowed interest relief again. I have, more or less, gone back to the position in all these areas which pertained when we started.</P>
      <P>There are lots of lessons to be learnt in this area by everybody. The main lesson is that it is quite dangerous to interfere in the open market.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for the changes he made to the town and urban renewal schemes in relation to rental rather than owner-occupied properties. In each of the Minister's Finance Bills, I have sought a rural renewal scheme for west Donegal. Five towns in west Donegal were selected under the town renewal scheme but, to be quite blunt, it has been a disaster in Donegal. Towns only 20 or 30 miles outside Dublin were entitled to the same reliefs as backward places in west Donegal where the population has declined over the years. To regenerate the west coast of Donegal, I am looking for the same rural renewal scheme as that brought in for the Upper Shannon basin. I know there will be difficulties until that scheme is finished.</P>
      <P>Again I ask the Minister for such a scheme and I hope he will be here this time next year. Maybe at that stage he will be in a position to consider it. A rural renewal scheme incorporating tourism projects should be introduced. I know many other counties along the west coast will be pushing for such a scheme but I am using this opportunity to ensure this is kept at the top of the Minister's agenda.</P>

      <P>Senator Bonner has raised the problem of west Donegal in each of my Finance Bills. As he rightly pointed out, he has pressed the case for extending the rural renewal scheme to west Donegal. The Upper Shannon rural renewal scheme was one of my initiatives and it has worked very effectively in the area encompassed by it. It is a pilot scheme which has been quite effective in some parts of the Upper Shannon area. Some areas have done better than others. I have extended the deadline to 2004 but it is the intention that it be reviewed long before that. We will then consider the possibility or the desirability of extending similar initiatives to other parts of the country. I would be loath to give a commitment at this stage that there will be a continuation of a similar type scheme in the future because that is a matter which will be the subject of consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="968" />I have stuck with the area I defined on the first day and I have not extended it by a millimetre. We drew the line on the basis of electoral divisions which have been in place for 100 years or so and bear no relationship to towns and so on. Unfortunately, I divided Deputy Mattie Brennan's parish in half. Deputy Brennan is retiring at this election, not on account of what I did to his parish but because he has decided it is time to step down. I have not been able to accommodate Deputy Brennan who is a long-standing friend of mine.</P>
    <P>Parts of Ireland need incentivisation. How we go about it in the future is open to consideration on foot of what we learn from this project. Places like west Donegal, parts of Mayo, parts of Cork and many other areas need something to encourage development. It is an open question, which has to be further debated, as to whether the tax system should always be the way to do something in this regard. I do not know the answer. Incentives brought in over the years, including the urban and rural renewal schemes and the various other things I have done, have certainly inspired people to do things they would not have done before. People seem to want to do anything rather than pay tax to the Collector General. They would prefer to invest in any type of scheme and get a tax break. Maybe that is not just an Irish phenomenon but it is certainly true in regard to the seaside resort renewal scheme, the urban renewal scheme, the town renewal scheme and the various other schemes.</P>

I know it is outside the scope of this provision but it appears people who make a contribution of that kind will be able to get a tax break as a result. Is that the case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the scheme is exactly as the Senator has pointed out and it is modelled on the changes I made to charities tax relief last year. If one gives a donation to a sports body for a capital project, one will get a tax break but the project must be certified by the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation as a capital project &ndash; in other words, one cannot get a tax break for ordinary membership of a GAA, golf or tennis club; it must be for a capital project. The capital project must not be of a value greater than &euro;40 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My only reason for doing that was to remove any controversy, that is, that we were bringing in some relief which would go to Campus Stadium Ireland. Whenever it goes ahead, it will cost in excess of &euro;40 million. If a person made a contri<Col N="970" /> bution to a capital project such as that and if it was less than &euro;40 million, they would be entitled to a tax break if they were a tax resident. If one is not a tax resident, the tax break does not apply.</P>
    <P>I hope this section is used by many sports bodies, and GAA clubs in particular, to raise money. There are many things in this Bill, including this, that merit more attention and publicity because they are innovative and will help sports organisations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>In most other EU countries there are alternative methods of computing corporation tax for shipping companies. Companies can opt for the traditional profit and loss account or tonnage tax methods. The case for Ireland adopting the tonnage tax method has been put to me for a number of years. The European Commission proposed this and said it does not contravene state aid regulations. I did not introduce this in previous Finance Bills because the European Commission regards us as having an aggressive corporation tax regime. However, I decided to introduce it in this Bill. Under the tonnage tax method a company can compute its profits based on tonnage and then apply the rate of corporation tax to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Alternatively, a company can opt for the traditional profit and loss method. This was introduced to try to ensure that Irish flag carriers are registered here. Other European countries found that their flag carriers were being registered in non-EU countries and they were losing their fleets. The same thing was going to happen in Ireland. Despite the complexity of the system, the shipping companies pressed for it for some time and welcomed its introduction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the tonnage system option for the shipping industry. Tonnage also plays a very important part in the fishing industry. The Minister said this has been introduced to standardise our regulations with those across Europe. Perhaps the Department of Finance, or the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources, could examine how the fishing industry is being treated across Europe. Our fishing industry is being strangled by the tonnage and quota rules implemented by the European Commission. We note from afar how the Dutch and <Col N="971" /> Spanish fishing industries are treated. We feel they are being treated separately and the rules are not fully implemented, unlike in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The volatile level of the price of fish makes an argument both for and against the tonnage tax system. If income or corporation tax was based on the tonnage, one would know what one would have to pay on an annual basis. Tonnage is now the basis on which our fleets are allowed to catch fish. I would like the Minister to examine the extension of this option to fishing trawlers. Unfortunately, there are only one or two Members of the Oireachtas who fight the fishing industry's case.</P>
      <P>The Minister introduced the seafarer's allowance some time ago. At the time I pushed for the extension of the £5,000 allowance to fishing boat crew members. Many of them are on fishing trawlers far from home for weeks on end and engaging in activity that is much more dangerous and intrusive on their lives than those involved in the shipping industry. The Minister could not extend that allowance at the time and I ask him to consider doing so now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I note the Senator's comments and I am sure he has made them known to the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources. I am afraid it is not possible to extend the tonnage tax to the fishing industry. It does not apply in any other EU country and I can envisage all kinds of state aid complications. We are in enough trouble with the EU in such matters without bringing more on our heads. The purpose of the tonnage tax is to keep EU shipping companies internationally competitive. We have not been the initiators in this but we have initiated many other corporation and capital gains tax schemes. I wanted to take my time in introducing this so that we would not look even more aggressive in this area.</P>
      <P>I am sure there are many parts of the tax code that I have changed and many other things I have done that I should regret, but I do not. The introduction of the seafarers' allowance of £5,000 is one area that I am half sorry I ever touched. I have been inundated with requests from many groups seeking special allowances for their professions. Seafarer's allowance or similar schemes are available in other countries. The original purpose of our seafarer's allowance was to assist people working on ferries. It was not intended to involve fishermen. If I am pressed much further on this, I will abolish it.</P>

      <P>I have no difficulty with the purpose of this section, particularly as it is being brought in on a phased basis. I always thought it was unfair to sole traders that they had to pay their taxes half way through the year whereas companies had an additional six months after the year end. I presume the filing date for companies remains nine months after the year end.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised the issue of file and pay returns for sole traders two years ago but the bullet is about to hit its target in the coming tax year. In principle I have no difficulty with it on an ongoing basis. It must be remembered that all accountancy practices are not Arthur Andersen or KPMG and that there are only a certain number of qualified staff who can complete certain aspects of tax returns. The difficulty I have is that smaller practices have a cross section of account types. There are company accounts, which have a filing date of nine months after the year end. They can arrive at any time during the tax year. In my accountancy practice I occasionally used different accounts dates for the benefit of the taxpayer. In general, the account date for all small sole traders is 31 March. This year we are changing our professionals to 31 December to ensure they get the best possible relief on their withholding tax or get credit on an actual basis.</P>
      <P>We are still left with small clients and they make up the majority of customers in a small practice. I do not intend to change any of those to 31 December. Otherwise we would have no work for two or three months. I intend to leave them. That will not be a difficulty in the long term because the 31 March accounts will fall within the following tax year.</P>
      <P>We will have a problem in October this year in that if I attempt to keep my company returns going in the same way and change my professional clients to December, I will not be able to cope at the same time with the smaller accounts. I realise that we have nine months from the 31 December filing date, but, in principle, they must all be filed by 31 March. We cannot physically do the accounts now due until March, which only gives us a few months to prepare the returns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Also, returns this year have to be filed with the Revenue Commissioners, whereas before we dealt with the local tax district offices which always gave a certain leeway when there was a December filing date because of the unsocial aspect, but this year the tendency has been to enforce the law. Under the tax Act, one has up to 30 days to file a late return where before one has been up to date. The summer holidays are upon us and I have a Seanad election, as the Minister knows. Therefore, most small practitioners will be in a terrible heap. I ask him, therefore, that the filing of returns to 31 January be accepted just for this year. We do not seek to obstruct the system, but it is not possible for small practices to cope. There will not be a difficulty the following tax year as the accounts date will <Col N="973" /> fall on 31 March. I hope the Minister will advise me that there will be leniency. Small taxpayers carry a 5% or 10% penalty, which is much more harsh on them than on larger taxpayers who can afford to pay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is aimed at bringing forward the payment date for corporation tax and brings it into line with that in other EU and OECD countries. It has a cash flow benefit and will be introduced in stages over the next five years because of the considerable amount of money involved. I also introduced the provision that small companies can base their tax returns on the figure for the previous year or 90% of that for the current year. Most choose the previous year.</P>
      <P>The Senator referred to the new pay and file dates for self-employed persons. I worked in a small practice and heard from my partner about the problems that will ensue because of this. As the Senator said, 31 October is a good date and, if administered properly, will stop people coping with different dates as they will have completed everything on the one date. It is the first year and I recognise that there will be problems for staff, but matters will improve with time. In ten years' time there will probably be an earlier pay and file date as in the United States it is 15 April.</P>
      <P>There were discussions with the Tax Emolument Liaison Council about flexibility, but we have written the date into law. The Revenue Commissioners will exercise flexibility after 31 October, but it will not be a question of months. I know from my own experience as a practitioner and as Minister for Finance that if I gave any specific guideline beyond a certain date, that would become the new deadline. I remember the work that had to be done in 1988 when the McSharry interest amnesty carried a 30 September deadline which allowed all taxpayers to get their accounts up to date. That was also the first year that returns had to be filed by 31 December, which was extended to 31 January because accountants had worked from July to September to meet the first deadline and then for the following three months. I remember working to 2 a.m. or 3 a.m. and over Christmas to meet the deadlines. There will be flexibility for a short period. I do not have any good news for the Senator or my partner because I must start on some date. There will be problems the first year. The Revenue Commissioners have been given a lot of extra work to do in recent years, from tax credits to realigning the tax year with the calendar year, and they, too, will be in a heap.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I remember the Senator's last question now. It was about filing returns with the Office of the Collector General. The reason for this is that under the new pay and file date arrangements, more emphasis will be given to the cheque. A new form is being designed to accommodate those who want to pay earlier and have the cheque cashed or to pay by direct debit on that date. If it was done through the local tax offices, cheques would be issued everywhere. It was decided, therefore, to deal with all cheques in the one place. There is a production line set up in the Office of the Collector General where forms will be dealt with efficiently. If someone wants to make an early return, however, it can be sent to the local tax office by 31 July.</P>
      <P>My own experience is that all small traders wait until the very end to get their accounts done and, even if they are done earlier, they will not sign them until the end of January. I hope to force practitioners' clients to choose the earlier date as a lot of difficulty was caused on 31 January, as it will on 31 October. People must get used to having accounts done and sent in on time, which will help practitioners. I predict that in five years' time it will operate smoothly. The statistics show that a colossal percentage of returns are filed in January every year. This must change. As I said, this will help practitioners and avoid the situation, which I know well, where completed accounts are left for months because the client will not sign them since he or she wants to wait until the last moment. The Revenue Commissioners will exercise discretion, but I am not inserting a date into law. This reflects my blunt and crude way of doing many things.</P>

      <P>In all seriousness, I speak for all accountants. We all had accounts that were held to be sent in at the end of January, but which will now be sent in in the last days of October. I refer to small clients, fee payers, on whom we have built our businesses, but who do not have their accounts done. Whatever the Minister may say, my staff and that of every other accountant have a huge workload. Like the Minister, I have been at this game for 30 years and in that time the accountants always got the brunt of the workload in terms of implementing these changes. All I am asking is that this year we are given a little leeway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the issue of the file and pay forms going to the Collector General, that is the same as the bogus tax account returns made in November. I <Col N="975" /> was able to leave in some forms to that office the day before the final date simply because I was due to come to the Seanad, but I had to send one client of mine in a taxi to Dublin that evening to ensure she had her forms in the office in O'Connell Street by 12 o'clock. Practices in the west face many more difficulties because we have to make arrangements. We are given until 12 o'clock on 31 October to file with the Collector General and if someone is living in Limerick, like Senator Kiely, they can walk into the office but one has to drive from Donegal to Limerick. People will probably be given one or two days' leeway with the postal system but the local tax office was much handier for practising accountants.</P>

    <P>The reason for this recommendation, as I am sure the Minister is aware, is that the issue of whether the Bank of Ireland and AIB should merge has <Col N="976" /> suddenly come into the public arena and there has been fairly widespread public debate about it.

A merger of this sort would be monstrous in financial terms and also in Irish terms. The Tánaiste, as the Minister will know, has already given the thumbs down to this particular merger but it is much more important that we hear the views of the Minister for Finance and the Government speaking with one voice and letting us know that this merger is a political non-runner and the Government will frown upon it.</P>
    <P>The reasons are apparent. There are two protections in-built in the system against such a merger, but they are not absolute unless we have Government disapproval. If the Government was to give its blessing to such a monstrous merger, I suggest there might be a possibility of it getting through. The two safeguards we have are the Competition Authority, and we recently had a much strengthened Competition Bill, and the European Commission. The reason the Competition Authority will show an immediate interest in this &ndash; the Director of the Competition Authority recently spoke about this very issue in theoretical terms, which obviously could be translated into practical terms &ndash; is because if such a merger was allowed, approved or encouraged by the Government, the Bank of Ireland and AIB would have 80% of the crucial and sensitive markets which would affect virtually every consumer in this country.</P>
    <P>I refer, first, to the very lucrative credit card market and, second, to the transaction markets, cheques and current accounts. Everybody knows that credit cards are highly lucrative for the bank and extremely penal to the consumer. If the duopoly that exists in the credit card market, which charges absurd rates above 18%, is allowed to become a monopoly, there will be no competition and these guys will run riot. I say that in a measured fashion because we know the way the banks have already behaved in this and other markets. They behaved disgracefully towards the consumer and the same week this suggestion was made the European Commission found that they were running a cartel. If a cartel becomes a monopoly, the situation will become worse. We would have a monster, with no competition, ruling the Irish retail banking market and it is important that the Government, and not just the Tánaiste, gives a thumbs down to a proposal of this sort.</P>
    <P>As evidence of the European Commission's office interest in such an area, I cite the case of <Col N="977" /> two Swedish banks which wished to merge last year. They were the second and the fifth largest Swedish banks, but they were stymied by the European Commission. They had just under 50% of these markets to which I referred but, nevertheless, it was considered they would have an unacceptable domination in those markets and the merger was stopped. It is important, therefore, that the two biggest banks in Ireland should not be allowed to take 80% of the market.</P>
    <P>The arguments for the merger, as put forward by the only person who proposed it but who, because he is in such a powerful position in the Bank of Ireland, must be taken seriously, are that one large bank worth approximately &euro;25 billion, as opposed to two banks worth approximately &euro;12 billion each, would be able to protect itself more easily against predators from overseas because it would have more muscle, be more expensive to buy and be in a better position because of its diversification geographically.</P>
    <P>That does not make sense to me because that is the old fashioned idea that for some reason it is better for the banking system to have, as its principal player, one big Irish bank rather than two foreign banks. If we know anything about the behaviour of Irish banks, it is that they would behave far worse than two foreign banks if they were to come in and offer competition. I would prefer if the Bank of Ireland and AIB were taken over and run by, say, the Royal Bank of Scotland or some other bank than for them to merge and take advantage of their utterly dominant position whereby there would be no competition in the market. That is a menacing prospect.</P>
    <P>It would not only affect the retail area. We talked already about stockbroking. Bank of Ireland and AIB own the two biggest stockbrokers in Ireland. Imagine what would happen if Davy's and Goodbody's were merged. That would mean that one company would take the lion's share of the corporate stockbroking business. The launches to which Senator Doyle referred would almost inevitably go to that one company. There would be no competition. There would be very little competition in the insurance market because of the dominance such a merged company would have there. There would be very little competition in the investment management market because Bank of Ireland Asset Management, which was very successful recently, and AIBIM, which is not so successful, would be forced to merge. One conglomerate would rule nearly all the financial markets as well. That is a dangerous prospect. It is not only dangerous for customers but in stockbroking there would be a danger regarding the charges and commissions to customers in that there would be no competition in the area of commissions.</P>
    <P>Such a prospect would not only be dangerous for customers, it would have a political dimension which no government can ignore. A merger of this sort would involve massive branch closures, what is called rationalisation. There would be no sense in it. In every town where there is one Bank <Col N="978" /> of Ireland branch and one AIB branch, one of those branches would be closed. That is what is called achieving synergies. If that were to happen, it would mean more unemployment. A large number of people would be unnecessarily laid off. Loss of competition means less work in the long term and certainly in this situation.</P>
    <P>I should remind the Minister that the green card played as the support for this floated idea is the worse card in light of the fact that the only banks that have introduced competition in the market recently are foreign ones. The most obvious example is the Bank of Scotland, not the Royal Bank of Scotland. When the Bank of Scotland came into the mortgage market here, it caused a furore because the old cartel had to get up off its backside and cut its mortgages and it did so. The first threat was posed to it when the Bank of Scotland came into the market. That was welcome and everybody was delighted when a foreign bank forced the banks here to do something to help the retail client, the poor mortgage payer who had been screwed by the banks for so long. If we were to permit a merger of this sort, there would be no way that a small foreign bank could enter the market here in a small way and do that.</P>
    <P>I also remind the Minister that he wisely sold ACC and ICC to overseas banks. He wisely said, &ldquo;Let them come in and if anybody will introduce competition, they will do so.&rdquo; I presume he sold the banks to the highest bidder, which was the right thing to do. On that occasion there was no reluctance to sell two Irish State banks to overseas outsiders. I hope in this instance there would be no reluctance on the part of the Government to sell to anyone overseas who would act in the interests of the consumer.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I do not think that will happen. The chief executive of the Bank of Ireland should have thought a little more carefully before he floated this idea because the obstacles are probably greater than he thought. Having come from Australia and having been there a long time, he may not have been aware of the strength of the teeth of the European Commission and the Competition Authority. It is important that a clear statement should be made by the Government that we are open to competition from abroad, that we are not fearful of foreign banks coming in and that we have no particular fear of the fact that AIB or Bank of Ireland may be taken over. That is the modern world in which we live. We cannot any longer say the green card will work and we want to be in control of our own banks. Our banks have behaved disgracefully. In the modern world there are takeovers every day of one bank by another.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to make a statement to the House on this matter or to promise to report back on this issue because it is so important in light of what is happening in the banking world and in light of the fact that the Irish consumer has been crucified for so long.</P>

      <P>Yes, that is true. I accept what the Senator said, that the merger of two major banks would not be in the interests of a number of people he mentioned, insurance companies, stockbrokers, and particularly the customer. The Senator referred to possible bank branch closures. The banks have a bad record of closing branches throughout the country. The issue of the Bank of Ireland and AIB closing branches in towns and cities was debated in the House. If the two banks were to merge, there would a great number of branch closures. For that reason, such a merger would not in the interests of the consumer or the taxpayer.</P>

      <P>I also take this opportunity to agree wholeheartedly with everything Senator Ross said. We have debated this matter on many occasions, particularly during Private Members' time. I have not yet heard Senator Ross rant or rave when it comes to debates on financial matters. I must agree that I am of one mind with him on most occasions on such matters, but there may be other matters on which he rants and raves.</P>
      <P>Before he made the point, I was thinking that I would prefer the Royal Bank of Scotland to take over the AIB, rather than the Bank of Ireland and AIB to merge. Bad and all as is the service customers currently get from their banks, if those two banks were to merge the ordinary punter using the local branch would not get a service &ndash; the service would be given to the big customers. I support fully what Senator Ross said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>While there had been some discussion in the middle 1980s to the effect that AIB and Bank of Ireland should merge, no concrete serious proposal for such a merger has been put on the table. In the circumstances the matter has not been put to the Government for consideration and the Government has not adopted a policy stance as to what its response to such a proposal would be. Given the range of permutations for possible combinations among financial entities, it would hardly be productive for Government to spend its time drawing up contingency positions for situations that might never occur.</P>
      <P>In any event, the issue might not be one solely for the Irish authorities, Government or otherwise, to adjudicate upon. Any proposed merger by large financial institutions would almost certainly have to be considered by the EU Commission, to assess its impact on competition in a European perspective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy <Col N="980" /> Harney, has said she would oppose such a merger on competition grounds. National authorities have a clear interest in ensuring a small number of financial institutions do not achieve an overly dominant position in the local banking market. The Government also has to have regard to the possible adverse employment implications.</P>
    <P>The legislative position that would arise in the case of the merger referred to by the Senators is not clearcut. As I mentioned, European law also comes into the equation and various domestic legislative provisions would come into play. Holders of banking licences are exempt from competition legislation at present, but this does not mean that their non-banking business is exempt. It is possible that the Competition Authority would become involved in the implications for the insurance business of banks of any proposed takeover or merger. As the Competition Bill, 2001, removes the exemption, a banking merger will not be different from any other when it becomes law.</P>
    <P>The takeover or partial acquisition of a bank is addressed in Chapter 6 of the Central Bank Act, 1989, which deals with acquiring transactions. The approval of the Central Bank is required for the acquisition of any holding of more than 10% of a bank. The approval of the Minister for Finance is required if the assets of a licence holder who controls more than 20% of the assets of all licence holders in the State are being acquired. The Minister can consent if he or she is satisfied that the Central Bank's decision to approve or refuse is in the interests of the orderly and proper regulation of banking and that the proposed acquisition will come within the provision of legislation dealing with mergers and takeovers. The Minister should consult the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and other Ministers, as considered appropriate. The Minister can refuse consent if he or she considers that the exigencies of the common good so warrant.</P>
    <P>Would a merger between the two national banks be in the national interest? The national champion argument is based on the premise that it is of strategic importance to Ireland to have a strong Irish owned bank, capable of competing in a pan-European market. A similar issue was dealt with by the Commission in a recent case involving the proposed merger of two Swedish banks. In its initial statement of objection, the Commission analysed the impact of the merger purely in terms of the national market, not based on the pan-European market. I understand the Swedish merger will not proceed.</P>
    <P>Should we strive to prevent foreign ownership of Irish banks? It is sometimes argued that a merger between the Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Bank would pre-empt a foreign takeover of one of the banks. As the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has pointed out, however, more than half of the shares in AIB are owned outside the State. One could claim that on this basis it is difficult to sustain the argument that foreign ownership, in itself, is harmful to <Col N="981" /> Irish interests. As the two banks have their headquarters here, their outlook and orientation could be expected to be more in tune with the needs of the domestic economy and enterprise. A balance needs to be struck between this obvious advantage and the other benefits of a competitive banking market.</P>
    <P>The merger referred to in this recommendation raises many issues, some of which would also arise if a large foreign based bank was to make a bid for one of the banks involved. As I have indicated, the legislative position is quite complicated and will evolve as the Competition Bill is enacted. I put it to the House that the Government will address this issue if and when it arises in a thorough and comprehensive manner, with full regard to all relevant factors. I welcome a debate on the possibility of a merger, as someone who knows that an argument other than that made by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Senators Ross, Joe Doyle and Bonner courts the possibility of utter public odium. As I spent 25 years courting such odium, I am not likely to be influenced by it now.</P>
    <P>The Government has not taken a position on a merger between the Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Bank and will not do as it would be ridiculous, given the many possible permutations and combinations. I do not breach Cabinet confidentiality by saying it has not been discussed by the Government in my time in office, to the best of my recollection. I am certain that a debate on the matter has not been initiated during this Administration. I can safely say, however, that the feelings of my Government colleagues would be the same as those expressed by Senator Ross and others this afternoon. I am confident that a poll of Members of the Oireachtas would reveal that they are all in the same camp.</P>
    <P>I welcome this debate as a means of raising other important issues. I attempted to raise these issues some years ago when I established a strategic review of banking in my Department. Its report touched on the issue of a merger of Ireland's two largest banks. As part of the build-up to the debate, I established an internal working group comprising officials from the Central Bank and my Department. The group's report was not too favourably disposed to the merger. I was disappointed that the strategic review did not lead to a wider debate on many banking issues at the time as I had hoped.</P>
    <P>It is desirable that the possibility of a merger be debated as an important issue, if not the most important, but it is perhaps unfortunate that the group chief executive of the Bank of Ireland, Mr. Soden, proposed it at this time. I cannot criticise him, however, as throughout my political career I have raised certain matters despite being told not to do so. Senator Bonner was not in the House during my years of political wilderness in Fianna Fáil, when I was told, &ldquo;You should not bring up this issue, it is the wrong time, it will cause consternation and the party will be brought to its knees.&rdquo; I have been told all my life that it is the <Col N="982" /> wrong time to make certain political decisions, including by the various <i>éminences grises</i> in the Department of Finance. I have never been deterred by those who have said that it is the wrong time to bring forward a proposal.</P>
    <P>Mr. Soden might be blamed for bringing up this matter at an inopportune time. The only time I met him was on the morning he was appointed to his position, when Mr. Crowley, the Governor of the Bank of Ireland, brought him to see me as a courtesy call. Mr. Soden seemed to be a pleasant individual, but we did not discuss mergers or anything else. His background is in the southern hemisphere and I suspect he has been influenced by his experiences there. This leads me to believe that events in the southern hemisphere in recent years have been particularly influential and Mr. Soden may have admitted as much in a recent interview. If he had continued to work in Ireland rather than going to Australia 20 years ago, he may not have come forward with the idea of a merger. When I established the strategic banking review I was influenced by what I had read about developments in the southern hemisphere.</P>
    <P>Most thinking in relation to this matter seems to align with that of Senator Ross who is supported by competition law. There is little chance that Mr. Soden's idea will be seen in a favourable light under EU law. It is worthy of debate, nevertheless, and the points he has made should be considered. It would be easy for me to say that I am on the side of the angels, as politicians are supposed to be in an election year, but I am too old to change the habits of a lifetime. It is important that other views are considered. I accept the points made by Senator Bonner and others. Senator Ross, who has expressed his thoughts today, and other journalists have written erudite articles on this subject in recent weeks. It is important that people are aware of all considerations and take them into account.</P>
    <P>The argument that neither the Bank of Ireland nor Allied Irish Bank is a genuinely Irish institution can legitimately be made. A proper analysis of their shareholdings would demonstrate that most shares are held by institutions outside the State. Therefore, they are not, in effect, Irish owned, although they are Irish managed. As I said in interviews at the time of the strategic review which did not attract much comment, people in southern hemisphere countries woke up one morning to discover that their banks are not managed at home. I said at the time that we will wake up some morning in 2005 or 2006 to find that Allied Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland, or whatever they are called then, are not managed in Ireland. People will ask how it happened that they came to be controlled in Germany or the United States.</P>
    <P>It might be argued whether we should have allowed it to happen rather than sleep walking into it. I set up the banking review group in 1999 so we would at least think about the issue. The group reported, but, unfortunately, there was not much debate. The report is on file and people can <Col N="983" /> examine it if they wish. This is one of the issues raised.</P>
    <P>Now that we have joined the EU and are members of the euro we no longer have control over interest rates or the value of our currency as we no longer have a currency. I have often expressed the view that in a small, open economy those tools were more valuable in theory than in practice, but at least we had them. Senator Ross has a view on the euro. We have control over budgetary policies despite efforts by our European partners to centralise such matters. However, who knows what will happen regarding such policies in ten or 20 years.</P>
    <P>If I designated County Donegal as a tax haven for building, most people would start their operations in Letterkenny because that is where activity is based. Therefore, if all of Europe is the same, one would be mad not to set up one's business near Berlin or Paris or in the UK. There are about 50 million people in the UK and almost 80 million people in Germany. Why would one bother coming to Ireland which has 3.8 million people? That is what we must guard against in terms of our European policy. To attract business, a small country like Ireland must be nimbler, more flexible, be able to do things better, have a better education system, better people, better taxation and lighter, non-repressive regulation.</P>
    <P>I used an analogy which Senator Bonner will recognise. It is hard to believe that the Senator and I played centrefield together. We were quite fast. The Senator was a better athlete than me and, if I remember correctly, he won Leinster championships at 800 metres. We played on the same team and then played against each other years later in college football. I always found that a 14 stone fit guy would run over a 10 stone fit guy. The same will be true in the European economy if everywhere is the same. We will lose out in time unless the Irish economy is more competitive, can do things differently, is nimbler, craftier, better educated or whatever. We must guard against oppressive regulation. We should have good regulation which is nimbler, better and more effective.</P>
    <P>The same principle will apply regarding banks. AIB and Bank of Ireland are big banks in Irish terms, but many of their operations are outside the country. AIB's shares have risen in value recently, but the combined capital value of the two banks would not be more than about &euro;25 billion. I think their capitalised values are about &euro;11 billion and &euro;14 billion. In European banking terms, &euro;11 billion is very small and &euro;25 billion is fairly reasonable. There is a difficulty in the Irish economy regarding technology. We wish to increase the size of the technology sector and Irish-managed banks will take that issue into account.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross is correct to point out that profit is the bottom line. I am an innate capitalist like <Col N="984" /> the Senator because it is the system which works best and creates more wealth. There are problems with capitalism. Excessive capitalism brings its own problems, but no one has found a better system. Capitalism is the best system because it responds better to the aspirations of people. Not everyone wishes to be a multimillionaire, but they might want an extra holiday, an extra day in the pub or to sit at home. The free market allows people such choices. It also creates extra wealth which can be used to help those who cannot help themselves. I am a total believer in this system.</P>
    <P>Banks operate to the bottom line which is the return to their shareholders. That is their job with which I have no difficulty. However, there is a major difference between excessive profitability and a bank which is managed somewhere else. A Government can have some influence with AIB or Bank of Ireland in particular markets or if the economy is going in a particular direction by way of a telephone call or a chat because it is in the banks' vested interests as they are based here.</P>
    <P>Senator Bonner and I have been complimentary about foreign direct investment in Ireland over the years. We are both chartered accountants and would always have felt a little aggrieved if we got nowhere having made a presentation to the IDA or Enterprise Ireland. However, if someone from the US came along with a large brochure they were welcomed with open arms and looked after. I do not know whether, like me, Senator Bonner felt that people were not treated equally. That was the case with good ideas which came before Enterprise Ireland or the county enterprise boards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The banks also deal with customers in this way. I was in Hong Kong in 1992 or 1993 as Minister with responsibility for trade and 41,000 of the 42,000 businesses there employed less than 20 people. Big is not always beautiful and one has to have a way of running a business in a manner which suits one's needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish economy has 3.8 million people and is situated in the middle of a big ocean. This is a small market with relatively small banks which have a dominant position. If banks are regulated or managed in Ireland, people working for them have a vested interest in making sure that everything goes well. It is the same as the analogy regarding the small business person and the foreign multinational. If a small business person employs 10 or 15 people, his or her house and business is mortgaged to the bank. If he or she goes down, his or her family will go down too. There is a difference in a bank which is managed in Ireland as it has a vested interest in keeping particular sectors of the Irish economy afloat. However, the same may not be the case if a small operation is owned by a US or European bank, the latter of which is more likely. In such cases, when something goes wrong in the Irish economy and we do not have control over interest rates or <Col N="985" /> other tools, we do not have a banking system which is managed here either. This issue needs to be considered.</P>
    <P>I would safely suggest that I am in a 0.01% minority in holding that view, but we should consider this issue. If this happens in seven, eight or ten years someone might suggest that it was not a good idea and highlight the fact that no one raised these questions. I thank Mr. Soden for starting the debate. I think the idea will be knocked over, but we have not had such a debate. It is a worthwhile debate, but the argument is on the side of Senator Ross and others. However, that is not to say that debating this matter was not a legitimate exercise. There are other issues which should be considered.</P>
    <P>A recent editorial in <i>Business and Finance</i> raised some of these arguments. It suggested that the obvious thing to do is to say &ldquo;no&rdquo;, but that we should also think of the other issues. That has been a good exercise. I am a great believer in the free market and in freedom of expression. I welcome this debate. I am aware of the dangers of speaking about this as I know how politics operates. It will be suggested that this is how I think. However, the worst oppression is the tyranny or fear of expressing one's opinion because it can be interpreted in a particular way. It is not political to carry on like that, but after all the difficulties I have faced, I still believe it is the proper way to be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to introduce the Communications Regulation Bill, 2002, to the House.</P>
      <P>The main purposes of the Bill are to create a commission for communications regulations; to dissolve the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation and transfer its functions to the commission; to increase substantially penalties for breaches of licence conditions by operators; and to provide for the improved management of public road openings for the purpose of laying telecommunications infrastructure.</P>
      <P>Before dealing with the details of the Bill I will outline the reasons for its introduction. The electronic communications sector has been experiencing a period of unprecedented change. During the 1990s, developments in technology, the Internet and in telecommunications services, as well as market liberalisation, enhanced the importance of the sector for economic and social development. The realisation that the sector was an indispensable building block for the development of the information society meant that it became an issue of public policy as well as a commercial opportunity. There has been substantial investment in the sector and, more recently, there has been a downturn in this investment. Confidence in the commercial health of the sector has been severely dented, but work on realising the vision of the information society must continue.</P>
      <P>The electronic communications sector remains an important building block for the development of the information society. We need a communications sector which provides competitively priced products and services to all consumers. This should be done in a way that enables operators to make a reasonable return on their investment so that they can continue to invest in the sector. They must continue to find new ways of meeting the needs of consumers in a cost effective way. The best way to achieve a vibrant electronic communication sector like this is to have effective competition among operators. This is a situation where a number of operators are competing against each other to win customers and meet their needs and where customers can switch from one operator to another when they find a lower price available or better quality on offer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The regulatory framework under which operators carry out their business has an important role to play in making this happen. For example, operators need to have low barriers to enter the market, such as the easy ability to get the facilities <Col N="988" /> they need at wholesale level at a reasonable price to enable them offer services at retail level. However, the reality can be different. It is a feature of the electronic communications sector that operators need to obtain facilities from their major competitor to compete against that competitor. There is a natural tendency, therefore, for the major competitor to protect its own competitive situation. One of the key roles for regulation of the electronic communications sector is to ensure fair competition among the operators in this situation.</P>
    <P>It may be asked why we still need such regulation over three years after full liberalisation of the sector. The reason is that there are still substantial differences in market power between operators and competition could be inhibited if there was no regulatory framework in place. Some operators continue to be dominant and abuse of that dominant position needs to be prevented. While competition laws and the powers of the Competition Authority are in place to address abuses of a dominant market position, those powers are normally invoked only after there has been a claim or evidence of an abuse. The regulatory framework for the electronic communications sector complements existing competition law by preventing abuse from happening in the first place. It is a valuable tool in a sector such as communications, where time is important. We all want to see the benefits of competition and the development of vibrant information society services sooner rather than later.</P>
    <P>Another reason we still need specific regulation is to protect the interests of users. We have moved relatively quickly from a situation of monopoly to full liberalisation and competition. In the monopoly era the counterpart to the existing exclusive privilege of providing telecommunications services was the obligation to meet the reasonable needs of all users in the country, wherever located, at an affordable price. A concern that may be expressed is that new operators may take customers from the former monopoly operator in low cost areas, leaving the former monopoly operator to supply customers in the high cost areas. A related concern expressed has been that in trying to address those threats, the former monopoly operator would raise prices charged to vulnerable consumers, who therefore would not be able to find an alternative supplier at a cheaper price. However, it is the function of the regulatory framework to protect consumer interests in this area and, notwithstanding privatisation and liberalisation, this role will continue.</P>
    <P>The task of regulating the communications sector lies with the Director of Telecommunications Regulation, Etain Doyle. I took up office on Thursday, 26 June 1997 and on Monday, 1 July 1997, she took up her post, for which she had been interviewed some months earlier. We were both new to our job and we have fared differently. It has been an interesting time for us both. Whatever else might be said, there is a telecommunications regulator, an aviation regulator and <Col N="989" /> an electricity regulator. I have one philosophy for regulators: leave them alone and they will leave you alone. That is the way business can be done. It is meant to be done independently. It is not meant to be done on the basis where the political or administrative head can decide, at random, to run riot through the regulator's activities and pick and choose those in which he or she wishes to become involved.</P>
    <P>Without having met the communications regulator I decided that, if a regulator has been established by law to act independently, then independent he or she should be and there should be no interference in his or her work. However, the burden of work is too much for one person. Ms Doyle has managed it expertly over the past five years but from now there will be three regulators operating under the umbrella of the commission. That is a good thing.</P>
    <P>The functions of regulating the telecommunications sector, broadcasting transmission systems and managing the radio frequency spectrum were assigned to the Director of Telecommunications Regulation with effect from 30 June 1997. The functions of the office now encompass three areas: regulation of the electronic communications sector, encompassing both telecommunications and broadcasting transmission systems; regulation of the postal sector; and the management of the radio frequency spectrum.</P>
    <P>The past five years in which the director and her office have carried out their functions have been challenging and I pay tribute to her and her staff for their achievements over that period. The challenges they have faced included the need to put in place all of the necessary measures to enable the successful implementation of full liberalisation from 1 December 1998, following my decision to bring forward the ending of the derogation on full liberalisation from 1 January 2000 to 1 December 1998. The measures which it was necessary to put in place included a licensing framework for new operators, an equitable telephone numbering system and the rights and obligations governing interconnection between Eircom's telecommunications network and the facilities of other operators.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the reasons why we are proposing changes to the structure for the regulation of the communications sector. I initiated a consultation process that resulted in the publication of a paper in March 2000, Governance and Accountability in the Regulatory Process: Policy Proposals. Among the issues which I have considered, taking into account the comments received in the public consultation, are the composition of reglatory authorities, the terms and conditions governing their appointment, their period of office, decision making processes and the financial and functional accountability of regulatory authorities to the Oireachtas, the Minister and the public. The Bill provides for the implementation of proposals contained in the policy document.</P>
    <P>Regarding the composition of regulatory authorities, I considered the relative merits and draw<Col N="990" /> backs of an individual regulator and regulatory board and decided that, as a general rule, a regulatory authority should comprise three members. As stated in the governance and accountability policy document, many of the decisions to be made by the regulatory authority are significant for those involved in the regulated industries and for the economy as a whole. This is particularly the case in relation to the communications sector, where there has been a substantial growth in the regulatory workload and the tasks and rulings which have to be implemented have become increasingly complex and qualitative.</P>
    <P>The existing legislative framework for telecommunications, which is based on European law, was designed primarily to manage the transition from monopoly to competition. Therefore, it was focused on the creation of a competitive market and the rights of new entrants. The market is now changing with ever-increasing speed in terms of market developments, in particular the convergence between telecommunications, broadcasting and IT sectors, evolution in technology and changes in user demand. The balancing of different interests, not only among industry players and between the industry and consumers, but also between the short-term and long-term economic and social interests of the State often requires that difficult judgment calls have to be made. A three-person commission would be in a better position than an individual to bear the burden of making such decisions.</P>
    <P>This is no reflection on the performance of Etain Doyle as director. Again, I wish to acknowledge her achievements and welcome the fact that this Bill enables her to complete her term of office as a commissioner, bringing the benefit of her experience to the commission.</P>
    <P>Regarding accountability, the transfer of regulatory functions from Ministers to independent statutory bodies requires that there be clear accountability mechanisms, without compromising their functional independence. In relation to the Director of Telecommunications Regulation, a number of provisions ensures appropriate accountability is in place, either in the existing legislation or through practice. This Bill proposes formally to put in place appropriate accountability mechanisms without compromising the independence of the commission.</P>
    <P>Apart from reforming the organisational structure for the regulation of communications the Bill provides for the reform of the framework governing access to public roads for the construction of telecommunications networks. The growth of the electronic communications sector in recent years is one of the great success stories of the economy. If there has been one down side to this phenomenal growth, it has been that the laying of new electronic communications infrastructure has required an unprecedented volume of road openings. This has placed additional strain on traffic in towns and cities.</P>
    <P>The Bill seeks to ensure that there is minimum disruption to the public and the environment dur<Col N="991" /> ing the building of electronic communications infrastructure. Local authorities will be given increased powers to co-ordinate and control road openings by telecommunications companies. The new commission will also be able to bring about agreements on the sharing of electronic communications infrastructure and impose conditions on sharing agreements.</P>
    <P>The sharing of electronic communications infrastructure will reduce the need for companies to open roads and lay their networks, making it much easier for new and existing companies to install such infrastructure. This should enable the delivery of state-of-the-art electronic communications services which are essential for the development of the information society.</P>
    <P>Following a review of the provisions of the general scheme of the Bill and conscious of the necessity to focus on the key provisions to be enacted in the limited Oireachtas time available, I decided that some of its provisions can be more appropriately progressed through alternative legislative means. Accordingly, some provisions in the general scheme have not been included in the text of the Bill as published. The provisions relate to control of market power, appeals against regulatory decisions, certain provisions relating to the management of the radio frequency and telecommunications fraud.</P>
    <P>Regarding the control of market power of electronic communications operators, these provisions are covered by the new European regulatory framework for the electronic communications sector, which consists of a package of five European Parliament and Council Directives as well as a decision. Four of the directives and the decision were adopted recently and the fifth directive is expected to be adopted later this year. These provisions will be transposed into Irish law by means of regulations under the European Communities Acts.</P>
    <P>Regarding appeals against decisions made by the proposed commission, the advice of the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government was that there were legal policy difficulties involved in the insertion into the Bill of a single procedure for appeals against regulatory decisions. Related appeals processes are set out in various pieces of primary and secondary legislation. As many of these decision-making powers will be revised in the transposition of the new directives into Irish law by means of regulations to be made under the European Communities Acts, the transposition will provide the opportunity to put in place a consistent and appropriate appeals process. In the meantime, the rights of appeal to the courts as set out in the existing legislation apply.</P>
    <P>Certain provisions relating to management of the radio frequency spectrum will be dealt with in a separate Bill to reform the Wireless Telegraphy Acts, the preparation of which is under way <Col N="992" /> within my Department. In relation to telecommunications fraud, I believe that the provisions of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act, 2001, will largely cater for the type of conduct which the general scheme sought to prevent.</P>
    <P>Regarding the remaining provisions of the general scheme which are now included in the Bill as published, the main changes made relate to the enforcement provisions. I understand that substantial constitutional and legal policy issues arise from the measures proposed in the general scheme to enhance the ability of the commission to enforce regulatory decisions. One of the main legislative provisions for enforcement is the creation of offences with the power to prosecute on a summary basis given to the statutory body concerned. The maximum penalty for breach of a summary offence can be quite small. Substantial penalties can be imposed where indictable offences are created but only the Director of Public Prosecutions may initiate proceedings for breach of indictable offences.</P>
    <P>Many of the offences applicable in the communications sector derive from regulations made under the European Communities Acts, transposing European directives into Irish law. Only summary offences can be created in regulations under the European Communities Acts. We considered whether this Bill could create indictable offences for breaches of obligations already specified in separate regulations but we were advised that such a provision would require substantial legal analysis by the Attorney General. Accordingly, it was not open for me to proceed at that time with some of the enforcement measures proposed in the general scheme. However, as previously indicated, the Bill does include a provision enabling prosecution on indictment of breaches of licence conditions, with a maximum fine of &euro;1,000,000.</P>
    <P>Since publication of the Bill, my Department has had further discussions with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and as a result I hope to move some amendments on Committee Stage which will advance the position regarding enforcement. In addition, my Department will, in consultation with the Attorney General's office, review the general question of enforcement in the light of the new regulatory framework for electronic communications to be laid down in accordance with the new directives.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the provisions of the Bill give a sound economic and regulatory framework within which the commission will work. In framing the legislation and in line with the requirements for introducing new statutory measures, my Department carried out a public consultation on the proposals and has had substantial discussions with interested parties and with relevant Government Departments.</P>
    <P>The Bill is separated into five main parts. Part I contains standard provisions covering the Short <Col N="993" /> Title, interpretations, laying of orders and regulations before both Houses, etc. Part 2 deals with the establishment of the Commission for Communications Regulation. Part 3 details the enforcement provisions applicable to the new commission. Part 4 deals with transitional provisions arising out of the transformation of the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation into the Commission for Communications Regulation. Part 5 caters for electronic communications infrastructure, road works and sharing.</P>
    <P>Part 1 contains standard provisions in relation to the Short Title of the Bill, the interpretation of words and phrases used, procedures for laying orders and regulations before the Houses of the Oireachtas, the establishment day and the usual provision for expenses.</P>
    <P>Part 2, sections 6 to 39, contains sections directly related to the establishment of the Commission for Communications Regulation and are similar to many found in other legislation establishing such regulatory bodies. There are provisions dealing with the transfer of functions from the director to the new commission, annual reports and accounts and the format of such accounts, the manner in which commissioners are appointed, as well as the chairman and staff of the commission. There is provision for the commission to account for its activities if called before a committee of one or both Houses of the Oireachtas and a proposed requirement for the commission to produce regular strategy statements in addition to a code of financial management.</P>
    <P>The functions of the commission are set out in section 10. These are: to ensure compliance by undertakings with obligations in relation to the supply of and access to electronic communications services, networks and associated facilities; to manage the radio frequency spectrum; to ensure compliance by providers of postal services with relevant obligations; to investigate complaints regarding the supply of and access to electronic communications services and networks; and to ensure compliance in relation to the placing on the market of telecommunications equipment.</P>
    <P>Section 12 sets out the objectives of the commission in carrying out its functions. This is an important new provision, setting out in legislation the key principles to guide the commission in its activities. Section 13 is another important provision, enabling the Minister to issue policy directions to the commission. This provision extends the scope of an existing power in the Telecommunications (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1996, in relation to the radio frequency spectrum to enable policy directions to be issued in relation to the electronic communications sector and the postal sector. In order that the functional independence of the commission is not compromised, this power to issue directions is limited to issues <Col N="994" /> of policy and must not relate to individual undertakings or persons. In addition, the Minister must publish the proposed direction not less than three weeks in advance.</P>
    <P>Provisions in relation to the composition of the commission, its chairperson and its staff are dealt with in sections 14 to 27. These provisions follow recently enacted legislation establishing similar regulatory bodies. Section 20 allows the commission to appoint staff and provides for the transfer of staff of the director to the commission. Sections 26 and 27 allow for the creation of superannuation schemes for both members and staff of the commission to be agreed by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance in line with the normal rules for these matters.</P>
    <P>Sections 28 to 30 provide for the resources and revenues of the commission. The Minister may make advances to the commission and the commission may also borrow money subject to the consent of the Minister and the Minister for Finance. The main provision in relation to funding is the commission's power to impose a levy on the regulated entities, that is, electronic communications providers and providers of postal services. Provision also exists for the treatment of surplus income from year to year.</P>
    <P>Section 35 provides for co-operation mechanisms in respect of the consideration of any matter which should be regulated by both the commission and the Competition Authority. The provisions in this regard are consistent with the recommendations set out in Governance and Accountability in the Regulatory Process. In view of the fact that similar provisions in relation to co-operation between the Competition Authority and statutory bodies are contained in the Competition Bill, 2001, I am considering whether section 35 of the Bill should be dropped.</P>
    <P>Section 36 provides for the commission to take over responsibility for drawing up and maintaining the radio frequency plan which has heretofore been the responsibility of the director. Section 37 provides that the Minister may specify public service requirements in relation to certain types of licences or authorisations. This is a re-enactment of a provision contained in the 1996 Act.</P>
    <P>Part 3, sections 40 to 47, deals with the enforcement powers of the new commission. In addition to the usual provisions relating to authorised officers, section 46 provides for prosecution on indictment for breaches of licence conditions, with a maximum fine of &euro;1,000,000, increased from £1,500. Furthermore, section 47 provides for a maximum fine of &euro;1,000,000 to be imposed on a person in breach of the price cap provisions of the Telecommunications (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1996. As I mentioned before, I hope to table some amendments on Committee Stage which will advance the position regarding enforcement.</P>
    <P>Part 4, sections 48 to 52, inclusive, contains standard transitional provisions relating to the transfer of property and liabilities of the director to the commission, the preservation of certain <Col N="995" /> continuing contracts, the adaptation of certain documents, the continuation of certain matters by the commission and pending legal proceedings.</P>
    <P>Part 5, sections 53 to 61, inclusive, provides for the reform of the legislative framework governing opening of public roads by telecommunications operators. In particular, section 54 provides that operators will be required to obtain the consent of local authorities which are responsible for roads in their areas before opening public roads to lay telecommunications networks.</P>
    <P>Section 58 provides for the new commission to bring about agreements on the sharing of electronic communications infrastructure and to impose conditions in sharing agreements. Currently the director may only intervene in sharing negotiations at the request of one of the parties. This Bill enables network operators to inform the commission of any negotiations on infrastructure they enter into and it empowers the commission to intervene if agreement is not reached. I am confident the Bill will seek to ensure that road authorities will be able properly to control access to public highways by telecommunications operators without unduly inhibiting the installation of telecommunications infrastructure around the country.</P>
    <P>The communications sector is an important contributor to Ireland's objective of being at the vanguard of the information society and electronic commerce. In order to ensure that we have an efficient and effective communications sector we need to have a regulatory framework for the sector which will maximise effective competition in the shortest possible timeframe. This Bill will set out a clear accountability framework for the new body in relation to Government, the Oireachtas, industry and the public. The framework for consents by road authorities set out in the Bill should provide for clarity and fairness as well as a consistent approach throughout the country. I therefore ask the House to facilitate the early passage of this Bill into law. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. I also thank her for her overview and speedy delivery of her speech. I must confess that I have been thrown in at the deep end because I am standing-in for my colleague, Senator Caffrey, who was called away on urgent business.</P>
      <P>As I understand, the main purpose of this Bill is to create a commission for communications regulation, dissolve the office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation and transfer its functions to the new commission. It will also increase penalties for the commission of certain offences and provide for the improved management of the opening of public roads for the purpose of laying telecommunications infrastructure.</P>
      <P>The Minister made reference to Etain Doyle and the good job that she has been doing and I am glad to note that Ms Doyle is not being made redundant immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="996" />
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have reconfirmed her position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>She is to continue as a commissioner. I do not think that the Minister has said for how long, but Ms Doyle is to serve out her period of office. The Minister has decided that there will be three commissioners and I am sure that she has taken good counsel on that issue.</P>
      <P>The Minister spoke of the abuse of a dominant position and we would all concur that this can no longer be tolerated. We are moving into a new era. The Competition Authority and other bodies act as safeguards to ensure that there can no longer be abuse of dominant positions.</P>
      <P>I welcome much that the Minister has said. It is only right that penalties imposed for breach of the regulations should be severe. I am glad the Minister is providing for proper co-ordination in respect of the opening and closing of public roads. All too often, we see that a road that has only recently been re-opened is closed again while some other authority is digging it up. I often wondered if local authorities were very slack in their approach to the digging up of public roads. I hope that this aspect of the Bill will be effective.</P>
      <P>While I accept that the Minister's intentions are good, the work of the commission may be slowed down by the existence of three commissioners. It may be necessary to have three commissioners, but I do not see how it will contribute to the speeding up of the process, which is the Minister's intention. The Bill should allow for three members with collective decision-making powers and a chairperson with a casting vote. Of necessity there will be many occasions where the three members, in addition to having briefed themselves well on whatever situation they are dealing with at the time, will be in disagreement with one another. As we all know, things are sometimes of necessity postponed. People decide to take time out to reflect on an issue before coming back to it at a later stage and hopefully bringing fresh minds to bear. That will slow things down somewhat.</P>
      <P>On the issue of enforcement, we again need to be on guard. This measure may not be as effective as in other areas the Minister referred to, such as the aviation, electricity and gas sectors. Enforcement could be less effective in this instance because, if I have interpreted the Bill correctly, a file would have to go to the Director of Public Prosecutions. The DPP's office has a great habit of sitting on things, in some cases for considerable periods of time, possibly even a year. Offenders would be well aware of the delays in the DPP's office. Human nature being what it is, I fear they may decide to carry on offending regardless. I am not convinced the enforcement measures the Minister has outlined in the Bill are adequate to meet the criteria she has in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no mention of broadband or how the roadblocks in the broadband system are to be overcome. The regulator has been arguing with <Col N="997" /> telecommunications providers for over two years regarding unbundling the loop and other issues. I worry also about that. What transpires in practice could run counter to the Minister's intention. I have had only a cursory look at the issue, having been thrown in at the deep end. My interpretation of it, however, is that there is a danger here of events not according with the Minister's intent and that in practice there will be delays.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance is mentioned constantly in the Bill&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>He has been here in the House. He is pre-eminent in all our activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am making is that the office of the Minister for Finance is so dominant and appears in so many sections. It appears one cannot go to the toilet without asking the permission of the master, the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>That could be interesting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be but the Minister knows the point I am making. It struck me forcefully this morning as I read through the Bill.</P>
      <P>Sections 19 and 25 also stuck in my mind upon my reading, and I would like to compare them. Section 19 precludes for a period of one year a former commissioner from holding any other office, paid employment or consultancy in which he or she might use or disclose any confidential information acquired while in office as a commissioner. Section 25 places obligations on commissioners and persons employed by them to disclose any pecuniary or other interest in a matter being considered by the commission, and outlines procedures which will be adopted where a conflict of interest arises.</P>
      <P>It is long overdue that we should have guidelines, or preferably legal directives, for people who have held any sort of responsible office. There was a story in the past week regarding a senior official in a local authority who was dealing with developers, large-scale developments and so on. Then, the week after retiring, he takes up employment with one of these people. This smacks of an inside track, knowing the system and how to get around it. I welcome the provisions outlined by the Minister, but we should have a general rule, enforced by law, that people leaving such responsible positions in State or local authority employment be prevented for a period from turning from gamekeeper into poacher, so to speak. Sadly, that has happened all too often in our society.</P>
      <P>As a people we have not had sufficient regard for situations of conflict of interest. We all know as public representatives that sensitive matters are sometimes brought to our attention, with people making representations to us even when they know well we could not touch them with a barge pole. This point is not sufficiently understood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="998" />I wish the Minister well with the Bill &ndash; all the better if she can improve it as it goes through both Houses. I welcome the Bill and accept the Minister's intent, but I think it may be subverted in the instances I have outlined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the Seanad and welcome the fact she is initiating this very important Bill in the House. I am heartened by the ability of Senator Coghlan to grapple with technological terminology like unbundling loops, spectrums, spectra and so on. I must confess to my total illiteracy regarding this terminology. I express my gratitude to those who tried to address my inadequate brain in getting around it. If the fruits of their labours are proved inadequate it is no reflection on them but on me.</P>
      <P>A major issue is that we are in a new era now. Until to a few years ago very strategic sectors of our economy were managed by public sector supervision and control. Now we must confront the new era and culture which is moving rapidly away from a controlled, regulated market to an open, free market and liberalisation. As we know, three agencies have been set up to deal with these issues &ndash; one in the telecommunications area, one in aviation and one in energy. Since these are key strategic areas of the economy, much attention has focused on them over the years and rightly so. These sectors are important to the economy and can impact seriously on our economic development.</P>
      <P>The agency we are dealing with in this Bill, the ODTR, was set up under legislation passed in 1997 and started operations the following year. Due to the speed of developments in this area it was supposed to move towards full liberalisation in 2000, but the Minister accelerated that further, bringing the process forward by ten to 13 months. That target was reached and matters have moved on since.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill takes account of the many developments that have taken place. There is much more work for the ODTR now and that work has become more complex. The market is evolving rapidly and is becoming wider, all of which brings attendant problems such as an increasing workload and increased complexity of the rulings the ODTR must make and implement. The Bill addresses those issues on an interim basis &ndash; the Minister will agree &ndash; as the market is changing rapidly. Even as we speak there are innovators in research and development coming up with new ideas. It would be unrealistic and naive to think we could produce a blueprint for the next 20 to 40 years. This Bill puts a framework in place which will deal more proficiently and professionally with the roadblocks and other problems to which the Minister and Senator Coghlan referred. The Bill will enhance the Minister's powers of policy direction in the sector, but she stressed that a proper balance must be struck between the needs of the consumer, arising out of public policy, and the sacrosanct independence of the regu<Col N="999" /> lator she is establishing and whose needs the Bill addresses.</P>
    <P>The revolution in the variety and capacity of communications brought to us by new technology has transformed the country's potential for economic and social development. We have a tremendous record over the last two decades, particularly in IT, where huge production has taken place. Key players in that sector have invested hugely in the economy and the fruits of that are becoming obvious in the telecommunications market itself. Innovation is also driven by consumer demand and that situation is evolving rapidly.</P>
    <P>The guiding principle for the ODTR is that it must ensure fair play without dictating how players will operate in the market. It must provide a mechanism whereby Irish and European law for the delivery of quality services at competitive prices can operate. The big question being raised by the media and experts &ndash; God knows there are as many experts as participants in this field &ndash; is whether this new era of competition is working. It is only to be expected that the mechanisms in the ODTR for freeing up the market have come in for criticism. We hear of competition being put on hold and deregulation of the Irish market limping along as well as experts warning about telecommunications shakeouts in coming years. It would be unprecedented, given the rapidly changing environment, if those criticisms were not coming forward. The surprise is that there are not more of them. Taken one by one the criticisms can be disposed of easily. It is important to bear in mind that in this evolving situation criticisms will be directed at the ODTR since it is the office of the independent regulator trying to regulate licensing in a rapidly changing market.</P>
    <P>One of the key areas in competition is access to the market itself. The Minister spoke of the large operators and one of those has a very dominant position in the market when it comes to infrastructure. The difficulty for the ODTR, again referred to by Senator Coghlan, is how to move forward to a position where fair play obtains and the interests of consumers can be met in terms of price of access. We are currently aware of the haggling going on between Eircom and the ODTR in terms of the prices the ODTR set. It set a price it felt was fair and reasonable in the circumstances and which was in the best interests of consumers and competition. As we know, a court hearing on that issue is pending but in the interim the price set by the ODTR is the one that obtains.</P>
    <P>As the market takes off in Ireland we are not just seeing the liberalisation of the market but we also a significant and sharp move from what was traditionally a large narrowband network to demand for a widespread broadband network. Again, the Minister and Senator Coghlan referred to this point. To be fair, great attention is being given to the development of competition in existing broadband markets such as lease lines <Col N="1000" /> and the development of newer broadband solutions, such as unbundling the local loop, fixed wireless access or satellite use. That must be emphasised in answering the critics, some of whom are vocal, that no country has yet developed its broadband network so extensively that Ireland can avail of the expertise derived from the learning curves of those countries in order to address the issues we face. That speaks for itself. This market is changing so rapidly that it is very difficult to come up with a blueprint from any country and say it applies to us. In effect, we are ploughing a lone furrow and it is important to emphasise that in the face of criticism from those who claim to be Einsteins in this field. I would not demand that the Minister be an Einstein or that she should impose conditions of Einstein-like proportions on the regulator. We are in a constantly changing situation and we hope the evolution of the sector will be of benefit. The best expertise available is being applied to monitor and regulate the issues.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise some issues for the Minister to consider on Committee Stage, such as the publication of licences. I am not competent to comment on this definitively but some participants in the industry have expressed the view that when licences are issued by the ODTR or, in future, the commission, those licences should be published, including the details and conditions attached to them. In this way a level playing field would be created for everybody &ndash; participants in the industry and those who hope to participate. There would be no defaulting, though that would have implications I do not want to go into, and everyone would be seen as starting from the same point and having to comply in the same way. If that refers to infrastructure or other aspects of the licence, publication of the licence would put that into the public arena. The Minister can consider this on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>When an application is made to the ODTR or, in future, the commission, to allow use of a part of the spectrum which is not specified in the radio frequency plan, the commission or the Minister should be able to direct a change in the plan so that the new use can be taken into account. It should also be taken into account with immediate effect. I understand from advice I have taken that there could be serious problems with this. While I am not competent to comment on it, I am the funnel through which these concerns can be laid before the Minister. I understand the words &ldquo;immediate effect&rdquo; could have serious implications. I will not pursue that aspect of the matter other than to ask the Minister whether the Bill, as drafted, gives adequate power to direct the commission to make changes to the radio frequency plan. If not, is there a possibility this could be accommodated? Would there be value or merit in making such an accommodation? If the answer to these questions is &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, is the inclusion of the words &ldquo;immediate effect&rdquo; feasible?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has confused me now.</P>
      <P>The third case refers to the space between two connecting points. The concern outlined to me was that while the Bill provides very adequately for wire cable, in the case of wireless, which I am competently and professional informed means there is no wire cable but rather a microwave beam, it does not appear to make adequate provision. If not, the Minister might consider on Committee Stage that adequate provision should be made for the same conditions to apply to wireless &ndash; in other words, microwave beam &ndash; as apply to wire cable. I am not sure if the Bill falls down in this regard and would like the Minister to look at the matter before Committee Stage to see if this is the case and, if feasible, to meet the concerns of the industry in relation to it.</P>
      <P>The question of road openings has been raised. In recent years there has been rapid development in the installation of electronic communications infrastructure. The laying of cable has taken off at an enormous pace. However, the laying of cable under public roads has generated unreal controversy and anger in communities in which the effects have been felt. In many instances, road openings by telecommunications operators and other utilities cause huge traffic disruption, to which the Minister referred. Some of the operators concerned seem to operate totally outside the law. They move into an area willy-nilly and without notice and simply start to dig up a road, bring traffic to a halt causing massive tailbacks and disruption. When they have finished digging, tunnelling or drilling late into the night, wreaking havoc in communities and housing estates, they clean up, fill in or back fill and in comes another operator. They have been described as bandits, cowboys and so on which I am sure is very unfair, but I am merely articulating the views of communities in which this process has had a terrible effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the communities I represent the impact has been most unacceptable. One can imagine, therefore, their relief and the welcome I want to give to the Minister's decision to change all this. I know operators had permission to work under certain restrictions, but in my experience and in those communicated to me, the restrictions were totally useless and ineffective. When confronted, managers held their hands up in the air and pleaded total helplessness. I see the Minister has decided to repeal the existing rights of telecommunications operators and replace them with a <Col N="1002" /> requirement for the operators concerned to obtain the consent of road authorities. That is to be warmly welcomed. The new arrangements will enable road authorities to properly control access to public highways without unduly impeding the development of the infrastructure which must be provided. A balance has to be struck between the needs of the economy, in terms of building up infrastructure, and those of communities.</P>
    <P>Many features of the Bill are welcome. The Minister did not presume to tell us she was going to resolve the problems in a market that is changing day by day, hour by hour and minute by minute, but, nevertheless, the frameworks she is putting in place and the structures she is changing will be effective and are welcome. They will not relieve or eliminate all the road blocks or other blockages and deal with all the spectrums or loops, but I am sure they will go a long way to balancing the quality and effectiveness of the works of the new commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and the Bill, but, like Senator Coghlan, one has to have reservations about whether it will speed up the process under which we operate. The Minister has made a huge effort to push forward new technology in her Department. That is the reason I am quite sure the aim of the Bill in changing from one regulator to a commission is to speed up the process, particularly in regard to the introduction of the broadband network. However, I wonder whether it will do so. Like Senator Coghlan, I wonder whether it will be slowed down and taken over given that the Minister for Finance is so heavily involved. Perhaps, if he is well occupied in the other House, we may be able do something with the Bill on Committee Stage to remove his heavy hand from various sections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance seems to have a more powerful role in every part of the public service. I do not know if the Minister, the Cathaoirleach or other Senators noticed two letters published in<i> The Irish Times </i>last week relating to the Freedom of Information Act as it affects the Department of Health and Children. Since the Government took office &ndash; I know Senator Liam Fitzgerald has his views on hospital consultants &ndash; we have been trying to work towards a consultant provided service, or so we thought. I was a member of Comhairle na nOspidéal when we brought this forward. We were appointing more consultants and trying to cut back on the number of non-consultant hospital doctors. The next thing we see is a letter in the newspaper dated early January from the Department of Finance stating a consultant provided service is not necessarily the way we will go. There was an anguished reply from the Secretary General of the Department of Health and Children. The Department of Finance and, I presume, the Minister seem to be stepping in when other Departments are trying to make progress. The manpower task force has been proceeding on the basis that there will be a consultant provided service. Comhairle na nOspidéal has <Col N="1003" /> been doing the same. I can see the same thing happening in this case.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said, the commission is to be independent. I was delighted she gave such praise to the regulator, Ms Etain Doyle, who has done a tremendous job with good humour, especially since she has had her own problems with the Department of Finance. The Minister may remember a big fight last year when the issuing of one licence was considerably slowed down.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance, as far as I can remember, wanted a high minimum fee while the regulator wanted to make sure there was coverage throughout the country. The process was delayed by about one year until they reached a settlement. This may happen more frequently in the case of this legislation.</P>
      <P>The commission will be independent because it will raise its own money. I notice it can provide for borrowings for which the Minister will have to give permission, but it is the Minister for Finance who will have his hand around the Minister's neck in giving the permission. Did the regulator ever borrow from the Minister? I have no idea about this. Was the regulator able to sustain her department with her own levies? Why will the commission not be able to do this rather than have situations such as that outlined in section 13 which deals with directions of the Minister? As Senator Coghlan said, the Minister appears to be able to give all the directions apart from awarding individual licences.</P>
      <P>It worries me enormously that section 13(4)(<i>b</i>) states: &ldquo;.the means by which entitlements to use such spectrum may be assigned (including appropriate fees), and in giving such direction the Minister shall have regard to principles of good frequency management.&rdquo; That is fair enough, but the next subsection states: &ldquo;A direction under <i>subsection (1) </i>relating to fees referred to in <i>subsection (4)(b)</i> may only be given with the consent of the Minister for Finance.&rdquo; In other words, the Minister for Finance will control competitions. That is not good. We should, therefore, remove the subsection in question because the Minister for Finance will control competitions, not the commission, as a result of which it will not be independent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite bizarre that the commission will have its own money and pay its staff, but section 20(3)(<i>a</i>) states that the Minister and the Minister for Finance shall determine the number, grading, remuneration and other conditions of service of staff to be appointed by the office of the commission. That should be taken out of the Bill. It is only numbers at the moment, but it will not do. The commission might decide it wants six very senior people and no one else. It might decide it wants two very senior people and half a dozen consultants. Control of that cannot be left with the Minister for Finance. If that is the case, how <Col N="1004" /> could one consider the commission independent? We can change this &ndash; I am sure the Minister for Finance will never find out. Does the Minister think he has spies here?</P>

      <P>I am sure the schoolchildren who have joined us in the Gallery will not tell the Minister a word.</P>
      <P>We must show some common sense. I note the Minister will appoint three people to the commission. Some of the other commissions to which three members were appointed, such as those dealing with aviation and electricity, are still functioning with only one. I do not see why extra people should be appointed unless they are necessary. I do not think extra people should be appointed just for the sake of it. It could lead to bad feeling if there are only two commissioners and the chairperson has the casting vote.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned the postal services and they are extraordinarily important. I would like to hear something about efficiency. There is nothing in the Bill about the postal services having to be efficient. That is extremely important. I like the public service element of this Bill and it is important that the public service in the postal services is well looked after. I am sure they will not hear a word I say, but our postal service is not too bad. I do not want them to find that out. Neither do I want anyone from Iarnród Éireann to travel on South West Trains in England because they would come back and tell us that we have a marvellous service. We should keep a discreet silence on some of these things. It is important to emphasise efficiency in the postal service.</P>
      <P>Like Senator Coghlan, I wonder why matters have to go to the DPP. Could the commission not be in a position to pursue these things themselves? The DPP will be dealing with appalling cases such as murders and rapes and will have to give priority to such cases above fining various telecommunications networks. Can that be changed? Surely the Minister for Finance would not mind that; he might even give us a bit of leeway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Senator Coghlan's point about the staff and the commission having to declare pecuniary benefits. Would it not be better if they were excluded from having shares in any companies with which they deal? We have run into a great deal of trouble in recent years with people who are involved in running trials for pharmaceutical companies. At one stage they were allowed to have only a very small shareholding in those companies. In America the size of the allowable shareholding has been increased. Last <Col N="1005" /> year the very reputable <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i> said it was now almost impossible to find people who were sufficiently disassociated from pharmaceutical companies to overview such trials. Conflict of interest has become a serious matter in many spheres. It is a matter that we should consider again.</P>
    <P>The Minister is trying to forward the implementation of broadband. Senator Coghlan explained the unbundling of the local loop so well that I will not go through it again.</P>

      <P>Maybe it is like the third secret of Fatima. However, we have been very slow to do it. Senator Fitzgerald said there are not many countries from which we can take an example, but several people have raised it with me over some time.</P>
      <P>Some areas were excluded from the Bill and maybe we should try to include them. One of those is a flat access rate to the Internet. Fortunately, my children are old enough to pay for themselves when they use the Internet, but this is a matter in which the mothers of Ireland have a great interest. Can we tackle this now? Is there some reason for excluding that from the Bill? It is a very important issue.</P>
      <P>I was contacted about mobile telephone number portability. While it is not such a difficulty for private users, it apparently causes many problems for business users. If they transfer to another mobile telephone company, they can only retain the latter part of their number. Naturally we do not want anything that impedes business. This causes more problems for small businesses than large businesses. Perhaps it is an issue that could be addressed. I also wish to raise the matter of operators who rent large sections of a mobile network and then go out of business. That seems to be quite a problem and it is not addressed in the Bill.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's efforts in this very challenging area. I agree with Senator Fitzgerald that we do not have much legislation from other EU countries to consider. On the other hand, there is no reason that we should not forge the way. We have done a great deal of work with information technology in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister will take notice of the problem of spam e-mail. I have raised this before but no one seems to take any notice of it. Unsolicited and repulsive messages are becoming increasingly common. The heads of the department of computer science and data protection at Trinity College have contacted me about this matter. It must be a really serious problem for them to have contacted me. They would not have done so if it was a frivolous issue. I do not think the Department of Public Enterprise decided that <Col N="1006" /> people would have to opt out of getting such e-mails.</P>

The Minister may have to take a tough line with a Minister other than the Minister for Finance. I am sure we will be able to aid the Minister in removing some of the Minister for Finance's influence on Committee Stage. I congratulate the Minister on bringing this Bill before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to be back in the Seanad. I welcome the generous nature with which this Bill has been received by all sides of the House. It has been a very interesting debate. One often gets more wisdom here in one hour than in I will not say how many hours in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>I thank Senator Coghlan for the generous nature of his contribution to the debate. Both he and Senator Henry raised the issue of three people slowing up the process. I do not know from where this view emanates, although it is in wide circulation. However, it is not realised the amount of work that the regulator, Ms Etain Doyle, and her office have to do. Since the postal business was added to her brief, it has more than doubled in volume and increased in complexity. The many telecommunications companies and their predisposition towards litigation compound the workload. We examined the position in other countries, both smaller and bigger than Ireland, and concluded that a commission of three is best. The most highly skilled and intelligent regulator could not cope alone with the barrage of work that lands on the regulator's desk. Three regulators will work more speedily.</P>
      <P>As I indicated before, court cases constitute the main burden of work for Ms Doyle. Senator Coghlan referred to the inclusion of a reference to the Director of Public Prosecutions in the Bill, but I am assured by my advisers that this is a standard provision is such legislation and the Bill does not differ from others.</P>
      <P>The Senator also raised the question of the guidelines for those leaving office or taking up employment elsewhere. We include in every piece of legislation a reference to such guidelines. Other Departments do the same. It is important to have them as such persons have a great deal of insider knowledge and it is not ethical that they should use it for personal profit in other employment. This is no reflection on any current regulator, but the guidelines are important nonetheless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Liam Fitzgerald also made a generous and knowledgeable contribution in which he spoke of the transition from a monopoly to liber<Col N="1007" /> alisation, the consequent increasing workload for the ODTR, the policy directions from the Department, whoever may be Minister, and the need for clarity in the different roles of the Minister, the regulator and the market. He recognised the interwoven complexity of these matters and spoke of the need for broadband provision and the publication of licences and details of licence holders. In many cases, the regulator publishes this information, but there is a need, as the Senator indicated, for systematic publication, although sensitive commercial details would be withheld. This issue will be addressed in a forthcoming wireless telegraphy Bill.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to an amendment of the radio frequency plan. We expect to do this, either by a directive or by transferring the function to the regulator. Senators also spoke of the lopping of trees that interfere with radio signals. At certain frequencies, obstacles such as trees in the line of a radio signal can interfere with its quality, but we hope the operator will be able to negotiate with the tree owner to deal with this.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that while none of us has an intimate knowledge of the technical terms, we are familiar with them. The unbundling of the local loop springs to mind, which Brussels now declares is unimportant after we spent so much effort on it, dealing with submissions and the telecommunications companies which stated if the final loop was unbundled, everything would be all right. That phrase always conjured up for me an image of a baby wrapped up in loops and hoops which was being unbundled to display him or her in all his or her beauty.</P>
    <P>Senators Coghlan, Henry and Liam Fitzgerald spoke of the digging up of roads. Everybody wants advanced technology on the doorstep, but no one wants the road dug up to achieve this. There is a middle way, as there is in most matters, in which the Bill's provisions will assist.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Henry, not just for the generous nature of her speech, but also for being questioning. Lest I am not here again before the general election, she does the university panel proud, as do all the Senators their panels. She is regularly here and her contributions are so matter of fact that anyone can respond to them since they touch on all the relevant issues. She was most critical of the heavy hand of the Department of Finance. However, discretion spancels my tongue&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have learnt to work with whoever is the incumbent in the Department of Finance, particularly in my current post where he is part owner and has a say on many issues.</P>
      <P>I agree with what the Senator said about the regulator's responsibility for postal services and the need for efficiency, aspects of which are not dealt with in the Bill but will be in a future one. On the flat rate for Internet access, Senator Henry spoke as a parent of children who now earn their own living, as I do, but the rate is enormously expensive. We hope the broadband infrastructure, details of which I sent to everybody and which will be 90% funded by the Government with 10% being put in by the local authorities, will result in very competitive rates. The market will then take over and drive down the price because of that infrastructure being in place.</P>
      <P>Mobile telephone number portability is a feature of a European directive which we have agreed to, but the Senator is right that it arises. These issues will be addressed in new directives which have just been adopted in Europe and we will deal with them through the transposition of those directives, which will be laid before the Houses. This is a matter which people talk about frequently but we cannot cover every issue. The Bill deals with three issues &ndash; redefining the office of the regulator, the enforcement process and much larger fines, and the opening of the roads in a proper fashion.</P>
      <P>On the question of spam mail, the Senator is right that the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment was the lead Department in this regard because it viewed it in terms of a competitive, commercial marketplace. The matter came before our Council meeting as well. In many instances spam mail is obnoxious. One does not wish to get literature on how one can win a million pounds by sending away a form or something equally spurious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter has a political background to it as well as a spam mail background &ndash; I am not talking about those of us who send literature to our constituents. I am talking about matters which impinge upon one's sensitivities and this is something we should examine also. I have been hugely upset in the past 12 months by mail coming to the house addressed to my late husband from institutions like banks and finance houses <Col N="1009" /> where he would have had an account in the past. I would have thought these institutions would have knowledge of a death and would have been able to put that information on their computers. Last weekend there were four such letters. When this was raised, it immediately struck a chord with me because of the intimate nature of it but also because we will soon be looking through the register and sending letters to people who may have passed away. That will cause huge distress to people who receive mail addressed to a loved one who has passed away. While the Senator was talking I had the immediate recollection of all that has gone on in that regard and people are justifiably upset about it. I realise some people would not know of a death, but we cannot condone mail being sent from an institution or body addressed to someone who is no longer with that family.</P>
    <P>The question of spam mail will be covered by the new data protection directive to which Senator Henry referred, which will be transposed into Irish law in the next year. The commission will have responsibility for implementing this directive and it will do that in a proper fashion. It has been put to me that spam mail should be viewed on the basis that it helps business, but I do not believe it helps business. I do not know what everybody else does with it but I dump it. I live in an apartment in Dublin, quite near to where Senator Henry lives, and the amount of this type of mail that can build up over two or three weeks is enormous, including Chinese take-aways offering to bring dinner to one's door, although one might want that some night. All sorts of other items are delivered also and I hope the directive will address that problem.</P>
    <P>Many other issues were raised in the debate and there will be an opportunity on Committee Stage to examine some of them. I thank Senators for their generosity and the openness of their approach.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment this evening in relation to the provision of a modern sewerage scheme, distribution mains and treatment works for the town of Castlerea, County Roscommon. Castlerea is a town of approximately 2,500 to 3,000 people and it has a sewage disposal system which was installed in the <Col N="1010" /> early part of the 20th century, but which today is totally antiquated. It discharges its outfall into the River Suck, which is about 70 miles long and one of the main tributaries of what we call the lower River Shannon. The outfall of Castlerea sewage is a major source of pollution which, under the standards laid down by the Environmental Protection Agency and European Union regulations on clean water, etc, is no longer acceptable.</P>
      <P>It is approximately nine years since the Department of the Environment and Local Government accepted that the sewerage scheme at Castlerea and in the adjoining towns of Ballaghaderreen, Boyle and Roscommon town had to be upgraded. In 1996-97, funding for new sewerage schemes was provided for Ballaghaderreen, Boyle, Roscommon town and Monskland, near Athlone. The final stages of approval for a new treatment works for the town of Castlerea was to be approved at that time but since 1997 there has been no move in relation to it.</P>
      <P>There are two stages to the scheme in Castlerea. Stage 1 deals with the treatment works which are badly needed because of its outfall and the level of pollution it releases into one of the major rivers in the country, which in turn has implications for the lower Shannon region, Lough Derg in particular, and those areas below Athlone. Stage 2 deals with a new distribution network in the streets of Castlerea with extensions towards new housing developments in the town and replacing the old distribution mains system, some of which is early 20th century and no longer functioning properly.</P>
      <P>The town of Castlerea has not enjoyed much of what we call Celtic tiger boom. Nevertheless, it has one of the country's main prisons with approximately 150 people detained there. The staff bring the total number of people who use the institution to 200. There are also general businesses and households. While Castlerea has not expanded greatly, like many other towns of its size with fewer than 3,000 people, it has experienced a good deal of expansion in terms of housing in recent years because it is in a tax designated area.</P>
      <P>It is urgent that stages 1 and 2 of the scheme are approved now. Two years ago an announcement was made by a Government representative, who still represents the county, that he had got an undertaking from the Department that the scheme would be included in the 2002 sanitary services programme. The scheme draws down perhaps up to 70% of its funding from the European Regional Development Fund. That is important and makes it rather easy for the Department to find the necessary funding since, at most, it will fund probably only up to 30% of the cost of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what is contained in the Minister of State's script, but I will be dissatisfied if he cannot confirm that his Department has decided to approve in 2002 &ndash; as per the promise given two years ago; I know exactly the stage it had reached within the Department up to June 1997 <Col N="1011" />&ndash; both stages, costing &euro;30 million, bearing in mind that it is a candidate scheme for European Regional Development Fund funding at the maximum level.</P>
    <P>This is a major election issue locally, which is no wonder given that the people living in the area have long awaited the implementation of the scheme. It is not acceptable that a town of its size should have an antiquated system. The planners in the local authority have to say that due to the inadequacy of sewerage system they do not want to make any more connections to it because of its current overladen state. I mentioned the prison, one of the largest places of detention in the country. This institution is new and replaces an old hospital.</P>
    <P>For all these reasons, this is an urgent project. The Chair knows well what I am talking about because I am sure he has received many representations about the issue. I sincerely hope I do not hear from the Minister of State something that does not tell the people of Castlerea anything. I want a positive answer. This is not about making an announcement for the general election; the scheme is needed for good infrastructural and environmental reasons in the town. Its sewage outflow system should not be polluting major rivers and fisheries. I will leave it at that and await with great anticipation a good answer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter. The provision of modern environmental infrastructure to support social and economic objectives has been a major focus of Government spending since 1997. The unprecedented increase in investment by my Department on water and sewerage schemes has made a key contribution to the remarkable economic growth that has benefited every part of Ireland in the intervening period.</P>
      <P>Total investment in water and sewerage facilities over the duration of the national development plan will amount to almost &euro;4.4 billion, of which over &euro;3.8 billion is earmarked for major public schemes. The additional water production capacity generated by the resulting expansion of the Department's water services investment programme during the first year of the NDP alone, the year 2000, equated with the average daily requirements of over 300,000 people. This represented, in just one year, 36% of the corresponding figure for the entire 1994 to 1999 period.</P>
      <P>The increase in wastewater treatment capacity in the same year represented the requirements of a population equivalent to 180,000 &ndash; almost half the entire increase between 1994 and 1999. When the figures for 2001 become available shortly, I am confident they will be just as impressive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In July 2000 the first phase of the water services investment programme, covering the years 2000 to 2002, was announced; the beginning of a rolling programme that will continue up to the <Col N="1012" /> end of the NDP in 2006. Funding is being provided under this investment programme for new schemes in every single county.</P>
    <P>The total allocated for County Roscommon under the first phase of the programme amounts to more than &euro;58 million in respect of 13 schemes. This compares to just over &euro;22 million worth of schemes in the programme we inherited in 1997. Of this &euro;58 million total, over &euro;28 million relates to five large sewerage schemes in Ballaghadereen, Boyle, Monskland, Roscommon town and Castlerea. Major water schemes, such as the north east Roscommon water augmentation and treatment scheme, the Arigna regional water supply scheme, the Boyle-Ardcarne regional water supply scheme and the Roscommon central regional water supply schemes are also included in the programme. Funding has also been provided under the serviced land initiative to bring additional serviced residential sites onstream as rapidly as possible to meet housing needs at a variety of locations around the county.</P>
    <P>Castlerea sewerage scheme is included in the current water services programme. Stage 1 of the scheme was approved to commence construction this year at an estimated cost of &euro;4.19 million, when the programme was published in July 2000. However, in the meantime, Roscommon County Council last year submitted contract documents for a much enlarged version of the original scheme that would cost over &euro;13 million, three times more than the approved scheme.</P>
    <P>Members will appreciate that, against a background of a cost increase of that magnitude, my Department would have to take all necessary steps to satisfy itself that such a larger and more costly scheme was necessary before it could reach any decision on the expanded proposal. Accordingly , there has been ongoing consultation and correspondence between the Department and the council with a view to resolving the various issues that arise. Further clarification of some matters has been only received from the council in recent weeks.</P>
    <P>The Department is examining the various submissions from the council and this process will be brought to a conclusion as speedily as possible. What has been said will be fully considered in that context.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, to the House. I am pleased that he, as the relevant Minister dealing with the matter, has come into the House to reply.</P>
      <P>I raise a sad and tragic case, that of a person who is into his eleventh day on a hunger and thirst strike. He is an ex-taxi driver who suffered a stroke ten hours or so after hearing the announcement on radio that deregulation of the taxi industry had been introduced. He has suffered severe permanent damage to the right side of his body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1013" />I met him and his family last night. The priest was there and the man in question was given the last rites. We are approaching a critical time for him. His contention is that the deregulation of the taxi industry contributed directly to his medical condition, the shock of which caused him to become permanently disabled. He has not driven a taxi since. The value of his taxi plate was £85,000 at the time. He has taken this action on the basis that the State has a responsibility to him in relation to his health and loss of earnings and that some mechanism should have been found to ensure he got some contribution in his current disabled capacity.</P>
    <P>He went on hunger strike before. On 16 August 2001, after a 32 day hunger strike, a Minister and special adviser to the Taoiseach called to his home to discuss the matter and persuaded him to abandon the hunger strike on the basis that the matter would be dealt with in the Social Welfare Bill in February this year. Debate on the Bill is drawing to a close and there is no provision that would address his problem.</P>
    <P>The promises, made to him in the presence of his wife, his son and the president and vice-president of the National Taxi Drivers' Union on 16 August and subsequently confirmed by the Taoiseach, related to an invalidity pension, a full medical card and retrospective moneys owed in that context. The witnesses have confirmed his version of events. He was denied the S-type invalidity pension on appeal in August 2001, as it was determined that while he was permanently incapable of work and had made 260 paid contributions, he was short 48 contributions in classes A, E or H in the last complete tax year. That had to be the case as he was incapacitated and unable to work during that time.</P>
    <P>The man, who is in a severe condition, has placed his motto on his wall as the basis of his ongoing actions &ndash;&ldquo;Principle, dignity and pride&rdquo;. He says he intends to continue his hunger strike, as he has nothing further to lose but his life. He is a diabetic, which means he may lose his sight.</P>
    <P>The problem faced by the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, is that he has to square the circle, to find a mechanism in the social welfare system to address the matter, while not causing an undue number of applicants. As the appellant is 61 years of age, he is due to receive a contributory old age pension in five years' time. He has lost his earnings and potential earnings as a result of the totally unforeseen deregulation of the taxi industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Taoiseach have agreed that a hardship committee should be established to deal with those most affected by deregulation and I understand it will meet next week. We have to satisfy this individual that the loss to his livelihood is acknowledged and remunerate him within the social welfare code in a manner that encourages him to cease his hunger strike. He understands that commitments were made to deal with his problems in legislation and I hope a mechanism can be found to do so under the Social Wel<Col N="1014" /> fare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 2002, which is due to come to this House next week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The matters which are the subject of this debate are related to the social welfare entitlements of an individual who was a self-employed taxi driver. As Senator Costello is aware, under social welfare legislation decisions in relation to claims or entitlements must be made by independently appointed deciding officers and appeals officers. The officers are statutorily appointed and as Minister I have no role in making such decisions. I cannot instruct my officials to make a payment to which there is no legal entitlement, just as I cannot direct them not to make a payment if one is due. I regret that the appellant has chosen to go on hunger strike. Many people, including the Taoiseach, the Minister of State, Deputy Eoin Ryan, many officials in my Department and the South Western Area Health Board and I have spent many hours trying to resolve this difficult matter.</P>
      <P>The person concerned was a self-employed taxi driver for 20 years until 22 November 2000 when he suffered a stroke. He has not been employed since that date and the severity of his illness will probably prevent him from returning to work. Following a period of hospitalisation he applied for disability allowance, which is means tested, and invalidity pension from my Department. Under existing legislative provisions, he does not qualify for either of these long-term disability income support payments. As a protest against the decision not to give him a pension or allowance, he commenced a hunger strike in July 2001 which lasted over 30 days. Following a series of interventions which took place during the initial hunger strike and the payment of a once-off urgent needs payment by the South Western Area Health Board, he ended the strike on 17 August 2001. He has since recommenced the hunger strike, however.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Disability allowance is a weekly allowance paid to people with a specified disability. It is subject to a medical examination and a means test. An application for disability allowance was received on 16 March 2001 along with representations from the National Taxi Drivers' Union. The appellant satisfied the medical criteria. He did not satisfy the means test as his weekly means, based on his spouse's employment, far exceeded the statutory limit and his application was accordingly refused by a deciding officer on 28 April 2001. He was advised of the decision and the reasons for it, as well as his right of appeal within 21 days to the social welfare appeals office, which is independent of the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs and his Department. He appealed against the decision and forwarded supplementary medical information from a medical social worker in St. James's Hospital. A deciding officer considered the supplementary information but the decision was not changed. The man was advised of this on 2 July 2001 and his <Col N="1015" /> case was submitted to the social welfare appeals office for formal decision.</P>
    <P>In order to qualify for invalidity pension, which the appellant also claimed, one must be permanently incapable of work and must have made at least 260 paid PRSI contributions at the appropriate rate, with 48 paid or credited similar contributions in the last complete tax year before claiming. An application for invalidity pension was submitted by the person involved on 19 May 2001 and it was decided on 25 June of that year that he was not entitled to such a pension as he did not satisfy the PRSI conditions. He was notified of this decision and the reasons for it as well as his right of appeal. He did not satisfy the conditions for eligibility to invalidity pension as he had no qualifying contributions in the governing contribution year from 6 April 2000 to 5 April 2001.</P>
    <P>As he had not made the appropriate PRSI contributions, he does not currently qualify for an invalidity pension. He does not qualify for disability allowance as his household income is in excess of the statutory limit as a result of his spouse's earnings. It has been emphasised to him that if his wife was not working and cared for him full-time in the home, he would qualify for the means tested disability allowance and she would receive a carer's benefit. These facts were indicated to them many months ago. If she took time off from work to mind him in the home, she would qualify for the carer's allowance and the attendant free schemes. He does not qualify for disability allowance at present because of his spouse's income and that of other people in the household. Two once-off urgent needs payments were made to Mr. Flanagan over the period. This individual has paid only S contributions &ndash; self-employed contributions &ndash; in some of the intervening years since 1983. Such contributions are not reckonable for invalidity pension purposes. In other words, no self-employed person who pays a stamp is paying towards an invalidity pension.</P>
    <P>Given the special circumstances of the case, arrangements were made for an appeals officer to hold an oral hearing of both appeals as a matter of urgency. The oral hearing was held on 1 August 2001. The appellant attended and was accompanied by his wife and son. The issues for decision were fully explained by the appeals officer and all present indicated that they understood them. Both appeals failed because in each case the statutory entitlement conditions &ndash; statutory means conditions in the case of disability allowance and statutory social insurance record requirements in the case of invalidity pension &ndash; were not fulfilled. The appeals officer made his decisions on 1 August 2001 and notifications issued on 2 August 2001.</P>
    <P>If there is any change in this individual's circumstances the Department will immediately review the question of any entitlements which he <Col N="1016" /> may have. I repeat the guarantee from the Department that his wife would qualify for carer's allowance or carer's benefit and that he would qualify for disability allowance if his wife was not working.</P>
    <P>As regards the broader issue of social insurance cover for the self-employed, any measure which was introduced could not be ring-fenced to only include taxi drivers, but would have to apply to all self-employed persons. When self-employed persons first became insured under the social insurance system in 1988, it was only with regard to old age and survivor's pensions. Their stamp contributions since then do not contain a contribution element in respect of disability/invalidity allowance as opposed to full rate contributions by way of an A stamp. In line with the recommendations of the National Pensions Board, they are not covered for other benefits under the system, including invalidity pension.</P>
    <P>Any extension of invalidity pension or other benefits to self-employed contributors would have major financial implications and would require substantial changes in the general social insurance arrangements for the self-employed. The rate of PRSI payable by the self-employed would require further examination if additional social welfare entitlements were to be provided. If all self-employed persons were to qualify for short-term and long-term disability benefit and an invalidity pension, which is being requested in this case, the annual cost would be over &euro;100 million. I have some sympathy with the view that self-employed persons should have some cover regarding disability and invalidity, but it is a matter of finding a mechanism and estimating the cost of meeting the bill. We estimate that the annual cost of allowing all self-employed persons to qualify for disability benefit and invalidity pension would be over &euro;100 million.</P>
    <P>Yesterday my officials and I met representatives of the National Taxi Drivers' Union to discuss the broader issue of providing invalidity pensions to self-employed people generally. I emphasise that this would not be a short-term solution and would need to be considered carefully. We agreed that further discussions would take place between my officials and the National Taxi Drivers' Union with a view to developing possible options in this regard. These options would have to be discussed with the social partners in the spirit of partnership.</P>
    <P>I have every sympathy with the difficult circumstances faced by this gentleman and his family. I assure the House that every effort has been made to resolve this matter. The Taoiseach and I, and our officials, are available at any time to try to assist the situation. I appeal to the individual involved to reconsider his actions and, together with his family and friends, to end his hunger strike.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that this man is on the eleventh day of his hunger and thirst strike, that it was impossible for him to make contributions in <Col N="1017" /> at least six months of the previous tax year due to disability and that he is only four or five years away from retirement at which point he would be entitled to an invalidity pension, can the Minister give some indication that, in the circumstances surrounding deregulation, a reduced pension might be given because of the highly unusual and unprecedented circumstances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Even if they had been paid, the type of stamps involved would not have qualified this individual for an invalidity pension. Since their introduction in 1988, self-employed stamps do not qualify persons for invalidity pension or disability benefit.</P>
      <P>The broader issue of pensions for the self-employed is a more long-term matter. The overall cost would be &euro;100 million to make these payments available to everyone, even on a reduced basis. Under the social welfare code means tested payments are the fallback if someone does not pay the right contributions. However, in this case, the means far exceed the means test limits. There is substantial income in the household involved.</P>
      <P>I am independent and do not make the decisions. I cannot order my officials to make payments in these circumstances, nor can I tell them not to pay someone in circumstances where, perhaps, he or she is entitled to a payment. If the Senator has any influence with this gentleman, he should point out that a scheme is being discussed between the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the National Taxi Drivers' Union regarding hardship cases which should be investigated. If this gentleman's spouse is not working and not in receipt of an income, then she would automatically qualify for a carer's benefit with all the attendant free schemes. In such circumstances where his wife was no longer in receipt of an income, he would also qualify for a disability benefit. That option has been on the table for at least the last nine months, but has not been taken up.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to see the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dan Wallace, in the House. I think the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development is trying to keep away from me. I hope this issue will also be regarded as an environmental issue, but I would be grateful if the Minister of State brings my views to the attention of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development.</P>
      <P>I have raised this issue before in the House and do so again because there is a lack of urgency in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development regarding the introduction of an all-island animal tracing scheme. I have also been in contact with Minister Bríd Rodgers and get a sense of greater action in her Department than in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1018" />We have had the dreadful spectacle of BSE over the past decade and last year we also experienced foot and mouth disease. A serious problem in both instances was the poor control over animal tracing. We were barely able to trace animals which came from the Scottish, English and Welsh hills to Northern Ireland and then to the Republic of Ireland. This situation will give rise to serious trouble.</P>
    <P>The lack of action is cavalier given that this country depends greatly on the production of meat. Consumers, domestic and foreign, want to know from where their meat came. We say we have a farm to fork method of identification, but it would be better to call it a farms to fork method because there are great gaps in our knowledge.</P>
    <P>I was urged to raise this issue because in the United States experimental work suggests the possibility that prions, the infective source in BSE, may have transferred into mouse muscle. The research has not been peer reviewed, and I do not know how good it is, but it should make us prick up our ears and realise this area should concern us. In the United Kingdom it has been suggested that BSE can be found in sheep and there have been suggestions that lambs should be slaughtered younger and younger. New problems are constantly arising, but we seem to be making very little progress in introducing an all-Ireland animal tracing scheme.</P>
    <P>Flushed with success from having an amendment accepted to the Diseases of Animals (Amendment) Bill in order that electronic and other methods of identification brought forward by the European Union could be used here, it is disappointing to see that the sheep tagging scheme has moved no further from where it was in the autumn. I cannot understand the reason there is no sense of urgency.</P>
    <P>While we have done fairly well, particularly Senator Quinn, in identifying the meat processing factories from which meat comes to supermarkets and thence the consumer, we have done little or nothing regarding the identification of meat from when it leaves the farm until it arrives at the meat processing factory and is slaughtered. I will describe one method of identification because I know those involved in it &ndash; geneticists in Trinity College who have introduced a method of identification called IdentiGEN. Senator Quinn uses it in his supermarkets. It relies on the identification of meat using the DNA of the animal as the trace element as it progresses from the meat processing factory to the supermarket shelf. It is always possible to identify the heifer or bullock from which meat came by the DNA code.</P>
    <P>There has also been progress in bringing forward better methods of identification from the farm to the meat processing factory. Last year at the height of the foot and mouth disease outbreak, there were considerable numbers of cattle running around County Tipperary, in particular with no ear tags. When tags are removed we do not know what happens to the cow in question. One method of identification relies on DNA evi<Col N="1019" /> dence. When the animal is tagged, a biological sample is put into a tamper proof container connected to the tag and is identified with the same bar code and ID as the tag. The sample consists of cartilage preserved by a desiccant in the container. Consequently it may be stored for long periods at ambient temperatures. Should a concern arise over the identification of a particular animal, a sample can be collected from the animal and compared to the ear tag sample through DNA analysis. Not only does this make the monitoring of live animals much easier, it serves as a deterrent against fraudulently transferring tags from animal to animal.</P>
    <P>The introduction of such an identification system would give a powerful signal to foreign buyers that we are serious about Irish meat being exactly as it is labelled. If it comes from a certain farm, the customer in Egypt or Paris can be certain that it is the animal he or she is buying and there is continuity in the supply chain. What are the views of the Department and what progress is it making on this important issue?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>The events of the past year, in particular the foot and mouth emergency, highlighted the absolute importance of co-operation, consultation and harmonisation between the North and South of Ireland on issues affecting animal and public health. It is more apparent than ever that animal diseases have the potential to cause this country serious social and economic damage, with effects which cut through every section of our society. While advances in veterinary medicine have provided us with better tools than ever before with which to treat such diseases, certain features of modern life and trade increase the potential for the spread of animal diseases between and within countries.</P>
      <P>Increased mobility and the facility for international travel, the trade relationships which exist in the context of the single market for the European Union, and greater liberalisation of trade under the auspices of the World Trade Organisation, while positive, are nonetheless factors which contribute to a greater potential for the spread of animal diseases than might have been the case in the past. Add to this the fact that irrespective of the potential for damage to their neighbours and their country, there will always be those who are tempted to engage for naked, personal, financial gain in abuses involving the illegal movement of animals and it will be apparent that we cannot afford to relax in relation to this area of concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The FMD crisis underscored the importance of the closest co-operation between the authorities in Dublin and Belfast in relation to animal health issues. It is clear that there are those who will readily exploit any weaknesses in such co-operation, and it is equally apparent that there will be considerable benefit to agriculture in Ireland as a <Col N="1020" /> whole, and all who depend on it, if we act together to protect animal health status from any threats, internal or external.</P>
    <P>Throughout the FMD crisis, Ministers and officials from both jurisdictions worked closely. This work is continuing and has intensified under the offices of the North South Ministerial Council. A steering group and nine working groups, comprising officials from both Administrations, have been established and are working under various headings on the development of animal health strategies for Ireland. It is my belief, one shared throughout Ireland, that the interests of farmers and their families are best served by the greatest degree of harmonisation and by treating Ireland as one entity for the purposes of animal health. That would afford us an unprecedented degree of protection against animal disease threats from beyond our shores and is a goal to which Minister Rodgers and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh, are committed.</P>
    <P>A key element of an all-Ireland animal health strategy is the adoption of a common approach to animal identification and tracing. Although our current systems may have been developed independently, I agree with the concept of compatibility and data exchange between systems. One of the tasks of the NSMC working groups on animal identification, particularly the group working to eliminate cross-Border fraud, is to continue co-operating in IT with a view to improving the exchange of key information and developing compatible systems with common interfaces.</P>
    <P>There is already an exchange of information in respect of cattle exported through Northern Ireland, both for traceability purposes and as a means of verification of entitlement to EU livestock payments. In addition, a project is commencing to streamline and improve the systems for exchange of data incorporating electronic transmission and receipt of information.</P>
    <P>As regards systems for sheep and pigs, there have been numerous discussions with our counterparts in Northern Ireland with a view to introducing arrangements that recognise our common interests in the matter. I fully support the concept of transparent and effective animal traceability systems throughout the island of Ireland.</P>

      <P>I ask the Minister of State to tell the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development that this response is hopeless. I am getting more information from the Department in Northern Ireland. Until food is removed from the ambit of the Minister, I do not see how any progress will be made in this area because the consumer is not being considered an important party.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 4.35 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Friday, 22 March 2002.</P>
