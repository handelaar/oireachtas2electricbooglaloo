      <P>I have received notice from Senator Minihan that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to outline the reason for the delay in awarding the building contract for the new Cork School of Music.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator O'Brien of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to indicate if he has received the report from the North Eastern Health Board regarding the tragic death of a new born infant whose mother was refused admission to Monaghan General Hospital last week.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Finucane of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to clarify when a replacement primary school will be provided for St. Nicholas's primary school in Adare, County Limerick, as this school was promised in 1999.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Higgins of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to make a statement on the imminent closure of Bellacorick power station, County Mayo, with the loss of 271 jobs in the ESB and Bord na Móna, and the plans she has to replace the lost jobs with alternative employment.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Minihan, Finucane and O'Brien as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. I regret that I have had to rule out of order the matter raised by Senator Higgins as the Minister has no official responsibility in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business today is No. 1, a motion referred to the Joint Committee <Col N="1982" />on the Environment and Local Government, on which it has completed its deliberations and which relates to specific acts against the environment that may be prosecuted as criminal offences, without debate; No. 2, Social Welfare Bill, 2002 &ndash; all Stages, with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes, all other Senators ten minutes and Members may share time and to conclude no later than 5 p.m.; No. 3, an earlier signature motion concerning the Social Welfare Bill, 2002; No. 4, Statute Law (Restatement) Bill, 2000 <i>[Seanad Bill amended by the Dáil]</i>&ndash; Report Stage, to be taken from 5 p.m. and to conclude no later than 6 p.m.; and No. 5, Immigration Bill, 2002 &ndash; Committee Stage, to commence on the conclusion of No. 4 and to last until 8.30 p.m.</P>
      <P>After the Order of Business, I wish to meet with the leaders of Fine Gael and Labour, and the representative of the Independent Senators&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;before he trips me up again, as no doubt he would like to. I wish to discuss the precise timing of debates. We will be able to have a sos at lunchtime, which would be highly desirable. In addition, I understand that the Social Welfare Bill may not last for the allotted time, although that situation may change. If we could have such a discussion after the Order of Business it would be helpful. I have liaised with the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, and the Minister who is taking the Immigration Bill, both of whom are committed to being present at their allocated times.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. B. Hayes Mr. B. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday, the Human Rights Commission published a far-reaching report concerning a proposal for the establishment of a Garda ombudsman in this jurisdiction. The Human Rights Commission was established under statute law and its reports are laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and are available in the Oireachtas Library. I am seeking a debate early in the new year on this significant report.</P>
      <P>As the Cathaoirleach will be aware, an eminent former Member of this House, Dr. Maurice Manning, is now president of the Human Rights Commission. The commission has taken a view that is somewhat different to that of the Government concerning the need for an ombudsman for the Garda Síochána. The Government's view, as set out in An Agreed Programme for Government, is to establish an independent Garda inspectorate. The commission holds the view that the appointment of an ombudsman would be a more sensible step. This would be in line with the Police Ombudsman of Northern Ireland who has done terrific work since the establishment of her office following the Good Friday Agreement. I am, therefore, seeking an early debate on this important issue, which all Members have a direct interest in discussing before the Government makes its decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1983" />Will the Leader ask her colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, to make a statement in the House concerning the dual mandate? I agree with Senator McCarthy's comments yesterday to the effect that it is time for the Minister to make a statement in the Seanad or the Dáil about his intentions. I personally have no particular interest in the matter, benign and agreeable as I am on all these issues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I echo that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. B. Hayes Mr. B. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>However, I would like to hear the Minister outline the Government's view. We have heard it bandied about in the national press and the broadcast media, but the Minister should make a short statement of intent to the House today or tomorrow before the Seanad rises for the Christmas recess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>He could do so after today's parliamentary party meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise another point which is related to this significant and serious issue. I do not suggest the Government is acting unconstitutionally or otherwise, but it is acting outside the spirit of the law and the debate in the House.</P>
      <P>During the course of the debate on the legislation, to which Senator Brian Hayes referred, in this House and the Lower House, there was a lengthy discussion regarding the importance of directly elected mayors. That issue was seen as an enticement to encouraging more people to participate in local politics and ensuring that the office assumed a status in society. It was an extremely important discussion and there was an understanding that we would move in the direction outlined. I accept, however, that the Government is entitled to make a decision not to do so. This is an issue in which I am disinterested and which is of no concern to me personally. Directly elected mayors in other countries hold enormous attractions for society, be it as figureheads or executives. I know politicians in other parties are not enthusiastic about this matter. There are two issues involved. The establishment of the title &ldquo;mayor&rdquo; has given a new distinction to that office. I request a full debate on the issue.</P>
      <P>On the point raised by Senator Hayes, I support the idea of a dual mandate. People should be allowed to elect whom they wish, when they wish and for whatever reason. I have always held that view. I know it is a shameful position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Being a regular double-jobber, far be it for me to talk down to people on that issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Ms O'Rourke Ms O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is enjoying a personal hiatus at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important these matters are discussed in that way.</P>
      <P>We must also deal with the matter of where we stand on the council of the west. I will not abandon that issue which is another of interest to people in rural areas to which only half a day's news is dedicated. We have buried the issue of the council of the west and blocked Waterford Airport. We are urbanising the country at will. It is not a matter of taking one side against the other, we are creating a split society. The House must push the idea of a regional approach, of which the west and other provincial areas will be a part, to development policy. I am not saying people have not done so before, but this issue should be as important as any other.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted everybody is now of the view that we should appoint a Garda ombudsman, an idea first put forward by my party approximately two years ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>My party produced the detailed proposals for it. If all the people who agreed with my party voted for it, I would probably be sitting in the Leader's seat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Ms O'Rourke Ms O'Rourke">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader would be sitting in my place.</P>
      <P>We like to discuss many things that happen in the world. There is something particularly offensive about the Chairman of the Palestinian Authority being refused permission to attend mass in Bethlehem on Christmas Day. I suggest that the leaders of all the groups in the House sign a motion to be passed without debate tomorrow morning calling on the Israeli Government to reverse that decision. It is a simple request. Most people agree that the decision was wrong. I ask that the Leader consider the introduction of such a motion today, with a view to voting on it tomorrow. It does not matter if there is not full agreement on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are scheduled to discuss Committee Stage of the Immigration Bill, 2002, this evening. At present, however, there is no list of amendments available. This is not simply because Opposition Members were late submitting amendments. My party's amendments were submitted last Thursday. The Government's amendments only arrived yesterday afternoon. I am aware of how hard the staff in this House work and that no blame can <Col N="1985" />be attached to them. This Bill has been on the Order Paper for the past six months. The Government could at least have drafted its amendments in time to comply with the rules of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, but I am entitled to a full list of amendments on a yellow sheet which the staff of the House work very hard to produce. That list has not been produced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The gist of the amendments is contained in this morning's newspapers, but they are not available in proper form in the House. I suggest the Government, or the Minister involved, has decided that the media is a more important forum than the Oireachtas in terms of discussing these amendments. That is as close to contempt for the House as a Minister can display. It is not impossible to deal with these matters rationally. The Leader has been reasonable about the timescale for dealing with this legislation. We had some misunderstandings, but we have reached a reasonable position and I thank the Leader for her capacity to deal with the Government yet again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Ms O'Rourke Ms O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Rourke</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has let the House down. A protest should be sent, through the Cathaoirleach, in this regard. Government Departments have the resources to produce amendments on time. If they cannot do so, they should request that business be postponed. The idea of Government submitting amendments late, over-working staff in the House and leaving the Opposition in a position of considerable disadvantage is ridiculous.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin" hpid="Mr. Hanafin Mr. Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Ryan's proposal regarding the Palestinian leader. It is reasonable and is something which should be close to the hearts of the Irish people. Ireland underwent its religious emancipation in the 1800s. It is entirely reasonable that people should be free to worship, particularly at Christmas. I am a great supporter of Israel's right to survive, thrive and live in peace and harmony with its neighbours. The best way to do that is to treat its neighbours with respect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>Many Members of this House and the Lower House were lobbied extensively by traditional music lovers. All of us would have supported the concept in the Arts Bill that appropriate recognition be given to traditional music. I compliment Senator Ó Murchú for his crusade within the Comhaltas movement, which we would have supported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1986" />I am concerned at the change in the Government's direction regarding the special emphasis provision. I would like to see the Arts Bill taken in this House as early as possible in the New Year. We could discuss it and, perhaps, appropriate amendments could be sent forward to the Lower House regarding the restoration of what was contained in the spirit of the Bill, which we would all, in principle, support.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all aware of the tragedy of the family who lost a premature baby in Cavan Hospital recently. I hope Senators will note the statement in today's newspapers by Tom Clarke, professor of neo-natal paediatrics in the College of Surgeons, to the effect that he feels the Minister for Health and Children is being unfairly treated because the survival rate of such infants, even in maternity hospitals in the city, is very poor.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health and Children generates many problems itself by failing to release information. My colleagues have not been able to obtain information regarding the death rate of full-term infants delivered at home in the past five years. I have been writing to the Department since April and have not received any satisfactory replies. Even a freedom of information request has been refused. I have been told to obtain the information from the Central Statistics Office. There is no openness or transparency on this serious issue. I am seeking a debate in the new session on maternity services in this country. I have received more satisfactory replies from the midwives delivering children than I have from the Department of Health and Children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Henry in regard to the availability of information from the Department of Health and Children. In recent days health boards received letters from the Department of Health and Children regarding the preparation of their plans for 2003. The health strategy, Quality and Fairness, is in a shambles. Serious concerns are expressed by public representatives, particularly members of health boards, in regard to funding for 2003. Dictatorial letters were issued by the Department of Health and Children which read as follows, &ldquo;The Minister for Health and Children has stated&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to return to a question I raised yesterday on licensing laws, planning and so on. There should be a debate in the House on the matter which should include the question of planning. It is extremely disturbing to find out today that planning permission has been granted by An Bord Pleanála for some kind of visitor centre on top of the Cliffs of Moher. Apparently a hotel will be built at some stage. This type of thing was kicked out when it was tried north of the Border on the Giants Causeway. The way in which An Bord Pleanála currently operates is a cause for concern, therefore, there should be a full debate on planning matters.</P>
      <P>I learned today that people will be restricted in certain areas of Galway, notably the Gaeltacht, in terms of being allowed to build houses. It seems that one must now be fluent in the Irish language. I am all in favour of the Irish language but that seems to be an extraordinary narrowing of views and damaging to the Irish language because it will create a reservation. Will inhabitants be provided with wigwams and totem poles?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what the Minister is doing in regard to the dual mandate and I hope he manages to have the legislation passed. There is a practical reason for that measure which we in this House know perfectly well, that is, one cannot get meetings of committees because there is some kind of little council huddle in Ballydehob which people insist on going to, which is wrong.</P>

      <P>I do not agree with Senator Finucane in regard to the Arts Bill. I was interested to receive a heavily orchestrated campaign on the issue, which I read with great interest. I then discovered that distinguished traditional musicians such as Paul Brady and the Chieftains took a completely different view. I am pleased the Minister had the courage to listen to these submissions because he was perfectly correct to do so.</P>
      <P>Why are we not having Private Members' time today? It is usual to have Private Members' time and, unless I missed it, there was no mention of it in the Leader's remarks.</P>

We need to debate the whole composition of An Bord Pleanála to see how accountable and transparent it is. I ask the Leader to request the Mini<Col N="1988" />ster at some time in the new year to come into the House for a debate on the issue, purely to refresh our minds as to An Bord Pleanála's role in relation to county councils and local authorities. Questions need to be asked at this stage.</P>

      <P>I ask the Leader to draw to the attention of the Minister for Agriculture and Food the suggestion from Europe yesterday that in any future case of foot and mouth disease vaccinations should be introduced. I am a great believer, as many of us are, of subsidiarity which means decisions are reached much closer to where citizens live. More and more decisions are being made at European level and taken away from individual nations. The case made about vaccination is understandable compared to the burning of carcasses in Britain last year, but dangers are posed to the agricultural industry, the tourism industry and so on as a result of decisions being made in Europe rather than in this country. I urge the Department of Agriculture and Food to debate this issue in the immediate future so that Europe does not foist something on us which is not in our interest.</P>

The issue of whether all births need to take place in large high-tech maternity hospitals is something which is worthy of discussion.</P>
      <P>I would like to comment on what Senator Norris said. If we believe in pluralism, multiculturalism and so on, those of us who belong to the dominant language tradition in practice in this country &ndash; maybe that is most of us if it is English-speaking &ndash; should have a bit of respect and not trample over places.</P>

      <P>I would like to avail of this opportunity to thank Senator Finucane for his kind comments this morning. I have no doubt, given the part of Ireland from which he comes, that he appreciates the importance of the traditional arts at local community level, for which I thank him. I thank the Fine Gael Party generally, particularly Deputy Deenihan, for the guidance and leadership he has given in this regard, includ<Col N="1989" />ing Members of the other political parties, all of whom have united on this issue, which is good for the arts.</P>
      <P>The Minister put his finger on it this morning, and what he said on radio is an indictment of the Arts Council. Two main issues were aired. He said there is no coherent policy in the Arts Council for traditional arts after 50 years and adequate funding has not been provided. When reference is made to this &ndash; it is a pity Senator Norris has left &ndash; we should remember that PricewaterhouseCoopers presented the Minister with a comprehensive document. Its findings were quite clear. First, there must be a radical change where the traditional arts are concerned, second, substantial funding must be provided in the future and, third, an appropriate structure must be put in place. PricewaterhouseCoopers gave two options &ndash; a separate council or the Arts Council appropriately restructured. The rank and file of people throughout this country want to see this happening.</P>

      <P>Senators have requested a discussion on the Irish language related aspects of the County Galway development plan. When discussing the Irish language, we should remember that it is important to include people rather than to exclude them. Various people in this House may have an opportunity to debate the matter, but I hope they also make submissions in relation to it. We cannot forbid people in one part of a county from living in another area. If we have the opportunity to discuss this subject, it is important that we separate emotions from the central issues of equality and access for those in Galway city who may wish to live in the Gaeltacht areas. We cannot allow divisions to continue.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1990" />The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources should come before the House to discuss the proposed increase in the RTÉ licence fee. An increase in the subsidy to an authority such as RTÉ needs to be carefully considered, particularly in light of the fact that a television programme shown on Sunday afternoons contains explicit scenes of drug-taking and appears to condone under age sex involving a 14 year old. It is absolutely disgraceful and we should not facilitate an increased licence fee until RTÉ shows some form of responsibility.</P>

      <P>Senator Hayes also asked for an invitation to be extended to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to come to the House to discuss the dual mandate.

I believe the matter will be discussed later today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Toole also mentioned that the council of the west is an important body and that clarification of its role is needed. I understand that the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, wants to examine the bodies that operate in the west to bring rationalisation to the area. The Minister has strongly <Col N="1991" />denied that he proposed the abolition of the council of the west, or even a diminution of its importance.</P>

      <P>Senator Ryan, with the support of Senator Hanafin, argued strongly that the House should issue a unanimous statement to the effect that the Israeli authorities' refusal to allow the Chairman of the Palestinian Authority, Mr. Arafat, to go to Bethlehem should be overturned. I agree with the Senator and I am sure other Senators feel that a motion, signed by representatives of the various groups in the House, should be passed without debate. It is a poignant matter to consider at Christmas, as the town of Bethlehem has a particular resonance for most people.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan also asked about the list of amendments. I agree that it is unfortunate that the definitive list is not yet available. It is not the fault, however, of the Cathaoirleach or the hard-working staff of the Seanad. I do not know why the amendments were received late by the Seanad officials. The Senator is right to state that it would be preferable if the amendments had been made available within the stated and proper time. It should not have happened and I apologise to the House for it.</P>

Senator Ó Murchú, like others, has a strong opinion on the traditional arts and he mentioned that the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy O'Donoghue, said during a radio interview this morning that there has been no coherent policy or funding for traditional arts. Different people have different points of view on this issue. The Minister is trying not to ghettoise but to ensure that the traditional arts have a clear and funded plan.</P>

    <P>Senator Henry called for a debate on home births and mentioned that she cannot find official statistics on the death rate of full-term children born at home. She claimed that there is a lack of transparency in the procedures. A debate on this topic would be useful and could be extended to include many similar matters. Senator Feeney agreed that a debate on the regulations that gov<Col N="1992" />ern home births would be a good idea and outlined her worries about to whom domiciliary midwives should report. I encountered a case of this nature two weeks ago. Home births are an attractive idea in many respects, but we need to put a shape on the sector.</P>
    <P>Senator Bannon said that he is worried about the health boards' service plans and allocations of funding for 2003. Without wanting to sound parsimonious, the health boards have received large increases in funding in recent years.</P>

Senators Norris and Cox raised the issue of housing in Gaeltacht areas. Senator Ormonde asked for a general debate on An Bord Pleanála outside the context of any particular Bill. She has made similar strong requests in the past. I will endeavour to get the Minister, Deputy Cullen, to come to the House in the new year to discuss these matters.</P>
      <P>I agree that the County Galway development plan, to which Senator Cox referred, is a national issue. Are we to treat people as if they are in an encampment or a reservation by telling them that they can live in one place and not in another? My personal opinion, in case people in Galway start to write to me, is that it would be wrong to do so. Senator Cox was right to say that we should have a debate on the matter.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinn said that we should not adhere slavishly to European laws, particularly the law on animal vaccination. He argued that we should decide our policy on such issues for ourselves.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Is breá an rud é go bhfuil mé ar ais sa tSeanad. Seo an chéad ócáid dom Bille a cur ós comhair an tSeanaid. I am very pleased as Minister for Social and Family Affairs to introduce my first Bill in this House. This is one of two Bills, intended to implement the social welfare package announced in the recent budget.</P>
      <P>This year's social welfare package amounts to &euro;530 million and represents some 40% of the total budget allocation of &euro;1.3 billion. This is a reflection of the Government's priority to protect the living standards of social welfare recipients at a time when difficult decisions have to be made with regard to the management of the public finances.</P>
      <P>Since the Government took up office in 1997, Ireland has changed dramatically for the better. The number of people at work has risen by 400,000 to 1.8 million, the rate of unemployment has fallen dramatically from 10.3% to 4.6% and the number of long-term unemployed has dropped from 90,000 to 22,000. Social welfare spending rose by over &euro;3.5 billion between 1997 and 2002, well in excess of the rate of inflation, and payment rates for both recipients and their families have improved very considerably in real terms. Between 1997 and 2002, we increased the main payment amount for a pensioner couple by 50%.</P>
      <P>As I outlined to Senators last month during the debate on the development of the social welfare system, the policies pursued by the Government over recent years in combating unemployment and in bringing about real improvements in social welfare have led to significant reductions in the level of consistent poverty. In 1994, the level of consistent poverty was 15.1% and this was reduced to 6% in 2000, the latest year for which figures are available.</P>
      <P>However, this Government is most anxious to protect the weak and vulnerable in our society and to safeguard the gains made in building social inclusion. We are delivering an additional &euro;833 million in social welfare spending next year, bringing the projected level of spending to over &euro;10 billion for the first time. Social welfare expenditure in 2003 will be &euro;4.5 billion higher than it was in 1997, an increase of nearly 80%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objectives of the social welfare package are to increase or maintain the value of all rates of payment in real terms, to give additional increases to those aged 66 and over, in particular those on widow's and old age pension, to continue to increase pensions in line with the programme for Government commitment to increase the State pension to &euro;200 by 2007, to increase or maintain the real value of all qualified adult rates <Col N="1994" />of payment and to ensure that they do not fall as a proportion of the associated personal rate and to make significant progress in our programme of increases in the level of child benefit.</P>
    <P>I will now outline the main provisions of the Bill. Sections 2 and 3 of the Bill provide for an increase of &euro;10 in the personal rates of old age, retirement and invalidity pensions,over age 65, per week. This will bring the rate of old age contributory pension to &euro;157.30 per week and the old age non-contributory pension to &euro;144 per week. This confirms our commitment to pensioners and marks a substantial first step in implementing our intention, announced in the programme for Government, to increase the State pension to &euro;200 per week. In overall terms, it represents an increase of about 59 per cent over the rate payable in 1997, well ahead of the increase in inflation.</P>
    <P>In 2000 we gave a commitment to increase the widow's and widower's contributory pension for those over 66 to the full old age contributory pension. I am pleased to say that the special increase of &euro;11 for this category, provided in section 2 of the Bill, will bring the new rate to &euro;155.80, within &euro;1.50 of the full old age contributory rate.</P>
    <P>The Government is also conscious of the needs of other vulnerable groups in society, particularly those who fulfil a caring role, widows, widowers and those on invalidity pension. We are providing for an increase of &euro;7 in the personal rates of those payments. This will bring the standard personal rates of invalidity and widow's pensions to &euro;130.30 for a pensioner under age 65 and the rate of carer's allowance for a carer aged under 66 to &euro;129.60 per week.</P>
    <P>We are also committed to protecting the real value of other social welfare payments. Over the period from 1997 general social welfare increases have increased well ahead of inflation and average earnings. In this budget, we are maintaining the value of these payments in line with inflation by providing an increase of &euro;6 per week in the personal weekly rate of disability and unemployment payments, one parent family payment, supplementary welfare allowance and farm assist.</P>
    <P>We are also providing for further increases of &euro;7.70 per week for contributory pensioners, qualified adults aged 66 and over, with proportionate amounts for those on reduced payments. A pensioner couple on a full social welfare payment will therefore get an increase of &euro;17.70 per week. The qualified adult allowance for a person over 66 has risen from 72% of the old age contributory pension in 1997 to 77% in 2003 and now represents 84% of the old age non-contributory pension. As promised in the programme for Government this will be increased in the coming years to the full old age non-contributory pension rate to benefit women in the home who do not qualify in their own right for the contributory pension.</P>
    <P>Other qualified adult allowances are being maintained in line with increases in the relevant personal rates. The increases in these allowances <Col N="1995" />are as follows: &euro;6.70 per week for old age non-contributory pensions where the qualified adult is aged under or over 66 and for contributory pensions where he is aged under 66; &euro;5 per week for invalidity pension where the qualified adult is under 66 and &euro;4 per week for all other qualified adult payments. Proportionate increases will be applied where persons are in receipt of reduced rate QAA payments.</P>
    <P>Now that the tax year has moved to the start of January, the budget increases will again become payable from the first pay-day in January. People receiving short-term payments such as unemployment payments will receive their increases immediately in the first week in January. In the case of certain people on long-term payments such as pensions, because of the time needed to print and distribute pension books, pensioners will receive their increases in arrears somewhat later. However, those who receive long-term payment by means of electronic payment through a post office or bank will, this year, receive their increases on the first pay-day in January.</P>
    <P>Some 235,000 people, mainly widows, widowers, one-parent families, invalidity pensioners and persons receiving carer's allowance, will receive a lump sum arrears payment for six weeks of the budget increases in mid February. This will be included in their new order books effective from that date. For example, a widow on a contributory pension over 66 years of age will receive a backdated payment of &euro;66. A further 262,000 recipients, mainly old age and retirement pensioners and disability allowance recipients who are due to get their new order books in April, will receive a special payment in mid-February comprising six weeks arrears of the budget increase and seven weeks' advance payment. For example, a pensioner couple over age 66 will receive a lump sum payment of &euro;260 in mid-February.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill increases the weekly income thresholds for family income supplement from January next by &euro;17 per week. This will lead to a net gain of &euro;10.20 per week in the average FIS family payment. These increased payments for all FIS recipients will be paid immediately in the first week in January.</P>
    <P>Sections 5 and 6 of the Bill provide for an increase in the earnings ceiling from &euro;38,740 to &euro;40,420 per year for employees' social insurance (PRSI) contributions and in the income ceiling for payment of optional contributions. Section 6 of the Bill also provides for a restructuring of the rate of optional contributions payable by share fishermen The standard rate of contribution is being reduced from 5% to 4% and the minimum flat rate contribution is being reduced from &euro;253 to &euro;200 per annum. In addition, the PRSI free allowance is being increased from &euro;1,321 to &euro;2,500 per annum. These changes reflect reductions already made in recent years for most other PRSI contributors.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1996" />This Social Welfare Bill, the first of two instalments, builds on the progress made in the social inclusion area by this Government over recent years. It safeguards the living standards of those who rely on social welfare and prioritises the allocation of resources in favour of those most in need.</P>
    <P>Gabhaim buíochas leis na Seanadóirí uilig as éisteacht liom agus tá súil agam go mbeidh díospóireacht breá againn. I commend the Bill to Seanad Éireann and look forward to a constructive and useful debate from Senators.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins" hpid="Mr. Cummins Mr. Cummins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire. I acknowledge the significant increases in the old age pension and child benefit in previous budgets. It was only correct that people on social welfare should share some of the benefits enjoyed by other sections of the community in recent years. When the purse strings tighten, however, the poor and vulnerable suffer the brunt of the cutbacks.</P>
      <P>All budgets involve choices, particularly a budget in the difficult economic environment brought about by the Government's spendthrift policies in the last two years. The Minister for Finance said that a key budget objective was to protect the weak in society. Those experiencing disadvantage, particularly in housing, were alarmed at what the Government chose to do and what it failed to do. Requiring the recipients of SWA rent supplement to contribute a minimum of &euro;12.40 instead of &euro;7.60 towards rent means that the &euro;6 increase per week in benefit is illusory. It is the economics of Paul Daniels, appearing to give an increase and then taking it away.</P>
      <P>The failure to protect the vulnerable is even more obvious when consumer price inflation is taken into account. This is the most inflationary budget in many years and new announcements are made every day of the week. There was no budget increment for social housing and capital spending for local authority and social housing programmes has been cut by 5%, instead of being increased by 10% as committed to in the national development plan. That was another promise and another lie. The cost of new housing, social and private, has increased through VAT, in addition to the attack on first-time buyers through the withdrawal of the first-time buyer's grant.</P>
      <P>Cutting back investment that supports local services such as schools, hospitals and local transport is another attack on low income families, as they depend on these services so much. The social infrastructure component of the public capital programme shows a cut of 5% in 2002 despite significant inflation. No wonder Threshold stated that the budget neglected the key aspects of disadvantage and poverty &ndash; inadequate and unaffordable housing and accommodation. The promised protection of the weaker sections of society has been withheld from those who need it most.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Combat Poverty Agency has a statutory role in advising the Minister for Social and Family <Col N="1997" />Affairs on economic and social policy appertaining to poverty. Its theme was the prioritising of poverty at a time of economic uncertainty. How let down that agency must feel that its recommendations were not even mentioned in the budget. It recommended that the eligibility for medical cards be widened by increasing the income threshold, as promised in the Government health strategy. This recommendation was shot down by the Taoiseach before the budget even saw the light of day, another con trick on the electorate.</P>
    <P>Another recommendation of the Combat Poverty Agency was that the Government honour its commitment in the 2001 budget to increase child benefit over three budgets to &euro;150 per month. To achieve this rock solid commitment given in 2001 would have required an increase of &euro;31.80 per month. What increase did the Government give? The increase was only &euro;8 per month, rowing back on its previous budget commitments and election promises. This was an attack on women and children. Women's votes were targeted by this Government through this commitment. Paying the back money for child benefit the week before the election was another ploy. Many of these women feel tricked and angry, as they should, because of the increase.</P>
    <P>CORI described the budget as unfair, unjust and unacceptable, insulting Ireland's poorest people once more. It also stated that budget 2003 marked a moment of truth for the Government in that it failed to address the substantial poverty and social exclusion which is persistent to this day. It has widened the gap between rich and poor, the widest gap in the EU. This is a telling commentary on the Government's policy on social and family affairs from a group that deals with so many disadvantaged and people on the margins of society.</P>
    <P>A card player who reneges would lose the game. If he or she continued to renege, he or she would be thrown out of the casino. This Government has reneged on so many promises on a daily basis that it should be thrown out. We all know that will not happen as the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil will prop each other up for as long as it takes. Meanwhile, the increases of a few cent after inflation is all that people on social welfare can expect.</P>
    <P>Additional free units of electricity for pensioners is an issue my party has raised on numerous occasions. To date, the Government has not listened. The question should be addressed in the future, especially in view of the increases in electricity charges.</P>
    <P>The Christmas bonus is welcomed by all who receive it but why do those on unemployment assistance and social welfare benefit not receive it? These are people who have been proven to have few means. I know that choices had to be made in the budget, but this Social Welfare Bill again proves that the Government prefers to hit the people who have little clout rather than tax dodgers and others.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister. I am glad that someone with her understanding, capability and experience is in charge of the Department of Social and Family Affairs.</P>
      <P>The Department's former title &ldquo;Social Welfare&rdquo; did not suit it because its work involves family, inclusion and looking after the people at the core of society who need our help. The Ireland in which we want to live is one that caters for everybody and gives them an opportunity to move out of poverty and begin providing for themselves. I have often heard people say that not enough people have medical cards. We should ensure that people do not need medical cards. What can we do to ensure that people do not need unemployment assistance? How can we help them escape the poverty trap and ensure that women, children and the elderly, who, because they do not have enough money, are dependent on welfare payments from the State, do not suffer?</P>
      <P>The real challenge, as we move through these difficult global economic times, is creating, maintaining and developing a plan for the future so that we can continue to see a growth in people's ability to fend for themselves and their families. It must be a great feeling to collect a pay packet every week for work one has done instead of going down to the dole office to collect unemployment benefit or assistance. Everyone wants to provide for his or her family and not be dependent on handouts. My vision is that we should look after our old people and recognise the contribution they have made to the State over the years. We should also look after our children and the most vulnerable in society and tackle the causes of problems instead of continuing to pay out money. We should tackle the causes of alcohol and drug abuse, help people in unhappy marriages and help children deal with changes in societal and familial structures and the difficulties to which such changes lead. That is the way Ireland should be in the future.</P>
      <P>Senator Cummins said he accepted that choices had to be made, which is true. The challenge for Opposition parties is to tell us what choices they would have made. What would they have done? Would they have tackled the issue of child benefit?</P>

      <P>There was a reduction of 6% &ndash; from 15.1% &ndash; in the consistent poverty level between 1994 and 2000. That is the figure of which we should take account. However, we should also consider the changes in unemployment levels. It is not so much that unemployment fell, but that employment soared. I do not know whether many people in the House understand how difficult it can be at times, in various regions &ndash; although there are unemployment black spots &ndash; to recruit people for jobs. That is amazing in a country the unemployment level of which, when I started working, was more than 10%. Unemployment has now dropped to around 3% or 4%. We are justified in feeling proud of this. People are beginning to fend for themselves.</P>
      <P>The Minister has provided for an additional &euro;833 million in social welfare spending next year, bringing the projected level of spending to more than &euro;10 billion for the first time ever. This is a positive development. We have not spent enough &ndash; there will never be enough to spend &ndash; but we are discussing a budget of more than &euro;10 billion for next year. Social welfare expenditure in 2003 will be &euro;4.5 billion more than in 1997. As the Minister stated, this represents an increase of nearly 80% in social welfare spending.</P>
      <P>We must also bear in mind that, in the past, people thought social welfare was about paying the dole to people who were unemployed. It is much more than that now. That increase of nearly 80% will benefit many more people. Our pensioners, mothers and children are glad. They were not fooled.

      <P>Child benefit was not taxed in this budget and I hope it will not be taxed in the future. It should also not be means tested and should continue to be paid to the person who benefits most from it. Child benefit is a support to the family and, in the society in which we live, families are in greater need of support than ever.</P>
      <P>I welcome this year's increases, although I am disappointed that they were not as large as expected. However, the money was available and difficult choices had to be made. An increase of &euro;8 for the first two children and &euro;10 per month for subsequent children brings the rates to &euro;125.60 for the first two children and &euro;157.30 for subsequent children, which is a significant amount on a monthly basis. I look forward to seeing further increases in payments over the next three to four years.</P>
      <P>The back to school clothing and footwear allowance is being increased by &euro;30 for children aged 12 and over. This payment is again directed at the family and helps support people in need. We will continue to pay, according to our PPF commitments, the child dependant allowance to persons in receipt of short-term payments for 27 weeks or more where children are in full-time education up to the age of 22 years. People might think that is not important, but one of the great things about this country is that many children from socially disadvantaged areas are now going on to full-time education after the ages of 16 and 17. They are enrolling in PLC courses, institutes of technology and universities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>They are receiving opportunities that were never there before and that is being recognised in the increases in these payments.</P>
      <P>In our programme for Government, we promised to increase the lowest pension to &euro;200 by 2007. This year, a &euro;10 increase was a first step towards meeting that commitment. We have sought to ensure that older people, widows and women, in particular, have more money in their hands at the end of the day. This budget protects the less well-off and the Government has sought to do that by ensuring the lowest payments are protected in real terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a widow or widower cannot have a bus pass for somebody who is not their spouse needs to be looked at because it may restrict the benefit of the pass if people are not in a position to travel on their own. In the first years following a <Col N="2001" />bereavement, widows and widowers who have been married for many years often do not have the confidence to go out on their own. That area could be looked at and, if it is not too costly, that benefit could be extended.</P>
    <P>In our debate two weeks before the budget, there were calls from all sides of the House to increase the carer's allowance and to give that to everybody and not to&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy" hpid="Mr. McCarthy Mr. McCarthy">

    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">

    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, &euro;150 million. The Minister has increased the disregard on this occasion so that a single person can have a disregard of &euro;210 per week and a couple can have a joint income disregard of &euro;420. This means that 4,500 carers will benefit, it will increase the allowance currently received by 2,800 carers and will ensure that an additional 1,700 carers will qualify for a payment. That is in addition to the innovative schemes introduced, such as the social insurance scheme which allows for carer's leave and carer's benefit.</P>
      <P>As an employer, I saw this year the beneficial effect that scheme had for one employee of mine. Unfortunately, a close family member of that employee took ill and was diagnosed with terminal cancer. The employee was in a position to take carer's leave and apply for carer's benefit which allowed that person to spend 12 weeks off work caring for the family member while receiving a payment. The ill person was able to stay at home, cared for by his family, and did not have to stay in a hospital or hospice.</P>
      <P>The challenge for the future is to look at new ways of doing things, ways that benefit people in the easiest manner so that there will be a better quality of life for those receiving care. Carer's benefit, carer's leave and payments to carers are continually examined and changes and improvements will continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anybody who looks after a child or adult with a disability, or an old person, knows the true value of the respite care grant. Members may laugh and say that it is derisory but the grant makes a significant difference to people annually. When that cheque comes into homes, it is a recognition of the contribution that people are making and a token that allows people to take a weekend away, or to put the person being cared for into a respite home so that the carer can take a couple of days off. That makes a significant difference even if it happens just once a year and I commend the Minister for increasing the grant by &euro;100 to &euro;735 per annum. People caring for more than one person will receive &euro;1,470 per annum and it will be paid in June 2003 to recipients of carer's allowance, carer's benefit and carers who <Col N="2002" />are providing full-time care and attention to those in receipt of various disability payments.</P>
    <P>The package, which sees an additional &euro;833 million, brings spending to over &euro;10 billion per annum in 2003; it sees increases of &euro;10 per week for pensioners, &euro;11 per week for widows and widowers aged 66 years and over, &euro;8 and &euro;10 increases in child benefit effective from April 2003 and a £7 increase for widows and widowers under 66.</P>

There is a &euro;6 per week increase for people on other payments, a &euro;100 per year increase in the respite care grant and an increase in income disregards for those on carer's allowance. The package can be commended to the House. I am sorry it is not more but I accept that choices had to be made. In the future, we will see a return to the type of provision provided by the Government over the past five years.</P>

      <P>I would look at various levels of society to see which areas have benefited and which have not benefited to the extent that was hoped. Social welfare is no exception in this regard and I intend to speak out on behalf of widows and widowers, pensioners, carers and those misfortunate enough to be unemployed.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy" hpid="Mr. McCarthy Mr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>It can be argued that the budget has not delivered to a great extent to those most deserving. To make that argument, we need only look at recent reports issued by a number of bodies, such as the Combat Poverty Agency. It did not invent the figures which show that Ireland now has the highest percentage of children living in poverty in the developed world after the USA. That is a startling and credible statistic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Are we to assume that the Focus Ireland's figures on homelessness are a figment of somebody's imagination? They are very real. Within five minutes walk of this House there are young people sleeping in corridors. Homelessness is rampant in this city and other parts of the country. Within five minutes walk of the national Parliament, there are people lying in doorways at <Col N="2003" />night with sleeping bags around them and containers beside them in the hope that people will contribute money. Many know the statistics but when one sees a young person thrown in the hallway of a building late at night it brings home the stark reality of homelessness more effectively than looking at reports or figures.</P>
    <P>The Society of St. Vincent de Paul does not exaggerate when it produces figures showing a significant increase in the assistance the society must give to low income families. The society states that it could spend twice what it does if it had the resources.</P>
    <P>Over coming months, the Combat Poverty Agency's recent publication, Against All Odds, Family Life on Low Income, will hopefully be studied by all Members of the Houses, including the Ministers in this Administration. The report deals with the lives of those living on social welfare payments. This is not mere propaganda by the poverty lobby but important factual information that has been garnered by that agency. It shows that a significant number of people have not benefited or made any significant gains from the wealth created during the past six or seven years. The additional sum of &euro;6 brings the lowest social welfare payment up to &euro;124.80 per week but it falls short of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness commitment to bring the lowest social welfare rate to &euro;127 during the lifetime of that programme.</P>
    <P>We have heard various arguments with regard to inflation. Some people on low incomes face higher than average costs because of their low purchasing power and lack of private transport. These are important factors which must be taken into consideration. The rate of inflation means the miserable increases are not as good as they seem.  </P>
    <P>The increases for many social welfare recipients will be clawed back by changes in rent supplements, which have been rightly condemned by housing groups and community welfare officers. Despite that, the Government had the gall to claim that the budget protects the weaker sections of society. It took a lot of gall for someone who is known in this House as a right winger to say that the Government is on the left of the political spectrum, particularly when the Administration's policies mirror those of the Tories in the UK in the 1980s.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The increases given to people on social welfare are not good enough. They do not mirror the harsh economic reality faced by many people every day. Although it might surprise some <Col N="2004" />people sitting on my right, the rate of inflation and the amount of indirect taxation people pay on a newspaper and a pint of milk are more than the social welfare increases.</P>
    <P>I was surprised at the 12% increase in car tax in the budget. The television licence fee was also increased by &euro;43. I support the State broadcaster. I will not moan or complain about such an increase because we must be realistic about it. We cannot have it both ways.</P>

I do not have a difficulty with that increase because I support State broadcasting. However, I have a problem with the 12% increase in car tax. That hurts everyone. It pinches people's pockets. A 12% increase is substantial. Such an increase in other areas might have been welcome, but not in car tax.</P>
      <P>VHI premia will increase by 19% while electricity prices will increase by 13%. One Member of the House which initiated the increase in VHI premia has a medical card. I am not criticising the Government for that. The Minister for Health and Children or the Minister for Social and Family Affairs did not give it to him.</P>

      <P>I do not blame the Government. It gives credence to the arguments put forward by people aggrieved at the budget, particularly when one considers the lack of increases in some areas and the substantial increases in others. The fact that an elected Member of our national Parliament has a medical card makes a joke and a mockery of the system. It is a joke that someone who is on a handsome salary, used that medical card on at least three occasions since being elected to the other House.</P>

It is ridiculous that the person who looked for votes during the election and fought for medical cards has one. It could only happen in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am worried that some people do not place any value on community employment schemes. They are a great engine of community activism and they have provided some people with a role in society which has been properly remunerated. The community employment schemes have provided an essential service. They have helped clubs <Col N="2005" />and voluntary organisations and assisted people to find work. I am worried that the schemes will be cut by 5,000 this year and by the same amount next year. We should not do that, particularly given that the country is not doing as well as it was three or four years ago. It would be better to retain those valuable schemes, particularly as the people who benefited from them might not find employment in other areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister confirmed recently that the back to work allowance scheme has been abolished, except for target groups such as lone parents and people with disabilities. For those on the unemployment register, however, the period of time allowed to qualify for the back to work allowance scheme has been increased fourfold from 15 months to a staggering 60 months. That happened because the financial provision for employment support services was cut in the Book of Estimates. The back to work allowance scheme has been extremely successful and has benefited approximately 13,500 recipients. While a study of the scheme commissioned by the Department recommended a reduction in the number of places, it also recommended increased funds for better training and support for participants. The net effect of the Minister's announcement is that the scheme will be abolished. The scheme should have been developed and improved because it played a pivotal role in assisting people to make the transition from long-term unemployment back into the workforce.</P>
    <P>The negative impact of the back to work allowance scheme had its genesis in the budget which contained a number of insidious cutbacks, the effects of which will only become apparent over time. Such negative impacts may only become apparent during the debate on the Finance Bill or whenever such issues are discussed. However, when the technicalities of the budgetary measures are spelt out, the seriousness of the overall impact becomes evident.  </P>
    <P>By any yardstick, the Minister stands indicted on the issue of social housing because local authority housing lists will continue to grow as a result of a reduction in the overall allocation of accommodation programmes. There are approximately 50,000 households, representing approximately 130,000 people, on local authority housing lists. Between 5,000 and 6,000 people are homeless. One homeless person is an indictment of all of us and it is one person too many. A significant number of people who were once in a position to buy their own homes have been priced out of the market. The Government announced a number of savage cutbacks in the housing sector in the Book of Estimates which was published on 21 November. We only have to look at the reports by Focus Ireland, the Simon Community, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and Threshold which analyse the housing strategies and homeless plans drawn up by local authorities. One report concluded that 33% of new householders and 42% in urban areas will not become home owners.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2006" />We have the highest concentration of home ownership in the European Union. Many young people and couples aspire to owning their own homes as soon as they become established in their career or profession. It is worrying that 33% of householders will not become home owners. The fact that many people are unable to buy their own home during our greatest period of economic prosperity is a damning indictment of the Administration. It ensured that the elite and wealthy in the country prospered during the years of the Celtic tiger and that the young people and those who aspired to buy their own homes remained householders rather than home owners.</P>
    <P>The reports also reinforce the demands being made by my political party. We want the Government to reverse the major cuts in housing, namely, the abolition of the first-time buyer's grant and the capping of the rent allowance. We debated the issue of the first-time buyer's grant at length in the House recently. Some people thought the grant of &euro;3,800 was not much, but it was factored into the financial arrangements some people made to obtain a deposit and repay a mortgage. However, when the Minister for Finance, &ldquo;Slasher&rdquo; McCreevy, decided to axe the first-time buyer's grant, he not only affected the thousands of young people who had hoped to avail of the scheme, but also the people who had contractual arrangements.</P>
    <P>There are anomalies in the system as one can see from the bloodstock industry. A young stallion can successfully cover 50 mares per annum and a stallion owner recently put a price of &euro;300,000 on a successful cover. This person will never pay a cent in tax, which is a large anomaly. The revenue gained by the Government from the abolition of the first-time buyer's grant could not possibly be outweighed by the advantages to be gained by examining this area, where a massive amount of money is seeping through the system and not a cent of it returns to the State. If multi-millionaire horse owners were pursued by the Minister for Finance with more gusto, young people might be &euro;3,000 better off when they buy their own homes.</P>
    <P>The capping of the rent allowance, announced by the Minister who has graced the House with her presence today, contributes to an increase in the number of homeless people. Single people will be forced out of their homes because this cap provides landlords with an opportunity to increase rents. The speculative landlordism which is now prevalent is taking us back to the 18th century. It is unfortunate that young people bear the brunt of the gold grabbing speculation indulged in by some people.</P>
    <P>Care providers give an invaluable service to the State and have done so under great financial, physical and emotional pressure. While I welcome the advances to which Senator Cox referred, we will never achieve the full potential of that scheme until we abolish the means test for the carer's allowance. Such a measure would have financial implications, but the country can afford <Col N="2007" />to tell these people that the service they are providing is invaluable. The people they are looking after would otherwise have to be cared for by the State. Carers not only contribute to the care of individuals, they also free up the resources of the State. That is a positive dimension of this matter. The abolition of the means test for the carer's allowance should be implemented.</P>
    <P>I look forward to contributing to the debate on the later Stages of the Bill.</P>

      <P>The past five years have seen a dramatic improvement in the provision of welfare services. Many of the major players in the area of social services, including those involved in social partnership, have admitted that the improvements have had direct effect in this area. There is always more to do and the Government has shown its commitment to continuing this work, particularly in terms of the Bill before us, by consolidating the improvements for pensioners, children, those in employment, the unemployed, widows, widowers and carers and those for whom they care.</P>
      <P>When addressing the House on the Estimates, the Minister for Finance said money alone was not the answer in terms of delivering top quality public services and that, if it was, we would have solved all our problems. The Department of Social and Family Affairs is a prime example of a Department moving with the times and providing a caring and efficient service to its wide scope of clients. In rural and urban areas throughout the country, services are provided on a daily basis to a vast array of people in differing social and economic circumstances. These services range from child benefit to old age pensions and from farm assist payments to work initiatives. Every facet of life is covered.</P>
      <P>The changes in the recent budget copperfastened all social welfare payments and delivered increases to every social welfare recipient, despite stringent economic circumstances. When taken in conjunction with the substantial increases across the board in the past five years, these changes have gone a long way in promoting and improving the social inclusion of those who find themselves in need of assistance. The additional &euro;3.5 billion invested in the system in the past five years has paid dividends and is worth protecting. The changes suggested in the budget enhance this protection.</P>

    <P>In the past, significant structural changes have been made to the social welfare system. Many of these changes, while costing little in financial terms, have been of enormous benefit to those who are awaiting services. The majority of benefits and allowances are now increased in the January following the budget. Family income supplement customers will receive their increases in full from the beginning of January. Customers on <Col N="2008" />short-term weekly payments, such as carers benefit and supplementary welfare allowance, will receive their increases in full from the first pay day in January and customers on long-term weekly payments, such as old age pensioners, widows and widowers, will also receive their increases from the same date.</P>
    <P>Many payments are paid through the post or directly into bank accounts. The recent promotion by the Minister of the personal public services number will further streamline and enhance the delivery of these services across a wide range of areas and make life easier for many. These changes, coupled with the almost 80% increase in expenditure the Minister outlined, have contributed to the transformation of the social welfare system into a 21st century service. Having spent some years working in the employment exchanges in the city of Dublin, I have had direct experience of the queues stretching out on to the streets. We used to refer to the blue line in Cumberland Street. Phenomenal changes have taken place in a short period. It is essential that this momentum be maintained and the changes protected.</P>
    <P>The Department and the Minister are spearheading the early introduction of schemes such as the early retirement savings account. A targeted awareness campaign is being constructed to encourage workers to provide supplementary pension provisions in the future.</P>
    <P>The House recently discussed the provision of social housing. The Minister, again concentrating on the most vulnerable sections of our society, has increased the amounts of supplementary welfare allowance to &euro;40 per single person and &euro;45 in all other cases where voluntary housing bodies have to take means into account when assessing their rents. This small increase will encourage the provision of more social housing, particularly in the voluntary sector.</P>
    <P>I understand the frustration of my colleagues on the Opposition benches when they see the changes and increases of recent times. They must wonder why they could not have increased the social welfare package by &euro;530 million, or 40%.</P>

It is frustrating to hear people bandy about figures regarding poverty and confuse consistent poverty with relative poverty. If one of the Smurfit family moves in next door, one's relative poverty rating will shoot through the roof. The figures speak for themselves. Consistent poverty has more than halved.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister. I regret that I must speak on this issue. The cuts in health and social welfare were unfair. The Government targeted the most vulnerable sections of society by placing a blanket ban on an increase in the rent allowance threshold. Rents have increased dramatically in the past few years, particularly in the city of Dublin. Does Senator Brady live in the real Dublin, the Dublin I witness every day&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;when I walk out of this House where people are lying on the streets and in alleyways under blankets, coats etc.? It is a shame on any Government that allows this to happen in 2002. We have already witnessed cuts in community employment schemes and thousands of places are being axed from the back-to-work programme which assists the long-term unemployed to return to employment.</P>
      <P>The number of people out of work in County Longford is very evident. The rate of unemployment there is probably higher than anywhere else in the entire country. We have been let down time and again by this Government. It would be appreciated if the Minister would look at the position in County Longford and nationally.</P>
      <P>There will be serious losses of essential services in local communities which up to now were delivered by community employment schemes. The proposal to extend the medical card scheme to those on very low incomes has been abandoned. Consumer prices, hospital charges, college fees, television licence fees and ESB charges have all been increased substantially since the election. The economy faces a serious downturn. Redundancies are announced on a regular basis and alternative employment is difficult to find. The recent budget has failed to address the substantial poverty and social exclusion which still persists. The Government must safeguard the quality of life for those reliant on social welfare but this was not evident in the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The gap between rich and poor cannot be allowed to grow and recent statistics have shown that Ireland is the worst in the EU with regard to looking after the least well-off in society, despite <Col N="2010" />boasting from time to time that we are the third or fourth wealthiest country in the world. The poor are expected the bear the burden of the Government's mismanagement of the resources which were available during the Celtic tiger years. The position now is that the Government has widened the gap between rich and poor by &euro;266 per week, according to the CORI justice commission figures. That document, produced since the budget, is in the public domain. The minimal increases in social welfare are unfair and unjust. The Minister for Finance's claim that the budget was aimed at supporting the most vulnerable in society is blatantly false.</P>
    <P>To sum up the view of the entire country I will quote the comment of an old age pensioner from Longford who, when asked what she thought of the budget replied, &ldquo;I did not feel its benefits. As you know, it hit the poorest hardest.&rdquo; Perhaps in this festive season the Minister would consider the abolition of the means test for the carer's allowance and give something to the poor and those who care for the sick and elderly. It is a time of giving and perhaps the Minister will be generous.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Senator allows me to make my contribution he can decide later. It is interesting to note that under successive Ministers for Social and Family Affairs, including the former Minister, Deputy Woods, the introduction of insurance contributions has meant that more pensioners are in receipt of contributory pensions, particularly the self-employed category, which includes farmers. That is a welcome development. That the Minister has been able to secure increases ranging from &euro;10 or &euro;11 for old age pensioners and widows is welcome. Neither did she forget to increase the payments for child benefit. A welcome development in recent years is that most increases are paid early in the year, some from 1 January. Successive Governments have tried to bring the dates forward and have succeeded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been championing the case of carers in the Dáil for many years and now in the Seanad. Like many other public representatives I would welcome the abolition of the means test for carers and we are moving towards it. I note from the budget that the disregard is &euro;210 for a single per<Col N="2011" />son and &euro;420 for a married couple. Given the increase it is well worthwhile for people to apply for carer's allowance. In the past those who thought they would not qualify for the allowance put off making an application.</P>
    <P>Social welfare officers are looking at the quality and type of care available. The relaxation in the conditions whereby the carer had to live in the same house as the person being cared for is a welcome development. Now carers can live just down the road and provide very good care. Carers are concerned about the amount of time they can get off. That issue has been addressed by various Governments.</P>
    <P>There has been a major increase of &euro;100 in the respite care grant and the disregards have been positive. It is the view of those I represent and professionals in the health board area that people like to be cared for at home. In certain parts of the country the number of private nursing homes has increased and obviously the subvention has been increased in those areas. When increased subvention is paid, frequently the cost of private nursing home care increases. This is an issue about which we have to be concerned. The Minister had the same problem in regard to the cost of rental income but has acted on that issue. It would make sense that the person caring for a person at home should get at least the same payment as the subvention paid in nursing homes. I hope that issue will be looked at.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister has available to her a fund of &euro;950,000 for medical appliances. This has been a matter of concern in the Western Health Board area for some time. It is a matter for the Department of Health and Children to provide aids and appliances such as wheelchairs, hoists and anything that can help those with a disability.</P>
    <P>Important developments in recent years have been the back-to-education scheme and the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance, for which the Minister has increased the funding. I hope these will be seen as positive schemes because every year we hear about the need for funding for them. The threshold for family income supplement has been increased by &euro;17 per week and I hope people avail of the scheme. Some people feel they are not entitled to it and do not make an application in time.</P>
    <P>In regard to care of the elderly and for those with disability, will the Minister or the Department of Health and Children look at the issue of the location of private nursing homes? Few nursing homes are provided in a large area of north and west Galway and north Mayo. If we are to provide care for our elderly, the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Department of Health and Children must look at the provision of nursing homes.</P>
    <P>Most health boards and communities have requested community nursing units for their area. The Western Health Board has sought several units. The private sector is the only way forward <Col N="2012" />if these are not going to be built by the Department. The private sector, which goes where there is money to be made, seems reluctant to provide nursing homes in some areas and we end up with too many in the one area. I urge the Minister to look at that issue.</P>
    <P>Despite the difficult economic situation and the circumstances of this budget, the Minister has managed to provide an increase for the disadvantaged. The Department could also play a useful role in getting people back on schemes or into education. The schemes favoured in rural Ireland are the community employment schemes. We would like to see people continue to qualify for those schemes. I am glad we have schemes up and running in County Galway despite cutbacks. Hopefully, they will continue.</P>
    <P>The Minister has allocated &euro;500,000 towards the cost of the rural transport initiative scheme. This scheme should be advertised more. Some of the transport schemes in Galway operate in the social services area providing bingo runs, social activities for the elderly, outings and visits. The scheme is a good one but I ask the Minister to advertise it more and to try to get more contractors involved in it as the numbers involved at the moment are low. As we have often said we could have all the free travel schemes in the world but if the transport is not there they cannot be used. This type of initiative is important and provides opportunities for elderly people and social services groups around the country.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for coming in today. I support the proposals put forward in the legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. P. Burke Mr. P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. I support Senator Kitt in regard to the rural transport initiative. It is a great scheme and should be more widely advertised and used. Those who do avail of it for a day out get great enjoyment from it. The scheme could be broadened and companies and businesses should be encouraged to support it financially.</P>
      <P>I also support those who spoke about the carer's allowance. This scheme provides a great service to the country and keeps thousands of people out of hospitals. We could not speak highly enough of the carers who provide such a tremendous service. I fully support the abolition of the means test in regard to carers. All carers deserve the allowance. Consider all those cared for at home throughout the country. If they had to be taken into nursing homes or hospitals the system would be completely clogged. It is quite clogged as it is but were it not for the services provided by carers the system would collapse.</P>
      <P>I welcome the increases for pensioners and social welfare recipients. However, when we match it against the increases announced before, in and after the budget, it is needed. There have been increases in motor tax, health, car, house contents and house insurance, the television licence, diesel, and VAT.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Brady mentioned new methods of payment of social welfare such as through the post <Col N="2013" />office or the bank. People will need credit or bank cards to avail of that service. The tax imposed on these cards in the budget is a form of poll tax. Everybody needs these cards to get by nowadays. The charges could amount to &euro;60 per annum in a case where someone has four cards. Most people need at least two.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider waiving tax in the case of social welfare and old age pension recipients. If those recipients have to draw down their payments through a bank or post office using a credit card, any increase the Minister has provided will be offset by the increased cost of the card.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increases announced in the budget, to which this Bill gives effect. However, the increases are badly needed when offset by the increased impositions which have been applied before, in and since the budget.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh" hpid="Dr. Mansergh Dr. Mansergh">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and I welcome the Bill. As the Leas-Chathaoirleach resumes the Chair, I wish to express my appreciation of the constructive tone of his speech which was somewhat in contrast to the blustering, partisan tone of one or two earlier contributions. The very substantial increase of &euro;530 million in spending in this area is among the highest in recent years. I calculate that this translates into approximately £417 million, by way of comparison.</P>
      <P>It is important to point out the great improvements achieved in social welfare in recent years in the context of social partnership. I am disappointed to see the continuation of those arrangements appearing to be at some risk this morning. Social partnership has contributed greatly to social cohesion. It has provided a focus on the full range of issues and has enabled us to maximise the resources available for social spending. I cannot envisage how a free-for-all will improve matters and it is far more likely to result in a disimprovement.</P>
      <P>Given that, for the present at least, employers and trade unions are locked in a stand-off, the wider interests of community, society and the country should be borne in mind. Realism is called for on all sides. In my view, it is as unrealistic for employers to expect a total strike-free environment as it is for unions to expect every worker to belong to a trade union. While I am not criticising those who aspire to get as close as possible to either of those ideals, I do not accept failure to achieve utopia on one side or the other as a reason for abandoning social partnership. If we do not succeed in keeping social partnership agreements in place in the future, I am concerned as to whether the same resources will be available for social welfare and whether the number of recipients may be somewhat higher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increase in social welfare spending is a real achievement in a context where unemployment &ndash; perhaps the principal source of that expenditure &ndash; has dropped from approximately 10% in 1997 to approximately 4.5% today. There is a possibility that it may rise to 5% in the coming <Col N="2014" />year. This indicates that, as Members would desire, the extra resources have gone into real improvements. An increase of &euro;10 in pensions clearly shows that we are on target to fulfil party pre-election and Government commitments towards a rate of &euro;200. According to my rough calculations, we are also on target for a general benchmark of &euro;150 for unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>The budget was poverty-proofed. Distributive effects were probably stronger towards the lower end of the scale than in any recent budget. I have a great deal of respect for the values of Fr. Seán Healy and those who work with him. However, I sometimes feel they do not adequately acknowledge the progress and achievements that have been made. On one occasion when Fr. Healy was castigating a budget introduced by the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, I asked him to specify any budget of which he had approved within the previous ten years. He replied that he would require notice of that question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins" hpid="Mr. Cummins Mr. Cummins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
      <P>His description of the budget was &ldquo;unfair, unjust and unacceptable&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh" hpid="Dr. Mansergh Dr. Mansergh">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe the record will show he said something similar about every previous budget, regardless of the party that introduced it. However, a great deal has been done&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins" hpid="Mr. Cummins Mr. Cummins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the slogan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh" hpid="Dr. Mansergh Dr. Mansergh">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;but Fr. Healy's focus does not take sufficient account of the need to integrate maximising economic progress with social cohesion.</P>
      <P>If one concentrates exclusively on the social end of the scale, one may lose sight of the wood for the trees. A former head of the Combat Poverty Agency expressed some nostalgia for 1986, a year of high unemployment, high debt and poor economic conditions. One might say that everybody was equally poor and perhaps the situation had an odd attraction from that perspective. Obviously, when an economy has been growing, more active redistribution is needed.</P>
      <P>In general terms, a feature of the budget has been to cut down on some of the tax shelters and tax breaks. It has been a great achievement to bring forward the dates of most social welfare increases to the beginning of the year, rather than, as in the past, having them apply from the following June, September, or even November. However, the increase for child benefit has yet to be brought forward to January. Great credit is due to the Minister and her predecessor for bringing forward increases and maintaining the full 100% Christmas bonus. I recall, from my former role as an adviser to the Government, arguments about the latter. The cutback in that measure, which dates from the mid 1980s, continued far longer than it should.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, with the Minister for Finance, is making an important provision in putting aside money for future pensions when our national <Col N="2015" />demographics become less favourable. Earlier in my career, when I was posted to Germany, there was already considerable concern about the sustainability of the pensions system in that country. We are rendering a great service for the next generation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
      <P>No. We are doing them a great service by not having huge pressures building up, as has happened in more advanced European economies. Despite the increases, I recognise that it is not easy for anyone to live on social welfare alone. Nonetheless, employment opportunities are now far better than in the past. Wherever possible, people should supplement their income, particularly through pension provisions. The social welfare system places particular emphasis on those who do not have any other possibility of sustaining their living standards. I congratulate the Minister on her first Social Welfare Bill which I hope is the first of many.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has a great commitment to her portfolio and she is right to have concentrated on the elderly in the Bill's budgetary provisions. I take this view since I am getting older myself and a girl must think of the future. I regret, however, that some of the promises made in the run up to the general election have not been fulfilled. For example, the child benefit increases are not great and when one takes inflation into account they will virtually be wiped out.</P>
      <P>From a professional viewpoint, I naturally regret the failure to extend the provision of free medical cards, particularly to children. We have one of the highest rates of asthma in Europe, if not the world. It is most important that children receive the proper treatment and care they deserve, before we have to establish centres to deal with chronic illness in adults. The medical card decision will badly hit many families because people will have to pay a significant increase before they get free drugs for long-term illness.</P>
      <P>Yesterday, Senator Phelan raised the issue of middle-aged or elderly bachelors who find it difficult to obtain accommodation. This is a neglected group of people and when we discuss family matters we tend to forget that they were part of a family at one stage.</P>

      <P>Since that group has been neglected in terms of accommodation, the Minister might try to see what can be done about providing them with housing when she is considering her proposals for next year. If it were not for the Salvation Army's hostels, I do not know how I would have managed to deal with such cases I come across in my general practice. One has only to walk around the city to see the number of home<Col N="2016" />less people, a large percentage of whom are middle-aged or elderly men. Some, but not all, of them have suffered from mental illness or alcohol-related problems. Many have just not been able to pay the rents now required in the private sector. Meanwhile, the provision of accommodation in the public sector has fallen far behind current requirements. I know the Minister will have to discuss this matter with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, not to mention the Minister for Finance, but this could be one of her projects for next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Part of the Minister's brief includes the family as well as social affairs. We have a clear vision of the type of family we want to build in today's Ireland. We cannot and should not go back to the old-style authoritarian family where children knew their place. However, we certainly do not want to see the excessive individualism that exists in some countries, where it is all based on selfish attitudes and family life does not get a look in. Our challenge is to blend the love and support which existed in traditional families with the recognition that all family members &ndash; men, women and children &ndash; have equal rights.</P>
      <P>As regards family friendly policies, the Government is committed to supporting parents in taking up work where they wish to do so. However, the Government is also committed to supporting parents who choose to care in the home. That is why in recent budgets we decided to invest massively in child benefit. I welcome the &euro;8 increase for the first two children and the &euro;10 increase for the third and subsequent children. The Government is supporting the choices parents themselves are making in caring for their children. That is why it increased the pension payable to women in the home to the full old-age, non-contributory rate.</P>
      <P>The latest child benefit increases form part of the largest ever series of increases in child benefit in the history of the State. I congratulate the Minister and the Government on having achieved that. After only six years, the basic rate has been more than trebled, and a family with three children will receive &euro;283 more per month than in 1997.</P>

      <P>To combat child poverty we have introduced the largest increases in child benefit in the history of the State, and we are proud of that. I welcome the &euro;10 increase in pensions. In future, Fianna Fáil pledges to raise the old-age pension to &euro;200 per week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>We will also introduce a home-makers pension for pensioners' spouses currently in receipt of the qualified adult allowance, set at the level of a full non-contributory pension. People in receipt of old-age pensions are appreciative of the major improvement in the rates of payment in recent years. That is a fact. Anyone who is not afraid to walk the streets and meet the people, knows that. We certainly are not afraid to do so.</P>
      <P>On assuming office in 1997, Fianna Fáil made a decision to improve the pensioners' lot. We are proud to say we have done that and will continue to do so. It is part of the Minister's priorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been major improvements in the rates of social welfare payments and the free schemes have also been improved and extended. The eligibility criteria for these schemes have been improved, thus increasing the numbers availing of them. We are all conscious of the importance of the carer's allowance scheme which has been mentioned by most speakers. This scheme has enabled thousands of people to be cared for at home, who would otherwise have to be hospitalised or cared for in nursing homes. While the eligibility conditions for the carer's allowance scheme have been eased in recent years, I am sure the Minister agrees that further improvements are necessary. We are all aware of appli<Col N="2018" />cations that narrowly fail to meet the criteria. I hope, therefore, that the Minister will be able to improve income limits and payment rates, and further relax the residency requirements.</P>
    <P>I welcome the &euro;10 increase for pensioners; the special &euro;11 per week increase in contributory pensions for widows and widowers aged 66 years and over; the &euro;8 and &euro;10 increases in child benefit effective from April 2003; the &euro;7 increase for widows and widowers under 66 years of age; the &euro;6 increase for people in receipt of other payments; the &euro;100 increase in respite care grants; and the increase in income disregard for the carer's allowance. All weekly increases are effective from January 2003 and that is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>I wish to remind Senator McCarthy that Proinsias De Rossa, a Member of the European Parliament, remains president of his party even though he offered to step down.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and wish her great success in her portfolio.</P>
      <P>It must have been difficult for the Minister, in presenting her first Social Welfare Bill, to have to enter both Houses with her hands up &ndash; as described in sections of the media &ndash; following the announcement of a disappointing budget. The Minister said this year's social welfare package is a reflection of the Government's priority to protect the living standards of social welfare recipients. The list of increases, as read into the record by Senator Wilson, makes good reading when taken as a global figure. The reality is that a 25 cent or 30 cent increase per week is an insult to many social welfare recipients at the lowest level.</P>
      <P>Senator Mansergh said earlier that Father Healy does not acknowledge that progress was made. If that is progress, in Senator Mansergh's terms, what can we expect in the future? Senator Cox said that we must find new ways to improve things. That, in my mind, is an acknowledgement of failure. The electorate have now realised the deceit pushed on them last May. The Government are trying to find new ways to con the electorate but that is not going to work. This budget, in social welfare terms, was unfair to those who needed it most. The famous gap between the rich and the poor has widened substantially once more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, said last year that his second budget provided significant increases in social welfare payments. It is true, we acknowledge that. It went some way towards bridging the gap. The Minister has broken his commitments and the expectations of old age pensioners, social welfare recipients and lone parents. All had raised expectations that they would be protected against inflation. One would imagine from the figures presented in the budget that we were protecting inflation. We have not protected it. Any increases given have been felled in one swoop with the increase in the television licence fee which affects every family. Most social welfare recipients will be worse off in 2003 than in previous years as a result of that <Col N="2019" />increase and the 1% increase in VAT. If that is progress, then it is time we looked at new ways to protect those who need it most. Senator Cox referred to this point in her contribution.</P>
    <P>Time and again we have heard from the Government benches that the country is in crisis and that we have to tighten our belts and pull back. We are not, thankfully, in an economic crisis. What we are suffering from is mismanagement by this Government, over the past three years in particular, of this country's finances. It is a pity the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, has to be the one to take the worst blow. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, had a choice to make but he did not make it. Does it stand up that we have to reduce social welfare increases to less than inflation rates while at the same time protecting the savings incentive scheme for others who, in some cases, have increased their contributions? The Minister for Finance ignored that and other glaring options because of his association with particular groups. We have heard from them all over the last fortnight.</P>
    <P>If we provide only a 25 cent or 30 cent per week increase to a married couple with one child on unemployment benefit and say we are comfortable with that, then I do not know what will happen to us in the future.</P>
    <P>We are told that in the past few days most health boards have received letters of determination for the forthcoming year. There is a serious shortfall in the figures for every health board. The tragedy is that the people who will be hit hardest are those we are talking about today, those in greatest need of protection. When other services fail, the people resort to local level and the health board for additional resources to keep them going in time of crisis. Every family, be they in receipt of social welfare payments or otherwise, faces a crisis during their lifetime. Such people turn to social welfare officers for assistance. We are now told there will be no emergency funding for crises within the health boards. That is another serious blow to the expectations of those who will, tragically, find themselves in need during the coming year.</P>
    <P>We have also heard about the withdrawal of medical cards from certain people. Instead of extending that service to those in greatest need, we are contracting it. I support Senator Henry's suggestion that we categorise special needs for the increasing number of children suffering with asthma. Current structures are placing an added burden on families in receipt of medication for this condition.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social and Family Affairs had to enter this and the other House with her hands up and acknowledge the severity of this budget and its lack of prioritisation. Health boards have now been notified of their cutbacks and their only leeway at local level has been closed off. We are in crisis.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2020" />I hope what has been analysed as an unfair, unjust and unacceptable budget, and an insult to so many people in need, the poorest people in the country, can be rectified by additional resources. Why has the Government gone back on a commitment, which was welcome, that payments would be made from 1 January? It is now talking about pushing them on to mid-February and paying them retrospectively in April. It is important that the increases are paid when they are due.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their support for the developments in social welfare, even though some may have had difficulties in regard to funding and the changes they would like to the schemes. This year's social welfare package amounted to &euro;530 million, two years previously it amounted to more than &euro;1,000 million and in 1997 it was &euro;263 million. This is more than a doubling of the amount of money made available for budgets, with the knowledge that the baseline has increased consistently over the past five years.</P>
      <P>It is important to give the Members a few facts. An increase of &euro;1 under any of my Department's schemes costs over &euro;50 million. This indicates the amount of money needed to continue with existing schemes and to provide increases. I was provided with &euro;530 million in my budget. Prior to the budget, through the pre-budget forum, I met many organisations and NGOs who represented people in poverty and so on, who sought &euro;3,500 million. The gap between the funds I had available and what people wanted in that context was huge. It was a similar scenario in the case of elected representatives who wanted additional money. Therefore, I had to make choices.</P>
      <P>Many Members referred to child benefit. Members of the House will agree that child benefit has had a very positive and direct impact in addressing child poverty and many issues in the context of child care. There has never been agreement on any side of the House on what is the best thing to do in this area. I appreciate that people were disappointed but I could not come before this House and say I would try to do something I could not achieve. Following the publication of the Estimates, I said I would not be in a position to achieve what I wanted, even though commitments were made. On that basis, it would take another &euro;414 million to provide the third tranche of the child benefit allowance this year, which would mean there would be very little money left over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins" hpid="Mr. Cummins Mr. Cummins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
      <P>They would not give the Minister the money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>The money was not there. I fought very hard for what I thought were the priorities and I though it was best to consider the priorities as follows. The third tranche will be provided in the next three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other priority is the elderly. I disagree with what Senator Bannon said in regard to a pen<Col N="2021" />sioner in Longford. Pensioners have been supported wholeheartedly by this Government and the previous Governments and the &euro;10 increase will edge us closer to the &euro;200 baseline we want to achieve by 2007. Many other supports are being put in place through the household package to try to support the elderly, including the new initiative on energy. Very often there is a waste of energy and heating and I am hoping to pilot a new initiative in this regard in the near future to address the many concerns of the elderly. I am proud to say the elderly are a priority. Members will notice that we are turning into an ageing population. Therefore, support of the elderly is very important.</P>
    <P>Tied to this is the important issue of carers. I said in the other House that we should reflect on where society is going. In my opinion the State should not take over the role of the family. However, it is the role of the State to give recognition and support to carers. Very often money is not necessarily what is needed in regard to caring; other supports are equally necessary. The money was provided in recent years through the carer's allowance, the income disregard for carer's allowance and the increases in carer's allowance, in particular respite care.</P>
    <P>There was a new initiative two years ago which is very popular. This is carer's benefit and carer's leave, which has given people an opportunity to leave work and not lose out if one takes over as a carer for a particular period. These are tremendous changes and improvements in the carer's allowance scheme. This year I was in a position to increase the income disregard. The programme for Government allows for an additional 5,000 carers to be included in the carer's allowance scheme. I have been able to include another 1,700 carers this year, despite the fact that there are financial difficulties.</P>
    <P>I appreciate there is a divergence of views as to whether removing the means test is the correct thing to do. We do not know how many carers there are. There is a view that some people can well afford to pay and they should not participate in a scheme to support those who cannot manage or cope. This is a debate which must take place. In the context of the means test, and based on the information available to us, it would cost an additional &euro;150 million to include most carers in the carer's allowance scheme. We are moving towards the introduction of an additional 5,000 carers.</P>
    <P>The long-term care financing report which my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, and I will publish in the new year will consider the reality of funding for long-term care. There has been much talk about the cost to the Department of Health and Children and health boards of supporting nursing homes and whether it would be best to consider home subvention in the context of increasing the carer's allowance under the health board initiatives. The reality is that in the future there will be a greater onus on the State because of the changing society, the change <Col N="2022" />in families and the dispersal of many families throughout the country. Therefore, we must consider the resources available to us and how best to get value for money in the context of providing the best service. We will be progressing towards that achievement and I am sure the House will have an opportunity to discuss the reports when they are made available.</P>
    <P>Many other issues were discussed, including housing. I appreciate housing is not my portfolio but it is an issue which reflects poverty and on people who cannot achieve. There are key targets under the NAPS which we hope to achieve in supporting those who are unfit to provide accommodation for themselves. In that regard, the Department provides through the SWA, the rent supplement scheme, which has not been changed since 1994. It has been increased this year to 10% of the basic payment, which is &euro;12. That is the minimum contribution because it has been capped. Different health boards have different caps according to the amount of rent the health board sets as reasonable. There will be no change next year because the maximum rents will apply. However, the reality is that rents have decreased. One of my concerns in regard to the SWA and rent supplement is that if one looks at the cohort of people in receipt of it, the majority of them are not families but single people.</P>
    <P>The most recent figures I saw indicated that about 2,000 elderly single people are in receipt of rent supplements. Middle-aged single men and women also receive rent supplements, as Senator Henry said. I am sure Senators, many of whom are members of local authorities, share my concerns&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins" hpid="Mr. Cummins Mr. Cummins">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;about the fact that landlords increase rents on the assumption that the health boards and the Department of Social and Family Affairs will increase maximum contributions. We cannot allow the increases that have been taking place in recent years to continue.</P>
      <P>We have to examine the morality of the fact that many people have to live in totally unsuitable private rented accommodation, especially as many landlords who provide improper facilities receive a great deal of money from the Department. Officials from my Department, with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, and the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, are working to see how housing standards can be improved. In that context, the supplementary welfare allowance scheme is being reviewed and I have asked the chief executives of the health boards to meet me early next year to discuss the administration of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rural transport initiative pilot programme, which is being managed by Area Development Management, was also mentioned during this debate. The Minister for Transport recently <Col N="2023" />announced that the pilot programme will be administered by his Department. The Government is examining how those who live in isolated rural areas can use their free travel passes and, in that context, I have provided funding to ADM, which will administer the private operators. Some 34 groups have been selected to receive funding and 18 new transport services will be provided as a consequence. Those of us from rural Ireland understand the importance of this new initiative. While it is fine to have a bus pass if one lives in an urban area, it is not quite so useful for those in rural areas who cannot get to large towns to go where they want. This is an important new initiative.</P>
    <P>The Government has certainly indicated its support for the less well-off, especially in the context of the funding available and the priorities I have outlined. I have copper-fastened the social welfare increases that were made in recent years. If one examines the figures, one will see that my Department's budget package is between twice and three times the size of the taxation package, reflecting the fact that we have targeted the less well-off.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy" hpid="Mr. McCarthy Mr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, before section 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>2.&ndash;The Minister shall as soon as may be after the passing of this Act prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the implications of increasing child benefit, pensions and other social welfare <Col N="2024" />payments in line with previously stated Government policy commitments, including the National Anti-Poverty Strategy and the Programme for Government.</P>
    <P>We have debated this at some length so I will not labour the point. The programme for Government included significantly higher increases than provided for in the budget. We have heard how the pension has been increased, over the last number of years, to a level which would not have been envisaged at one stage. However, that was distributing the wealth of the Celtic tiger. People were entitled to it, particularly the pensioners who formed and shaped society as we now know it. They contributed throughout their working lives. They are entitled to more significant increases than the paltry amounts proposed.</P>
    <P>The increase in child benefit clearly does not meet the commitment in the programme for Government. I appeal to the Minister to view the amendment favourably and accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment would require another report. A frequent criticism is that we have initiated so many reports over the last number of years and people ask what use they have. I appreciate that the Senator is looking at the NAPS and the programme for Government which we have five years to deliver. The NAPS was reviewed in February of this year. It is an extensive and all-encompassing programme, also of five years duration, taking in not just payments and adequacies of payments but also many other targets. In that context there is not a huge necessity to commission yet another report.</P>
      <P>However, as elected representatives the Senators have taken the opportunity, I am sure, to look at the implications of any budgetary matter and review it over the year, which is something I will do in the numerous reviews which are taking place in the Department of many of the schemes. Some of these have been brought to my attention and Members of both Houses would like me to review and re-assess them. In that context, the Department will continually review the income adequacies of payments. In the NAPS programme we were moving towards &euro;150 per week in 2002. We have already achieved that and we are moving towards &euro;200 in the old age pensions by 2007.</P>
      <P>It is also important to reiterate that increases must take account of available resources. I am sure that some people on my right will remind me about promises. The following commitment has been made: &ldquo;The Government will continue to pursue a strategy of increasing social welfare payments, as resources permit, so that people will have an income level to sustain an acceptable standard of living.&rdquo; It is therefore unfair and a little disingenuous to say that we have not delivered. We are doing it in the context of the resources and the targets, which are the pensions, and the &euro;150 base line in 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2025" />I am sure that the Senator, over the next year, will look at the relevance of the increases in social welfare benefits in the context of the NAPS and the programme for Government, both of which will be reviewed in due course and are always discussed at the social inclusion committee of the Cabinet. I appreciate what the Senator has put forward but I am not in a position to accept the amendment.</P>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy" hpid="Mr. McCarthy Mr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 3, before section 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>2.&ndash;The Minister shall as soon as may be after the passing of this Act prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the implications of abolishing the means test for a carer's allowance and introducing a top-up carer's payment for those in receipt of another social welfare payment.</P>
      <P>We had a lengthy debate on this matter earlier. The Minister gave details of the cost of the proposal. One of the points she made was that we do not know how many carers there are in the country. However, we could look at setting up a national carers' register and a data base for all carers so that we would know the exact number of people involved in caring for a dependant. We are currently attempting to second guess the numbers. Since the lack of statistics forms part of the argument which prevents the abolition of the means test, there is a greater case for introducing either a register or compiling a data base.</P>
      <P>We owe a great debt of gratitude to the many thousands of carers for the support they provide in an area which falls into the responsibility of the State. In doing so they should be recognised. I have had cases, as I am sure has everyone else, of people not qualifying for the carer's allowance because of the means test, yet they were not well off. However, due to the structures which exist they did not satisfy the means test and were pushed to the point where they did not qualify at all. I appeal to the Minister's good nature to accept this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. B. Hayes Mr. B. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator McCarthy's amendment. Will the Minister indicate to the House the latest number of full-time carers according to her Department's figures? On the previous occasions figures were collected &ndash; approximately two years ago &ndash; the number was about 24,000. However, the Carers Association has continually informed colleagues on all sides of the House that the actual figure is about 120,000. A pilot scheme run jointly by the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs two years ago came up with a figure of 24,000. This is a minimal projection. How many of these are receiving the full rate of carer's allowance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2026" />Senator McCarthy referred to another scheme aimed at trying to determine the numbers involved. We have been at this for a number of years now and there has been no change. The problem is that even of the people represented by the Department's figures, a majority do not receive carer's allowance. Perhaps the Minister could enlighten the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not support the amendment. It worries me when people mention, as they did earlier, the State's responsibility. I sometimes wonder whether they have forgotten about the family's responsibility. As a sister, and perhaps some day a mother, of somebody with a disability, I believe it is my responsibility, not that of the State, to look after a person in need. We are moving away from our responsibilities and pushing them on to the State. Unfortunately, in doing this we are creating a gap that we can never fill, an expectation of what the State must do for the people who care for others.</P>
      <P>One of the sad things about the changes we have seen in recent years is the lack of responsibility people feel for members of their families. They are happy just to push them away into nursing homes and move on. We must be careful to ask ourselves whether, after bringing children into the world or being brought up by parents, we do not have a responsibility to look after them. Are we abdicating responsibility for our mothers, fathers, aunts, uncles, sons, daughters, sisters or brothers by not looking after them when they are in need?</P>
      <P>The issue of working with carers and looking after people in need is under constant review, but we must be careful. There will be a cost associated with every decision and we must decide where we want to spend money. I am not in favour of the removal of means testing for carers, which has been discussed many times in the House. If I have a parent who needs to go into a nursing home for full-time care because I am not able to look after her and I have the means &ndash; through an inheritance or earnings &ndash; to pay for it, I do not believe I should be entitled to extra money. For that reason, I am against the abolition of the means test. However, I accept that it needs to be reviewed and we must constantly move towards widening the band of eligible incomes. There are better ways to spend our money than by giving it to people who already have a great deal of their own and who are in a position to look after someone or employ a person to do so, without a consequent impingement on their disposable income.</P>

      <P>Carer's benefit was also mentioned. That is a new scheme which has only been in existence for two years. There are 1,400 people participating in the scheme, which has been very successful.</P>

      <P>We have tried to encourage people to become involved and to take carer's leave. Employers have been generous in facilitating this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We discussed the removal of the means test on Second Stage. At present, it would cost about &euro;150 million to abolish the means test. In the programme for Government we aim to bring 5,000 new carers into the system. By introducing the income disregards we have been able to take another 1,700 into the scheme this year and I <Col N="2028" />hope that over the course of the scheme the numbers will rise to 5,000.</P>
    <P>One of the issues we will soon have to face is the ageing population. My Department and the Department of Health and Children, through the health strategy, has promised to reform the current arrangements. A study on the future financing of long-term care is being finalised. We are exploring strategic issues such as care, home subvention, the role of the social insurance fund and the role of carer's allowance and carer's benefit and their possible financing through PRSI. We are taking into consideration many approaches that have been tried abroad. A number of pilot studies are taking place through the Department of Health and Children. I will soon be able to present to the Government, along with the Minister for Health and Children, a strategic way of financing long-term care. The report will also be published very shortly.</P>
    <P>We all agree that the role of carers is very important. We often do not appreciate the difficulties they experience. We are giving them recognition by adding to their income, although it would not be possible to reward sufficiently some people who are caring for 24 hours a day. Respite care and facilities are very important and we are working with the Department of Health and Children to make sure that these are available to carers, both to assist them in emergencies and to give them a break. We are currently considering the issues raised by the Senator in the context of the report.</P>

In accordance with Standing Order 103, it is deemed to have passed its First, Second and Third Stages in the Seanad and is placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage. On the question &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration&rdquo;, the Minister may explain the purpose of the amendments made by the Dáil. This is looked upon as the report of the Dáil amendments to the Seanad. The only matters, therefore, which may be discussed are the amendments made by the Dáil.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá áthas orm bheith ar ais sa Teach. Over 12 months ago I had the pleasure of bringing this Bill before the Seanad. Since then some amendments have been made by the Dáil. All of the amendments are of a technical nature and none made any material alteration to the substance of the Bill as passed by this House. The amendments of substance were recommended and accepted in this House when the Bill first went through.</P>
      <P>Section 2 was amended to make provision for the restatement of Acts that have not been amended to be included in a restatement. For example, the Statute of Limitations Act, 1957, was amended by the Statute of Limitations (Amendment) Act, 2000. The 2000 Act was not amended. In order to allow it to be restated the words &ldquo;that has been amended&rdquo; were deleted from the Bill. A further amendment was made to this section in order to put beyond doubt the power to include statutory instruments in restatements. The amendment to the Long Title ensures it takes account of amendments to section 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2031" />Amendments Nos. 4 and 5 are technical amendments to section 8 to ensure consistency with the terminology in section 2, which refers to a restatement being &ldquo;certified&rdquo; as opposed to &ldquo;made&rdquo; by the Attorney General. A further amendment was made to section 8 to put beyond doubt the period during which the restatement is to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. That period is clearly stated to be 21 days on which each House has sat after the copy is laid before it.</P>
    <P>A small amendment was made to section 9 to clarify what is envisaged by the Government in relation to orders to be made under the Act. The proposal is that the Government may prescribe by order the form of restatements. An order will be made under this section requiring restatement to be, for example, presented in consecutively numbered paragraphs and to include the Attorney General's certification.</P>
    <P>I commend to the House these technical changes, which will improve the Bill. We look forward to the publication of the restatements as they will be of great benefit, especially to practitioners and lawyers. It will also improve the coherence and accessibility of statute law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. B. Hayes Mr. B. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty with the amendments following the consideration of the Bill by the Dáil. They are technical and will improve the Bill. It is important that our statute law be presented to the public and practitioners in an efficient manner. A huge body of work in the Office of the Attorney General and across Departments is ongoing and I commend them for their efforts. Anything that streamlines the presentation and comprehension of law is welcome.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh" hpid="Dr. Mansergh Dr. Mansergh">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
      <P>We support the amendments. The Bill contributes to what once would have been regarded as the philosopher's stone, the codification of law. There are the famous codes of Justinian and Napoleon, although I do not paint as bright a future for the Minister of State. When I told the former Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, that I was not an unmitigated admirer of Napoleon he looked puzzled, if not offended. The legislation will be useful for historians, practitioners and politicians, especially when they consider such measures as the consolidation of the planning or broadcasting legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no difficulty with the amendments. Members of the House frequently assert that because they are not lawyers they are unable to give full consideration to legislation of this kind. They should not make such statements because we are more than lawyers, we are law makers. We should not apologise to lawyers for our range of skills, which are deeper and more profound than theirs. I am glad we are helping them. I hope that some of the mystique of law will disappear with this process and with that some of the expense associated with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2032" />More people can grasp and understand the law than lawyers would have us believe. I am a professional and I generally support the view that all professions are a conspiracy against the laity. I am glad we are clarifying matters in this area and I welcome the amendments.</P>
    <P>In the last Oireachtas one third of all Bills were initiated in the Seanad. It did a good job on them, reflected in the fact that very little legislation initiated in this House required serious amendment by the Dáil. It is a pity our role is sometimes not recognised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin" hpid="Mr. Hanafin Mr. Hanafin">

It was thoughtful and interesting. Members of the other House were annoyed that the Dáil did not have the same time to consider the Bill.</P>
      <P>If amendments are considered here and there is good time for debate, especially between Stages, Ministers and Senators can reflect on the legislation. This can only improve it. These amendments simplify the Bill and make the legislation easier to comprehend. Any substantial amendments to the Bill were made in this House when it was presented over a year ago.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (1), line 4, after &ldquo;or&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;commercial&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The amendment seeks to insert the word &ldquo;commercial&rdquo; before &ldquo;mechanically propelled vehicles.&rdquo; We feel it is over-kill to apply this requirement to all vehicles entering the State, and it could be detrimental to tourism. I would like to Minister to comment on the proposed amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. M. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposing the amendment because, aside from the drafting difficulty, there is no such thing as a commercial mechanically propelled vehicle within the meaning of the Road Traffic Act, 1961. Given that that Act does not define the phrase which this amendment would create, the argument underlying this amendment is opposed in principle. I will elaborate on that point, if I may. To confine the scope of the carrier liability provisions of the Bill to commercial vehicles would seriously undermine the potential effectiveness of those provisions and leave in existence continuing scope for widespread abuse of our immigration controls. I see no justification in principle or practice for excluding non-commercial vehicles involved in bringing passengers to this State from the scope of the carrier's liability scheme.</P>
      <P>Immigration controls must apply to all non-nationals seeking to enter the State from outside the common travel area. They could not operate in any other way. Carrier liability controls, which form part of the State's immigration control techniques, must likewise apply to all inward vehicular movements for the same reason. If it is unacceptable for the driver of a commercial vehicle to bring a person to the State without proper documents, which is the logic of this amendment, why should it be acceptable for the person in charge of a non-commercial vehicle? Why should it be unacceptable for the person in charge of a boat to bring in an undocumented person, even if the boat is a pleasure craft, and not a commercial vessel, for that is also the logic of the amendment? Why should it be in order for the driver of an eight-seater family car not to have to bother about presenting the passengers in the car for immigration, while the driver of an eight-seater bus must do so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The plain fact is that this amendment would make the operation of sensible immigration controls of any sort, at the point of entry, inoperable. If an immigration officer has to make a decision <Col N="2035" />as to which vehicles coming off a ferry are checkable, and which are not, the scope of revision of immigration control widens. That would be as good a means as any of providing encouragement to criminals to target Ireland as a place for illegal entry.</P>
    <P>While we have in place strong provisions for combating trafficking in persons, in the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act, 2000, it would make for an incoherent strategic approach to combating illegal immigration if we were to close one form of abuse only to leave open another avenue for abuse. The amendment misses the point of the carrier liability scheme, which is to encourage those who are in the business of carrying passengers to make sure that all their passengers have proper documentation, and to encourage those who are not in that business to make sure they do not have on board any unexpected passengers who might not have proper documents. I urge the House to reject the amendment.</P>

The Minister's quite contradictory reply contained an understandable desire to ensure that <Col N="2036" />those who are paid to bring people into this State have a liability to ensure they meet our laws with a reasonable degree of consistency. The Minister is now seeking to transfer that liability to the owner or controller of every car coming into this State. Is it a good idea to erect signs at Roscoff, Fishguard and other ports informing people from Germany, France, Italy and the Netherlands who are coming here on holidays that they may have to pay a &euro;1,500 on the spot fine if they do not have the correct immigration papers or that they can wait and go to court and perhaps pay a fine of &euro;3,000.</P>

      <P>Yes, I am firmly governed by the Chair.</P>
      <P>The Minister was very honest and forthright &ndash; as he always is &ndash; in saying that he wants deliberately to extend this provision to commercial vehicles. Most people think of lorries in the context of the tragic situation which occurred in Wexford. I know the Minister was as upset about that incident as the rest of us and he wishes to do everything he can to avoid that type of occurrence.</P>
      <P>The Minister has been open in saying he does not wish to confine this provision to lorries, commercial vehicles and so on. He feels that such a provision would narrow the Bill greatly, that the legislation must cover private vehicles used by families for pleasure, holidays, etc. I can confidently predict that we will face a series of cases whereby people will be stopped at ports and taken from their cars for one reason only &ndash; that they are black.</P>

There may be legal reasons that questions of definition are involved &ndash; I bow to the Minister's legal knowledge, I do not have any such qualifications. The Minister was a superb lawyer in private practice and I have no reason to imagine his intellect has been dulled since he took ministerial office.

      <P>I support the comments made by my colleagues on this side of the House. The inevitable effect of &ldquo;vehicle&rdquo; covering every vehicle entering the country is to reinforce a sense of fortress Ireland. The perception will be that any foreigners coming through our ports in a car of any shape, form or description will inevitably bear a question mark over them.</P>
      <P>It would be appropriate for the Minister to accept our amendment and relate this provision to commercial vehicles. What the Minister is seeking to do &ndash; he may correct me if I am wrong &ndash; is to prevent trafficking which takes place, for the most part, in large vehicles. Groups of people travelling together will be the primary objective of this legislation.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister clarify the remarks attributed to him in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> regarding the introduction of further amendments to this Bill? Will he at least let us know what to expect? He has indicated to Cabinet that there will be further amendments to this Bill in the context of developments in the UK. It appears his thinking is for us to line up with UK law on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are discussing 14 pages of amendments to a six page Bill. We are now getting indications of further amendments to the Bill. I put it to the Minister and the House that it is not appropriate to debate such a significant number of amendments which would have the effect of changing the Bill so completely that it should be redrafted and reintroduced in <Col N="2039" />the House in the new year. I would be grateful if the Minister would indicate this to this House as a matter of courtesy, having done so to the Cabinet and the media. I appeal to him to look again at the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>In contrast to the very constructive debate here yesterday evening, we seem to have begun this one on a very cantankerous and preposterous basis. I do not think anyone in this House would condone or attempt to defend the criminal activities of trafficking in human beings, the unfortunate consequences of which we saw in commercial vehicles.</P>
      <P>On Senator Norris's point, we are well aware of the situation in Wexford following the unfortunate incident last year. If we close off access by way of commercial vehicles, it will not be beyond the ingenuity of criminals to use private vehicles. Surely we are not seeking to open another avenue for these people. The Minister's response in this regard is eminently sensible and any other approach would not be responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry" hpid="Ms Terry Ms Terry">
      <NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a point on the issue of the carrier and vehicles. The definition of &ldquo;carrier&rdquo; would include carriers of goods who transport persons lacking the required documentation into the State. If it is shown that such a carrier deliberately transports people and vehicles, or compartments of vehicles designed for goods, they should be dealt with under the legislation covering the illegal trafficking in persons. It would be better if the definition of &ldquo;carrier&rdquo; was confined to the carrier of passengers, which would overcome some of the difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Terry's point is very sensible because the logistics of the proposal seem incredible if each private vehicle coming through the ports, particularly during the summer, is to be inspected. Drivers who give lifts to hitchhikers are very vulnerable because they must be assured that the person has the correct documentation. These drivers who may not be involved in trafficking could end up receiving a very large fine.</P>
      <P>The Leader of the House was correct in saying there are black bus drivers, people working here who are Irish citizens, and that black people will not be discriminated against in coming into the country. The point Senator Norris said is true because a black bus driver was recently held at the Border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. He was kept overnight in a Garda station in Dundalk. He was not driving the bus when arrested but was a passenger in the bus going on for another shift. This type of thing is happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had dealings with a young woman whose baby is black, even though she is not. She took the child to England to see his father &ndash; I brought up this issue in the Seanad previously &ndash; and she had considerable difficulty when returning to the <Col N="2040" />country. People are singled out and we would need to be careful in saying this will not happen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that there will be monitoring of all vehicles coming to this country, does the Minister envisage that huge numbers of personnel will have to be recruited to carry out these checks rather than putting the obligation on the commercial carriers, which we thought would be the case up to a few moments ago? Obviously this is a huge task.</P>
      <P>Given that the Minister's colleagues have put a cap on all recruitment, what chaos will emanate from the proposals in the Bill? This is a very serious matter. Putting this theory on paper is one thing but carrying out the proposal is a different matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>There seems to be some misunderstanding in regard to the ambit of the Bill. Section 2(1), even as proposed to be amended, makes it clear that the measure applies to a vehicle arriving in the State from a place other than Great Britain or Northern Ireland or, if a later amendment is accepted, the Channel Islands, Isle of Man and the other near possessions of the United Kingdom. Let us get this straight. The proposal is not of relevance to anyone crossing the Border.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not apply to anyone travelling in a plane from Great Britain to Ireland, nor does it apply to anyone travelling on a ferry from anywhere in the United Kingdom to Ireland. It does apply to, say, the Roscoff or Cherbourg ferry. Even if the legislation was properly drafted &ndash; unfortunately I can see the intent, but the intent was missed because there is not a phrase &ldquo;commercial vehicle&rdquo; within the meaning of the Road Traffic Act, 1961 &ndash; what I am being asked to do is to introduce a law whereby someone who, for instance, brings into the country from France 12 or 14 migrants in a caravan attached to a car escapes liability under the legislation, while someone who drives in with one undocumented hitchhiker on a lorry does not escape liability.</P>
      <P>The Senators who accuse me of arrogance and discourtesy to the House should at least grant me this. The amendment is illogical because it is proposing measures which do not make sense. I would like to see the scene on the Cherbourg ferry as everyone ran from the lorry they were about to embark from into the caravan and then drove past with Senator Norris saying, &ldquo;I am very glad the law is in a sensible state and that chap, Minister McDowell, was a bright man when he made that distinction&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us have a sense of humour about it. The reality is that this is a slightly ridiculous amendment which would have very <Col N="2041" />anomalous results. It does not apply to anyone travelling into this country from the United Kingdom, it applies to vehicles on ferries. Because we are where we are in Europe, we are talking about vehicles on ferries coming from France. If I were to say a lorry driver carrying an undocumented hitchhiker is to face liability while someone who brings in a caravan load of undocumented people should not to face liability, I would be making the law an ass. I will not do that unless the House insists I do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have dealt with many Ministers in this House in the last 20 years or so. Most of them appreciated that Ministers should try to engage with the principle of an Opposition amendment on Committee Stage, rather than playing silly games about the precise wording of amendments. Senators on this side of the House are humble and are quite happy to accept that the combined resources of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Office of the Attorney General can sometimes draft better sections of Bills than we can. When we propose amendments to Bills, we raise issues in the hope that a reasonable Minister will take a reasonable position and will consider whether an amendment on Report Stage can be brought forward, with the advice of ministerial officials and the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.</P>
      <P>We ask that an amendment be considered on the merits of the case we make, not on the relative triviality of whether we can perform the same task of the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel in every detail. If amendments are to be considered on the basis of the triviality I have mentioned, we might as well forget about proposing them. The Minister, Deputy McDowell, should be more aware than most that technical complexities can be resolved by officials who are paid large sums of money to do so. Those of us who are poorly resourced make no apologies for being unable to draft perfect legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may happen that a person, as part of a group of people in a car coming to this country, will forget his or her passport or any other form of identification. In such circumstances, does the Minister think it is reasonable that the driver of the car, who did not know that a passenger had forgotten some documentation until the group boarded the ferry, should have to pay a fine of &euro;1,500? Is this a good idea in a country that is allegedly endeavouring to entice tourists? If the Minister thinks that it is okay, he is right to oppose Senator Tuffy's amendment. If he thinks it is not okay, it is his responsibility to work out a way of dealing with the issues about which he spoke. The language used by the Minister when he referred to people scuttling out of the backs <Col N="2042" />of trucks and into caravans is of a nature usually associated with Deputy Noel O'Flynn.</P>

It is not realistic and I do not wish to be party to the accusation made by Senator Ryan.</P>
      <P>Although there was a certain amount of annoyance on this side of the House when the Minister introduced an element of humour into the debate on this amendment, I had no problem whatever with it. Serious problems can often be underlined or illuminated by a touch of humour, as long as it is not particularly offensive and I found nothing offensive in the Minister's comments. We can be far too picky about language at times. I am much more interested in the substance of one's remarks, although I am willing to play linguistic games as tediously as anyone else in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that he has looked at the question of people being called aside on the purely observational basis that they happen to be of a different colour from the majority of Irish <Col N="2043" />citizens. I am sure the Minister will accept that it happens with disturbing frequency, even between the two parts of this island. When I say that it happens with disturbing frequency, I should clarify that once is too often. Records suggest that it happens from time to time, although it is not an epidemic. The Minister admitted that it happens at the Border, but he said that it rarely happens to those who arrive on ferries from England and France. If it happens between the two parts of this island, is it not likely that it will happen with greater frequency when vehicles arrive from the Continent? I do not think the Minister has made a strong point, as the phenomenon I have described is more likely to be found when traffic arrives from the Continent.</P>
    <P>I do not think a massive, criminally assisted invasion of Ireland by people driving Volkswagens or Fords is likely to occur. People arriving in cars are quite visible, whereas those who arrive in containers are concealed as a central part of the operation. It is highly unlikely that persons without appropriate papers will sit at the front of a camper van, smiling at the officials who come to meet them. Similarly, it is unrealistic to imagine that 12 of these people will hide in a caravan. Under this legislation, people who arrive in such modes of transport are requested to show the correct documentation and if they are found not to have it, they will not be admitted to the country. That is the real point.</P>
    <P>The Minister raised the question of a hitchhiker. Why should somebody be fined &euro;1,500 for giving a lift to a hitchhiker? I disagree with the Minister in so far as I do not think an automatic fine on the carrier would be a good idea. I will move an amendment later in this debate to delete a more appropriate section of the Bill for this reason. I will place before the House personal evidence that such a move would be dangerous and counter-productive. I disagree with the Minister on a philosophical level. The example he gave serves to weaken his case rather than to strengthen it, as it is more likely that people coming on ferries from Roscoff will be stopped.</P>

      <P>It is appropriate that I should say at the outset that Labour Party Senators do not sympathise with any legislation that will create a fortress Ireland. The Minister is aware that I do not agree that immigration officers, who already have too much power, should be given additional powers to enforce a state of mind such as that represented by Deputy O'Flynn in the other House. It is a mistake to think that Deputy O'Flynn would be in any way upset at being attacked in this House or anywhere else.</P>

      <P>It is a sad fact that people like Deputy O'Flynn are quick to gain political advantage from the unfortunate problems of others. It is clear that the Labour Party wishes to oppose the work of commercial traffickers &ndash; people who bring others across continents for significant financial gain &ndash; and it supports any measure that will bring an end to their activities. The amendment moved by Senator Tuffy seeks to distinguish between well-organised criminal gangs that engage in the trafficking of hundreds of people across continents and those who may casually pick up a hitchhiker without asking if he or she has a passport. I do not think it is beyond the wit of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to cater for such a distinction by defining commercial vehicles in a clearer manner.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris is right to say that this section of the Bill does not apply to the United Kingdom, including Northern Ireland. This provision does not arise from a strongly held principle, but from the fact that we have traditionally shared a common travel area with the UK. I do not doubt that the Minister would happily extend the provision to cover Great Britain and Northern Ireland if he could do so.</P>
      <P>I am genuinely interested in knowing whether his Department holds statistics about the place of origin of the bulk of asylum seekers and where the majority of incidents of the type catered for in this section of the Bill take place. Perhaps the Minister can supply such details. Do such incidents take place as passengers disembark in Cork or Rosslare from ferries coming from Cherbourg or Roscoff? Do many such incidents occur in Dublin as people arrive from the United Kingdom? Where are applications for asylum made?</P>

      <P>That is an appalling distortion, as I said nothing of the kind.

We are not against the idea but we are not in favour of enforcing a law which would oblige people to subject those whom they casually pick up, such as hitchhikers, to interrogation and to inspection of their passports there and then. There has to be a distinction made. If not, we will fail to get the point. There is no need for the Minister to distort what I said.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a certain absence of reality here. Senator Ryan accused me of discourtesy to the House. None was intended. If I remain in good humour when others are becoming angry and working themselves into tempers, that is their problem, not mine. I intend to proceed as I started.</P>
      <P>Those who board a ferry at Roscoff or Cherbourg have to produce documents to get on to the ship in the first place if they are travelling normally or openly. However, if they are travelling in the boot of a car or concealed under a rug in the back of a car, caravan or camper van they might be brought aboard a ferry in circumstances where they would not have to present their documents. This is double law in the sense that the carrier, for most purposes, is the owner of the ship and will not admit any non-national who is not properly documented to his vessel. The only people who are likely to be affected by the Bill are those who have somehow evaded the checks which are done as a matter of course by the proprietors of the ship and boarded it in some way.</P>
      <P>The question which then arises is whether we should distinguish between someone who has evaded notice getting on to a commercial vehicle, who has to be criminalised, and someone who has evaded notice and got into a private vehicle with the knowledge of, or lack of vigilance on the part of, the owner and who should attract no sanction. We should consider whether it would be worthwhile to distinguish between those two classes of vehicles. Would it be worthwhile to say that someone who is operating the Act at Rosslare, or anywhere else, should be allowed challenge or inspect one class of people, those driving commercial vehicles, knowing that he cannot take any action under the Act in respect of someone who is driving either a caravan with people in it or car with people in the boot or in a rug in the back of an estate wagon? I ask the Senators to consider if it would be reasonable for me to accept, in all of those circumstances, even the principle of this distinction if the drafting has been correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not dismissing the amendment because its drafting is slightly defective. I am saying that even if the drafting was right the idea is not right. The distinction is simply not one which ought to be made in our law. I ask the Senators to consider this. It applies to people coming in vehicles &ndash; we are talking about road vehicles because this is the distinction which has been drawn by the amendment &ndash; from outside the State into the State other than via the United Kingdom. This means, in effect, people travelling in any car ferry from <Col N="2046" />France or Spain. The amendment is asking me to say that someone who somehow gets on to one of those ferries without being checked in the ordinary way and someone who carries him should not be subject to a sanction if the vehicle he is using is a private vehicle but should be subject to a sanction if it is a van, bus or lorry.</P>
    <P>No matter how long the debate on this amendment goes on, the Senators who initially supported the amendment will, on reflection, consider that it is not a distinction that should be made. I ask, in good humour and as politely as I can, that the Senators reconsider and with draw the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to delay the House but the real difficulty is getting the Minister to address the problem. If someone is in a car on a car ferry, under the legislation the person in charge of the car ferry will be guilty of an offence if he has not checked it. The first reality check is that anyone who has used the car ferry services between Ireland and France knows that on the other side there is a 50/50 chance that his passport will not be checked in either direction. There is no guarantee that the authorities in those countries will check passports. However, an obligation is being imposed with which I would not take so much issue and that is that those operating the ferries are supposed to ensure compliance. It is gross overkill to extend the obligation from the operators of the ferry to people on a family holiday, coming from the Netherlands, France or Italy one of whose members forgets to bring proof of his identity. The only safeguard is that it shall be a defence for someone charged with an offence under this section that he took all steps reasonably open to him to ensure compliance. If a Dutch person on holidays forgets to check that all of his children have their passports, is he taking reasonable steps? There is no need to penalise innocent individuals.</P>
      <P>I apologise to the Minister if I was a little sharp. I did not say that he was like Deputy Noel O'Flynn. I said that the language he used was put him dangerously close to being accused of that. He is casual in his use of language and gives encouragement to people like that.</P>
      <P>I wish the Minister would explain why he has to penalise the drivers of private cars in the same way and with the same fine as the operator of a car ferry. If the maximum penalty for the operator of a car ferry is &euro;1,500 for one person, why is the penalty the same for an innocent driver of a private car who happens to have someone in the car who is not carrying documents? Why cannot the distinction be made between people who are coming here? This is supposed to be a welcoming tourist-oriented country which is encouraging people to come here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Everyone who boards a ferry will be checked by the ferry company. At present it has not an obligation to check the documentation of its passengers. We are now bringing <Col N="2047" />in a rule that obliges them to check and they will pay a fine for every undocumented passenger they carry. From now on every ferry company and airline travelling into Ireland from outside of the United Kingdom will have to put in place checks to ensure all its passengers are documented. That is a rule we are introducing and they will be liable if they fail to live up to their new duty. Someone who boards a ferry undocumented is someone who will have evaded.</P>
      <P>I accept Senator Ryan's point that currently there is some casualness about this and not everyone is counted in every car. From now on that degree of casualness will disappear. Everyone will have to carry appropriate papers to board a ferry or plane from outside the UK and coming to Ireland. It will be unusual for anyone boarding a ferry to be unchecked from now on.</P>
      <P>It could clearly apply to people who are concealed in a vehicle. Unless ferry staff search every vehicle, it is possible to conceal people in one. If people are travelling like this and the owner has failed in his or her duty to check whether they are entitled to enter Ireland, it would make no sense to distinguish between the driver of a car towing a caravan with five people under the bed and the driver of a truck who made no effort to ensure that his container doors were locked while travelling between Cherbourg and Rosslare. We are dealing with reality here.</P>
      <P>I ask the Senators to withdraw the amendment because it asks me, even if it were redrafted in a neater way, to make a distinction I ought not to make and which has no practical use.</P>

      <P>I am not trying to cause devilment, but I am not clear on whom the primary liability falls or who the carrier is in any particular case. The definitions section defines carriers, including the owner, and then further defines &ldquo;owner&rdquo; to include part-owner, charter manager or operator. It is not unusual for ships or, for that matter, planes to have quite a complex pattern of ownership in which one person might own it, another charter it and yet another operate it. For the purposes of the Bill, who is the carrier on whom the primary liability falls?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Senator that to my knowledge, there is no policy, either formal or informal, of discriminating against colleges based on their geographical location in relation to admission of students.</P>
      <P>This Bill will not add to the difficulties in getting into Ireland. What will happen is that the carriers, who are in this sense the proprietors or the people in charge of the ship or aircraft, will have to check documentation. It should be understood in the House that no &ldquo;fortress Ireland&rdquo; policy has suddenly appeared in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Ireland is the last country in the EU not to have such provisions. This is not something we took out of the bottom drawer over at St. Stephen's Green to help us create fortress Ireland. Ireland is an anomaly in Europe in that every other member state has put in place carrier liability legislation of some kind.</P>
      <P>Senator McDowell asked about primary liability. The simple answer is that there is no simple answer &ndash; it depends. If the owner of a ship allows a lorry on to the ship in which three or four refugees are concealed, it would be unreasonable to expect the staff of the ship to search the lorry in question. In that case the carrier will not be liable under this law if he or she had no reason to believe a passenger was being carried. If, on the other hand, somebody is plainly visible to the carrier, who fails in his or her duty to ensure that the person is documented, he or she should be liable under this law. This law imposes on them a duty to ensure they do not carry undocumented passengers. If a lorry driver unloading a container at Rosslare had an undocumented passenger in the front seat, it would suggest that the owners of the ferry failed to ensure he or she was documented. If the person being carried is hidden under bales in the back of the container there is no <i>prima facie</i> basis on which an immigration officer could seek to apply liability to that person. It all depends on the circumstances.</P>
      <P>There are many cases where criminal liability is applied to a number of people at the same time. One of them might establish a defence that he or she has taken all reasonable steps but the owner of a car in whose boot there is a person concealed with his or her knowledge is liable. It is shared liability in theory but only one person will be liable in any given circumstance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am capable of devilment but here I am genuinely trying to tease out what &ldquo;carrier&rdquo; means in the definition section of the Bill. The carrier is the person who is liable under section 2 of the Bill for the offences. Going back to the example, would Servisair, the owner of the aircraft or the operator of the aircraft be liable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator McDowell is a lawyer of some subtlety and perspicacity. I cannot think of any clearer language to express who the carrier is. It is either the owner of the vehicle or the person in charge of the vehicle. Where Aer Lingus or any other airline delegates to another company the checking of passenger documentation, it does so at its own risk. If it carries someone who is undocumented, that is its problem. The Bill does not allow it to say it has complied with its duties because Servisair in Paris did it. The obligation is non-transferable. Whoever owns or is in charge of the vehicle carries the liability. There a difference between the owner and the person in charge because the vast majority of aircraft are owned by leasing companies.</P>
      <P>There must be a definition of this kind. People cannot cast off their liability under this Bill if they are a carrier. It does not matter a whit if they have done the checking themselves or asked someone to do the checking for them, or whether that person is an independent contractor or an employee. It is immaterial to the liability of the carrier. It is clear if the Senator consults the definition of &ldquo;carrier&rdquo; that is so.</P>

      <P>The Minister is saying that the people responsible for checking passports in Dublin Airport are not those who will be held liable, but the airline that owns the plane being <Col N="2051" />boarded. I came back from Roscoff during the summer. There is a hut at the entrance to the port where passports are checked, or not, as happened to me. I presume the French immigration service or the police operate that service. If I was with Brittany Ferries, it would be reasonable for me to rely on these guys to check passports and documentation &ndash; that is their job. The Minister is saying that if they do not do that properly, Brittany Ferries is still responsible. That places unreasonable liability on the carrier. Immigration is for states to organise through their police forces or immigration services. If they do not do their job properly, to place a secondary or primary liability on transport companies is entirely unreasonable. The Minister will put in place two checks &ndash; the State will check at one hut and then the transport operator will have a responsibility to check it further along. That is unreasonable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator McDowell that it is wrong to place all responsibility on either the carrier or the driver of a vehicle. There are varying levels of inspection at different ports. It is unreasonable to expect a lorry driver to have the equipment that the French authorities would have that can detect body heat through container walls. The onus should not be shifted on to lorry drivers. It is unfair and places a disproportionate penalty on them. It should be shifted to the officers of the states through which the vehicle passes. They have the capacity, resources and technology to do this. There are situations where lorry drivers have passed through checks in good faith and, subsequently, people were found on board. If the checking authorities of the state cannot find someone in a vehicle and a driver is unaware of them, why should he or she be penalised when the officers of the state who are charged with the responsibility are not penalised?</P>

      <P>Senator Norris made an interesting point about the authorities in other countries. There is anecdotal evidence &ndash; perhaps more than that &ndash; to suggest that other authorities have turned a blind eye to this. The events at the Channel tunnel are an example. The authorities are happy to see people pass through their jurisdiction into others. This is a reasonable point. I have some knowledge of the shipping and transport business and cannot see how carriers and drivers could be excluded from the legislation. Some of them have undoubtedly been culpable in accepting money for trafficking in human beings.</P>

      <P>There seemed to be much more concern on the part of the former Soviet Union to stop people leaving the place than to prevent them getting in. That is resonant of one kind of society. There is no obligation on any EU member state or its police force to check any vehicle leaving the country in order to prevent <Col N="2053" />undocumented people getting out. A system which sought to cast that responsibility or asked the Irish State to assume it would be done by other countries would be a nonsense, as Senator Walsh pointed out. There is no interest on the part of most states in preventing a problem from passing through their territory to the territory of another country.</P>
      <P>We must get real about this. This is a carrier liability Bill, not a foreign states police force liability Bill. We cannot control the activities of police forces in continental Europe and oblige them to check vehicles. However, as Senator Walsh said, in the fullness of time &ndash; it will be full if we continue at this rate &ndash; when we reach subsections (5) and (6) of section 2, it will be realised that there is a full defence to cover exactly the points about which Senator Norris is concerned. While we engage in verbal trench warfare about the definitions in section 1, we ignore the full defences offered in section 2. Unless somebody has a difficulty with the definitions or is offering a different definition, or hoping to offer one on Report Stage, we should agree that section 1 stand part of the Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2054" />The Bill, as drafted, will require operators to require Irish citizens to disembark. This is an absurd idea, and will be cumbersome and difficult to apply. There is concern about Ireland's image with regard to the treatment of visitors and citizens. The Bill is an interference with civil liberties and the phrasing in this part of it could be unconstitutional for the reasons I have raised. The Minister should make a statement on this.</P>

Bearing in mind the thrust of the debate has been thus far that it is unreasonable to cast excessive burdens on the carrier, the purpose of the amendment would be to require carriers to satisfy themselves as to who were nationals or non-nationals. It is a misconceived amendment. It may be that related amendments would have more significance at a later stage of the debate, but to substitute &ldquo;non-nationals&rdquo; in this provision would be to ask the carrier to make judgments which would be wholly impractical.</P>

      <P>With respect, we are talking about an amendment. We are not discussing the powers of an immigration officer as much as the obligation cast on the carrier to ensure people comply with directions given by the immigration officer. The suggestion is that the carrier should only ensure that non-nationals comply with the direction and should not be under any obligation to ensure that Irish nationals comply with it. That is a recipe for chaos.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not follow the purport of the amendment. I do not understand how it can be correct for an <Col N="2055" />immigration officer to direct that all persons on board a vehicle seeking to land in the State should get off. I also do not understand the logic behind the suggestion that there should be a new law to allow officers to ask people to alight from a vehicle, ship or aeroplane and present themselves for checking, but that the obligation on the carrier should be limited to cases where non-nationals are being carried.</P>

      <P>I want to tease the matter out. I do not understand what is meant by the section.

Why are we trying to impose such a responsibility on a ship owner? </P>

      <P>I am seeking a similar clarification. What is the effect of paragraph (<i>a</i>)? Must an immigration officer inspect everyone or can he use his discretion? Paragraph (<i>c</i>) refers to each non-national on board. The legislation is aimed at non-nationals. Part of the reason we tabled this amendment was to specify non-nationals, as the Minister did in paragraph (<i>c</i>).</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am intrigued by the Minister's concerns. Our amendment proposes to substitute &ldquo;non-nationals&rdquo; for &ldquo;persons&rdquo;. However, section 2(1)(<i>c</i>) states that the carrier is required to do many things for a non-national. The carrier must ensure that he or she has with him or her a valid passport or other equivalent document and, if required by law, a valid Irish transit visa or an Irish visa. The carrier must identify non-nationals in order to deal with the issues referred to in paragraph (<i>c</i>). Why is it acceptable under paragraph (<i>c</i>) to tell the carriers they must identify non-nationals, but it is acceptable under paragraphs (<i>a</i>) or (<i>b</i>)? They must identify and separate non-nationals. It is an affront to Irish people to introduce legislation which states that they must queue as if they were seeking permission to re-enter their own country. It is reminiscent of some of the things to which the Minister referred earlier.</P>

      <P>When a person presents themselves, an officer does not know whether he or she is a non-national or a national. An officer cannot distinguish that until the person produces his or her papers. If the people on board a ship refuse to disembark, the immigration officer does not have the authority to go on board. From my knowledge of the shipping business, the captain of the ship is in charge of the vehicle while it is in port. There must be a responsibility on the carrier to ensure that people comply. The thrust of the Bill is to place responsibility on carriers, commercial or otherwise. It seems logical to extend that to give them the opportunity to co-operate with immigration officers to ensure that the Bill is effective. I do not understand the logic behind the amendment.</P>

It seems the carrier will decide at the port who should or should not travel to our country. That will deny someone the right to seek asylum here. It is the State's obligation, but we are giving that authority to the carrier. Perhaps the Minister could clarify that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I remind Senators that I am dealing with one amendment because Senator Ryan, in his wisdom and in the spirit of co-operation, told me I cannot deal with any other amendments. I will not, therefore, deal with the intent of the section at this stage.</P>
      <P>We are dealing with a proposal to delete &ldquo;persons&rdquo; in line 22 and substitute &ldquo;non-nationals&rdquo;. The effect of that would be to ask the carrier under the section to make distinctions between directions given by immigration officers in respect of Irish nationals and persons who are not Irish nationals. The purpose of section 2(1)(<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>) is to specify duties cast on carriers. Each of the duties must be looked at separately, but the three duties cast in paragraphs (<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>) will, if they are not complied with, give rise to criminal liability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2057" />As regards paragraph (<i>a</i>), there is an obligation on someone bringing a ship to Ireland to ensure that all persons on the ship who are seeking to land in Ireland or to pass through a port here to travel somewhere else disembark in accordance with directions given by immigration officers. That means they cannot loiter in the boiler room until after midnight when all the other passengers have gone and that they must pass through channel A or B if an immigration officer says that is the way they should go.</P>
    <P>Any carrier who does not comply with his or her duty and take all reasonable steps to ensure that the passengers disembark in the manner required by the immigration officer attracts to himself or herself a criminal liability. If a ship with 100 people on board is docks in Ireland and an immigration officer says that all passengers intending to land in or pass through Ireland must get off the ship, a carrier who fails to ensure that all passengers are cleared from the ship during the time the immigration officer is present to check their documents will commit an offence and attract penalties for each person he or she does not require to leave the ship in accordance with the directions given by the immigration officer. Likewise, if a carrier was completely relaxed and casual and allowed passengers to spill out and go in every direction but the direction in which the immigration officer indicated they were to go, the carrier would be liable. The purpose of all of this is to impose upon carriers the obligation to ensure that their passengers enter the State in a manner in which immigration officers can exercise the requisite degree of control.</P>
    <P>In Senator Tuffy's amendment we are being asked to delete the word &ldquo;persons&rdquo; and insert &ldquo;non-nationals&rdquo; and, therefore, to bring about a situation where it would not be an offence for a carrier to leave people on a ship at a later stage or to let them wander through whatever channel they wanted as long as they were Irish nationals. If that were the case and one attempted to prove the matter afterwards in a criminal court, one would have to prove that people found concealed on a ship were non-nationals in order to bring home the offence. If they fled across the fields, or whatever, one would not be in a position to prove the case at all.</P>
    <P>It would not make sense to do what Senator Tuffy is suggesting in this case and I ask her, respectfully, to withdraw her amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. D. McDowell Mr. D. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The point made by Senator Ryan is a good one. I am not altogether confident of the terminology of our amendment but it is more than reasonable to point out that subparagraph (<i>c</i>)<i></i>already defines a difference and puts obligations on a carrier in respect of non-nationals. That in turn suggests that there is, therefore, a requirement on ship owners, for example, to distinguish a non-national from a national. I am not sure how they are meant to do that. Are they to corral non-nationals into a hold of the ship? Nevertheless, as things stand there is <Col N="2058" />a clear obligation on them to distinguish between the two. It seems to me that is not reasonable.</P>
      <P>With regard to what the Minister has just said about the liability of a carrier, I am not sure that I am in sympathy with this idea. Brittany Ferries, for example, is a large and profitable carrier owned by a French company. It is not reasonable for the State to impose even on that company an obligation to ensure that people disembark through a particular channel in Rosslare. Surely it is our job to use our immigration forces, if that is the right word, to ensure that is done in the way we want it done. To say the ship owner has some responsibility for that is an extension of a liability which is not reasonable. Whatever one may say about checking documentation when passengers embark, to say it is the ship owner's responsibility rather than ours to see they disembark in a certain way is not reasonable.</P>
      <P>I assume immigration officers have powers to enter and search ships docked in Irish ports.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a carrier's liability Bill. It is a touching and welcome development that the Labour Party should seek to transfer to the State, which is not making a profit from this transaction, all the extra costs of ensuring that people comply with the law and to exonerate the private companies who are making profits from any duty to ensure that they fulfil their part of the bargain and present their passengers in an orderly fashion to the immigration officers of the State.

    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Senator McDowell that subparagraph (<i>c</i>) uses the term &ldquo;non-national&rdquo; but in this wonderful republic of ours it is the <i>prima facie </i>right of an Irish citizen to get back into Ireland. The absence of an Irish passport is not a reason for someone who can otherwise establish that he or she is an Irish national to be refused the right to enter the country. We do not want to prevent someone who has lost his or her Irish passport <Col N="2059" />from being carried or who loses it overboard when the ship is docking, to be made to go back to France unnecessarily.  </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>We have to be realistic and look to the rest of this section to determine to nature of the obligation being cast on the carrier by section 2(1). It is a defence for a person charged with an offence under this section to show that he or she took all such steps as were reasonably open to him or her to ensure compliance with the provisions of the Act. It is a reasonableness test. In order to decide whether he or she is carrying undocumented people a carrier must make a reasonable stab at deciding who are the Irish nationals and who are not. The best way to do that is to ask them to produce documents and Irish people will, in all probability, prove they are Irish nationals by producing Irish identity documents of one form or another. In those circumstances if all reasonable steps have been taken to ensure they were Irish citizens the carrier has complied with his or her obligation under the Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Being reasonable, it is more practical in this day and age to look at air passengers, who are the majority of people who travel to this country from outside the common travel area. In those cases reasonable steps to comply will establish a full defence under section 5. The requirement will be complied with if the carrier arranges that a passenger travelling on his or her plane produces a travel document which is valid for travel to Ireland at the time he or she checks in and boards the flight.</P>

      <P>it is the carrier's duty to ensure he or she is carrying people who are documented. If a carrier makes an arrangement <Col N="2060" />with Servisair in Charleroi airport, for example, to carry out this function the carrier will be guilty if he or she produces someone in Ireland who is not documented. The carrier may say he or she has done everything that could reasonably be done. One of the things the carrier must reasonably do, if the check is not carried out by him or her, is provide someone competent who he or she can prove has carried out the check on the carrier's behalf. The carrier will be liable for the criminal penalty and it is a matter of indifference to the Irish State if he or she has some contractual arrangement with Servisair in Charleroi Airport whereby the carrier gets reimbursed for every mistake the private enterprise co-partner makes in this area. If there is laxness on the part of those who do the checking in and the carrier incurs a liability on that account, that is the carrier's problem.</P>

      <P>I will not labour the point but I believe we have a difficulty here. The people who are doing the checking are not actually liable. Servisair, or whoever, in Charleroi Airport does not have a liability. The people who delegated the duty to them have the liability and there is no reference to delegation in the Bill.</P>
      <P>This is unreasonable. One can get into virtually any Irish airport without producing a passport and one may well have started one's journey in a French regional airport where procedures are quite lax. If we want to prevent immigrants getting through, for example, Farranfore Airport having come from an airport in France it is for the Irish State to provide immigration facilities in Farranfore rather than insist that Servisair do so in Montpellier, for example. We are putting too much onus on the carriers.</P>

If the people of Ireland heard the specious arguments being thrown up, one after another, with the best of humour, against putting in place a workable law which puts Ireland on a par with every other European Union member state and that Senator McDowell was asking me to accept that a carrier will be exempt from liability, because a different company or agency checks people on to flights, and therefore that I cannot have carrier liability because it is unfair and that Irish immigration officers should do the work themselves, the only logical explanation I can think of is that he wants to maximise State employment in Ireland and recruit a Border police who spend their days checking everybody who comes into this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed we are and I will address that in a moment. However, I want to respond briefly to what the Minister has said. Surely, this Bill is about finding a balance as to who operates the immigration service, the carrier or the immigration service proper. Immigration officers here have a great deal of powers. As Revenue officers, they are vested with quasi-judicial powers, certainly investigative powers and powers of search which are serious. These powers are given to them by the State under statute and it is right and fair that they should be. What the Minister appears to suggest is that rather than give the immigration service the primary responsibility for enforcing the immigration laws of the State it should be transferred to Ryanair or Aer Lingus. It is not unreasonable to impose some obligation on carriers, whether ferry owners, ship-owners or airlines, to ensure compliance with the immigration laws, but the Minister is transferring the entire onus to them and suggesting it is in some way unreasonable for us to criticise that fact. That <Col N="2062" />is not an unreasonable stance to adopt and we will continue to do so for the rest of the evening and beyond. That the Minister should determine that argument as specious is strikingly wide of the mark.</P>
      <P>In regard to the amendment, the Minister and I have never managed to get through these issues easily. The specific point raised by Senator Ryan was that carriers are already obliged to treat non-nationals in a different fashion from the way they treat nationals. He has correctly described the position as to why that should be the case. It strikes me that that causes practical difficulties in terms of how it is done on board ship and whether it requires checks to be made before disembarkation. If the Minister is giving an assurance that he would consider such a check would be unreasonable or unnecessary in order to comply with the Act, I will accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some sympathy with the Minister's position on this matter, particularly with regard to the responsibility of carriers. With the proliferation of franchising out &ndash; Servisair and Ryanair are also being bought in &ndash; it appears the Minister's position is reasonable to a certain extent and is also the prevailing situation in other jurisdictions. I am profoundly glad it is the carrier, whether Ryanair, Aer Lingus or the agent, Servisair, that is responsible and not the individual. I have had experience of this. I managed to get on an aeroplane some years ago in London and apparently I was not properly checked. When I looked at my passport I found I did not have a visa which was then required for the United States. It was in another passport and I was very relieved to find that British Airways was fined something like $20,000 and I was not.</P>

      <P>If responsibility is not put on the carrier, effectively one is facilitating those involved in criminal activities involving asylum seekers and refugees. A carrier who is operating in good faith and has passengers on board will have no difficulty in complying with the Bill. Obviously, if he is doing it surreptitiously for profit or other motivation he will have difficulty because he will be seeking to conceal them.</P>
      <P>It behoves us, unless there is an intent to make the Bill unworkable, which I hope is not the case, to comply with the wording set out. To seek to change it, as the amendment suggests, leaves it open for a coach and four. I ask the Labour Party to be upfront if it is opposed to the thrust of the Bill but not to hide pedantically behind this type of amendment.</P>

      <P>I do not see anything over the top in requiring a carrier to present all passengers to an immigration officer for examination. If I was to accede to the Senator's amendment, it would mean that only non-nationals would have to be presented. Therefore, if people scarpered across the airport fields or disappeared off the ferry and ran, I would not be able to prove who they were. I would then have a difficulty in proving a breach of duty because I would not be able to prove the status of the people I could not find. Let us be reasonable about this. I am sorry, I thought we were talking about amendment No.&nbsp;5.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 4 concerns the replacement of &ldquo;in compliance with&rdquo; with &ldquo;if required to do so by&rdquo;. &ldquo;In compliance with any directions given by immigration officers&rdquo; is the phrase used in the Bill. If a direction is given, it must be complied with. The phrase, &ldquo;if required to do so by,&rdquo; has the same meaning. If an immigration officer does not give a direction, there is no failure on the part of the carrier to adhere to the duty cast on him by the section. An immigration officer will only <Col N="2064" />give a direction when he or she chooses. The meaning of the two phrases is the same.</P>
    <P>I accept what Senator O'Meara said about the need to examine legislation carefully. I am trying to make reasonable progress with the Bill so as to save her from the wrath of the Leader of the House who might be tempted to take the view that inadequate progress has been made and resort to more draconian tactics to ensure a proper pace is adhered to.</P>

      <P>In page 4, subsection (1)(<i>c</i>), line 29, after &ldquo;non-national&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;(other than a non-national seeking or proposing to seek asylum in the State)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Our purpose is to ensure we do not exclude those coming to this island seeking asylum. The section, as phrased, makes it more difficult for asylum seekers to come here. It will probably lead to more instances such as the one that occurred in County Wexford last year. It is unacceptable not to allow exceptions for genuine asylum seekers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. D. McDowell Mr. D. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important point. It comes down to who decides which person is a legitimate asylum seeker entitled to asylum here. We contend that, after lengthy debate in both Houses, there is a complex procedure in place for deciding who is entitled to asylum here. We should not impose on carriers an obligation to make a decision, <i>prima facie</i> or otherwise, as to whether somebody is a genuine person entitled <Col N="2066" />to asylum. Clearly, if someone arrives here from France, we would say, on the face of it, that the Dublin Convention should apply and he or she should be returned to France. Whether it does apply or whether he or she is returned is a decision that should be made by an immigration officer who has power to decide if an application is manifestly unfounded. That is the point at which a decision should be taken. It should not, under any circumstances, be taken by a carrier, whether a aeroplane or ship operator.</P>

      <P>I question the merits of saying, by deletion or amendment as proposed, that asylum seekers should not have any form of identification. There would appear to be a certain contradiction in people seeking asylum without being able or willing to say who they are or from where they have come. In my view, there is no valid objection to a requirement by the State for the production of some such documentation with regard to their identity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I must admit to some surprise that those amendments have been tabled. Section 2(1)(<i>c</i>) places a requirement on a carrier to ensure that a non-national has the proper documentation &ndash; a valid passport or other valid document which establishes his or her nationality and identity and, if required, a valid visa or transit visa. All that is required of a carrier is that he or she carries out the rudimentary task of checking the passenger's documents to ensure they are in order. Nothing more is necessary. Carriers' staff will be helped, as some already are, by training <Col N="2067" />and advice from immigration officers to enable them to spot the more obvious forgeries and falsifications. Basically, however, it is a fairly mechanical task. If an intending passenger presents with insufficient documentation at a port of embarkation for Ireland, it is no different to turning up with insufficient money for the fare. All the carrier has to do is tell the intending passenger he or she cannot travel on that day.</P>
      <P>If amendment No. 7 was accepted, further responsibilities would be thrust on the carrier to make more personal inquiries of the intending passenger by asking questions such as: &ldquo;Do you intend to seek asylum in Ireland?&rdquo; How could we possibly have that? What is the position of Labour Party Senators in relation to the Dublin Convention? In the vast majority of cases, flights and shipping services bringing passengers to Ireland are originating from Dublin Convention countries. Are we to say that anybody who forgets his or her passport may insist on boarding on the pretext of being an asylum seeker? That would be wide open to abuse. Let us be more realistic in this regard. If we are imposing carrier's liability, we cannot expect every check-in desk to become a mini-tribunal, asking passengers their reasons for travelling to Ireland and trying to establish whether they are genuine asylum seekers. We cannot have a situation where a person without any documents whatsoever can evade the requirement to produce documentation to gain admittance to Ireland by simply stating to a Servisair employee at Charlerois Airport, or wherever, that he or she intends to claim asylum in Ireland. We must live in the real world. How could we possibly legislate on the basis that a person without a visa for entry to Ireland can board a flight to this country by simply saying the magic words, &ldquo;I intend to claim asylum in Ireland&rdquo;?</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Members of this House to be realistic in this matter. If that were to be the law, we may as well throw out the Bill in its entirety. Nobody in his or her right mind would bother to produce a passport if he or she could simply engage in the verbal formula of saying he or she is considering making an asylum application on arrival in Dublin. There is no substance to that proposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I appreciate that Senators are anxious to facilitate asylum seekers in some way, I have indicated publicly that one of the balancing mechanisms I intend to put in place is that Ireland will accept programme refugees under United Nations arrangements. That will involve people about whose status there will be no doubt, because they will be presented to this country by the United Nations as genuine refugees who will not have to go through all the procedures of making applications to commissioners or going through legal processes of appeal and so on. If I were to accept this amendment, the effect would be that a person could board any flight to Ireland, without any documentation, subject only to paying the airline in question and stating that he or <Col N="2068" />she intends, or is considering, making an application for asylum on arrival in Dublin. Rather than using the term I was about to use, I will confine myself to saying that is somewhat unrealistic.</P>

      <P>I take the Senator's point but my response is to ask if this Bill should be emasculated to the point that anybody presenting without travel documents at any check-in anywhere in Europe or America or wherever and intending to claim asylum in Ireland should be ushered on board a plane? If that is to be the situation, not only should we abandon this Bill, we should also abandon all immigration controls. Ireland would become an easy target for those without any documentation as they would simply have to pay the fare, board a flight to Ireland and arrive in Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an interesting distinction to be made in this regard. I assume the Minister would claim the Immigration Bill, 2002, is intended to cut down on illegal immigration to this country. What he is not telling the House &ndash; and perhaps it follows logically from his comments &ndash; is that it is also intended to provide another rung to prevent people from seeking asylum in Ireland. That rung will not be provided by the immigration service, the Garda or other forces of the State, but by airlines. In effect, the Minister requires airlines to determine whether people are genuine asylum seekers. As Senator Tuffy has pointed out, many people seeking asylum do so on the basis of either having no documentation or having documentation which is forged, inaccurate or incomplete. That is quite commonplace, as the Minister is well aware. That is one of the difficulties in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one transfers to airlines responsibilities which are properly carried out by the forces of law, the end result is the situation which will arise under this Bill. As the Minister has said, somebody at an airport check-in desk will decide whether an intending passenger is a genuine asy<Col N="2069" />lum seeker. The Minister may wish to have it that way but we do not. We take the view that, as the Minister is well aware, if people arrive in Ireland with a manifestly unfounded case, immigration officers are already empowered to turn them back. I see no reason to give that power to a person sitting at a check-in desk in Charleroi Airport or elsewhere.</P>

      <P>I am seeking information from the Minister. If a lorry enters a ship, there are essentially two carriers &ndash; one travelling inside the other.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the issue the Minister raised. If somebody presents themselves in Charleroi, the Minister implied that our amendment would mean they could simply say they were going to seek asylum in Ireland and had to be allowed on board the plane at Charleroi. If the section referred to embarkation before they got on board the ship, plane or other vehicle, then the Minister would be correct. However, the section refers to when a vehicle arrives in the State, not when it leaves the point of departure. I am only citing this because it is entirely relevant to the amendment.</P>

      <P>I do not know how one can arrive in the State in Charleroi or Roscoff. If it is discovered on board the vehicle that somebody does not have proper documentation and if they then say they want to seek asylum, the carrier should not be penalised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry" hpid="Ms Terry Ms Terry">

      <P>This Bill is definitely seeking to reduce the number of people seeking asylum here. While I respect what the Minister is trying to do, I am extremely concerned about the genuine people who wish to seek asylum and who will be denied that opportunity because of the Bill. I accept what the Minister said, namely, that he will introduce some measures to address the cases of people in exceptional circumstances. He should take into account the need to address such <Col N="2071" />cases as quickly as possible, however, rather than putting them on the long finger. We have a responsibility to those who suffer persecution in their own countries, but the Bill will deny them the right to seek asylum here. We are abdicating our responsibility to assess such asylum applications and giving it to a carrier.</P>

      <P>As Senator Terry pointed out, the Bill will make it more difficult for people to enter the country illegally.

      <P>I am not re-opening the Second Stage debate, but a number of people on both sides of the House have been using the term &ldquo;genuine asylum seekers&rdquo;. I simply wanted to say that it is a problematic term. It is better to use the general term &ldquo;asylum seekers&rdquo;. We must be aware of our responsibilities concerning asylum seekers.</P>
      <P>As regards Senator Mansergh's comments, it is often a fact of life that asylum seekers will either be carrying false documents or none at all. If such people leave a country under threat of death while trying to save their families, it is quite possible they will be travelling with false documentation in order to seek asylum elsewhere. The Minister should take into account the genuine concerns contained in the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened attentively to the debate and I consider the amendment to be worthy. The issue comes down to economics, because the Minister does not want to employ additional staff to man the ports or other points of entry into the country. How many people who emigrated to America from this country over the years were returned? It would be unfair to place the onus on carriers, including Aer Lingus and others, and fine them for taking Irish people whose papers were not in order to America. In the past, people who were found to be entering the United States illegally were sent back home. We now find ourselves in the same situation with people coming here illegally, but the legislation proposed by the Minister places the entire responsibility on carriers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should consider the position in which this country has been for the past 20, 30 or even 50 years. People left Ireland on a nod and a wink basis, saying they had gone through immigration. When they arrived in America they were sent home but the carrier was not fined. The amendment is good. The Minister is taking all the responsibility away from the State and the immigration authorities and placing it on the carriers. That is very unfair. We are all aware of cases where people will try to get on board a plane, <Col N="2072" />with a nod and a wink at the airport. Those people arrive here illegally. Responsibility for them is now being transferred from the State to the carrier. I ask the Minister to either accept the amendment or reconsider the matter for Report Stage.</P>

      <P>Senator Ryan has never had to operate an airline. No airline can operate a system whereby it checks people are properly documented when they arrive at their destination. No airline will do that because it would lose money hand over fist by having to pay to send them back again. This legislation will require the documentation of every person travelling to Ireland to be checked before boarding. That is the reality of the situation. Anybody who thinks differently is codding himself or herself. It is self-delusional to think we could operate any other system.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris's telephone call enabled him to miss Senator McDowell's espousing of the Russian dolls question. He will see from the record of the debate that I dealt with the point. The crucial point is, are we being real about this? Is Ireland to be the only EU member state without carrier liability? Is that the point? Carrier liability may have the effect of making it more difficult for undocumented persons to come to Ireland. I accept that. It will have that affect. Is it the position of Fine Gael or the Labour Party that Ireland is to be the only EU member state which does not operate this system of law?</P>

      <P>The Senator will have plenty of time to reply. This is an open-ended debate so far. We must face reality. Ireland is the only member state of the European Union with<Col N="2073" />out carrier liability law. There would be no point in having this law if I were to accede to the amendment that a person not incur any liability where he or she declares an intention to claim asylum thereby rendering him or her exempt from having his or her documentation checked. Anyone could breeze onto a plane holding a card declaring an intention to claim asylum in Ireland. Let us get real here, either we have this law or we do not. We cannot have a nonsensical law which is circumvented by a verbal formula printed on a card which allows everybody at the check-in counter in any airport in the world to request to be taken to Ireland to claim asylum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, there is. The purpose of the amendment is that a person would incur no liability if his or her documents were false and he or she was claiming asylum in Ireland. We cannot have laws like that. Anybody who thinks we should, should go out to the plinth and tell the Irish people that he or she supports the idea of an undocumented person being able to arrive at Dublin Airport simply because he or she wishes to claim asylum here.

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it is. Let us be clear about the point that was argued. It was said that Senator Mansergh's point was unrealistic when he argued that asylum seekers with no documentation or forged documentation would be picked up at the check-in desk at the airport. This is a nonsense. If some Members are against the Bill in principle, so be it. They should vote against it at the end of the debate. There is no point putting forward propositions which, effectively, turn it into fairytale legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2074" />I ask Senators to consider this point. How many flights or scheduled passenger ship services come to Ireland from outside the European Union, the candidate states for the European Union, the United States of America or Canada? How many flights come directly into Ireland from these places? A handful. It is not possible to fly from most places to Ireland without touching down in North America or the European Union. There are some exceptions such as Prague, Moscow and Cuba. Senators opposite will know that nobody from Cuba would want to seek refuge in Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us be real. We are talking in general terms about our putting in place laws which already operate in every other EU member state. This amendment seeks to ensure that we put in place some paper law which means nothing at all. I cannot understand the logic of that.</P>
      <P>If one exempts from section 2(1)(<i>c</i>) any person who is an asylum seeker, one casts upon the airline, be it on the tarmac in Dublin or at the check-in in Charleroi, the obligation to at least receive a statement from an intending passenger that he or she wants to be allowed to travel on the basis that he or she is an asylum seeker. One casts upon them an obligation to work out bona fide cases. I was castigated earlier for trying to pass the State's obligation onto the airlines. This amendment asks the airlines to run an immigration service at every airport in Europe. We cannot do that. Let us be fair about this. We can argue the principle of this Bill all night but it is pointless to put up spurious and specious arguments which would effectively destroy the Bill and render it inoperable. I do not think I should be asked to accept such amendments.</P>
      <P>I say this in the best spirit. I will be here until 8.30 p.m. and until the Leader of the House loses patience, some Minister will be here to present and deal with these amendments. If we are to make progress we must move on to real and substantive amendments which will make a difference, rather than spending time on vacuous amendments which are totally inoperable.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
      <P>What we are seeking to do is to allow asylum seekers to reach this State. The Bill, as drafted, could prevent asylum seekers coming to this country. Is that what we want? The Minister referred to people who are not genuine asylum seekers but who are economic migrants. If there was proper immigration legislation which allowed for a green card system, this issue would not be as big a feature of the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. D. McDowell Mr. D. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I resent the Minister's comment that the amendment is vacuous because it is an important point. He is suggesting that only asylum seekers properly documented deserve to <Col N="2075" />be allowed to land here in the first instance, which I cannot accept. He knows better than anyone that we have in place a very complex and expensive system for considering the applications of asylum seekers. It begins with the immigration officer and runs right through to the refugee tribunal. It is a very complex system which both Houses spent a lot of time debating and putting in place and is costing several hundred million euro per year. The Minister and Senator Mansergh are saying this measure applies only if asylum seekers or refugees are properly documented. I cannot accept that is the case because, as we know well, many asylum seekers are not properly documented and some are undocumented in the first instance, which is the central point. To suggest the amendment is vacuous is way over the top, to put it mildly.</P>
      <P>On a much more frivolous note, I join the Minister in wishing his party leader well on her holiday in Cuba at the end of the month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>If someone has all the proper documentation neatly in order, he or she is less likely to be a genuine asylum seeker or refugee. If someone is in a situation of peril, very often he or she will have considerable difficulty in acquiring documentation. As that point has been made previously, I will leave the matter. I agree with the Minister that if one is not going to win, one might as well move on and try to achieve some measure of negotiation.</P>
      <P>If this is an appropriate time, perhaps the Minister will answer the question I posed earlier. If a lorry is inside a ship, who is the carrier? Is it the lorry driver or the proprietor of the boat, the captain of the ship? As I understand it, in normal circumstances ultimate authority legally lies with the captain who has ultimate authority and jurisdiction over everything on his or her ship. It is not fair to penalise in this draconian way individual lorry drivers who may not have full responsibility.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry" hpid="Ms Terry Ms Terry">
      <NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
      <P>I respect what the Minister is doing and believe we need to have controls in place. The fact that we have no controls is putting great stress and strain on the resources of the State. If one was to consider the asylum applications of the many who have come to this country, perhaps their applications would not be granted. While I agree we need controls, I am concerned that we must make provision for exceptional cases. That is the point I have been making since the beginning of the debate. The Minister cannot say we are trying to throw out the Bill or that we wish to leave our ports open. While we need to have controls in place, we must provide for exceptional cases, which the legislation does not do.</P>

      <P>Like Senator McDowell, the reason the debate is proceeding slowly is the Minister seems to be incapable of accepting that the Opposition might have a decent idea about this issue <Col N="2076" />which is actually different from his. He seems to have a need to use words like &ldquo;realism,&rdquo;&ldquo;vacuity&rdquo; and so on with great enthusiasm. There are more ways than one of being vacuous and unhelpful. Producing complicated amendments out of a Department at the last possible moment and causing considerable inconvenience to members of the Opposition is a fine way to make life slow and difficult. It was not our fault that a whole set of amendments was produced late in the House. If the Minister wants to become involved in that sort of activity, let him begin by having the grace to acknowledge that one of the reasons the issue has become complicated is the Bill was left on the Order Paper untouched for the past four months and, out of the blue, without any advance warning to the Opposition, listed for this week. Having been listed for this week, amendments arrived yesterday evening&mdash;</P>

      <P>I ask the Minister to come back to the question of the reason he engaged us in this issue about the point of embarkation when the legislation for which he is responsible deals with people on board the vehicles in question. Why <Col N="2077" />will he not deal with what is included in the Bill, that is, people on board vehicles? He has repeatedly used the argument that this is the only country which does not provide for carriers liability, but that is to simplify and distort what is happening. First, we are declining to employ this measure within the land borders of the State. I suspect many other countries make similar exceptions. Large parts of the European Union are covered by the Schengen Agreement. Therefore, they do not have passport checks. People are free to travel between states within the European Union. Carriers liability cannot arise since there is no obligation to carry documentation.</P>

      <P>We are talking here about people who will have no documents. That is the fundamental reality &ndash; the Minister has spoken a lot about getting real. In every conflict in the world, of which there are many, there are people desperately trying to get out. The last thing these decent and persecuted people will do is ask their state authorities for permission to leave. When people crossed the Berlin Wall while being fired at by their own police force, no one asked them for documentation because it would have been nonsensical to do so. When thousands crossed the Border here in 1969 in the face of considerable hostility, no one from Senator Mansergh's party asked them to prove they were entitled to our hospitality because we knew they were people in need. People in need do not carry papers.</P>

      <P>I am about to conclude in the face of the Acting Chairman's considerable tolerance. This is not just a Labour Party argument. All the arguments about the complexities and difficulties of the legislation have been articulated by virtually every voluntary group in the State concerned about the rights of asylum seekers. These are people who work with asylum seekers, care and provide services for them and have absolutely no interest in facilitating illegal immigrants in the State. It is a gross offence to all of them and their concerns to suggest our legitimate amendments are anything other than an attempt to deal with the reality in Ireland today. I get the impression that the Minister wishes for a return <Col N="2078" />to the reality of 40 years ago, when we were all white, harmless and never thought about anybody else.</P>

It seems to me that amendment No. 11 involves, in effect, an acceptance that there is a tension, to put it mildly, between the provisions of the Refugee Act, 1996, which include the discretion of the Minister to consider refugee applications, and the measure proposed in this amendment. If the Minister does not believe that amendment No. 11 involves an acceptance of the tension I have mentioned, I would like him to explain why amendment No. 11 is to be proposed.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister will clarify if it is true that, as part of the illegal trafficking that has been conducted in Europe and in order to ensure a safe passage for illegal immigrants, traffickers have advised those who wish to enter Ireland and other countries to burn their passports and other documents. If they take the advice, illegal immigrants who are actually economic migrants have a far better chance of claiming and being given asylum. I do not intend to discuss economic migration, as it is a separate <Col N="2079" />issue. I am trying to give another dimension to this debate, as the opinions I have heard remind me of the little old lady in the corner shop years ago who was told that it was terrible that she was charged a royalty for playing a transistor radio.

      <P>Despotic states ensure that their citizens or residents are documented. An argument is sometimes made against identity cards on the grounds of being too authoritarian. Like the previous speaker, I wonder if it is often the case that people do not have documents not because they have been deprived of them by the state they are leaving or because they cannot get hold of any identity documents, but because they do not want documents. They sometimes have false documents for the purpose of getting into another country, rather than for the purpose of getting out of their own country. It is unreal to argue that despotic regimes deprive people of documents, as it is the last thing they do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am interested in the variety of views being expressed. Let us look at Article 26 of the Schengen <i>acquis</i>, of which Ireland is a contracting party, which states:</P>
      <P>The Contracting Parties undertake, subject to the obligations arising out of their accession to the Geneva Convention of 28 July 1951 relating to the Status of Refugees, as amended by the New York Protocol of 31 January 1967, and in accordance with their constitutional law, to impose penalties on carriers who transport aliens who do not possess the necessary travel documents by air or sea from a third state to their territories.</P>
      <P>I should point out, for the information of Senator Ryan, that the word &ldquo;aliens&rdquo; is used in the <i>acquis</i>. As I said at the start of this debate, it is not as if the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is thinking up little schemes to suit itself. A Council directive requires Ireland to impose penalties which are proportionate and not less than &euro;3,000 in some respects. I ask Senators to be realistic about this matter &ndash; we are living in the real world where we are subject to real influences.</P>
      <P>Let us return to what we are being asked to do in this amendment. Senator Ryan has come up with the notion that, somehow, I am casting an unfair responsibility on carriers because, in effect, the Bill will apply to people landing in the State and not to those embarking. I can inform the Senator that no airline in the real world will allow somebody to board a flight if it will be obliged to bring him or her back. The only way airlines can control whether documented or undocumented people are on a flight that lands in Ireland is by checking whether they are documented when the flight takes off. Let us remember that documents do not fly in and out of the windows of aircraft. This Bill, like legislation in other countries, will have the effect of ensuring that carriers will check documentation on the point of embarkation.</P>

      <P>This measure is not extra-territorial in its effect. If airlines want to check people as they arrive into Irish airspace, they are perfectly free to do so. If they want to organise their airlines on the basis that they only check documentation as an aeroplane lands in Dublin, they are perfectly free to do so. The reality, however, is that no airline will conduct its business in this manner, as it is better to check documents at the point of embarkation. I reiterate that the great majority of flights into Ireland come from countries that have signed up to the Dublin Convention, or safe countries such as the United States and Canada. The great majority of people who travel into Ireland by air or on scheduled sea passenger services emanate from safe jurisdictions. People who come to Ireland from third countries are, by and large, people who have entered the intermediate territories with documentation of some kind. If people come to Dublin without documents, it is because, in the vast majority of cases, they have disposed of their documents as they boarded a flight in Amsterdam or wherever. It is impossible to pass through the access points into Ireland without documents &ndash; one cannot board, or disembark from, a flight from Lagos to London without a document. If one arrives in Dublin without documents having travelled from Lagos via London, I am sure that one will not have boarded an aeroplane in Lagos undocumented, even if one is escaping persecution.</P>
      <P>Let us live in the real world. This measure depends on making it practicable and workable. It is not egregious or wholly different in principle from the measures that the other member states of the European Union have undertaken in accordance with their Schengen obligations. The amendment before us which provides that anyone could circumvent any of these obligations by merely making a claim at a check-in desk anywhere in the world of intention to make a claim for refugee status in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I have already told Senator Ryan that in the real world people will not be checked when an aircraft has landed on the runway at Dublin Airport. The time for airlines to comply with their obligations is at the point of embarkation. That is where they will have make their judgment. If people are given an exemption at that point on the basis of refugee status, it can only be either that the passenger, either getting on to the plane or in transit suddenly goes to the hostess or steward and says that he or she has decided to claim political asylum in Ireland and <Col N="2082" />that the airline is exempt from any responsibility to check that he or she had documents to enable them to travel on the flight. That is unrealistic.</P>
      <P>From the rhetoric of the serried ranks of the left I am flogging a dead horse as far as they are concerned. However, I ask Fine Gael to consult their party as to whether they support the principle of the Bill and then put down amendments and make speeches which reflect what the vast majority of Irish people would consider, I venture to suggest, i.e. that these are reasonable proposals. They should not isolate themselves from public opinion because they will do themselves even more, unnecessary political damage if they maintain a filibuster against the legislation.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House. Cork City has been declared European City of Culture in 2005, a prestigious honour not only for Cork but for the country, which will help us promote the arts and culture on both the European and world stage.</P>
      <P>The Cork School of Music is steeped in the cultural history of Cork. It has received world-wide recognition for its contribution to musical education, most recently the introduction of the Suzuki method of teaching violin to children from the age of three. It houses two orchestras and has had close association over the years with musicians of the calibre of Professor Fleischmann, Micheál Ó Súilleabháin and the late Sean Ó Riada. It goes without saying that the Cork School of Music will play a major role in the 2005 celebrations and should be the flagship for Cork as European City of Culture.</P>
      <P>The staff and pupils of the Cork School of Music vacated the existing school building in September 2001 and are currently in temporary accommodation. This amounts to 14 months in fairly unsuitable accommodation with no end date in sight. The school, with a student population of 3,500 is currently located in 17 different buildings throughout the city while awaiting the construction of the new school. The existing school has been vacant for those 14 months and that alone has serious implications should it have to be reoccupied by the staff and students. One of the primary reasons for designing a completely new building on the existing site, rather than modifying the existing building, was its lack of compliance with current fire, disabled access and health and safety legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2083" />The project received Government sanction in October 1999 and is to be constructed and operated on a public private partnership basis over a 25 year period. The process of advertising, consultation, listing preferred bidders etc. was completed in February 2001, with the successful bidder being announced early in April 2001 by the then Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods. Planning permission was granted in August 2001 and an appeal to An Bord Pleanála upheld the planning permission in January 2002.</P>
    <P>Since then there has been no real action. The contractors' price has held and to date they have not applied for any inflation increase to the project cost. They are ready to commence the 24-month contract for the new school. If the contract does not start by January 2003, Cork, Ireland and Europe will deprived of their flagship for Cork's year as European City of Culture.</P>
    <P>An independent report was prepared by Farrell Grant Sparks in April 2002 for the Department of Education and Science and the Department of Finance, demonstrating the affordability of the Cork School of Music. This report clearly shows that the Jarvis bid offers potential quantitative value for money and is 3% below the equivalent risk-adjusted value for money comparator. The report also highlights the approximate cost per month, the current delay in approving the project and the impact to the Exchequer. It is worth noting at this point, for those not familiar with the finer details of public private partnerships, that it would be at the hand-over period of the school that the first payment would be incurred, that is January 2005.</P>
    <P>The new school of music was launched as one of the two pilot education public private partnership projects. If this project is stopped it will have serious cost implications for the Government in terms of having to settle outstanding costs to the preferred bidder. It would have a damaging effect on the whole public private partnership market and send a negative message to the private sector. If a pilot public private partnership project cannot get off the ground, what chance have the public private partnerships of succeeding in the area of education?</P>
    <P>It is somewhat ironic that as late as yesterday we debated in this House the new National Finance Development Agency to promote public private partnerships. This is not a new capital project, but a replacement project. All relevant procedures have been followed, reports justifying the project completed and prices agreed. The final obstacle now appears to be the Civil Service, which has yet to put in place the necessary financial arrangements for the public private partnership. It is incumbent on everyone to move this process forward and remove the obstacles blocking its progress. I urge the Minister to remove this blockage, wherever it lies, and ensure that this contract is delivered on time in the interests of the students, the staff and the people of Cork, the European City of Culture in 2005.</P>

      <P>I thank the Senator for raising this issue on the Adjournment. As he is aware, the new Cork School of Music, a constituent part of Cork Institute of Technology, is being procured under the public private partnership model. The CSM provides training in a wide range of musical instruments, musical theory and speech and drama. The school caters for first, second, third and fourth level students, whether they are amateur musicians, music teachers or performers.</P>
      <P>The tender for this project was advertised on a European basis in June 2000. Following the project launch in July 2000, 12 consortiums expressed an interest in bidding for the project. Following the presentation of outline proposals, the number of bidders was eventually reduced to three. These bidders were issued with an invitation to negotiate in November 2000. The consortium bids were submitted in February 2001 and were subject to detailed evaluation under design and construction, services, financial and legal headings by officials of the Department of Education and Science along with specialist advisers. Following this process, Jarvis Projects Limited was selected as the preferred bidder in March 2001.</P>
      <P>The Department of Education and Science officials and advisers entered into a period of intense discussion with Jarvis with a view to finalising the project financially. During this period Jarvis, under the terms of the project, sought and received planning permission for the project from Cork City Council. However, An Taisce submitted a planning appeal to An Bord Pleanála. During the period of the appeal, work on the project was suspended and it was only resumed after An Bord Pleanála rejected the appeal and granted planning permission for the development, as the Senator pointed out, on 24 December 2001.</P>
      <P>The Department of Finance has raised a number of issues in respect of the project. Officials from the Department of Education and Science, in conjunction with specialist advisers, are examining these issues and have been in contact with Department of Finance officials. In addition, the question of the involvement of the European Investment Bank must be addressed. Proposals have been tabled whereby the EIB will provide refinancing for the project two years into the operations phase, thus reducing the overall cost. Discussions with both the Department of Finance and the EIB are continuing. These should be completed in the near future and a definitive decision on the project will be made.</P>

    <P>The Minister for Education and Science would like to assure the Senator that he is fully aware of the importance of the school of music to Cork city and to the musical and cultural life of Cork and the whole Munster region. I agree with the Senator that this is an important flagship project and he has brought our attention to the fact that the practical implementation of these public private partnerships is of immense importance. I <Col N="2085" />will bring to the attention of the Minister the importance of finalising this matter.</P>

      <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for giving me the opportunity to raise the matter of the building of a new school at St. Nicholas's primary school, Adare, County Limerick.</P>
      <P>I recently attended the official opening and blessing of a new extension to Scoil Seán tSraide in Adare. It was a joyful occasion, with the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey, officially opening the extension. A few miles down the road, he would have encountered a completely different educational environment for the pupils attending St. Nicholas's primary school.</P>
      <P>In July 1999, the former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, visited the school after an invitation from the board of management. Following the inspection by the Minister and his officials, it was agreed that it was not practical to carry out works on the existing school. He stated, more than three years ago, that a new school would be built. The board then acquired the adjoining land as agreed by the Minister and his officials.</P>
      <P>The existing school is part of the Augustinian abbey, which is listed as an historic building and is over 600 years old. The walls are damp and subject to fungal growth. It is not possible for the windows to be opened and this results in poor ventilation. This type of environment is unhealthy and contributes to the incidence of asthma in the pupils. The tiled hall is damp and slippery and, therefore, dangerous. As a result of leaks in the skylights, the pupils get wet. The heating system is unsatisfactory and the toilet facilities are insufficient for a school with more than 70 pupils. The staff members must use the same toilets as the children. There is no staff room, staff toilet or office and no room where parents can meet the teachers. Access to classrooms consists of 20 steps, which are dangerous and slippery in wet weather. Infant classes are held in a portakabin, which is separated from the rest of the school.</P>
      <P>As this school is part of a heritage site, it attracts many visitors, particularly from April to October. These people have access to areas which are restricted to pupils and often distract pupils in their studies. The school is close to the river Maigue and rat poison must be set at regular intervals. The present sewerage system is old and has ongoing problems, especially in wet weather. As the Minister of State may conclude from what I have said, there is an urgent need for a new school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pay tribute to the parents, pupils and teachers, the principal, Ms Margaret Beckinden, and the chairman of the board of management, the Reverend Rachel Lewis, for their tolerance in working in this Dickensian educational environment. Enough is enough. The Minister of State should offer a ray of hope to these people by tell<Col N="2086" />ing them the Department is serious about providing a new school. I look forward to his reply.</P>

      <P>I thank the Senator for giving me the opportunity, on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science, of outlining to the House the position regarding an application from the authorities of St. Nicholas's primary school for grant aid towards a new school building. At present, St. Nicholas's primary school is staffed by a principal, two mainstream class teachers and a shared learning support teacher who is not based in the school. The enrolment at 30 September 2002 was 71. The school's current facilities consist of two classrooms, a portakabin for the third teacher and another for the resource and remedial teacher.</P>
      <P>An application for the provision of a new school building is with the Department of Education and Science's planning and building unit. The Minister for Education and Science will be announcing his Department's expenditure proposals relating to primary school buildings in the new year. In the meantime, it is not possible to say when individual projects will proceed to architectural planning or construction. However, the Department of Education and Science is committed to the provision of improved accommodation at St. Nicholas's primary school.</P>

This does not detract from the merit of what the Senator has said, however, and I will convey his sentiments to the Minister.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan. I offer my deepest sympathy to the mother and family in Monaghan on the sad loss of an infant, which always touches the heart of the community. Coming up to Christmas, our thoughts are with the Livingstone family. I have been in touch with the Minister and voiced my concerns on the health service problems faced by the people of Monaghan.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Health and Children instructed the North Eastern Health Board to carry out a full review of this incident and provide him with a detailed report of the circumstances surrounding the case. An external review group, independent of the board, has been established to evaluate the health board's report, which was completed on Monday, 16 December. The report and its findings are currently being evaluated by the review group. Will the Minister ensure that the review group report will be completed as a matter of urgency? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2087" />A report by the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in 2000 advised all health boards in regard to the level of consultant staffing requirements to provide an appropriate level of consultant care in the maternity and gynaecological services. The institute considered that a viable unit requires in the region of 1,000 births per year to enable consultants to maintain their expertise. The report, having examined the level of obstetric activity in Monaghan hospital &ndash; which in 1999 recorded 344 births &ndash; advised that consultant-led maternity services at Monaghan should be discontinued as the provision of such services was no longer supported by the recommendation of the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. If proper consultant and paediatric services were available at Monaghan hospital for the people of Monaghan, the birth rate would have been at a level that would have ensured that a viable maternity unit could have been maintained.</P>
    <P>Comhairle na nOspidéal is currently reviewing obstetric and related paediatric, anaesthetic and gynaecological services for the population of the North Eastern Health Board region, with particular reference to consultant staffing in the context of current best practice. In considering this review, Monaghan's location should be examined. The medical experts inform us that while most pregnancies end without complication, no ante-natal screening procedure can guarantee a problem-free delivery. I understand that following the end of obstetric services in Monaghan there were protocols in place to deal with emergency cases like this. The inquiry should report on why this event occurred last week and how to prevent it in future.</P>
    <P>The Minister will agree that it is unacceptable that cases like this should occur. I urge him to ensure that in future Monaghan hospital will be able to deal with such incidents.</P>

      <P>I take this opportunity to offer my deepest sympathy to the mother and family concerned on their very sad loss. Their loss is a deep one that has caught people's imagination. It requires all of us to focus our energy on addressing this problem, which has persisted in recent months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Brien has sat on the Agricultural Panel of the Seanad for many years, but he is also a public representative for County Monaghan and has consistently raised the question of proper provision of services at Monaghan hospital with <Col N="2088" />the Minister for Health and Children. He has put much effort into that area.</P>
    <P>On becoming aware of this matter on Wednesday, 11 December, the Minister immediately instructed the North Eastern Health Board to carry out a full review of the incident and to provide him with a detailed report of all circumstances surrounding this case. He also established an external review panel, independent of the board, to evaluate this review. The group comprises Dr. Seán Daly, master of the Coombe Women's Hospital, Ms Maureen Lynott, project director at the national treatment purchase fund, and Ms Brigid Boyd, clinical midwifery manager, neo-natal, at the Coombe Women's Hospital.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference of the panel are: to consider the report of the NEHB in relation to the incident and make such further inquiries and to conduct such interviews as it considers necessary; to examine the protocols and procedures in place for the handling of obstetric emergencies at the Cavan-Monaghan Hospital Group, having regard to prevailing standards of best practice, and to examine their application in this case; and to report to the Minister on the adequacy of the response of the hospitals and the ambulance service to the incident and make such recommendations as it sees fit.</P>
    <P>The North Eastern Health Board completed its review on 16 December 2002. The report and its findings are currently being evaluated by the review panel. The Minister shares the Senator's concern that this review process be brought to a conclusion as quickly as possible. The Senator will understand that the Minister does not wish to dictate to the panel or take from it the power it must exercise to make findings in this case. The review panel's report will be completed as a matter of urgency for presentation to the Minister for Health and Children. I assure the Senator that this matter is receiving priority attention. The Minister will review the position in relation to this issue on receipt of the review panel's comprehensive evaluation of the health board's report.</P>
    <P>The wider question of the appropriate provision of services in Monaghan hospital has been raised and the Minister is concerned that the best possible service is provided. It is of paramount importance at this stage, however, that we get a detailed account from the review panel of what happened in this tragic case.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 9 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 19 December 2002.</P>
