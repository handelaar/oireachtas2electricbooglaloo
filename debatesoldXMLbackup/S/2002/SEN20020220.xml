      <P>I have received notice from Senator Cassidy that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to outline the progress made to date on Coralstown national school, County Westmeath.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Nolan of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to provide for improved medical/hospital services for the people of County Carlow.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Ó Murchú of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources to provide an adequate helicopter rescue service for the south east.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business for today is No. 1, motion re referral of EU Council's framework decision on joint investigation teams to the Joint Committee on European Affairs, to be taken without debate; No. 2, referral of a motion regarding the Diseases of Animals (Amendment) Act, 2001, to the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, to be taken without debate; No. 3, referral of a motion regarding the Council Decision concerning the Schengen Information System to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, to be taken without debate; No.&nbsp;4, Competition Bill, 2001 &ndash; Committee Stage; No. 5, Sustainable Energy Bill, 2001 &ndash; Report and Final Stages &ndash; this is a Seanad Bill amended by the Dáil; No. 23, motion No. 19, to be taken between 6 p.m. and <Col N="342" /> 8 p.m., and business to continue thereafter if not concluded before 6 p.m.</P>

      <P>Arising out of No. 2, will the Leader arrange a debate in the very near future on the lessons to be learnt from the foot and mouth episode? It appears to a number of commentators that an element of complacency is creeping in again and that there is a feeling that controls can be fully relaxed. There is evidence of a recurrence of the disease elsewhere. It would be useful to have a debate now when there is not a crisis and to ensure that steps are being taken to ensure we will not have a recurrence in this country.</P>
      <P>Arising from the total debacle that is now the Disability Bill, in view of the fact that the Bill has to be virtually rewritten and given that the Minister for Health and Children has promised a further period of consultation, I wish to be helpful in this matter. Will the Leader arrange for the Minister to come into the House so that Members who have read the Bill, talked to the various groups involved and taken expert advice may be involved in the consultation process? If the Bill has to be rewritten before it comes in, at least this House will be part of that process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I support very strongly the points which Senator Manning has made. I would like to hear from the Leader what is the present status of the Bill. To all intents and purposes, I believe it is dead. I cannot see it coming back to the House before the general election. We should be honest with the many people who are dependent on it and they should not be kept hanging on a string. We asked for a Bill in which people's rights would be enshrined. It failed to do that and ran into predictable problems. While I do not wish to anticipate the debate, I believe there is a technical issue involved here. Many reasonable questions are being raised with Members of the House.</P>
      <P>I thank the Leader for his interest in education and I am glad to see, a Chathaoirligh, that you were able to facilitate him in a discussion on Coralstown national school which badly needs some support. However, I suggest it would be more appropriate to have a full debate on education, as we have requested on a number of occasions. That would allow the Leader to deal with all the other substandard school buildings, as well as Coralstown national school, that are deprived of funds in the run-up to the election.</P>

      <P>I ask the Leader to commit himself to a time and date for the comprehensive debate which he has already promised on all aspects of education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also wish to raise again the question of a press council and how it might relate to issues which <Col N="343" /> are raised here every week. The National Union of Journalists has issued a policy statement supporting the idea of a press council. This is a good opportunity to debate this matter and to move forward in a progressive way, in terms of a balance between the needs of journalists, the common good and respect for privacy and confidentiality. This matter has been raised in the House previously and Senator Manning has referred to the need to look at our libel laws in a similar context. The moment is now opportune to tie all those aspects together and to have a view from Government as to how we might move forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to add my voice to the call for a full debate on the Disability Bill, with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Mary Wallace, in attendance. I welcome the fact that the Minister has withdrawn the Bill. He did so at the eleventh hour, purely because of the pressure from the various disability groups who organised a major conference in the Mansion House last night. At the last minute, the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Mary Wallace, announced her intention to have a fresh round of consultations in relation to the Bill. The Bill will not pass through both Houses during this session but it is important that we ascertain the Minister of State's thinking and that the Bill is put back on the right track.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Taoiseach to come to the House to discuss the current process under the Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy) Bill, 2001? The referendum will be held in two weeks but the referendum campaign is a shambles. The public is totally confused.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Taoiseach to come to the House to inform us about the position regarding the statutory entitlement of all citizens to information from the Referendum Commission on the constitutional amendment and what will happen if some people do not receive such information? The Referendum Commission has stated on the one hand that it will not be able to provide the information and, on the other, that it will be able to do so. I would like to Taoiseach to inform us about the guarantees in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the call for a debate on education with the Minister for Education and Science, which I also sought last week. On 4 March, members of the public will provide substitution and supervision services in secondary schools. This is a major step. The Minister needs to come to the House to explain why the dispute has been allowed to deteriorate to this extent. There will <Col N="344" /> be a great deal of conflict and fall-out as a result of the dangerous step that is about to be taken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Manning is correct that it would be appropriate for the House to examine the foot and mouth disease issue, particularly as it is one year since the outbreak and we would probably take a more detached and balanced view now than we might have when we were in the midst of the crisis. We expressed our gratitude to the Minister, the staff in the Department and all sectors of society for the way they co-operated to keep the disease at bay, except for the one unfortunate incident in County Louth. However, we should revisit the issue and perhaps also consider the reports that have issued in the recent past on the matter both here and in the United Kingdom to emphasise the point that such outbreaks must be dealt with on an all-island basis, otherwise they cannot be contained.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Mary Wallace, should be commended for the way she has approached the Disability Bill, 2001. The legislation is a significant step forward and is not the final step on the road. She is to be commended because she is prepared to amend section 47, which is contentious. It is disingenuous to suggest that a meeting in the Mansion House, however well merited, coincided with the announcement of the withdrawal of section 47. I do not think that was not the effect of the meeting, although it was its intended effect. Perhaps these issues can be discussed because the Minister of State is amenable to consulting everybody who is interested in this matter.</P>

      <P>I refer to the testimonial match being organised by Niall Quinn. This is the first time during this Seanad that I have risen to compliment somebody, but he is not involved in politics. He will donate £1 million each from the proceeds of the match to the children's hospital in Crumlin and to a hospital in Sunderland. I was proud of the way he honoured the country last Friday and it is a sad reflection on us that we do not lead in the way Niall has led. He is a credit to us but there is no way for us to honour him. Ireland does not have an honours list. However, last week Prince Charles was in Dublin to honour one of our own.</P>

It has been mentioned in other parliaments and he is to be complimented. We should lead those compliments and ensure he gets some recognition.</P>

      <P>Everyone in the House must agree that the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Mary Wallace, has done an extraordinary job in bringing the Disability Bill, 2001, to the stage it has reached. She has shown not just courage but political prescience in deciding that &ndash; because of the needs as stated by the people with disabilities rather than their spokespersons &ndash; she is willing to look at the Bill again. She should be complimented.</P>

      <P>I ask that compliments be passed to the Minister of State on this matter. I ask, as a matter of urgency &ndash; and there are Members of the House who will suggest I raise this too often &ndash; that we consider the situation in the Middle East which has got completely out of hand. We are not doing enough in Europe to try to alleviate the problems being created on the one hand by the harsh hand of Ariel Sharon who seems to have <i>carte blanche</i> to do whatever he wants in the occupied territories. He is acting illegally every time he goes into the occupied territories&mdash;</P>

      <P>I ask the Leader to request the Minister for Foreign Affairs to compliment the 100 officers in the Israeli army who have decided that they will never again knock houses in the occupied territories. I ask that the European Union play a stronger role in what is happening there. Both Israeli and Palestinian lives are being lost there on a daily basis &ndash; although more of the latter. Can we decide once and for all that Palestinians have a right to exist, the Israelis have a right to exist&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise a matter which I mentioned to the Cathaoirleach before the Order of Business who graciously granted permission to do so briefly. I am sure other Members will be as shocked and saddened as I am to have learnt of the death of one of the young ushers, Wayne O'Donnell, in a tragic accident a couple of days ago. I am sure &ndash; because we are very much a community in Leinster House &ndash; that we would wish to pass on our sympathy to his wife of just a year.</P>
      <P>Although I am an agreeable person and I like paying compliments, I cannot agree with the compliment that my colleague suggested we send to the Minister of State concerning the Disability Bill, 2001 &ndash; it was not prescience but panic. The problem is that we were not listened to in this House. We tried, particularly on this side of the House, to have it made a rights based Bill but that was refused. Rights were purported to have been put into the Bill but they were completely unenforceable. They gave nothing and this was penny pinching. It is a shame because the people who were being discriminated against are the most vulnerable. I ask that the Leader give us information as to the precise stage of this Bill and the parallel Bill dealing with victims of sexual abuse because we have exactly the same thing there. People from the Magdalen laundries were excluded despite the urgent pleading on all sides in this House. People with disabilities were discriminated against &ndash; deaf people, people in other institutions and victims of non-sexual physical abuse were all excluded from the Bill. This is penny-pinching and I ask the Leader to find out if this Bill will also be radically amended or even withdrawn, as we need to know.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Manning's call for a press council or at least a debate on this issue. It is very important that we have such a debate. We have a very honourable tradition of journalism but the British gutter press is buying into this country. Lies are being told about people, which is intolerable, and now is the time to nip it in the bud. The NUJ, of which I am a member, is powerless in a number of these instances, because journalists are being told to get out of the NUJ so that they will not be subject to its controls.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Can we please have the Minister for Health and Children in this House to explain what is happening to the health service? Last night three major Dublin hospitals turned people away for three hours. There is a crisis here and perhaps the Leader will produce some formula<Col N="347" /> tion where we will have an explanation of the precipitate deregulation of pharmacies, which has lead to a situation where pharmacies are not taking on further methadone patients. This will have serious repercussions in the community in terms of crime.</P>

      <P>Will the Leader of the House invite the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to this House to discuss the critical issue of public order, particularly in our cities? We need to work towards some new initiatives to tackle this situation because fire brigade action when there is a fatality, or a near-fatality, is a very threadbare response. We need an evaluation from the Minister as to the impact the extended licensing laws have on the lives and leisure of young people in cities.</P>
      <P>I support the call for a debate on education. I do not want a scattergun debate on the subject as we cannot debate every school at every level. I have been seeking a debate for months on the position of the teaching of science and maths at second level.</P>

      <P>Will the Leader invite the Minister for Health and Children to discuss the enormous confusion surrounding the forthcoming constitutional amendment referendum? I am sure every Member of the House is aware of the general confusion on this issue. The latest aspect of confusion to emerge concerns the morning-after pill.</P>

      <P>I commend the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Mary Wallace, for the way she has brought the Disability Bill forward. She has left her door open and accommodated many <Col N="348" /> diverse groups, and will continue to do so.

      <P>Committee Stage of the Competition Bill, 2001, is to be taken today, but when will Report and Final Stages be taken? The Road Traffic Bill, 2001, did not reach this House before Christmas and we are dependent on it for the introduction of the penalty points system. When will that Bill come before us? Is there a danger that we will run out of time to enact it and that the carnage on the roads will continue? We have not heard a word about this recently. We are told this is a way to alleviate the danger on the roads, yet nothing has been done about it.</P>
      <P>We have asked on a number of occasions for a debate on the insurance industry. There is now a &euro;2 billion outstanding personal insurance cost to the State. It went up by 40% last year and it is suggested that it will increase by 50% this year. This debate is urgently needed and a number of us have been asking for it since October.

      <P>I support the call for a debate on a press council, the media and the libel laws. I also support Senator Manning's call for a debate on foot and mouth disease, particularly in the context of comments made by Senator Dardis.

      <P>I ask the Leader to request the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, to come to the House for an urgent debate on the crisis in our accident and emergency rooms. There is utter chaos in hospitals. There is no flu epidemic at present, yet last night over 100 people could not be admitted to wards. They had to sleep in the emergency rooms. During this debate we should examine the issue of the care <Col N="349" /> of the elderly and consider the fact that much pressure is being put on elderly patients to get out of acute beds and to go into the community. In many cases they go home to elderly spouses who cannot look after them. It is a serious and important issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Manning's call for a debate on foot and mouth disease. Such a debate would be timely. There was widespread public support for and acknowledgement of the good work undertaken by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh, and his Department's officials in protecting us from the scourge of the disease. Great Britain's former agriculture Minister was reported recently as stating that not enough has been done to ensure there is no repeat of the epidemic. We are very exposed if that is the case.</P>
      <P>I join Senator O'Toole in calling for a debate on a press council. It is an appropriate time for such a debate. I ask the Leader to include in such a discussion the issue of the prohibitive cost of legal services. This week an award by a court of &euro;25,000 came at a cost in legal bills of a reported &euro;750,000. It is not acceptable in a democracy that people do not have access to the law at a reasonable cost. It is time the Government faced up to that matter.</P>
      <P>There are many calls on the Leader for all sorts of debates, but this is a good time, before the recess, to raise the issue of tolls. There are proposals under the PPF to place tolls on main arteries and it is important that those proposals are fully aired here to avoid the state of affairs obtaining on the M50 where there are long queues, environmental problems and huge costs. I ask the Leader to consider bringing that debate forward at an early stage.</P>

      <P>Senator Norris and Senator O'Dowd are right to point out the chaotic situation in the hospitals. I am sure all Senators saw the position in Beaumont Hospital's accident and emergency unit on the news last night. Recently I visited the accident and emergency units in Tallaght Hospital and St. James's Hospital, and they are just as bad. Will the Leader of the House ask the Minister for Health and Children to come in to address the position regarding the imminent strike by nurses in accident and emergency departments because they feel that the promises made to them three years ago have not been fulfilled? They are due to go on strike in two weeks. We see how bad the position is with the accident and emergency departments fully staffed, but what on earth will it be like if they work on a phased basis or withdraw their labour because the conditions are absolutely intolerable?</P>

It is obvious that zero tolerance has failed badly. I support the call for the Minister to come into the House because he needs help and no doubt this House would be able to give him a great deal of help. He has failed badly in bringing law and order to the country. We have seen in the Sunday newspapers that this has a knock-on effect on hospitals throughout the country.

      <P>As Leader of the House, I want to be associated with the expressions of sympathy on the death of Wayne O'Donnell, the service officer in the Houses of the Oireachtas. I extend my condolences to his wife, Elizabeth, his mother and father and all his family. He was a very impressive young man who was most obliging. He was everything one would hope for, a decent, honourable and most courteous servant of the House.</P>
      <P>Senators Manning, O'Toole, Dardis, Maurice Hayes, Walsh, Lanigan, Norris, Costello and Ormonde called for debates. In particular, Senator Manning called for a debate on the lessons we have learned from the foot and mouth disease crisis. I have no difficulty in allowing time for that. If proof were needed that the Good Friday Agreement is relevant to the people of the Twenty-six Counties, this was it. If the Agreement had not been in place and if Ms Bríd Rodgers was not Minister, there would have been chaos, possibly all over Ireland, as was experienced in the UK. In fairness to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh, the Government and Ms Rodgers and her staff, the matter was dealt with efficiently. To their great credit and that of the public and everyone who co-operated, the people of Ireland were spared the ravages of foot and mouth disease. I will work hard with the leaders and the Whips to organise a debate in which Members can make known their views because it is an important issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators called for the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, to come to the House to allow Members make their contributions in the <Col N="351" /> consultation stages of the Disability Bill, and I will endeavour to have this take place. She mentioned in one of the interviews I heard this morning that there would be a two week consultation period. I was most impressed that she gave great attention to everything that was requested of her. I will consult her after the Order of Business.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole, Senator Costello, Senator Norris and others called for a debate on the education programme and the Government's programme for the future. I do not have a difficulty allocating time for that.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning, Senator O'Toole and others called for a debate on a press council. I called for such a body about 14 years ago. It is long overdue and would only concern a person working in the media who abused his or her privilege or power. There are many excellent journalists and magnificent publications. The council would only affect those who abuse the system either to their advantage or to put forward their views or those who do not relate the truth in the news. I will pass on the views of the Members to the Minister and will provide time for a debate on this, possibly in the last week before the recess.</P>
    <P>Many Members expressed views on the Competition Bill. I will pass on the views of Senator Norris, in particular, to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello and Senator Keogh expressed views on the proposed twenty-fifth amendment of the Constitution. We should welcome the Referendum Commission's announcement that every home will have a publication outlining the views on this matter. I join everyone who has welcomed this move. I will pass on the views expressed by the Senators to the Minister.</P>
    <P>I wish to be associated with Senator Dino Cregan's vote of congratulations to Niall Quinn. I also include Daniel O'Donnell in that because he has brought credit to us all with his great work with regard to fund-raising and such matters. Excellence should be recognised and acknowledged in some way, possibly through an honours system. I hope the Taoiseach or the President takes this on board. I know the former Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, considered it when he was in office. It is something we should consider.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan called for an urgent debate on the Middle East and expressed strong views on the issue. He has much experience in this regard and I will pass on his views to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>There were many calls on the Minister for Health and Children, especially regarding the deregulation of pharmacies. I will pass on those views to the Minister and perhaps Members might take them up with him when he is in the House soon to deal with legislation.</P>
    <P>Senator Quill and Senator Burke called for a debate with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on public order and the operation of the extended liquor licensing hours. I will request this of the Minister and I do not have a difficulty providing time for it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="352" />Senator Quinn called for an update on the Road Traffic Bill. I will inquire about this matter. He also asked for a debate on insurance, something which has been requested many times. Many urgent debates have been sought. We will have to review them in light of the amount of legislation coming before the House which must be passed before the Easter recess.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry and Senator O'Dowd called on the Minister for Health and Children to update the House on their various queries and to outline the position regarding the disturbing statements they made. I will endeavour to ensure that happens.</P>
    <P>Senator Walsh called for a debate on road tolls and the National Roads Authority. I will allocate time for this debate. Senator Finneran called on the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to update the House on new waste regulations. I will provide time for this also.</P>

      <Col N="354" />&ldquo;(8) The putting into effect of a merger or acquisition in accordance with the provisions of <i>Part 3</i> of this Act, together with any agreements which are ancillary to the merger or acquisition and are referred to in the notification of the merger or acquisition under <i>subsection (1)</i> or <i>(3)</i> of <i>section 17</i>, shall not, in itself, be prohibited under <i>subsection (1)</i>.&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The Competition and Mergers Review Group recommends that the mergers that have been assessed under the merger control regime and allowed to proceed should not generally be vulnerable to challenge under the competition rules. Accordingly, subsection (8) of section 4 and subsection (3) of section 5 provide that the mergers which are notified either mandatorily or voluntarily are immune from challenge under sections 4 and 5 of the Bill.</P>
      <P>This immunity is limited to the merged entity as notified, including any auxiliary agreement similarly notified, but does not apply when the merged entity subsequently alters its behaviour out of line with the notification. However, the present text of the Bill does not deal with where an undertaking voluntarily notifies a merger but subsequently withdraws the notification and therefore the Competition Authority is not given an opportunity to assess the transaction. Clearly, it would be against the spirit of the recommendation from the CMRG for such an undertaking which has not submitted itself to merger control regime to benefit from the immunity. Accordingly, these amendments will ensure that only those voluntarily notified, which are properly assessed by the authority, can rely on the protection from suit.</P>

      <P>The text of section 5(1) repeats the terms of section 5(1) of the Competition Act, 1991, which is modelled on the wording of Article 82 of the EU treaty. However, it is arguable that the reference to &ldquo;a substantial part of the State&rdquo; is inappropriate for Irish markets. One legal commentator has stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="355" />The reference to a substantial part of the common market makes sense in the context of provisions designed to eliminate distortions in cross-Border trade and to help achieve a single market in goods and services throughout the member states of the Community, but given that a unified market exists in goods and services throughout the Republic of Ireland in that goods do not, for example, have to cross national frontiers, the rationale of the European Community is clearly absent.</P>
    <P>It has been pointed out by Vincent Browne, solicitor, in his recent book on competition law, &ldquo;It seems inappropriate that relief for abuse should turn on whether or not the abuser has a dominant position in a substantial part of the State.&rdquo; Having considered the arguments, I propose to remove the phrase &ldquo;in a substantial part of the State&rdquo; from this subsection and substitute the phrase &ldquo;in any part of the State&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a query. The amendment refers to goods and services. Does that mean, for example, that if there was a monopoly or a near monopoly in one town or province in one particular trade, but not necessarily a large market share in the rest of the territory, it would be regarded as applicable in this case? Take my own business, for example, a supermarket that operates in only one province, but does not necessarily have a large market share in the whole State. Does this mean that the legislation would have implications for it if it were too large in that province? I am not sure I understand this &ndash; I have not mentioned the issue before. It is a query for the Minister.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister a view on whether this legislation will affect pharmacies, for example? I have had communication from people representing the pharmaceutical business and they say they are very concerned that what they regard as the precipitate deregulation of the market will automatically lead &ndash; as it has, apparently, according to their briefing materials, in Norway &ndash; to the extinction of small local pharmacies and the growth and intrusion of combines from larger markets, particularly the British market. That seems to be a matter that affects competition, although I could be wrong. If there were two, three or four local pharmacies in a market town and they were extinguished, to be replaced by a branch of a large UK chain, would that constitute something that would be contemplated by the Minister in the Bill?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Since we had the Second Stage discussion here there have been changes in relation <Col N="356" /> to pharmacies, which I very much welcome. The 1996 regulations which were introduced by the then Minister for Health were not just very anti-competitive, they were so restrictive that towns like Knock and the place from where I come, Newcastle in west Dublin, were among areas where no pharmacies could be licensed for the purposes of dealing with prescriptions under the GMS. That was very unsatisfactory, and some pharmacies were making up to £2 million.</P>
      <P>Because there were court challenges in relation to this matter the Minister for Health and Children, on legal advice, revoked those regulations. However, it would be wrong for anybody to assume we have a deregulated market. For example, an Irish person who qualifies abroad cannot open a pharmacy here unless he or she has been in practice for three years in a pharmacy. This remains very unsatisfactory and I have been receiving correspondence of late from newly qualified Irish pharmacists who are very keen to see that restriction lifted. The Minister for Health and Children established a review group to deal with this matter. All we have done is remove the 1996 regulation so we are back to a pre-1996 situation.</P>
      <P>Some time ago a company sought to acquire a number of pharmacies in the Republic. I referred that matter to the Competition Authority, which, while approving the acquisition on the grounds that it enhanced competition, stated that because of the restrictive nature of the 1996 regulations I should bring in a statutory instrument requiring every pharmacy acquisition to be subject to ministerial approval. Obviously that is no longer necessary now that we have removed for the moment the 1996 regulations. However, until the review is completed it will be difficult to say what the picture will be in relation to pharmacies. I do not share the view expressed that this is the end of community pharmacies. I think the market will operate as it does in other sectors. We do not have similar protections in other areas. I am keen to ensure we have the highest possible quality of pharmacy service throughout the State and that citizens, particularly elderly people, have easy access to a pharmacy close to where they live. That is what should happen and I believe it will happen.</P>
      <P>Anybody wanting to acquire a number of pharmacies, depending on the scale, may meet the thresholds specified in the Bill, in which case, the approval of the Competition Authority will be required.</P>

I do not propose to go into it further because it is not directly germane, but it was a useful point and the Minister was very helpful in giving us her views on that. If either the Minister or I were principally motivated by considerations of finance, we obviously would have chosen a different profession &ndash; we would have been wiser to go into pharmacy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 10, before section 6, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;6.&ndash;(1) For reasons of the public interest, the Competition Authority may by decision find that, on the basis of the information in its possession <i>section 4(1)</i> is not applicable to an agreement, a decision of an association of undertakings or a concerted practice, either because the conditions of <i>section 4(1)</i> are not fulfilled, or because the conditions of <i>section 4(5)</i> are satisfied.</P>
      <P>(2) The Competition Authority may likewise make such a finding with reference to <i>section 5(1)</i>.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>First, I apologise to the Minister. In the past I have criticised the convoluted words that sometimes appear which can be difficult to understand. When I read this as it was suggested to me, I had huge difficulty understanding the point I was trying to make when it was put into these legal terms. The purpose of this amendment is to restore to some extent the balance of fairness that applied in the legislation that is being repealed by this Bill. It will also help to restore the balance between our natural desire to catch offenders and making life impossibly difficult for the majority of innocent businesses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Until now the Competition Authority was obliged to respond to a query about whether an agreement, if entered into, would be in contravention of the law. However, the Bill not only removes that obligation, but it deprives the authority of the freedom to answer questions even if <Col N="358" /> it wished to. That removal, combined with the presumption of guilt, puts an unacceptable burden on an individual who is in doubt. It means the Bill is anti-competitive because the risk is too great. I know it is not easy to understand, but the Bill would be improved if the amendment was accepted. The Bill has removed something which ensured that Ireland was a more competitive society. In most instances case law helps to establish what is permissible. Unfortunately, however, there is little or no case law in Ireland; what we have comes from Brussels. In that situation the ability of the Competition Authority to respond in the future as it has done in the past becomes more important to law abiding businesses.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to note that my amendment does not compel the Competition Authority to do anything; it merely enables it. I started out with the idea of putting an obligation on the authority to respond in that way, but I was persuaded that it would place a burden on it which could become an albatross around its neck. I decided to settle for a mild, modest and weak enabling clause. I do not see any reason the Minister could oppose it. While it does not compel a response, at least it prevents the authority from saying that it does not have the power to make a decision.</P>
    <P>Until now &ndash; I am sure it still applies &ndash; if a business wanted advice on its plans, it would probably have been able to telephone the Competition Authority which would probably have agreed to give advice. I understand the Bill removes from the Competition Authority not only the obligation to do that, if it ever had that obligation, but its permission to do it. Given that the authorities in Brussels have been inundated with a huge number of queries, it makes sense to remove the obligation on them to answer them all. My original intention was to oblige the Competition Authority to do it. The Minister will probably say that such a move might create a burden in future. I ask the Minister to permit the Competition Authority, if it so wishes, to reply to requests for advice ahead of time.</P>

The proposed provision is similar to one in the draft regulation to reform the application of EU competition law. I understand it was inserted in the draft regulation in order to provide for greater legal certainty when the notification system is abolished. While I am sympathetic to the thinking behind the amendment, I do not propose to follow the draft regulation in this respect because I believe there is a danger, which has been acknowledged in discussions on the EU regulation, that the provision could lead to a reintroduction of the notification system by the back door. I also believe that we in this jurisdiction have a better way of dealing with the problems that exist.</P>
      <P>Later I will propose an amendment to section 29 of the Competition Bill, 2001, which would empower the Competition Authority to issue guidance notices advising companies on how to comply with the provisions of the legislation. I believe this is a more flexible instrument to deal with the problem. If the Competition Authority could give free legal advice, many parties would be interested in availing of it. However, I do not believe it is appropriate that we should accept this amendment, although I can understand the thinking behind it.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed with the Tánaiste's decision not to accept my proposed amendment. She mistakenly stated that I proposed the Competition Authority could be obliged to reply, but that is not what is in my amendment. I had originally planned an amendment that would force the authority to reply, but I thought it through and decided not to go ahead with it. I decided that it was better to enable them to reply, rather than to force them.</P>
      <P>As the Bill stands, it appears that the authority is not permitted to give advice to anyone who seeks it. If my amendment was accepted, the authority would still be in a position to refuse to give advice. However, I believe that it is only right that a citizen should be able to contact the authority in order to establish what sort of activities are permissible. In light of the discussion we had earlier on assumption of guilt, this is very important. If this Bill goes through without my amendment, the Competition Authority will not be allowed to respond to requests for information ahead of time. My amendment would strengthen what we are trying to achieve in this Bill. If we do not do this, a business that is thinking of looking for advice will not be in a position to seek it. On that basis, we may end up with an anti-competitive Bill, which is not what the Tánaiste intends.</P>

      <P>There is certainly nothing in the Bill to prevent the Competition Authority from giving advice in broad terms. The current chairman of the authority is in the vicinity of the Chamber, so I had better be careful about what I say. He is probably one of the most accessible chairpersons of any body in the State, and I believe that the authority itself operates on the same level of accessibility.</P>
      <P>I understand Senator Quinn's point, that the word &lsquo;may' can also mean &lsquo;may not', and I can imagine the consequences of that. However, legal advice is freely available to companies in relation to particular matters, and I do not see how the authority would have any difficulty in offering informal advice on general matters. On this basis, I do not believe it is necessary to write Senator Quinn's amendment into the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept entirely what the Tánaiste has said. The chairman of the Competition Authority is in the House, and I am quite sure that if, in the past, I or any other citizen had contacted the authority for advice, we would have received it. My advice is that such an ability to respond will be removed by this Bill. I am not going to push my amendment now&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Suppose a business was considering making an arrangement with a supplier regarding agencies for the distribution of motor cars and they were not sure whether this would be in contravention of Competition Authority regulations, in the past they could have picked up the telephone and asked the authority directly. My understanding is that this Bill removes the right of the authority to respond to such requests for advice and information. I do not want to compel them to respond, but merely maintain their right to do so.</P>
      <P>My reason for putting down this amendment is to confirm that there is no danger of the authority being denied permission to offer advice. I believe the Competition Authority, both as individuals and as a group, would be quite willing to accept and give advice if it suits them to do so. If they were inundated with requests for information to the extent that they could not do their normal work, then they might have to refuse to give advice. I do not think that this amendment interferes with their right to do so. I would be happy to withdraw the amendment if the Tánaiste would agree to give it some further consideration between now and Report Stage.</P>

      <P>If I thought that the scenario painted by Senator Quinn was not covered by the Bill, I would definitely accept his amendment. I will give further consideration to the matter. This is a reasonable request, although I do not believe it is necessary. I think what the Senator is saying is that now that the notification period is gone, <Col N="361" /> there is a vacuum in relation to the generality of advice. That is not my understanding, but I will revert to it at a later stage.</P>

      <P Just="Center">SECTION 6.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 9, lines 19 to 31, to delete subsection (2).</P>
      <P>I raised on Second Stage the point covered by amendment No. 5 and it is one which has already received a certain amount of attention in this House. I wish to raise it again to highlight its importance. I feel very strongly about this subsection. At the very least, this is not a clause that we should allow to go through just on the nod.</P>
      <P>This subsection, according to the explanatory and financial memorandum:</P>
      <P>introduces a new presumption which will apply in the prosecution of the more serious offences. This obliges the court to presume, unless the defendant can prove otherwise, that the object or effect of the agreement, decision or concerted practice at issue is to prevent, restrict or distort competition.</P>
      <P>As I stressed when we debated this matter before, I do not in any way seek to minimise the gravity of the offences with which we are dealing. I look on a crime against competition as one that makes victims of the whole community. For this reason, I support the increased penalties that the Bill attaches to the more serious offences under this very legislation. However, this provision sends a shiver down my spine, because it strikes at the root of the way that we in this country approach justice. This provision, with a casual brush of the draftsperson's pen, sweeps away the presumption of innocence until proven guilty that underpins our entire system. As far as I know, for every other offence in the book, the burden of proof rests with the prosecutor, who must make the case for the defendant's guilt beyond any reasonable doubt.</P>
      <P>What is so special about what we are dealing with here that we should wish to sweep away this basic principle? No doubt it will be argued that it will be difficult to get prosecutions without such legislation. Surely such an argument could be applied to any other case before a court. I am sure the authorities would love to have this provision extended to all offences because it would make their lives so much easier. However, it is not applied generally because legal tradition in this country has always held that placing the burden of proof on the prosecution is a necessary part of the system of checks and balances in the power of the State in its relationship with its citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder whether the negation of this fundamental principle is proposed because the offences involved are esoteric in nature and are not com<Col N="362" /> mitted by ordinary citizens. Would we pass this provision so casually if the offence involved was riding one's bicycle without a light or not paying one's water charges? I do not believe so. Is it not the case, however, that we would like it to be included in legislation relating to terrorist, sexual and many other offences?</P>
    <P>Does this provision represent a clash, within Europe, of two different systems of law? Are we conceding the principle that a person is innocent until proved guilty to bring us into line with practices in other European countries such as France, where the presumption of innocence is a much less fundamental principle than it is here? If so, we should declare that to be the case and be open about what we are doing. This is a bad development. Every Government would love to be able say to those accused of every type of offence, &ldquo;We think you are guilty, now prove yourself innocent.&rdquo;  To the best of my knowledge, that does not exist elsewhere in our system and we are now planning to enshrine it in this legislation. It will make for bad law and we should think twice before proceeding.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not say that I am without sympathy for Senator Quinn. However, there are precedents in recent legislation for a provision of this nature. I believe I am correct in stating that the Animal Remedies Bill, which is concerned with the use of illegal growth promoters, involves a similar burden of having to prove one's innocence. In other words, the traditional presumption that one is innocent until proven guilty is not universally applied. There are instances where people are required to make a rebuttal and prove their innocence. The provision in question is reasonable in circumstances such as this. Section 6(1)(<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>) states that an undertaking which &ldquo;enters into, or implements an agreement, or . makes or implements a decision, or . engages in a concerted practice&rdquo;, which shows that the provision is restricted in terms of the potential offences involved.</P>
      <P>Subsections (3), (4) and (5) refer to the grounds for entering a good defence and further limit the impact of the provision. Subsection (3), for example, states that it shall be a good defence to prove that &ldquo;the defendant did not know, nor, in all the circumstances of the case, could the defendant be reasonably expected to have known, that the effect of the agreement, decision or concerted practice would be the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition in trade alleged in the proceedings.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree with Senator Quinn's comments about the esoteric dimension of the offences involved. Issues of this nature can have far-reaching consequences for society as a whole. Where agreements to which the section refers are entered into, there can be serious consequences for consumers and society in general. For those reasons, it is appropriate that a defendant should have to prove his or her innocence. I do not believe this is the most desirable way to proceed, <Col N="363" /> but it is becoming increasingly difficult for authorities to prove conspiracy and collusion. There is no question that the people who might be responsible for some of these practices have access to the best and most expensive legal advice and I would not underestimate their capacity to devise weird and wonderful ways of avoiding their responsibilities under the law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is usually a look of bewilderment on the faces of my colleagues when I rise to speak. However, there were even more pronounced looks of bewilderment earlier when I spoke out of context in respect of this matter. Having being suitably chastened by the Chair, I wonder whether the Editor of Debates will assist me by transposing what I said earlier into the debate on this amendment so that I do not have to repeat it.</P>
      <P>I referred earlier to the Revenue Commissioners and the fact that the onus of proof is on individual citizens in the context of their tax affairs. Am I correct in suggesting, as an ordinary citizen reading reports, that the tribunals currently operating in Dublin Castle place the onus of proof on the people being brought before them as witnesses and that lawyers for the tribunals seem to possess an enormous amount of information they do not reveal unless it is referred to or added to by a witness? In the context of what Senator Dardis stated, is there not already in existence a growing practice of placing the onus of proof on people?</P>
      <P>There are two other points I wish to raise. I do not wish to cast aspersions on those involved in the corporate world, but let us consider the practices of some international corporations which seek to dominate and control markets. That awful word &ldquo;cartel&rdquo; seems to be coming into increasing use because secret protocols appear to be operating between corporations selling the same product in marketplaces to maintain price levels, etc. Considering the battery of lawyers employed by companies in the corporate sector, I am of the opinion that they may be in a position to hide some of these protocols to which I refer.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate what was her thinking in including this provision in the legislation? It has raised the angst of those who represent the business community here, the concerns of whom were so well articulated by Senator Quinn. I do not wish to diminish what the Senator said and I appreciate the importance of this matter. IBEC lobbied strongly in respect of it and seems extremely animated about it. IBEC believes this provision will have such an effect on day to day business that it has requested that it be completely withdrawn. Perhaps it would be helpful to the House if the Minister gave an indication of her thinking in including this provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Quinn's amendment. I must make a declaration of interest here because I work for Independent Newspapers. I <Col N="364" /> do not know on which side the company would be in respect of this matter but I feel obliged to make a declaration for the sake of doing so.</P>
      <P>There is real danger involved, as a legal matter and a matter of principle, in changing, in respect of all law, the presumption of innocence. I am aware that there is a strong lobby in respect of the libel laws, for example, that the presumption of innocence should be removed from those who are supposedly libelled and that they should be obliged to prove their innocence. That is an absolutely outrageous suggestion and it has been made by journalists, of which I am one, and a certain union. It seems that everybody is entitled, regardless of whether they are involved in journalism, business or some other area, to be presumed innocent. This provision unambiguously changes that presumption and means that businesses will be believed guilty unless they can prove their innocence. There is a danger of over-reacting to certain events of which everyone is aware and, as a result, making a fundamental change which is not acceptable and not fair. Businesses, like individuals, are entitled to rights, but this provision will remove such rights and is the wrong route to take.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I take a different view which I will make abundantly clear. This provision is being included to make it easier to secure prosecutions. In the first instance, however, the prosecution will have to prove that an agreement, decision or concerted practice exists and that the accused was a party to it. When one proves one set of facts, it is not unreasonable to prove what will be the consequences. For example, if it is proved that people were a party to price fixing, it is not unreasonable to presume that this price fixing was aimed at restricting competition. Can anybody suggest another good reason for a person to be a party to price fixing?</P>
      <P>This provision is not unique; it applies in other aspects of the criminal law and, of course, the accused can rebut it in court. Having proved the existence of an agreement or a concerted practice or a decision and that the accused was a party to it, it is not unreasonable to assume another set of facts. I have given the example of price fixing. Having proved there is an agreement to fix prices, it is not unreasonable to presume that was with a view to restricting competition.</P>
      <P>The intention is to ring-fence what I refer to as the hard core offences. I am willing to look at the scope of these provisions in the light of what Senators have said. It is not intended to be lightly used. However, in relation to the hard core offences, where it has been proved beyond doubt that there was an agreement or decision or concerted practice, it is not unreasonable in those circumstances to presume that was done with a view to restricting competition. If Senators are in agreement, I will reflect on the matter and discuss with our lawyers how these particular provisions might be ring-fenced around the more hard core offences referred to in the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am greatly concerned about the actual words used. This strikes to the very heart of our democracy and the provision whereby one is innocent until proven guilty. I note from what Senator Dardis and the Tánaiste have said that this is not the first time and that there have been other cases. I regret that greatly. I worry if we are now beginning to do this more regularly than I had thought that it strikes at the very heart of our tradition of democracy.</P>
      <P>I did not understand clearly from the Tánaiste's reply whether this provision is being introduced because it is common in European law. From what I know of the situation in France, the same tradition of innocence until proven guilty does not apply. I really have great difficulty in this regard. Senator Dardis said it is becoming increasingly difficult to prove cases of this nature. Of course it is becoming increasingly difficult and I agree entirely with him, as I said earlier.</P>
      <P>I support the Bill, including the heavy fines for which it provides. Every offence of this kind is not just against the business, it is against the community as a whole. We really need to find a way of making sure such behaviour is stopped and heavy fines and penalties are one way of doing that. I understand from Senator Mooney that IBEC has lobbied on this matter &ndash; I was not aware of that. We discussed a Bill last year on citizenship and naturalisation which has since been queried, perhaps because we did not give it sufficient attention. We should be very careful in this regard.</P>
      <P>I am greatly worried about the use of words to the effect that one is guilty unless one can prove one's innocence. That is a slippery slope. The innocence of the individual is important. This issue relates to innocent individuals as well as businesses. The Tánaiste has said she will look at it again. I would prefer to hear her say she will take steps to ease the minds of those of us who are deeply concerned about the slippery slope we are approaching in this context.</P>

      <P>Mention is made of IBEC. I am not a member of IBEC and I do not necessarily hold a brief for them. However I agree with its point that in section 8 the liability of employees is too wide-ranging. IBEC points out that there is no definition of a manager or other similar officer and once the company offends, the burden of proof shifts to the employee in question who must prove non-consent. This is an onerous requirement and will be unworkable in practice as many will not be in a position to prove non-consent, particularly when acting on the direction of their own managers. I agree with IBEC and I would like to hear the Tánaiste's view on this matter.</P>

      <P>The inspiration for section 10 is section 57 of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act, 2001, which in turn implements certain recommendations of the Government's advisory committee on fraud and the Law Reform Commission. It is my view that serious competition offences are analogous to fraud. Moreover, the type of evidence adduced for fraud offences is similar to that required under this Bill which is likely to include technical economic assessments of the impact of the activity under scrutiny. In the course of the passage of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act, 2001, through the Oireachtas, several Members were concerned at the scope of the provisions and sought to ensure that adequate safeguards for the accused be included. Accordingly, my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, introduced a number of amendments to section 57. In the interests of consistency, these amendments seek to introduce the same changes to section 10 of this Bill.</P>
      <P>First, only agreed summaries of evidence are to be supplied to the jury as in amendment No. 6. Second, amendment No. 8 will provide that, where the judge has ordered that an affidavit by an expert be given to the jury, that expert will be summoned as an expert witness by the prosecution and may be required by the trial judge to give evidence. Clearly, this would give the defence the opportunity to cross examine the expert about relevant matters. Amendment No. 7 also mirrors changes made to section 57 of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act, 2001, and complements the provisions in subsection 1(<i>b</i>). As this subsection provides that the opening speeches of counsel could be made available, it seems logical that the same provision be made available for the closing speeches.</P>

      <P>I propose this amendment because there are types of acquisitions in relation to financial investment transactions where undertakings hold shares and other undertakings on a temporary basis for investment purposes. These trans<Col N="370" /> actions are purely financial in nature and have no effect on competition and while technically they need to be notified at present under the 1978 Act, they are exempt from notification under article 3(5)(<i>a</i>) of the EU merger regulation. This is essentially because they do not result in control within the meaning of the regulation being acquired or transferred. As I have already adopted the EU merger concept of control in section 15 of the Bill, I agree that a similar provision for this type of transaction is appropriate.</P>

      <P>I am introducing these amendments in light of the views received from the business community, which felt that a requirement to notify a merger within seven days of the conclusion of the agreement was unreasonable due to the international nature of many transactions that require regulatory clearance in Ireland. Many transactions that are notified here also require regulatory clearance in other jurisdictions. Accordingly, it would be more appropriate to allow a period of one month within which a merger or acquisition must be notified after the conclusion of an agreement.</P>
      <P>I accept that parties will endeavour to notify their merger or acquisitions as soon as possible because it is in their own interest to do so. A period of a month will allow them adequate time to prepare full and proper notification.</P>

      <P>This amendment closes a loophole in the Bill regarding mergers or acquisitions which are voluntarily notified by parties in section 17(13). These are proposals which do not reach the financial thresholds for notifications, but where the parties are seeking immunity from challenge from section 4 or section 5 of the Bill. The amendment ensures that such voluntarily notified transactions are processed in the same way, and within the same timescales, as transactions which require to be notified, for example, mergers and acquisitions which exceed the threshold.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
      <P>In page 20, subsection 1(<i>c</i>), line 21, to delete &ldquo;4 months&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo; 2 months&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These amendments are designed to reduce the time the authority will take for consideration of a merger. Under the proposed legislation, the authority will have one month to carry out an initial review of a proposed transaction and will then have a further three months to carry out a more detailed assessment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My understanding of the purpose and benefit of competition law is that it should improve competitiveness, enhance efficiencies and reduce costs. It cannot be an efficient use of resources if a transaction is held up for nearly four months before the parties can have some finality to the deal. In particular, such a timescale might cause acute difficulties for any plc involved in a merger as it would effectively have to underwrite the cost of any offer pending the clearance or rejection of such a deal. While international companies might be able to sustain such a cost, I suspect it might <Col N="372" /> place an onerous burden on Irish plcs and might inhibit participation in future transactions on their part. Any Irish plc would think long and hard about participating in a transaction that would be so expensive and place it at risk on the markets. Provided the Competition Authority is properly resourced, there is no reason that it should take it longer than ten working days to carry out an initial assessment of a transaction or that both the initial and subsequent examinations cannot be carried out within a two month period.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say that the time limits proposed in the Bill are the same as those that apply at present and at EU level, but the fact that she is removing her role from the process, thereby potentially reducing the current period by up to two months, should be reflected in the legislation. The time limits that apply at EU level are for transactions that are much more complex, both in terms of the territories covered and the amounts of consideration involved. A four month consultation period may be appropriate for a transaction over &euro;5 billion, affecting more than one member state, but it is disproportionate in a domestic context. As my colleague, Senator Coogan, pointed out on Second Stage, it is analogous to a situation where a person purchases a house but is forced to use a bridging loan for up to four months while awaiting the surveyor's report. I thank the Senator for taking the Second Stage debate for me.</P>
    <P>I propose that the two month period for consultation might be extended where the authority requires additional information from the parties or in circumstances where the authority applies to the Minister for an extension. This is a reasonable amendment and I urge the Minister to accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am usually keen to have very tight deadlines but we also have to be realistic and make sure that the right thing happens from the consumer's point of view, which is the whole purpose of the Bill. It is shorter than the EU timeframe and is tight by international standards. With regard to the four month period, it is important to emphasise that the vast bulk of notifications, more than 98%, are cleared at first phase, that is, within one month of the notification being made or additional information being supplied where this is sought. The longer period only comes into play when notification raises significant competition concerns and is subjected to a full investigation. In such cases, the period allowed is necessary to enable the authority to carry out a proper investigation which entails receiving written submissions from interested parties and holding oral hearings as well as a detailed analysis of the economic effects of the proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clearly in the interests of the consumer that the effects of mergers that might lessen competition, thus increasing prices and reducing consumer choice, are thoroughly investigated. It is also in the interests of the notifying parties that the deadlines should not be too tight as that <Col N="373" /> would result in mergers being prohibited within what might otherwise be permitted, subject to conditions, if sufficient time was available to investigate means by which anti-competitive effects could be alleviated.</P>
    <P>With regard to the proposal that the one month period proposed in section 22 should be reduced to ten working days, my Department's experience of operating the current mergers regime would strongly support the view that one month is the minimum period required to carry out an adequate initial examination of notified agreements. The same period is allowed for the first phase examination under the EU merger regulations. Accordingly, I am not disposed to accept the amendments.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 20:</P>
      <P>In page 23, lines 30 to 44, and in page 24, lines 1 to 40, to delete subsections (1) to (8), and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1) In the case of a media merger the Authority will make the determination as to whether the merger would&ndash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="374" />
      <i>(a)&nbsp;</i>increase the concentration of the market in such a way that the undertaking concerned would control more than 50% of the market in the State, and</P>
    <P>
      <i>(b)&nbsp;</i>whether the merger would result in a diminution of the plurality of view available to the public.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment is intended to draw attention to the difference that exists between certain purely commercial mergers and mergers in the media industry. It focuses attention on the dangers posed by a concentration of power in one company or individual. As this is a question of public opinion, it is not just a matter of efficiency. It is a matter of democracy and of making a plurality of voices and viewpoints available to the public.</P>
    <P>This is an area where it would be useful to concentrate the majority of power in the hands of the authority for simple reasons of human fallibility and the application of pressure to political persons. The Minister is, of course, a sterling person of strong nerve and courage, but that may not always be the case. Politicians are subject, increasingly, to pressure from the media. In 1994 the authority found that the Independent Newspaper group had abused a dominant position in the marketplace with regard to the <i>Irish Press</i>. At that time the authority had no legal powers of redress. A couple of years later, a similar issue in the media arose, but that time, though there was the possibility of legal sanction, nothing was done. That was a ministerial responsibility. I cannot say what the motives for inaction on that occasion were and they may very well have been perfectly reasonable.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that leaving this exclusively in the hands of the Minister would expose that Minister to considerable pressure from what is one of the most powerful lobby groups. Those who control the press have inordinate and growing power and it is in the interests of democracy that we include additional, special criteria when we look at the question of the media. It is not just a question of the substantial lessening of competition, there is also a question of plurality and market share. If 80% of people decide they want to go on a yellowpack airline, that is fine. Let them have 80% of the market as that does not distort the democratic process. However, if 60% or 80% of media interest, print or broadcast, is in the hands of one individual, that is extremely dangerous for democracy.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that my amateur attempt to express this in legal terms is satisfactory. It may well be that the Minister will need to look at this and make an amendment on Report Stage. I do not claim immense wisdom or drafting skill, but it is such a significant matter that it requires a good deal of attention. It is not appropriate simply to leave the normal commercial criteria in place when one is dealing with an interest group as powerful as the media. I hesitate to utter the name, as I have used the example frequently, but the concentration of power in the hands of media <Col N="375" /> moguls like Rupert Murdoch is highly dangerous. People like that use their positions to follow clear political lines for their own commercial advancement. I take particularly to heart his disgraceful attack through his newspapers on the Dalai Lama, the reason for which was a desire to exploit commercial opportunities in the Republic of China. It is not at all appropriate that this policy should be carried on. While we cannot clip the wings of Rupert Murdoch from the Seanad Chamber of the Oireachtas, we can at least initiate a process whereby we protect our democratic institutions from potential abuse. I am very interested in the Minister's response.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter is of particular interest to me also. As I said on Second Stage, I welcome the statutory obligation to clear media mergers through the Minister. However, another issue has arisen on foot of the IBEC submission. It was an issue to which I had not given much serious thought until I read that. The Minister can probably clarify the matter in her reply. In the context of corporate mergers generally, the Competition Authority will make decisions on purely economic grounds as they affect the market as distinct from the national interest. I am not happy to find that is the case and I am interested in knowing what the thinking was when the legislation was drafted. I would be grateful if the Minister outlined why she has not felt it necessary, while welcoming ministerial intervention in media mergers on the one hand, to ring-fence corporate mergers on national interest grounds as distinct from economic grounds.</P>
      <P>There is an international practice and the IBEC submission referred to the Australian experience as follows:</P>
      <P>Most of our European counterparts have this protection built into their own legislation and we would be almost unique in abandoning that right. A recent Australian case neatly illustrates the danger. Woodside, an Australian company owning the Australian gas reserve, was the subject of a take-over bid by Shell. The Australian Government prohibited the merger on the grounds that to allow a multinational to take ownership of the Australian gas reserves would be contrary to the Australian national interest. If a similar scenario were to arise here, under the new Bill, that merger would go through.</P>
      <P>I am somewhat concerned. Perhaps there is something in the body of the legislation which will afford protection in the case of mergers which might be inimical to the national interest and I would be grateful if the Minister clarified this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am genuinely concerned at the increasing domination of the television market here by Rupert Murdoch's organisation, particularly Sky. It is astonishing that within such a short time we are talking about the introduction of digital television <Col N="376" /> through satellite dishes, an issue which only emerged in September 2000, little over 15 months ago. There are now, according to Sky's own figures, in excess of 200,000 subscribers in the Republic of Ireland. If you consider that the entire television market, based on the collection of the licence fee, is in the order of about one million, Sky now has a market share of over 20%. That is frightening in its implications, especially in the context of listed sporting events, an issue which has entered the public arena over the past few weeks. While this is parallel to, rather than part of, her brief, I urge the Minister to give serious consideration to the issue of listed sporting events, notwithstanding the submissions made by the three major sporting bodies.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand where the conflict lies, particularly in the case of the GAA, if the Government designates the all-Ireland football and hurling finals exclusively as listed events. In effect, this would mean that the Murdochs of this world would not be able to bargain with the GAA, give them millions of pounds for those two matches and then put them on pay-per-view. If our national games were available only on pay-per-view, it would mean that the only way one can see them would be by paying a subscription fee to a non-national company, which has no involvement or interest in or concern for the culture or the ethos of this society. I understand that at the end of the day it is about money, but frankly it seems rather unfortunate that we have reached a stage in which the GAA is using a Murdoch organisation to get RTE to pay more money for our national games. Without going into the area of soccer or rugby, it is about money at the end of the day.</P>
    <P>This is a time for political leadership on the part of the Government. It should face the three sporting unions because I do not agree with this. Make no mistake about it, the day is coming quickly &ndash; we have seen this in the case of the Ireland and England game at Twickenham &ndash; when the only way one will be able to see national sporting events, that is, finals rather than an array of intermediate fixtures, is if one pays to view them at home or if one goes to a pub to watch them on a big screen. What a future that conjurers up, that one will watch major national sporting events in the local pub because that will be the only way to see them without paying through the nose. Once one goes down the slippery slope of pay-per-view, there is a cash cow for those who are supplying the service. This has been discovered in America, where the baseball authority found to its cost that it lost support among people who gave up going to the games and it reversed its pay-per-view arrangements with the major networks.</P>
    <P>I raise this only in the context of media mergers. I tried to outline what has been happening with the increasing market penetration by a non-national television company. I enthusiastically welcome the right of the Minister of the day to veto mergers in that regard, but it also begs the <Col N="377" /> following question. Why does the legislation seem &ndash; I use that word advisedly &ndash; to be lacking in this regard? Where vital national interests are involved, it seems that the Competition Authority can make decisions on mergers on purely economic grounds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the reasoning behind the amendment but I do not understand why the Senator would wish to delete a large part of section 22 to accommodate the amendment. I take issue with Senator Norris on the matter of the 50% control and how one identifies 50% control. Would one identify it by virtue of circulation, capitalisation or by other means? The definition of &ldquo;relevant criteria&rdquo; set out in section 22 deals with that situation much more effectively than any talk about 50% control of the market or, indeed, the effects of the merger, which, by definition, would be taken into account by the authority and by the Minister in making the determination.</P>
      <P>The relevant criteria are very broadly drawn. They include strength and competitiveness, the extent to which ownership in the State is spread among individuals and the extent to which ownership and control of particular types of media business is spread among individuals and other undertakings. That is a much better way of defining what might be dominance or of determining what might be the effect of a merger in the market.</P>
      <P>The issue of Sky television, etc., has a relevance here. I take the point, which is properly made, that some of these issues are more to do with broadcasting legislation than with the Competition Bill, nevertheless the Senator has a point. The degree to which there is lack of competition was very visible before the game between Ireland and England, and, indeed, during it and afterwards, leaving aside the fact that the game could not be seen on terrestrial television at the same time as it was being shown on Sky Two. The relevance is that Sky News in its coverage concentrated exclusively on the game between Ireland and England when there were two other rugby internationals at the weekend, one in Cardiff and the other in Italy. It was as if the other matches were not taking place. The reason they do not cover such games is they are just promoting their own product. They are using their news bulletins to promote their own projects. That is the competitive aspect rather than the broadcasting aspect of the issue.</P>
      <P>I do not disagree with anything Senator Mooney said about broadcasting, but there is a serious competitive dimension to this and it needs to be attended to. I would not criticise Sky's coverage of the game itself, but I would criticise the way the company's news bulletins deal with one game to the exclusion of other sporting events taking place at the same time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to add a supplementary example on which the Minister might be prepared to comment. In response to Senator Dardis, I <Col N="378" /> made it clear that this draft of the amendment was not precious to me. Therefore, I have no great sensitivities in that regard and I hope that the wisdom of the House will prevail. However, there is a general concern that the media, because of its role in forming public opinion and in informing public opinion, need to be protected in a special way and that purely financial considerations are not sufficient, that it is a question of the expression of views and informing the public. I think we must look at that extremely carefully.</P>
      <P>I want to give an example. This time I am not hitting my <i>bête noire</i>, Mr. Rupert Murdoch. I am just raising a question about an institution which I greatly value and cherish, that is, RTE. We are lucky to have a responsible, good national broadcasting service, and particularly stations like Lyric FM. RTE deserves the support of the citizens of this country, but it would concern me, for example, if RTE started gobbling up all the little local radio stations because they give a good particular service. The local radio stations give a variety of local information and opinion. If they were in the control of the central State broadcasting service, I am not sure that that variety could be adequately protected. Even though I am an admirer, a supporter and, I may add, a regular licence payer of RTE and I am very glad to contribute to its coffers in my small way, I would not welcome even an institution like RTE gobbling up the majority of local stations. In terms of affording the public a plurality of viewpoint, it is important that we treat media in a special way.</P>

      <P>I certainly agree with what has been said about the role of the local media. They are playing an increasingly important role in helping, at one level, to knit communities together and give a sense of identity to communities. Stories which would not in a million years hit the <Col N="379" /> national airwaves and are big news at local level are being extensively covered. They have had a very positive effect on communities, particularly across rural Ireland. The listenership figures are very impressive. More than 50% of radio listeners in many parts of the country are listeners of local stations.</P>
      <P>I must admit that nothing gave me more concern than this issue, that is, what is the best way to deal with media mergers. Since we began to put together this legislation, I have spent more time discussing this issue than perhaps any other aspect of the Bill. Ironically, I would prefer a regime where it could be done by others for some of the reasons Senator Norris mentioned and because media mergers will not be dealt with purely on economic criteria nor just for the reasons some Members mentioned.</P>
      <P>The media have a powerful role to play in our lives in informing &ndash; or misinforming &ndash; entertaining and so on. They are a powerful influence over every society. The world of the media is changing dramatically. I did not realise how many people had Sky Sports until last Saturday. I must live in some type of sheltered environment. I do not have it myself but I was amazed by the number of people who did and who offered me the use of their television for the duration of the unfortunate match last Saturday. It was unfortunate because it made depressing viewing.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands has power under the Broadcasting Act, 1999, to designate what would be broadly called &ldquo;national sporting events&rdquo;. I remember when it was being discussed at Cabinet how keen everyone was to ensure these would be available free of charge to citizens. I regret they have not yet been negotiated. I know the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, and the Minister, Deputy de Valera, have been in discussions with sporting organisations on this matter. It is a great pity it has not been resolved. I share the views expressed in that I would hate to think that sporting events like the All-Ireland hurling or football finals would not be widely available to the community at large without the payment of a fee to Sky Sports. This is especially so in the case of elderly people who might not be in a position to go to another person's premises or to a local hostelry. I hope the matter can be resolved quickly but it is outside my remit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to take up the point made by Senator Mooney that corporate or non-media mergers do not attract public interest or what he called &ldquo;national interest criteria&rdquo;. Legislative measures in this regard have been in place for 22 years and I do not believe they have ever been used. I cannot think of an example where something might not be in what is called &ldquo;the national interest&rdquo;. There are many examples where individuals or companies were supported and it was assumed, wrongly in my opinion, to be in the national interest. I remember one operator in the beef sector who received the lion's share of moneys avail<Col N="380" /> able and that was assumed to be in the national interest. I never quite understood that. If the players are large enough, it is often assumed anything they want should be given because it is in the national interest. I do not support that view. I will reflect on this issue and Senator Dardis made a valid point on it.</P>
    <P>The Commission on the Newspaper Industry established by my predecessor which reported in 1996 and the Competitions and Mergers Review Group recommended that we go beyond what could be called normal competition or economic criteria in determining mergers in the newspaper industry because of the influence newspapers have. The relevant criteria, which we have written into the Bill, have been taken from the recommendations of the newspaper commission. They are in section 22(9) and include:</P>
    <P>(<i>a</i>) the strength and competitiveness of media businesses indigenous to the State,</P>
    <P>(<i>b</i>) the extent to which ownership or control of media businesses in the State is spread amongst individuals and other undertakings,</P>
    <P>(<i>c</i>) the extent to which ownership and control of particular types of media business in the State is spread amongst individuals and other undertakings,</P>
    <P>(<i>d</i>) the extent to which the diversity of views prevalent in Irish society is reflected through the activities of the various media businesses in the State, and</P>
    <P>(<i>e</i>) the share in the market in the State of one or more of the types of business [and so on].</P>
    <P>We widened the concept of control in the Bill to include not just control by shares but also loan guarantees and so on. That covers a situation which has existed and which will have to be taken into account in future before someone could take control of a newspaper or media interest.</P>
    <P>That said, what we have devised in the Bill is perhaps a cumbersome solution. There is a role for the authority which will deal with what one could broadly call the competition side. There is also a role for the Minister, the Oireachtas and the courts where mergers are concerned. Given that media mergers have such a huge influence on democracy, diversity within society and freedom of expression and that one of the hallmarks of a democracy is freedom of the press, we felt on balance that it was better to leave what is in the Bill as the mechanism. If the Competition Authority had the expertise to deal with what I could broadly call &ldquo;public interest issues&rdquo; in addition to its expertise in competition, I would have been happy to have left the entire process with the authority. We have not yet come forward with something better and I hope we can do so before the Bill is enacted. Everyone who has examined this, including those who advise me, agrees. My own belief is, having spoken to some colleagues in Opposition parties who have an <Col N="381" /> interest in this area, that what we have in the Bill is, on balance, probably the preferred solution.</P>
    <P>Strict percentages, besides being difficult to prove, are too rigid and prescriptive. The criteria outlined in the Bill are appropriate, as is the role given to the authority relating to competition aspects. The authority will be the determining body in the competition element, but the wider issues which broadly reflect what I have called broader public interest grounds will be left to the Minister and, ultimately, the Houses of the Oireachtas. That is provided for in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister. She has been very gracious in suggesting this is a troubling area and one which is very difficult to resolve clearly. She has indicated she will examine it again. I will also do that and take further advice. I would be very happy if it were left with the Competition Authority.</P>
      <P>My experience politically, which is limited I suppose, is that, as a group, we tend to be a little pusillanimous in dealing with the media. I clearly recall being in the Cathaoirleach's office when the editors of the principal newspapers were in attendance. The lickspittling which took place was obscene. I thank God I am an independent Senator with a pretty independent electorate because I gave it to the editors right between the eyes on the question of libel. I am afraid we as a group are subject to pressure on this matter. Any time the media are discussed in the House, there is fear, hostility and deference because people are afraid. That is a pity.</P>
      <P>I would like to think the Competition Authority would be entrusted with this area. Its personnel are able to determine these matters in terms of ensuring a plurality of views are expressed, which is the essential ingredient. I thank the Minister for her helpful reply and perhaps between us we will devise a form of words or at least come up with some ideas which may be helpful to her advisers and draftspeople in resolving the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what Senator Norris said about the attitude of the media, but he can probably be heartened by the fact that not only is his electorate independent, the people generally have an independent streak. Despite the best efforts of those in the media to give the impression that they are in control of matters, the people tend to make their own decisions. It is a little like our attitude to religion. We listen carefully to what the Pope has to say but then do our own thing. Senator Norris would not fully understand that in the context in which I say it, but it is to let him know that we are not totally monolithic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am grateful to the Minister for her reply. My concern was about goods and services from airlines, post offices, banks and other areas undergoing a period of transition. It is a matter of grave concern to people in rural areas that there is a withdrawal of goods and services from their <Col N="382" /> areas. Banks are the other element of this argument. A future Government could sell off the family silver to the point where all these services would be privatised. The rationalisation and consolidation which has happened and is continuing to happen in the broadcasting area could then happen with these services. Once we begin to deregulate other areas it will inevitably lead to consolidation and mergers.</P>
    <P>We may find that people from outside the country will take a purely commercial view of these matters. That was where I was coming from in the context of uneconomic as distinct from national interest reasons. I am heartened by what the Tánaiste said. She agrees it is not a black and white area and I hope the matter will be kept under review.</P>

      <P>Government amendment No. 21:</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment relates to the media section, particularly the requirement of the Minister to publish the reasons for making a decision on a media merger. I tabled the amendment to ensure any commercial confidential information is secure from publication.</P>
      <P>In response to Senator Mooney, I am not sure there is much difference between us. What is important is competition in regard to EU requirements, public utilities and so on. The EU requires that we do not distort competition between member states, engage in anti-competitive behaviour or use state aids to subsidise certain operations which would decrease competition. However, there is no requirement under the EU for us not to have post offices or telephone kiosks. Our public service obligations would allow us to do all that, provided it does not distort competition. Sometimes the name of competition is used to falsely close things down, which I regret. It is important to have a range of services available to people who live in rural Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clearly, media matters concern us all. I understand there is a poster on lamp posts throughout this city, which I have not yet seen, to the effect that I am involved in some controversy about the morning after pill. A friend of mine who called me on my mobile phone wondered what this was all about. I have not yet seen the article. When damaging articles are written, particularly if one has not been contacted or asked for an opinion, which I have not been, it is very difficult. I am not saying this is a libel matter, because I do not <Col N="383" /> believe it is. It is probably a political comment in the context of other matters currently in the public domain. We must be very careful in regard to the libel laws because if one's good name is taken away, it is extremely difficult, notwithstanding court procedures and so on, to get it back. As legislators, it is not just right that we should defend our own good names, but the good names of other citizens who do not have the opportunity to affect the law in the way we do. I share Senator Norris's views on these matters.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <P>Government amendment No. 22:</P>
    <P>In page 24, between lines 17 and 18, to insert the following subsection:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(6) For the purpose of the exercise of the power under <i>subsection (4)</i>, the Minister may consider such submissions or observations from persons claiming to be interested in the matter as the Minister thinks proper.&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Under this amendment, I am proposing the introduction of a new subsection to provide that the Minister in making a decision on a media merger may consider submissions or observations from interested parties. I believe the Minister should have the fullest information in making such a decision.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 23:</P>
      <P>In page 24, subsection (9), to delete lines 42 and 43 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&nbsp;&lsquo;broadcasting service' means a broadcasting service to which the Broadcasting Act 2001 applies (and includes a sound broadcasting service within the meaning of the Radio and Television Act 1988);&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment seeks to make it clear that sound broadcasting is included in the definition of &ldquo;media business&rdquo; in the Bill. The existing definition in the section of &ldquo;programme material&rdquo; comes from the Broadcasting Act, 2001. &ldquo;Programme material&rdquo; in the Broadcasting Act means audio-visual material or, where used in the context of a sound broadcasting service, audio material which includes advertisements and material which when transmitted will constitute a direct offer to the public for the sale or supply to them of goods and other property whether real or personal or services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The definition of &ldquo;programme material&rdquo; is linked to the definition of broadcasting service, also taken from the Broadcasting Act, 2001. &ldquo;Broadcasting service&rdquo; is defined as a service which comprises compilation of programme material of any description on which it is transmitted or relayed for reception by the general public. It was felt this definition did not <Col N="384" /> adequately cover sound broadcasting services. The amendment is being tabled to ensure there is no ambiguity regarding the inclusion, for example, of independent local and national radio stations.</P>

      <P>In page 25, subsection (11), line 41, to delete &ldquo;system or&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;system,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The amendments seek to widen the definition of media mergers and recognise the fact that telecommunication services such as telephone lines are increasingly becoming channels for the transmission of content. For example, the advent of ADSL technology means the simple telephone line may become a channel for transmission of data and programme material. Given that one company currently owns or has interests in local and national print media, cable and telecommunications, it is crucial that we examine any increased consolidation or media mergers in the future. It is in the public interest that there should be diverse ownership of the media and that any increased concentration of ownership is reviewed, having regard to these new technologies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>It has come to my notice that there are newer technologies, such as digital subscriber lines, which use telecommunication lines to transmit data. In future it may be possible to transmit or retransmit programme material from television or radio through telecommunication lines. The question arises as to whether these DSL services are covered by the Bill. My intention is that the Bill should cover all means of transmission or retransmission. I am not concerned so much with the technology as the content. I will look again at the section to ensure the definition &ldquo;media business&rdquo; covers all possible technologies for the transmission or retransmission of programme material.</P>
      <P>As this is a highly technical area, I need to consult both the Minister for Public Enterprise and the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. The technical definitions in this section originated in legislation or regulations emanating from those two Departments. Therefore, I want to ensure that any changes I might propose are in line with existing legislation and regulations governing broadcasting. I hope to consult the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel on these amendments.</P>

      <P>I will speak on behalf of Senator Norris until he arrives. I know he is concerned that the limitation regarding the High Court is not in the best interests of democracy and, therefore, he wonders why there should be a limitation on going to the Supreme Court.

I am sure the Bill will be strengthened by such a proposal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I outlined this matter on Second Stage because I felt it was an unnecessary limitation, particularly in light of the case I instanced of the Orange mobile telephone licence which came to the notice of the High Court. Judgment was given by a very distinguished, careful, thoughtful judge, Ms Justice Fidelma Macken. There was a disagreement and the case was appealed to the Supreme Court. Given the wisdom of members of the Supreme Court, that decision was reversed. That is a clear, historical precedent whereby it was useful and very valuable to have recourse of appeal to the Supreme Court. In light of that history, it appears unwise to remove the possibility of appeal to the Supreme Court. For that reason, all the amendments are together. In amendment No. 34, the deletion of subsection (9) is required, which specifically prevents appeal to the Supreme Court. In the other amendments, &ldquo;and the Supreme Court&rdquo; is simply added in.</P>
      <P>I should not have the presumption or arrogance to anticipate anything but if I may be just slightly prophetic, I feel in my bones that my amendments may be accepted on the logical grounds that there is a Government amendment, amendment No. 33, that refers to an appeal to the Supreme Court. There could hardly be such an appeal if the Tánaiste was not gracefully prepared to accept this series of amendments.

My understanding is that this is routine in the Supreme Court anyway. I have been involved in an appeal to the Supreme Court myself. I remember the lawyers saying to me that no new evidence could be adduced at that point by virtue of the nature of the Supreme Court and all they would deal with would be points of law arising from the High Court. I could be incorrect in this regard, but that was my information in that case.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;(<i>g</i>) To liaise and consult with the public, <Col N="387" /> public representatives and representatives of business, farming community, trade unions and consumers in the performance of its functions under this Act.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am suggesting this amendment because it is vital that the authority be keenly focused on its overall objectives. The pursuit of finer points of economic theory is all very fine, but needs to be firmly focused on the practical benefits business consumers receive from a more competitive and effective competition regime.</P>
    <P>I am also suggesting this additional function for the authority because it is important that it adopts a carrot-and-stick approach to its enforcement role. I suspect that it is a far better use of the authority's time if it is able to educate people in the benefits of competitiveness and to highlight the types of transactions and arrangements that are prohibited.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a strong advocate of consultation and discussion. After all, this is a very small country. As Senator Coghlan knows, he and I consult constantly, notwithstanding the fact that he is in a different political home from me. The idea of having a mandatory requirement or legislating for something that should be, by its nature, a voluntary act is not good. I know the authority has many seminars, briefings, consultation and dialogue with all kinds of representatives, from professional bodies to trade unions, employer organisations, farming organisations, etc. That is done frequently on an ongoing basis.</P>
      <P>I am not a fan of writing into the legislation the compulsory requirement that one must consult. All sorts of legal difficulties could arise. Could the authority ever do anything without consultation? It is better left to the regime that operates at the moment. There is a suggestion that the chairman of the authority should attend annually a meeting of the relevant Oireachtas committee. That is a good suggestion, which I will be taking on board in the Bill. I am not keen to have a compulsory, legislative or statutory requirement on the authority to consult particular groups.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(1) The membership of the Authority shall consist of a chairperson and ordinary members who should be appointed only after open competition.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I very much hope that the Tánaiste will accept this amendment because it seems to be absurd to establish a competition authority and exempt it from the requirements of competition. If one has a competition authority and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform dreams up some employees, sticks them in, it is not appropriate. If we cannot have competition in the Competition Authority, where on earth will we have it? I am in favour of open competition, even on occasions when one knows perfectly well who the right person is. He or she usually gets the job.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinn will agree with me in saying that we have an absolutely wonderful secretary-political assistant. She applied for the job in the James Joyce Centre, was shortlisted to three people, but did not get it, against my advice. Then, when the job for secretary came up, I said to Senator Quinn, &ldquo;I know exactly the person for this job. She will be wonderful, but we still have to have an open competition. I just want to mark your cards &ndash; I will let this person know that the job is available because I hope she will apply for it.&rdquo;  She did apply. Again, she was shortlisted to three candidates. Senator Quinn said he would get his personnel person to consider the lady in question and he recommended her. She now works for us, extremely efficiently and well. However, even in those circumstances, we went through the open competition and I am glad we did. We got what we wanted in the end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel strongly that there is a logical inconsistency in having a competition authority and having it say, &ldquo;We will not have any competition here. We will regulate for everybody else and insist that they have open competition, but we are not going to be stuck with that.&rdquo;  I hope very <Col N="389" /> much that the Tánaiste will accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>I am reliably informed that one of the comments frequently heard from businesses that have been involved in discussions with the authority in the course of a merger is that the authority lacks any real commercial insight or practical experience. I am sure a bunch of economists can be expert, but they also need to be aware of the environment in which the real commercial world functions. It is vital that the membership of the authority should have wider experience and not be limited to economists, lawyers and academics. Additional expertise could be provided without compromising the enforcement role of the authority and this is the purpose of my amendment No. 39.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would go further than my colleague, Senator Norris. In light of Dáil reform generally, not only should there be competition for such places but the applicants should come before the relevant Oireachtas committee, in much the same way as happens in the United States. They should be questioned to determine if they are capable and competent for these positions. That is a view that is not specific to this authority. I am just raising the hare in general that we might very quickly reach a point when this will be necessary.</P>
      <P>I am pleased there is no exclusion specifically written into this legislation about members of local authorities. It had been the bane of our lives in this House &ndash; I can see the Acting Chairman smiling because we have jousted together on this issue down through the years. Whenever new bodies are being created under the aegis of the State, the parliamentary draftsperson has always written in a subsection saying that members of local authorities are excluded, as if they were somehow pariahs in society. I can understand that this is a much more sensitive area and there may be potential conflicts if interest. I am sure the Minister will be able to clarify the point for me. I hope that the vast reservoir of expertise that rests in local authority membership will not be discarded.</P>
      <P>I would love to know how Governments decide who will be appointed to these bodies. It is a bit like a secret society and we never know where these people come from. How are they targeted? How are they identified? Is there a list somewhere to which people can apply? Is there a senior civil servant in some section to whom letters can be sent recommending Joe Bloggs or Mary Smith for a particular position? I do not want it to sound like I am engaging in a bit of whimsy here because it is a very serious issue. It is very important that the Minister has pointed out in the legislation specific areas of law economics, public administration, consumer affairs or business generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Minister will give some indication as to her thinking about the appointment of women <Col N="390" /> to the Competition Authority. It is very important because there seems to have been some slippage in this regard recently. As a strong advocate of women participating in public life generally, and I have the book to prove it &ndash; I have been waiting to say that for years &ndash; I hope some recognition will be given and that suitable women will be appointed to these boards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I want the Minister to consider the whole approach taken in this section bearing in mind the point that Senator Norris makes and what Senator Mooney said about how things will be done in the future. On Second Stage I said that the whole strength of the Competition Authority lies in its independence, both perceived and actual. In answer to Senator Coghlan's point, I believe that the current authority is very strong. I do not know the individuals on it other than the chairman, but it is held in very high regard.</P>
      <P>A key part of its independence is its independence from Government, especially in this country, where competition matters tend so often to have a political edge to them. The Minister will recall that the OECD report was concerned about the question of independence of the authority. There are ways for the Government to exercise control over the Competition Authority. One is through the purse strings, as was witnessed in recent years where the authority was unable to do some of the work it wished to do. We talked about this on Second Stage and I hope we made some progress. The other is through its control over the appointment and dismissal of members of the authority.</P>
      <P>I grant that this section imposes on the Minister the requirement to appoint only people with certain types of relevant experience. However, as far as independence is concerned, that is only a fig leaf. There are two ways to increase the independence of the authority and neither is fully suitable in this case &ndash; in his wording, Senator Norris put his finger on it. That is why I did not table my amendment and I ask the Minister to consider it and give us a response on Report Stage.</P>
      <P>The two ways to distance the Government from the appointment process are by entrenching the appointment, in other words, by making it very difficult for the person to be dismissed, or by delegating the selection process to the Civil Service Commission. It would not be good to entrench the appointment to the same extent as we do with the Ombudsman, for instance, because this is a job that is envisaged as being permanent and it is probably not desirable that members of the Competition Authority would be permanent. Nonetheless, they could serve a second term and the power of the Minister in reappointment is what worries me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the appointment should be handed over to the Civil Service Commission. That body is recognised as being impartial and independent. Using it would give the process the necessary distance from Government that we seek. I know it is a basic principle of Government to cling to all <Col N="391" /> the power it has ever had. However, in this case I ask the Minister to consider if the good of the legislation does not demand a greater degree of independence than is envisaged for this authority if it is to do its work in the way the Bill envisages. The words Senator Norris used &ldquo;open competition&rdquo; are wide enough to suggest that another solution such as that of the Civil Service Commission might solve this.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney spoke about the possibility of the authority coming before an Oireachtas committee in the future as happens in the United States. I am not sure if that is the right solution, but maybe it is. However, the independence of this authority is paramount and we must make sure that no future Government damages that independence.</P>

      <P>I am talking about the executive positions. In all cases I asked for the best possible team of people to be put together so that the best person could be picked. We have been very fortunate. We have terrific people, notwithstanding the level of remuneration, which as we know is not what it should be. I am reluctant to say too much because the chairman is sitting in the press gallery. The current chairman came back from the United States. Although I read what he said about taxis, he was not someone who was familiar to me. We are very privileged that we can get so many good people to serve in public positions for what are inadequate remuneration packages.</P>
      <P>Although I am not in a position to accept the precise wording of Senator Norris's amendment, I accept the principle, and this issue is with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel. I want to keep the option of having part-time authority members for obvious reasons to do with having expertise in particular areas or in cases when a number of members may have conflicts. It is good to have the option to go for part-time authority members from time to time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards gender balance and local authority members, we must remember this is an executive authority. It is not like a governing body, the <Col N="392" /> RTE authority or the board of a semi-State company. The individual members who make up the authority have executive functions. Therefore, there must be a certain level of skill and expertise and the sum total must have a broad range of legal, economic and other expertise. The current group has that and there is one female on it. It would be wrong to have it prescriptive in terms of gender or expertise because that would be too restrictive. If one gets good people and if they have the capacity to be able to see the big picture, one gets the right decisions. In addition to their skills, we want people of integrity who cannot be got at. We have been fortunate in that we have all that together. It is a five year term, it is not for life, although individuals can be reappointed.</P>
    <P>As regards local authority members, I know there will be an election soon and I am sure Senator Norris would like all appointees to be Trinity graduates, Senator Quinn would like some of them to be NUI graduates and Senator Mooney would like them to be local authority members. There would be a complete conflict of interest between being a public representative and an executive member of any authority. It would be an impossible position as there would be a conflict in relation to many decisions. It is not a bad thing in principle that public representatives are represented from time to time in organisations where decisions are made. It would be more relevant if the authority met the local authority members' association from time to time. I do not know if the current chairman has done that. I know seminars are arranged on an annual or quarterly basis. Perhaps there might be a role for the authority to keep in touch with local government members and to inform them in the way it informs Members of the Oireachtas and others about what it does. That could be worth exploring. Perhaps Senator Mooney would like to explore it or, if not, he might like me to do so on his behalf.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for accepting the principle of the amendment. Senator Mooney was slightly ungallant when he raised the question of gender balance and suggested the Minister's slippage was showing. That is not the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Minister bears in mind that one of my other concerns was that there could be political loading. I accept what she said about the usefulness of having people drafted in from time to time to add special expertise, but I would not like to think there was a possibility the jury could be stacked by ministerial appointment with a considerable number of other people. The Minister has spoken generously of the standards of integrity, intelligence and commitment of the people <Col N="393" /> appointed. I pay that compliment back to her. We cannot predict we will always have someone of that calibre in that role. Governments and Ministers change and it is wise for us to ensure there is no temptation for Ministers, if there is an awkward situation, to load in extra people. I hope the Minister bears that in mind in addition to the question of open competition. I thank her for her helpful reply.</P>

      <P>On a point of clarification, I do not wish Senator Norris's comment to pass.

      <P>In page 37, subsection (1), line 33, to delete &ldquo;4 months&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;one month&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment deals with publication of the report and is an attempt to make it more direct and efficient. I am happy the Competition Authority would be capable of publishing it within one month of the end of the financial year. I am sure <Col N="394" /> the Minister, who has good relations with the personnel there, could check that with them. I imagine if they are anything like the people with whom I am familiar, they will be able to do that. They do not need four months &ndash; one month would be sufficient. I recall Senator Quinn, as a businessman, making a similar point about other legislation in the past year or two. I urge the Minister to delete &ldquo;4 months&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;one month&rdquo;. Let us not dally over it, but get it out there as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I do not see the point in pulling the Minister in between the Competition Authority and the Oireachtas and the general public. The report is not for the Minister's unique consumption. The public and the Oireachtas are entitled to have it directly. Ministers in the past, for example, sat on such reports and we had to apply pressure through the Oireachtas to get them. It would be disillusioning for an authority to prepare, draft, publish and submit a report to the Minister and then for it to disappear for a while. It would be better not to involve the Minister in this responsibility and to let the Competition Authority publish its report.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 43 removes the phrase &ldquo;The Minister shall lay&rdquo; and substitutes &ldquo;A copy of such report shall be laid&rdquo;. We can have the report within one month and it does not need to go to the Minister exclusively, although a copy will go to the Minister. It is the responsibility of the authority to ensure that a copy of the report is laid before the Oireachtas. It is not the Minister's responsibility as it happens automatically. That is cleaner, neater and more efficient. I hope the Minister will find it in her heart to agree with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Norris. I have had experience of looking for an RTE report of 1 November the previous year. However, I found that while RTE had sent it to the Minister, it had not been published 11 months into the following year. As soon as the question was asked in the House, it was published within days. I have also had the experience in the past, although not to the extent of my experience in An Post, of setting standards to publish our report as quickly as we could after the end of the financial year and to hand it to the Minister after three months. We had to urge the Minister to publish it because we wanted to set standards.</P>
      <P>The Minister has done well to seek independence from the Competition Authority, but I do not understand why the Competition Authority should not publish it instead of giving it to the Minister to do so. I am not sure what happens in the case of the Ombudsman which is where we want independence. I imagine the Ombudsman publishes his own report. I would be amazed if the Bill to create the Ombudsman's office restricted the Ombudsman from presenting his report to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My other concern is the length of time. If the Competition Authority presents its report within four months, and the Minister is allowed sit on it <Col N="395" /> for four months, it will possibly be eight months before it is published. I am sure that is not the wish of the Competition Authority, and it is certainly not the wish of the Tánaiste. However, a future Minister might be happy to delay it for his or her own reasons. I urge the Tánaiste to accept particularly amendment No. 42, which states:</P>
    <P>In page 37, subsection (1), line 34, to delete &ldquo;make a report to the Minister&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;publish a report&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That would strengthen the independence of the authority.</P>

      <P>In page 37, subsection (1), line 33, to delete &ldquo;four months&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;one month&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>One of the difficulties is that the financial year now coincides with the calendar year. I would hate the chairman of the authority to have his Christmas lunch so indigestible that he could not concentrate on producing the report. Perhaps one month is a bit tight, although it could be less than four months, and I commend that to the Minister.</P>
      <P>As there are so many references to the Minister within the Bill, it is appropriate that the authority should make a report to the Minister. However, that should not preclude its publication. I suggest to Senator Norris that rather than providing for the deletion of &ldquo;make a report to the Minister&rdquo;, the amendment should provide for making a report to the Minister and also publishing it. The degree to which people read these reports that are laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas is open to question, but it is appropriate that the report be laid before the Houses. These three elements are not incompatible. The Minister would receive a report, the report would be published and would also be laid before the Houses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the thrust of what Senators Norris and Quinn are attempting to do here. From the very first day Senator Quinn came into this House he has used a philosophy that he also uses to great effect in his own business. On many occasions I have heard him talk about trying to reduce the amount of time involved in the publication and conveying of reports to the Houses, and I welcome that. I share Senator Dardis's view that there might be a compromise between one month and four months that the Minister might consider &ndash; perhaps two months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should consider, if it is not already in the Bill, providing that the authority publish the report to the Minister and to the Oireachtas, perhaps simultaneously. I yesterday discovered to my surprise, and to that of my colleagues on the Joint Committee on Heritage and the Irish Language, that the Broadcasting Complaints Commission has not laid its annual report before these Houses since 1991. That is almost 11 years. I ask the Minister what sanctions there are for failure to lay such reports, right across the whole panoply of Government, before the <Col N="396" /> Houses of the Oireachtas. The Joint Committee on Heritage and the Irish Language is attempting to find out why the Broadcasting Complaints Commission did not discharge its obligations. It has meant that Members have been unable to debate the detail of the reports since then because they do not have them officially. A situation could equally arise in relation to the reports under current discussion, whereby the reports could not be debated in the Houses of the Oireachtas unless they are legally laid before the Houses.</P>
    <P>On the initial reading of this section I felt it would be sufficient to oblige the Competition Authority to publish the report to the Minister. However, in light of the experience of the Broadcasting Complaints Commission and what has emerged here, perhaps the Minister might take the view that there should be a double locking mechanism. There would be an obligation to convey the report to the Houses of the Oireachtas at the same time as to the Minister.</P>

      <P>These are reasonable amendments. The idea of two months is reasonable and I am prepared to accept, although I know there will be horror behind me, that the reports to the Minister and the Oireachtas be published at the same time. It is reasonable that a Minister with responsibility for a particular area should receive the report. It does enhance the independence of the authority not to have a filter whereby it goes to the Minister and then on to the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>Annual reports at the Cabinet table are large thick books. They are usually printed by the time they go there anyway. It is a formality. A civil servant comes across with hoards of these things in big bags, one for everybody in the audience, plus the secretariat. It is quite a big task, so if we can even improve it at that level it might be no bad thing. The idea of its going to the Minister and the Oireachtas and being published within a two month timeframe is a reasonable compromise.</P>

I recall a situation on 11 September when a spin person in Britain said, &ldquo;Great, this is the day to hang out all the dirty linen because it will <Col N="397" /> be buried.&rdquo;  There is a possibility of a Minister waiting for a glorious opportunity when there is a big story all over the place and discreetly emitting the report, which is therefore buried. This appears, in Britain at least, to be a fairly consistent practice. I gather that a female executive, Jo Moore, had to resign yesterday or the day before precisely on these grounds. It was suggested that she had felt that the death of Princess Margaret would&mdash;</P>

      <P>In page 37, between lines 40 and 41, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) Each year, the authority must attend before the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Enterprise and Small Business, to discuss its performance over the past 12 months and its future work programme for the next 12 months, provided that the Authority shall not be obliged to discuss any detailed matter that is currently under examination, investigation or prosecution by the Authority and shall be mindful of its obligations under section 30 of this Act.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is something to which my learned colleague, Senator Coogan, referred at length in his Second Stage speech. It is important that the authority has some formal interaction with the Oireachtas. While we cannot discuss details of individual prosecutions or investigations it is important that we have some dialogue.</P>
      <P>It would be beneficial from both our perspectives, and I hope the Tánaiste can see some merit in this suggestion. I believe it is in keeping with her own views, as expressed at some length on other amendments.</P>

One of the practicalities has been referred to by Senator Mooney with regard to the Broadcasting Complaints Commission, which it was discovered had not published since 1991. It was recognised only because an issue arose. It should be manda<Col N="398" /> tory to publish and lay before the Houses. A mandatory attendance on an annual basis, perhaps subsequent to the reports being given to the Minister and submitted to the Houses, would be a healthy exercise.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the local authorities, and I know it excluded them. I agree there might be a conflict of interest in that case. However, there are avenues whereby the committee can meet with the General Council of County Councils and LAMA and the AMAI at their annual conferences. If they were to contact these associations and inform them that there may be issues which are relevant to local authorities, they could actually have the debate and discussion there. At that level the local authorities should be satisfied. I am of the opinion, however, that the House should meet the committee on an annual basis not to discuss issues which might be pertinent or contentious at the time, but those which have been addressed.</P>

      <P>Section 43, as it is now drafted, largely restates sections 20 and 21 of the 1991 Act with one notable exception, namely, that the powers of authorised officers have been extended to allow them to enter the homes of directors, <Col N="399" /> managers or other members of staff or undertakings which are under investigation. This new power is in line with proposals of the European Commission on the modernisation of regulation 17 of 1962. However, since the introduction of the 1991 Act, the Competition Authority has made representations to me that there are serious limitations on its search powers and that this has hampered it in enforcing the law. For example, the authority is not authorised to remove original documents, which are an essential element of the required proofs; rather, it must take copies of each document which impedes the efficiency of the search and causes difficulty with such evidence in a criminal trial.</P>
      <P>As stated earlier, I consider some anti-competitive offences analogous to serious fraud offences and I believe the authority should have at its disposal the full range of investigative tools. Senators will be familiar with another item of legislation, the Company Law Enforcement Act, which I introduced recently. Sections of that Act gave the Director of Corporate Enforcement authority to seize original materials, require people to give certain information, such as personal information, and relevant documentary evidence and to use force, if necessary. For example, where files are kept in a locked cabinet and the key is withheld from the authorised officer, force may be necessary to prise open the cabinet. These amendments seek to align the provisions of this section with the powers available to the Director of Corporate Enforcement and to enable the Competition Authority to prosecute offences effectively.</P>

      <P>This is exciting stuff, with doors being kicked open, etc. The Tánaiste made a good case for the inclusion of the use of force, but I assume it will only be employed in extreme and fairly serious circumstances. What is proposed will lend a kind of glamour and excitement to the work of officers of the Competition Authority. I look forward to the dramatisation, for television, of further episodes in this series.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I plead with the Tánaiste to give further consideration to the amendment in question before the Bill is taken in the Dáil because it was designed to take account of situations where large Irish companies, such as the Kerry Group, CRH, Elan, etc, conducting worldwide operations which, in the course of trading, acquire bona fide businesses in other jurisdictions that do not trade in Ireland. As I understand it, these companies are obliged to notify these acquisitions to the Minister under current legislation and will be obliged to notify the Competition Authority once the Bill is enacted. This seems nonsensical and it is difficult to imagine why the authority needs to have any scope for review of a transaction that has no impact on competition in this State. It <Col N="403" /> imposes additional burdens on the companies concerned and places an additional administrative burden on the Competition Authority.</P>
    <P>In the interests of improved competitiveness and increasing efficiencies, it is imperative that the Tánaiste recognises and caters for this situation. I suggest that Irish businesses which operate in an international environment should be free to conduct business without any unnecessary administrative shackles. I notice that&mdash;</P>

It states &ndash; and this supports my point &ndash; there would be no direct impact on competition law here and, therefore, they should not have to notify the Irish competition authority. It goes on to state: &ldquo;We believe this is something which legislation should address, given the high level of foreign direct investment in a large number of multi-nationals based here.&rdquo;  I refer this to the Tánaiste for her careful consideration before she takes the Bill to the Dáil.</P>

      <P>I wish to make a few general comments. We have done a good job in this House, with the co-operation of the Tánaiste, in relation to this Bill. On Second Stage, we indicated areas of concern and brought forward amendments. The Tánaiste has generously accepted the principle of quite a large number of them and has indicated she will go back to the Dáil to improve this Bill. This has demonstrated clearly the relevance of Seanad Éireann and the useful role it can play in the improvement of draft legislation. I am very grateful for the co-operative and helpful attitude displayed by the Tánaiste and her advisers. I believe, as a result of its passage through this House, an improved Bill will make its way to the Dáil to be passed there so that we will have an even better and stronger Competition Authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I add my words to those of Senator Norris, with one exception. I am disappointed that the Bill is going right through to Report Stage today. I sought on the Order of Business &ndash; perhaps I did not word it correctly &ndash; a guarantee that this would not happen today, so that we could have those amendments in this House. I understand the case which has been made that the amendments will be taken in the other House. I understand the urgency of getting this Bill enacted and I would not like wish to delay it in any way, but I regret that Report Stage is being taken on the same day as Committee Stage. As a point of principle, we should never do that. We have time to consider the proposed amendments, <Col N="404" /> particularly as the Tánaiste has considered them and is going to consider them further. It seems a shame that we have not actually concluded in this House.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Tánaiste and her officials who prepared this Bill and I wish the Bill safe passage through the other House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">

      <P>I have some sympathy with Senator Quinn's observations. As a general principle, Report Stage should normally be deferred to a later date. However, I thank the House for its co-operation in this respect because, unless we move the Bill quickly through this House, it will not be possible to have it enacted before the general election. From that point of view, there is an urgency. As I said at Second Stage, the Tánaiste showed, when she was Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, that she was quite amenable to accepting amendments when we discussed a very complex piece of legislation, the Environmental Protection Agency Bill. She has shown similar flexibility today and I am sure, when the Bill returns from the Dáil, the observations made here at Committee Stage will be reflected in the final shape of the Bill. I wish the Bill well in the Dáil and I thank the Tánaiste for the attention she has given the House.</P>

      <P>I thank the House for agreeing to take all Stages today. I was reluctant to take all Stages and it is not something I do lightly. I know it is important that legislation is properly scrutinised in both Houses of the Oireachtas but, as Members understand, we have <Col N="405" /> a very short timeframe for the Government Chief Whip and the Opposition spokespersons to get agreement before the inevitable happens after Easter. It would be a shame if this Bill were to fall, leaving us to re-invent the wheel again, which could take 18 months or perhaps two years to have this Bill enacted. That would be a great pity.</P>
      <P>The process which led to this began in 1996 when the company law review group was established by my predecessor. That group reported some 18 months ago and it has been quite a speedy process since then. I thank Senators and I assure Senator Coghlan that all of those things will be done even though my officials may not be happy campers and will probably tell me how foolish I am, but so be it.</P>
      <P>In relation to Senator Coghlan's amendment which he was unable to move, in theory I would be well disposed towards it but it is not as easily done as it may sound &ndash; for example, the proposed acquisition by Coillte of Balcas, which was outside the State. I would like to do it if I could. The last thing I want is to put another burden on Irish companies acquiring operations abroad. We are looking at the matter to see if we can find a way round the difficulties which the Senator has highlighted.</P>

    <Title>CLÁR Programme: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann commends the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development for his initiative in introducing the CLÁR programme and its emphasis on the areas that have lost the most population in the last 75 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. When he had responsibility for the Gaeltacht, he was genuinely interested in rural development and he addressed various aspects of rural decline. The CLÁR programme is very innovative and emerged from his experience of dealing with Gaeltacht areas and State agencies in terms of the <Col N="406" /> specific small and valuable needs of communities and the aspects of life that are most important to those who live in them; his success in the provision of essential services such as water and sewerage schemes, roads, electricity, telecommunications and transport in such areas; and his firm commitment to equalise some of the difficulties and impediments that have manifested themselves through the years. A key concept of the programme is the Minister of State's desire to allocate moneys and resources generated by our economic success to address deficiencies in these areas. There has been success in these communities which has been recognised by many people along the western seaboard.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State devised CLÁR as a rural version of the RAPID programme, which is part of the national development plan. He has used his experience to co-ordinate Departments which have substantial investment programmes under the NDP and it is an ideal programme to focus on the specific needs in these areas. By targeting them in consultation with State agencies, investment from many sectors is co-ordinated to deal with their needs.</P>
    <P>Areas are selected for investment under the programme on the basis of population decline over the past 75 years. These areas suffered such rapid decline that no State agency or private sector company felt it was feasible or justifiable to make any investment in providing services to meet their needs. The programme helps to provide a focus on these areas, whether at local authority, semi-State or departmental level, and challenges their decline. The decline has manifested itself in 51% of people within the CLÁR programme areas leaving there. The programme aims to alleviate this and support the communities who want to face the task of resolving their economic problems. The CLÁR programme is focused mainly on the BMW region &ndash; 16 areas in Connacht, five areas in Munster and four areas in Leinster.</P>
    <P>There is an amendment to this motion and it may be the view that the initial capital expenditure in the programme is small in national terms. However from my experience and from looking at developments that the Minister has undertaken, I believe within the two year period of this CLÁR programme &ndash; from 2002 to 2003 &ndash; it is a sufficient capital amount to kick start much activity within our local authorities, State bodies and Government Departments. Given the Minister's enthusiasm and the genuine effort he is making within the Departments, I am sure he will get the necessary response from those agencies to work towards and invest in the ongoing support of this programme.</P>
    <P>The programme works through consultation and the Minister has met and consulted with all the community bodies throughout the country, including people in the partnerships and those involved in the communities as well as the different State agencies. He has outlined what the concept is about and how it should work. There has <Col N="407" /> been a positive response from the local authorities and from other agencies covering a wide range of interests from health necessities, in partnership with health boards, to specific needs in roads, water and sewerage and local improvements works which are so important to county councils. It is to be managed by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and in co-operation with the county development boards. Discussions have taken place, priorities have been mapped out and the Minister has made specific announcements in relation to the support he is giving to county councils as well as commitments in other specific areas.</P>
    <P>There is a huge investment programme in group water schemes, which is an acknowledgement of communities' dependency on these schemes, particularly in peripheral regions. The Minister has made specific commitments to local authorities in that context which will alleviate much of the capital cost per household associated with these schemes.</P>
    <P>The CLÁR programme is a great challenge. The &euro;25 million investment is to last two years. In addition to the recent announcements in each local authority area, it has been warmly welcomed by elected representatives from the outset. It is challenging because it opens up a new element of co-operation between the health services, county councils, semi-State bodies and other agencies. I am satisfied that this scheme will create substantial activity and bring specific benefits to communities which are genuinely interested in improving their own conditions. It will revitalise areas that have declined and fallen down economically in comparison to other small towns and communities. This is the first time it has been specifically recognised in a programme and this commitment, which will be reviewed after two years, will show positive progress. The challenge it is presenting will show results and it will be necessary for future Governments to fund it until we have met the criteria of sustainable development and balance.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's commitment to and enthusiasm for this very welcome programme and I am satisfied that he will deliver the results. It will be praised among community groups for its success and will be recognised and funded by future Governments until the criteria have been met.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Senator Chambers in welcoming the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, to debate the CLÁR programme. I formally second the motion as proposed by Senator Chambers. I acknowledge the excellence of the work being done by the Minister of State, as will those who have tabled the amendment. In anticipation of a constructive debate, I suggest that the tabling of that amendment will help to clear up certain issues rather than cause negativity. I was present when the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, came to west Cork to address public meetings and I am aware <Col N="408" /> of the enthusiasm with which his plans and innovative thinking were met. I know this is the case around the country.</P>
      <P>The CLÁR programme was launched in October 2001 and is designed to tackle the problems of population decline and lack of services in rural areas. CLÁR is part of a comprehensive series of measures taken by the Government when it announced it would focus on quality of life issues in rural and urban areas. As part of the agreement with the social partners, the RAPID programme was established to ensure that, in the national development plan, priority would be given to areas of special disadvantage &ndash; both urban and rural. The urban areas have already been selected under the RAPID programme and CLÁR is the rural version of RAPID. It is a specially modelled programme for rural areas and its approach differs radically from RAPID because the problems are different. It is therefore a rural model for a rural setting.</P>
      <P>When we look at the Minister of State and his understanding of the problems of rural Ireland, we can understand from where he is coming and the knowledge he has applied to ensuring the success of this programme. To put an end to the decline of rural communities, CLÁR will fast track the national development plan spending in selected areas. An extra £20 million &ndash; approximately &euro;25 million &ndash; has been allocated to ensure its success. Some 16 areas in 18 local authority areas have been selected for inclusion in the programme nationwide, including Cork and Kerry, Tipperary north and south, Limerick and Clare in Munster, parts of all the counties of Connacht, parts of Cavan, Monaghan and Donegal in Ulster and parts of Westmeath, Longford, Meath and Louth in Leinster. It embraces a wide range of areas in the regions that have suffered. I welcome this programme and compliment the Minister of State on his enlightened approach because nothing had been done up to now.</P>
      <P>These regions were selected on the basis of population decline between 1926 and 1996. It was decided that each area would have to have a minimum population of 4,000 and a maximum of 30,000. The average population loss in these regions was 51% and the total population that will benefit from the programme is approximately 280,000. There is one exception &ndash; the Cooley peninsula &ndash; which has been included because of the difficulties caused by foot and mouth disease.</P>
      <P>The CLÁR programme is an effort to reverse the negative effects of the withdrawal of vital services such as the closure of schools, creameries, Garda stations, etc. Lack of investment is blamed on the decline of the population and the lack of cost benefit, and CLÁR aims to ensure that priority development is given to fast-track areas in greater need.</P>

    <P>The programme is co-ordinated by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development in association with the county development boards. The role of the Department is to facilitate the reprioritisation of developments and, if neces<Col N="409" /> sary, provide supplementary funds to Departments and agencies rather than set up a new agency. The national rural development forum also acts as a monitoring committee.</P>
    <P>CLÁR operates through two basic instruments. It reprioritises investments under the NDP to ensure that these areas get priority of investment under the plan. A sum of £20 million, &euro;25.4 million, has been dedicated over two years, 2002-03 to provide matching funds to Departments and other agencies for special projects, including some not contained in the national development plan, that are urgently required for rural development. The reprioritisation of spending relates to all measures covered under the NDP, including physical as well as social and community infrastructure.</P>
    <P>The bulk of the &euro;25.4 million will be spent on public and community projects such as roads, water, sewerage and infrastructure for the provision of broadband and facilities for the very young. Priority is given to co-funded projects to be undertaken by other State agencies and, in the case of community development, by the local community. Particular consideration will be given to basic social infrastructure such as child care, care of the elderly, etc. If this is not positive thinking to keep rural Ireland alive and to rekindle the communities we represent and that we want to see progressing, I do not know what is.</P>
    <P>Special consideration is also given to economic issues, such as enterprise centres that will result in the employment of those who would otherwise have limited opportunities. The first step is a public consultation process, which was completed by Christmas 2001. Approximately 19 meetings were held nationwide, which were attended by the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Ó Cuív. It is the objective of the county development boards to co-ordinate the social and community initiatives of the programme and the achievements that we look forward to such as roads.</P>
    <P>Road allocations have been issued by the Department of the Environment and Local Government and while these are within the ambit of that Department, they reprioritise the roads in the regions marked out for priority by the CLÁR programme under Government instruction. These structures and services are being brought for the first time to communities that were denied them because of a dwindling population.</P>
    <P>Approximately three weeks ago it was announced that regardless of the distance from the water source, one charge of £900, &euro;1,143, will apply. This was as a result of the public consultative process undertaken. I suggest that the CLÁR programme reflects the determination and commitment of the Government over the past five years to enhance the importance of rural development in the future of Irish society. It is a unique opportunity for those marginalised communities throughout the country to participate in, and <Col N="410" /> benefit from, a programme that aims to make a difference in combating the effects of social exclusion and negativity.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Minister of State should be congratulated for their efforts and we look forward to more announcements in future. I compliment the Minister of State on his work in this area. His heart is in rural Ireland and he has an admirable understanding of rural Ireland. He is to be complimented on the comments he has made both in the House and on national television in standing up for the rights of rural people, such as their right to build a home for themselves in their own areas. In this context there are organisations, some of whom receive State funding, whose roles need to be defined. Does An Taisce reflect the real life of rural Ireland? It seems to be its policy that a local family that has been in an area for hundreds of years can no longer build a house. I compliment the Minister of State on behalf of the country at large for the television debate he conducted on this subject.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnieCaffrey" hpid="Mr. Caffrey Mr. Caffrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>Seanad Éireann deplores the lack of any meaningful initiative in the CLÁR programme and further deplores the fact that the programme is given no funding to make independent initiatives; and condemns the meaningless role given to CLÁR by the Government that only allows it to be an irrelevant add on to existing schemes operating in the declining and disadvantaged regions that in themselves are inadequate or failures.</P>
      <P>While I welcome the Minister of State to the House, I certainly do not welcome his enthusiasm for the CLÁR programme. The funding available for this programme will achieve little or nothing. The aspirations outlined by Senators Callanan and Chambers are very worthwhile aspirations for rural Ireland and I share that aspect of the debate with them. While CLÁR recognises the problems that exist in rural Ireland it provides no adequate funding to remedy those problems which mainly stem from the continual drift from the land over many years.</P>
      <P>In my own area, which has been designated under the CLÁR programme there has been a decline in the population in the region of 50% to 60% since 1926-27. That kind of haemorrhage will continue and this band-aid programme is insufficient to staunch the population flow from rural Ireland. We have a plethora of organisations operating within the State, all funded to varying degrees and none of them operating with any great effectiveness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently the Western Development Commission proposed a massive redevelopment programme worth £850 million for the western region and the Government rejected it. That would have significantly revolutionised western <Col N="411" /> Ireland and is the type of funding that is required. Leader programmes operate in most counties at present and they are also underfunded. I was at the launch of the Leader programme in Mayo a fortnight ago and the type of funding that is available for projects in the region will not make a significant impact on the problems that exist there. While the CLÁR programme recognises the problems, as we all do, there is no serious attempt in this document to solve them and the money available will do virtually nothing when administration and other expenses are taken out of it, even though it should be matched by funding from other State agencies as well.</P>
    <P>In his closing remarks Senator Callanan referred to the problems of planning in rural areas. Unless the Minister tackles those problems in conjunction with the CLÁR initiative and the provision of funds, he will not get anywhere. Ridiculously, it is now the case that rural people cannot get a house. People are the lifeblood of the countryside, people who build houses where their fathers and grandfathers lived. That is disappearing. Our planners and the objections coming from all sources will ensure that we will have no people in rural areas in ten or 20 years' time.</P>
    <P>A recent survey showed that farm sizes are increasing yearly and they will continue to do so because the bigger farmers are buying out the smaller ones who are leaving the countryside. If we believe this programme will reverse that trend or solve the problem, we are fooling ourselves. There are agencies out there already and Corrib gas is coming on stream in Mayo, despite all the objectors who wish it would disappear even deeper under the North Atlantic, never to be seen again. There is also Government inaction in relation to towns in Mayo, the gas pipeline and the transmission line. We talk about CLÁR, but here is a ready-made solution to lack of industrial development along the west coast. It is being ignored. We are talking about a programme which, according to the Minister, is going to revolutionise rural Ireland, but it will do no such thing.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed. I have no faith in the programme as it is totally under-funded. I agree with its aspirations and welcome its recognition of the problems of rural areas, but it does nothing to solve them. I would be delighted to be able to say that this is a comprehensive document which will add substantially to the regeneration of the rural hinterland we all know and love so well, but unless the Minister can go back to his Government and get the funding needed to implement the programme's objectives, we are going nowhere. Senators opposite may secretly admit to the shortfall within the programme.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that the Minister's aims constitute a first step and that he may ultimately get money if he is in Government long enough, but he certainly does not have enough to start the ball rolling. I can see that at first hand in my own county. Quite a substantial area of north west <Col N="412" /> Mayo is designated under this scheme. One possibly substantial benefit is the increased grant for rural water supplies, but the provisions are very limited. In some areas there is no running water in households or on farms. They are not connected to group schemes and wells are out of their reach. A water supply is a major addition to a country house, but it does not constitute exciting living in a countryside that is being denuded of its people.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have to go back to the drawing board. His aspirations are embodied in the CLÁR programme, but he does not have the money to realise them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment proposed by my colleague, Senator Caffrey. There is no need to go over the reasons the amendment is tabled. While I welcome the Minister of State to the House, Senator Caffrey described his programme well when he called it a &ldquo;Band-Aid job&rdquo;. I compliment the Minister of State on what he did for the Gaeltacht areas in his last portfolio. I have no doubt that he means well and that he is trying to put the best face on a project in which he believes, but he is hamstrung by lack of funding.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach is not fully committed to this. He can give &euro;10 million for pier D at Dublin Airport and &euro;1 billion for the Bertie bowl. He has any amount of money for any amount of projects, but when it comes to something like this, with nine or ten counties involved, &euro;20 million is the total provided, &euro;10 million in each of two years.</P>
      <P>To be fair to the Minister of State, he is doing excellent work. In his previous portfolio at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands he took certain stands. I always recall him saying of Gaeltacht roads that he was going to build them out from the Gaeltachts, rather than have them start in the cities and work their way in. He did what he said he would. He is wise enough, has been around for long enough and has been given a good enough grounding in his previous occupation to know how the system works. He worked it to his advantage in his last Department, providing the money while drawing on all the other agencies. He has brought that methodology to this Department and he is now providing some funding while trying to draw on agencies such as the county councils and health boards. The &euro;10 million in each of two years that he has got from the Taoiseach or the Department of Finance is totally inadequate for the job he has in mind. It is a start, but it is not capable of delivering in what are the most disadvantaged areas in the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most depopulated areas in the counties were targeted. A parish can be made up of two or three parts. My own parish is made up of three and two of them are excluded from the programme's provisions. It is hard to explain to those in the other parts of the parish that they are not included in what some of them feel is going to be a bonanza. I cannot see how it will be that and I would like the Minister of State to explain in <Col N="413" /> detail how he feels some of the projects will work out.</P>
    <P>One of the great problems is that no decision has yet been made on how the criteria are to be applied on the ground. Certainly, we at local authority level have not been told. Many have an idea of how it may work, but no one has full knowledge. One of the major disadvantages is that no decision can be made locally. While the council will bring a lot of the projects together, proposals have to be forwarded to the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, which will decide what is to be funded and to what extent.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State is constrained by the number of people working in the Department. From that point of view, he is working at a disadvantage and he is to be complimented on what he is doing with the few resources available to him. Senator Chambers admitted that the funding is small in comparative terms when one considers the size of the counties involved in the scheme.</P>
    <P>To return to the criteria being used, most of the back up funding will come from the local authorities. Health boards and many State agencies are lacking in resources. Therefore, county councils are one of the sources into which the Minister of State hopes to tap. County development boards and local authorities seem to be the local co-ordinating bodies. County development boards are made up of representatives of the health boards, vocational education committees, etc. These boards do not have any great back up secretarial services either and, therefore, I want to know exactly how it will all work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>I will explain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>No doubt the Minister of State will explain, but it is confusing. Maybe I cannot understand it, but I am sure there must be some way of explaining how it will all come together. No doubt the Minister of State is well intentioned and he will try to work with all the areas where funding can be available, but some Senators said that they envisage the programme being used for group water schemes, sewerage schemes, county roads and local road improvement schemes. I want the Minister of State to explain how he envisages a local road improvements scheme being undertaken. Heretofore, the Department of the Environment and Local Government made a contribution to county councils. The county councils took all the schemes on board and notified the people involved. The people paid the local contribution and the work was carried out. Does the Minister of State envisage this programme backing up schemes which will be selected by the county councils? Will the programme take the place of the local contribution? Will there be additional schemes? How does he see it working? I want to know how it will operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of county roads, most local authorities have a programme of works and there is a <Col N="414" /> strict strengthening programme set down by the Department of the Environment and Local Government. All those are contained in a five-year works programme, which is forwarded by the local authority to the Department of the Environment and Local Government, and these are selected annually. Does the Minister of State envisage his Department doing works in addition to those contained in the multi-annual roads programme or does he envisage the funding being used for resurfacing roads, removing dangerous bends, etc? I do not understand how he will tap into the current system because most councils have a programme of works, other than a resurfacing programme, agreed at this stage. From that point of view, therefore, I welcome the funding for local authorities and his initiative, but he can understand where we, as local authority members, are coming from. We are disadvantaged in that we do not know exactly how it will work at local level. I presume the Minister of State has answers, but I second the amendment tabled by Senator Caffrey.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, to the House and congratulate him on the amount of funding he has available to spend on the CLÁR programme. As Senators said, the funding is not enough but people will never be satisfied. No matter what a Minister in his position said, there would never be enough.</P>
      <P>I also compliment him on the way this programme has been devised. It has been developed for less favoured areas in Ireland, which have declining populations and a lack of services. These are exactly the areas we want to protect. We have spoken for a long time about protecting deprived areas in rural Ireland and trying to keep open post offices, schools and, in some cases, Garda stations there. Rural post offices are the key to these less favoured areas and it is important that these remain open. I know the Minister of State is protecting these in a big way.</P>
      <P>Part of my area in County Monaghan is in the CLÁR programme area but there are only small parts of counties involved in it. There has been some confusion about the &euro;25 million the Minister of State has to spend on the programme in 2002 and 2003 and I know he will explain it here. This money is additional funding. It is for roads, group water schemes and sports and leisure complexes. This funding has to be welcomed in these deprived and less favoured areas in the country.</P>
      <P>No matter how small the increase in the funding for roads, it is certainly welcome. I welcome the funding which is available for my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan. It will help to get more road works done in the area. I especially welcome the additional funding for local improvement schemes because these are for lanes where people are living as they did in the past. There is a big waiting list in different parts of the country and any funding the Minister of State puts into these schemes will be of great benefit to the people who live a distance from the road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="415" />Funding will also be available for sports and leisure facilities. We have a young population in Ireland and it is important that we keep them in rural areas and, in particular, in areas where the population is declining. It is our young people who will build houses in these areas and who will increase the population there.</P>
    <P>I hope the CLÁR programme will continue and that it is not a one-off. I hope it is only the beginning of a programme that will benefit different areas throughout the country for which it was intended. I do not want to repeat what has been said, but Senator Chambers outlined the programme well. He also mentioned the group water schemes to which I referred. Group water schemes and sewerage schemes in these areas need help because these places were deprived of water and sewerage facilities. This was due to the fact the population was not sufficiently large to make it practical to supply the services to these areas. It is important facilities such as water and sewerage for less developed areas are included in the CLÁR programme. I congratulate the Minister of State on his presentation and wish him well with the implementation of the programme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JarlathMcDonagh" hpid="Mr. McDonagh Mr. McDonagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Cuirim fáilte Uí Cheallaigh roimh an Aire Stáit. Ní amháin gur comhleacaí é dom san Oireachtas, ba iar-chomhleacaí é dom ar Chomhairle Chondae na Gaillimhe. Rinneamar a lán obair thábhachtach nuair a bhíomar ar an gcomhairle.</P>
      <P>Any enterprise which brings finance and support to areas in the west is welcome. Many aspects of the CLÁR initiative will have a major impact on the areas designated. I am pleased certain areas of Galway have been selected. We understand the area west of Maam Cross is one of those. I know it is very close to the Minister's heart, as it is to mine, being in the Connemara Gaeltacht. There is a shared area with Clare in the Slieve Aughty region taking in Woodford and Derrybrien, and the third area is in the Glenamaddy-Williamstown region in the north of the county. I am happy money is aimed at areas where it is accepted disadvantage exists because of low population, peripherality, etc.</P>
      <P>However, the Minister of State should have improved the programme. It is administered by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and there is no local decision-making. This is unfortunate, especially at a time when the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and others refer to devolution of power and enhancing the role of local authority members. There is no local facilitation. This is detrimental to the programme. There should be closer co-operation and association with county councils and the enterprise boards. Senator Chambers said commitments have been given, and the Minister of State reiterated this. However, there is no statutory role as such. Effectively, the Minister of State is the boss and the scheme is administered from on high.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="416" />The programme has many good aspects but it is different from the RAPID programme. The latter has a local supervisory and implementation role with local implementing teams. As adult education officer with County Galway Vocational Education Committee, I will be involved in the RAPID programme whereas I understand &ndash; the Minister of State may correct me &ndash; there will not be any adult education or VEC input to the CLÁR programme.</P>
    <P>The intention of the programme is laudable and any public spending in this regard has my support. There is a great deal of goodwill towards and interest in participating in the programme. However, there is a danger of robbing Peter to pay Paul. Will the Minister of State clarify whether this funding is additional or is provided at the expense of and at a cost to other areas? There is a great need for clarification and many people await it. The programme, which has many good aspects, may act as an irritatant to other areas outside the designated regions. Will the Minister of State outline his plans for involving local bodies?</P>
    <P>While the people of Connemara are to be commended for the strong groups they have put in place, such as FORUM and other groups which do magnificent work, other areas may not have such strong groups. There is a need in such cases for community facilitators and for a more meaningful role to be given to county councils to assist communities. It is very difficult to find volunteers and there is a great deal of work in making applications. In the case of the RAPID programme, advertisements have been placed seeking skilled officers for designated areas. There is no such provision in the CLÁR programme and no back-up facilities for community groups have been provided.</P>
    <P>The CLÁR programme is not as well structured locally as the RAPID programme and a great deal of tightening up remains to be done. Perhaps when devising the scheme the Minister of State was running out of time and had his eye on other events in May. He would be better advised to make haste slowly, <i>festina lente</i>. The aspirations of the CLÁR programme are good, but the implementation is aspirational. It needs to be strengthened. Otherwise, it will become another white elephant.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has already been commended on his performance on RTE television and I add to that. He is a man of great eloquence and he spoke very well. However, he is a member of Government at a time of a growing belief that Dúchas is inclined to object to every planning application in rural areas. A spatial strategy is coming on stream which, if implemented, will result in the countryside being denuded of population. The outline of the strategy states that all development should take place within speed limits and villages. If this strategy is implemented, there will be no more building in the rural areas of the county the Minister of State and I share and they will be denuded of population and new <Col N="417" /> homes. If Dúchas continues to object to every planning application, with which neither the Minister of State nor I agree, there will no need for planning but perhaps a greater need for CLÁR programmes because rural communities will be devastated.</P>
    <P>While the Minister of State gave an articulate and eloquent performance on television &ndash; some say it was verbose although I do not agree with them &ndash; at the same time the buck stops with the Government. It is fine for the Minister of State to go on a solo run saying he believes this or that, but he should tell the Government to prevent Dúchas from objecting to planning applications, not to implement the spatial strategy and to allocate money for the implementation of the CLÁR programme.</P>
    <P>While the scheme is a good one and its aspirations are commendable, it has not been fully thought out. There should be a stronger role for local authorities and the statutory agencies. It should not be administered from on high because that will prevent it from having an impact.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State when responding to the debate will address some of the problems people have with the programme. I am delighted a debate is being held on this matter in the Seanad because it is an important programme which comes at an important time for rural areas. More work needs to be done on the programme. I hope it will be implemented in a meaningful and effective manner but it needs to be strengthened. Given that the Minister of State is a man of boundless energy, I am sure he will be prepared to take on board some of the proposals in the Fine Gael amendment. If so, the programme will be stronger when implemented in June, regardless of who is in office, and it will contribute to the further development of rural Ireland. However, if the programme is not strengthened, it will not have the desired effect.</P>
    <P>I support the Fine Gael amendment and in doing so I appeal to the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, to strengthen in particular local involvement in the programme. If he does this, the programme may become effective and stronger and he will be remembered for striking a blow for rural Ireland in a very meaningful way. However, if he does not strengthen the programme and make it more locally focused, he will be remembered for introducing just another programme to be included in the plethora of programmes which have recently been brought on stream with little effect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased the Minister is here. I met him on previous occasions at the launch of a specific aspect of CLÁR on the Tipperary-Limerick border. I support the Fine Gael motion because I thought this programme would be a way of dealing with disadvantage in rural areas following on from the RAPID initiative for city areas. People's expectations have been raised and I hope I will not be disappointed when I go back to the people in a particular area in County <Col N="418" /> Limerick from where my mother and her family came. This was a thriving area in the early part of the last century because the village had quite a good infrastructure at the time. Sadly, due to the demographic demise of the area, it is now struggling. All it has, which in a sense is interesting, is a state-of-the-art sports centre for young people seeking prowess in athletics. That is currently the beginning, middle and end of Bilboa. I am pleased the Minister of State included this area, the name of which fascinates people. This is the only area relating to Counties Tipperary and Limerick which has been included. There are many other areas in County Limerick which could also be included, given their demographic decline.</P>
      <P>There was also a very interesting school because it was down to single numbers and one teacher. These numbers have increased but an extension which was promised during the lifetime of this Government did not go ahead. Unfortunately, the school caters for local young people. The Minister of State referred in his launch document to the vicious circle &ndash; if there are no services, there will be no people. If there is to be an increase in the population in the area it will begin and end with the viability of the school. I ask the Minister of State whether an extension to the school can be included within the funding. I am sure his Department alone cannot fund the work. Perhaps there will have to be a contribution from the Department of Education and Science. What we are looking for is the development of the national school in Bilboa which is the only element of infrastructure in the area.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State will be aware that I met the sports group, which will have to establish its priorities for development. It built this centre with its own hands, by and large. It caters for more densely populated villages in the area where children are interested in running. The prowess of one girl led her to take part in the cross-country Olympics not very long ago. The area needs tarmac. A meeting with public representatives and others was held in the new year to establish priorities for communities. Having enumerated the priorities to council officials, the county development board and officials of the Castleconnell electoral area, of which this area is part, the calls from the community, which were very simple, were taken on board. Obviously the issue of a sewerage scheme was not raised.</P>
      <P>We would like industry in the area. However, this would be difficult given that nearby villages with thriving populations do not have industry. There is a local health centre not too far away. We are seeking the reconstruction of a particular section of a road. Senator Burke referred to the Gaeltacht initiative, starting a road at one end and ensuring it is completed at the other end. A particular road which is due for reconstruction under the roads programme will cost &euro;25,000, which the local authority will have to fund. What we are looking for from CLÁR is &euro;15,000 out of the &euro;40,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="419" />There is a difficulty in the Minister of State's initiative. Of course there must be partnership with the agencies, which in this case is Limerick County Council. Given the cutbacks in the Estimates in regard to tertiary roads, I wonder whether we will get the &euro;25,000. It is a specific strategic road.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>A sum of &euro;40,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very small. I am not expecting megabucks. I am being very realistic because this would give people in the area the infrastructure to make their lives comfortable. Obviously the elderly must rely on public transport, which they do not have. When I raised that issue with the Minister of State he said there was another public transport initiative and he would not dabble in that fund. So far that fund has not come to that area and I wonder if it ever will. The contribution of &euro;15,000 would be well worthwhile and it would mean the work could be extended.</P>
      <P>The other bugbear is the local improvement scheme. There is such a list in Limerick County Council which I am sure can be replicated in all county councils throughout the country. Realistically one must wait from 13 to 17 years for these schemes. This is the reality in Limerick County Council where there is such a scheme. There is only one application for the Bilboa area, which is No. 92 on a list of 103. Its chances of receiving funding from Limerick County Council are nil. I pity poor elderly people who are waiting for the implementation of local improvement scheme in their areas. Some of them will probably die before the scheme is implemented.</P>
      <P>The waiting list here is seven years. If we are realistic, it will keep people farming in that area because that is the way of life. The scheme will serve two houses and three farms. If CLÁR funding were made available the contribution required would be just &euro;10,350, which is very little. This is a quality of life issue and if we think in terms of the millions spent and misspent &ndash; reference was made to the &ldquo;Bertie bowl&rdquo;&ndash; on various other projects, it is not too much to ask for the people who stayed in their locality. Possibly when they were younger, they did not look at the bright lights but gave a commitment to their own area. They are still there and I hope their quality of life could be improved by something as simple as funding to the value I mentioned. The Minister, having a mother from that area and knowing how realistic people are, knows they do not look for too much. They know exactly what they want &ndash; basic infrastructural needs plus the survival of a school, which is bringing in more pupils because of the excellent quality of education there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Minister will be able to look back if he is in another Ministry &ndash; not in the next Government because we hope to be in Government &ndash; and see that his contribution to the Bilboa area was that he had had a role in coun<Col N="420" /> tering the demographic demise and reversing the downward population trend by putting a little extra into a school that is the only infrastructural element in a very small community, which the Minister considered, in light of the minute study, deserving of financial input.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghlacadh libh as ucht deis a thabhairt dom cur síos a dhéanamh ar an tionscnamh CLÁR agus an dul chun cinn atá déanta ag an tionscnamh seo ó tosaíodh é.</P>
      <P>Is cuid den scéim RAPID é CLÁR, ach go bhfuil sé dírithe ar cheantracha tuaithe. Nuair a bhí na ceantair á roghnu shíl me gurb é an bealach ab fhearr le tabhairt faoi ná díriú ar na ceantracha is mó a chaill daonra ón mbliain 1926 i leith. Roghnaíodh 15 ceantair ar an mbonn sin agus cuireadh ceantar Cooley i gContae Lú leis ar an mbunús go ndearnadh dístocáil iomlán ar an gceantar sin i rith na géarchéime galar crúb agus béil a bhí ann anuraidh.</P>
      <P>Tá codanna de cheantair ocht n-údarás déag áitiúil i gceist sa gceithre chúige. Is iad na contaetha go bhfuil páirteanna dóibh mar chuid den tionscnamh CLÁR ná: Corcaigh, Ciarraí, An Chlár, Luimneach, Tiobráid Árainn Thuaidh agus Tiobráid Árainn Theas i gCúige Mumhan; páirteanna de chuile Chontae i gCúige Chonnacht; páirt de Thír Chonaill, Cabhán agus Muineachán i gCúige Uladh; agus páirt den Mhí, Iar-Mhí, Longfort agus Contae Lú i gCúige Laighean.</P>
      <P>Cheadaigh an Rialtas an tionscnamh ag deireadh mí Iúil 2001, agus cuireadh &euro;25 milliúin ar fáil thar tréimhse dhá bhliain i mí Meán Fómhair. I rith an Fhómhair, thug mé cuairt ar na ceantair éagsúla agus mhínigh mé an plean agus ag an am céanna bhí cruinnithe agam leis na Ranna Rialtais éagsúla atá ag plé leis an tionscnamh. Ó thús na bliana seo, tá mé i mbun feidhmiú an tionscnaimh CLÁR agus tá dul chun cinn nach beag déanta.</P>
      <P>I am delighted to have an opportunity to address the Seanad and to allay some of the misconceptions that seem abound in respect of the CLÁR programme. I do not know whether some of these misconceptions arise from a disease called &ldquo;electionitis&rdquo; or if they are genuine. As Senators are probably aware, this initiative is part of the RAPID programme that seeks to focus investment and development in areas which, through population decline or high deprivation, tended not to benefit fully from previous national development plans.</P>
      <P>Urban areas were selected on poverty criteria, but I felt that this would be an inappropriate method of selection for rural areas and that the areas most in need of development in rural Ireland were those showing the most population decline. Senators will be aware of the syndrome of services being withdrawn from rural areas because of population decline and of population decline being caused by the withdrawal of services. This is what we are seeking to end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="421" />I commenced work on the CLÁR initiative in March 2001 and the Government approved the scheme in principle in late July 2001. In September 2001, I was given a direct fund of &euro;25 million over two years and an emphasis was placed on reprioritising investment under the national development plan. Some 18 local authority areas are covered by CLÁR &ndash; these were mentioned by Senators. The total population of the CLÁR area is about 285,000 people. I attended 18 public meetings in CLÁR areas to explain the initiative during the autumn. I concluded these meetings in December. These meetings were very well attended and there was great enthusiasm for the lack of bureaucracy involved or need to go round in circles, creating more plans and analysis, and the fact that we were just getting on with the job that people needed done.</P>
    <P>The communities were very forthright at the meetings and we had very open question and answer sessions. I certainly did not curtail any suggestions or debate from the floor. I found that the communities were in tune with my thinking. They are fed up with plans and more studies. They just want things put right. Also, at that time, I had a plenary session with all the other Government Departments dealing with these areas. I also had a series of bilateral meetings to put schemes together. It is important to note that CLÁR is not a new agency. There is enough duplication and different bodies doing the same thing. Therefore, all the schemes in which I am involved must be in line fully with the policies and programmes of the various line Departments.</P>
    <P>There are three elements to CLÁR. Rural proofing is the first. One of the most frequently mentioned points in this context pertained to community employment schemes. If they are not rural-friendly, we go to the line Department and talk to it about the problem. Planning was one issue we mentioned and I will say more about that later. That is what rural proofing is about.</P>
    <P>Reprioritisation under the national development plan is the second element. This is what I call the invisible money. The idea is that one tries to reprioritise and frontload the developments towards the CLÁR areas. We know the tendency up to now has been to get investment to follow development. Therefore, growing cities and towns tended to get money because they were growing, but because they were getting the money they continued to grow. The areas that were dying did not get money. The whole idea of CLÁR is to try shift the money back into these areas.</P>
    <P>The third element concerns the direct fund. Everyone is focusing on the direct fund because it is the visible part of the scheme. In view of comments made by Deputies and others, it is very important to stress the methodology being used in the expenditure of the direct fund of &euro;25,400,000, which is available to me over a two year period. I have heard at least two Opposition Deputies describe this as a slush fund. They also made complaints that there are no application <Col N="422" /> forms available for communities. I am disappointed that they have not taken the time to find out how this programme will work and why no application forms are needed. The reason is that I am operating through the existing agencies and not setting up a parallel system, thus not creating duplication and unnecessary bureaucracy. If I learned one thing in my long years as a community development officer and co-operative manager &ndash; I worked both voluntarily and professionally in rural development &ndash; it is that the more complication and agencies that exist, the harder it is for the people on the ground.</P>
    <P>Earlier, a Senator spoke of providing funding to community groups to try access the system. We could also do a lot to make the system more accessible to people without having to spend millions of pounds on employing people to do so. At the moment, we have a chaotic system that even I find difficult to keep up with at times.</P>
    <P>I will try to outline briefly the steps I have taken. It is no good dealing with the big issues if we still have houses in this country with no roads or water mains leading to them. Anybody who tells me that addressing the latter issue is not dealing with rural deprivation is talking poppycock because they are not talking about deprivation. A person without a decent water supply and a decent road to their house is highly deprived. We do not need sociologists to tell us that. The people tell one that themselves because the first thing they mention is: &ldquo;Minister, I do not have a road&rdquo; or &ldquo;Minister, I do not have water. Forget about everything else until I have a road and water &ndash; I do not want anything else.&rdquo;  I empathise very much with what Senator Jackman said in that regard.</P>
    <P>There are two elements to the roads programme, the first of which was made public, namely that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, when making a decision on the roads programme this year, was able to finance 93% of the projects from the CLÁR areas proposed to him. Some counties have questioned this but the reason they got their figures wrong was because some counties insist on applying for more than they want. If they want &euro;4 million, they apply for &euro;8 million. Then it has to be cut back to &euro;4 million. Based on the final submissions made by the counties in line with the request from the Department of the Environment and Local Government, I am assured that 93% of the applications for roads under the non-national, EU co-financed funding were funded this year. The average for the rest of the country is 75%. It is calculated that this is worth &euro;4 million extra to the CLÁR areas.</P>
    <P>However we have gone further. We have put together a special fund of &euro;4 million, &euro;2 million coming from the CLÁR programme and &euro;2 million which the Minister for the Environment and Local Government held back when he was giving out the rest of the money. I have written to the local authorities and have asked them to submit proposals. I have asked Limerick County Council <Col N="423" /> for a proposal for 100% funding on &euro;40,000 this year. That should solve Senator Jackman's problem.</P>
    <P>There are some Senators here from County Mayo. I have asked the local authorities there for proposals to spend &euro;650,000 and if they are not telling the Senators what I am asking for, it is about time they did. This is extra money and if the people in Mayo cannot spend it there, they should send it back to Galway because Senator Jarlath McDonagh and I will spend it there without a problem. When people are crying out for money, &euro;650,000 over and above all the other increases should make a significant impression in these areas in Mayo.</P>
    <P>Coillte Teoranta has also agreed to make &euro;500,000 available. By shopping around, my &euro;2 million has become &euro;4.5 million which of course shows that my contention was always well based. The initial funding of &euro;12.5 million will attract huge amounts of extra funding if the homework is done properly. The problem in these areas was that unlike bigger growing areas, they could not provide the added element to attract additional money. There is now &euro;4.5 million and I am waiting for specific projects to be agreed between Coillte and the local authorities to be presented to me so that they can commence.</P>
    <P>Many of the Senators are also members of local authorities. I call on those Senators to ask their local authorities to do two simple things for me. First, they should reply quickly to simple letters we send looking for information because the quicker we get it the quicker we will answer. Second, if I write asking for proposals for &euro;600,000, &euro;300,000 or &euro;40,000 they should send back proposals for whatever amount I ask, not twice or three times that. The letters specify that if they ask for more we will write back and ask them to cut it down, which leaves the choice with the local authorities.</P>
    <P>Many Senators have rightly mentioned LIS roads and from my travels around the country I have found this to be one of the biggest issues raised. There are still people who do not enjoy the luxury of a road to their house. I have allocated considerable money to try to deal with this problem. Subject to final approval from my colleague in the Department of the Environment and Local Government &ndash; and there will be no problem with that &ndash; for every &euro;2 spent by a local authority on local improvement schemes in a CLÁR area, I will provide another &euro;1 for more roads in that area. If a council thinks I will fund all the roads in the CLÁR area and decides to put all its LIS money into the non-CLÁR areas, it will receive nothing from me.</P>
    <P>I am not asking them to make a big exception for the CLÁR areas, but if they treat them fairly and spend the money as they would have done throughout the county including the CLÁR area, then having determined how much will be spent in the CLÁR area, which could be &euro;100,000 in a big county, they will receive &euro;50,000 to spend on <Col N="424" /> even more roads. In that way we will begin to tackle the huge waiting list of roads particularly in isolated rural areas. I do not select the roads. This will be done by the normal systems in the local authorities. I see no point in asking CDBs, vocational education committees, health boards or anybody else to select LIS roads.</P>
    <P>As regards water and sewerage, the big things happen and the small things never happen. The waste water directives caused huge problems for small villages and towns because they meant that all the big schemes covering an area with a population greater than a certain number had to be done first to be in compliance. That meant development in many small villages and towns was stunted due to the lack of waste water facilities in particular. Furthermore, a huge amount of water schemes are needed in these areas, which cost £100,000 or £200,000. These are not getting done because the local authority claims not to have the money.</P>
    <P>For example, County Mayo gets £700,000 for small water and sewerage schemes every year. For every &euro;1 spent in a CLÁR area, I will give another &euro;1. If an authority spends &euro;400,000 in a CLÁR area this year, it will receive another &euro;400,000 and will have &euro;800,000 to spend. What could be fairer? I have to devise systems that stop the local authorities from being tempted to skim the money back on a no gain system. I must have a system that encourages them to take the money out to the edges. This is quite a clever device to do so. I am leaving it to the local authorities to make the decision; I am not going to make it for them.</P>
    <P>The group water scheme was probably one of the most cost effective steps ever taken. These are isolated areas with low population density and houses scattered away from each other. We all know the syndrome where the unit cost per house is bigger because they are in isolated areas. It is unfair to ask people to pay £2,000 to £4,000 per house for the provision of a basic commodity like water. When we asked the county councils about the problem, they said a few million pounds would solve the problem nationally. A number of schemes were costing more than £6,000 or &euro;7,618 and only a modest top up was needed.</P>
    <P>Under the CLÁR programme it is achievable for all of these to be wiped out within five years. The current scheme allows for a maximum grant of 85% of &euro;7,618. The balance of &euro;1,142 is then made up by the householder. The problem was that for more expensive schemes, the householder had to pay the full amount above &euro;6,476. To give an example in old-fashioned pounds, if a scheme cost £7,000 per house, the amount to be paid by the householder was £1,900, which is more than double what he would have to pay if the scheme was only £6,000 per house.</P>
    <P>Subject to the local authority putting the scheme on a list to which it will allocate its normal money and provided it decides it is good value and the best way to provide these people <Col N="425" /> with water &ndash; again no dictation from the top &ndash; it can make a similar claim and we will provide a 100% top up. This means that no householder will pay more than &euro;1,142 or £900 for the provision of water. That is a demand led scheme. It is up to the local authorities to choose the schemes in their areas. In the past these schemes were always left out because it was not possible to get the local contribution. Now it will be possible provided the local people are willing to pay the £900 and the local authority is willing to give the appropriate authority to the scheme.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that some counties have already seen the benefit of this and are moving very rapidly to cash in. There are some schemes where the top up will be only &euro;200 or &euro;300, but it still means a 40% or 50% saving for the householder.</P>
    <P>I have had discussions with Leader companies and the county councils about village renewal to provide car parks at heritage sites, etc. We have run into technical difficulties due to European rules which we are trying to overcome. I hope to make an announcement about that in the near future. There have been some discussions about national roads, which is a privatisation issue. I cannot say what the outcome will be.</P>
    <P>Module 2 relates to industry, telecommunications, gas, enterprise, technology, business units and public transport. I am in ongoing discussions with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment about telecommunications, electricity, gas and public transport as part of CLÁR. It is better to deal with this issue centrally. The methodology we are using at present is simple. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has sought bids for the provision of telecommunications. There are many bids for carriers, for example, from Mayo County Council as well as from Roscommon County Council and Galway County Council which have submitted a joint bid. The Department of Public Enterprise will be able to make a decision on those bids and it will fund it. However, some of the smaller parts may not be funded. When it makes its decision, it will then discuss with us those to which we can apply our money in the CLÁR areas.</P>
    <P>Everyone is talking about the problem with telecommunications and the fact that there are fibres running here and there. The last mile is a difficulty. I will give the House an example. One industry in Mayo approached me about the absence of a point of presence. It would cost the company an extra £60,000 in telecommunications charges because it did not have a point of presence near it. A point of presence costs £250,000. That is what I want to concentrate on. If it saves an industry £60,000 a year, it is a good return on capital. We are doing that through a sensible system, while piggybacking on the good work being done by the Department of Public Enterprise. The money must be spent in the CLÁR areas, not in Galway city, Castlebar or Dublin.</P>
    <P>I am also looking at the provision of DSL. I will explain what that is for those who, like myself, do not understand it. DSL is an upmarket version of <Col N="426" /> ISDN, which is more powerful and has a greater range. It would be a huge boost to areas, such as Ballycastle in County Mayo and Clonbur in County Galway, which do not need fibre optics but need ISDN or its equivalent. We are in discussions about those matters and we hope to make a decision in the near future.</P>
    <P>I will consider the issue of the provision of the gas line to places, such as Belmullet, and airstrips, such as the Clifden airstrip and Knock Airport, and the provision of funding. As regards enterprise, technology and business units, discussions are ongoing with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. It is drawing up a new programme and we cannot make a decision or get involved until it rolls that out. I must work at the same pace as the Department.</P>
    <P>The community and social aspect is important. Ongoing discussions are taking place with the Department of Health and Children, the Department of Education and Science and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform on the provision of a programme for the development of necessary services in rural areas. We will do two things in the health area. We are working with the Department of Health and Children and I hope to be able to write to the health boards about it in the near future. We are working with small capital works programmes in rural areas, such as health centres, which are low on the priority list because there is not a population basis, and day care centres, which need funding but which do not seem to get to the top of the list. Members from Mayo will remember the Inishturk syndrome. It would not have got a health centre were it not for the 25% funding from the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, which moved it to the top of the list.</P>
    <P>Similarly, we are generating programmes to look at these issues and to roll out small but strategic projects which are important to local communities, which tend to be small, and where a small amount of money can bring big dividends. I am also looking at other strategic health initiatives which I hope the Department of Health and Children will propose. I have indicated budget levels as they are co-funded projects. Not only am I using my £1, but I am also using pounds from other Departments which would not have gone into such areas before. Some programmes have a multiplication factor of six, while others have a multiplication factor of two. The multiplication factor is three or four in terms of bringing money to these areas. That means the programme will be worth approximately &euro;50 million a year to the CLÁR areas in extra investment. That is &euro;250 million over five years. That means the &euro;850 million being sought by the Western Development Commission is only three times more than that already lined up in CLÁR for these areas, which are the most peripheral areas of the Western Development Commission.</P>
    <P>As regards education, our role is not to look after mainstream school funding. That is a role <Col N="427" /> for the Department of Education and Science to which a lot of money has been given by the Government. It has provided four times more money than was provided by the previous Government. There is another role in education, such as outreach third level education, PLC and VTOS courses. I will put capital funding in that direction. If a secondary school is amalgamated, the old building should be refurbished as an outreach university or to enable PLC or VTOS courses to begin. I compliment the people in the BMW region for setting up Líonra with which we have had good discussions.</P>
    <P>I am also in discussions with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform about the refurbishment of rural Garda stations. Communities want Garda stations kept in good repair to make them attractive for gardaí to work in because they believe a Garda presence in communities is important.</P>
    <P>As regards the islands, there is no point reinventing the wheel. I know the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands is great because I worked there. It is staffed by great civil servants who know their jobs. Instead of sending other civil servants out to do the same job, I have given the Department an allocation of &euro;100,000 to choose the projects in the CLÁR islands. It will nominate them and I will endorse their package.</P>
    <P>If anything gives me a headache at community meetings it is the question of funding for community and sports facilities. This issue was raised at all the meetings, but it is almost intractable because there are a multiplicity of agencies dealing with it. Applicants must apply to seven, eight or nine different agencies to fund one small community centre. Examples of these are IFI, INTERREG, the peace and reconciliation fund, sports capital programmes, the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, county councils, enterprise boards and Leader companies. They all seem to be short of money. I quickly solved that problem in the Gaeltacht. I said we would give a good grant and that, combined with local contributions, would mean the job would be done. It made it easy because applicants only had to go to one agency to get one good grant. It is all the State's money, it is not European money. Why do we have to have nine agencies employing civil servants to write nine cheques? It does not make sense.</P>
    <P>I met my colleague, the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, this evening. We are trying to work out a simple system which does not create more bureaucracy and another agency to tease the people but which does something to help them. I hope to be able to make an announcement about this in the near future. I am sure that if I proceed in the way we want to, the community will be pleased with the approach which will be simple and effective.</P>
    <P>Most of the money I am talking about is capital because the national development plan is focused on capital. However, my experience is that if one <Col N="428" /> gets capital development, the current money will flow. If I build a day care centre or a nursing home unit, I will get the money to run it. The lack of capital facilities in these areas often inhibits current money. I have not seen enterprise units lying idle even on the tops of mountains where they were built by Údarás na Gaeltachta. The doubting Thomases laughed, but those units were filled and they provided jobs.</P>
    <P>I would hope that, with the indulgence of the Chair, I could address some further issues. Regarding the administration of this programme, I currently have two civil servants working on it on a day-to-day basis. I have asked for a total staff complement of five. I believe this is a sufficient number because I am getting everybody else to do the work &ndash; the local authority looks after the road works schemes&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will try to be very brief. The reason for the effectiveness of CLÁR is that it piggybacks on every other agency, using their existing systems. This makes it an efficient programme. The beauty of the scheme is that I am not the one who makes the decisions &ndash; the individual county councils have that responsibility. I do not know about the road that Senator Jackman has mentioned, but I have no doubt that Limerick County Council will know about it in due course. It is the people at the lowest level of agency who are making the decisions. As Minister, all I do is allocate the money and set the parameters within which such decisions can be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not one euro of the &euro;12.5 million allocated to this scheme has been spent on administration. The Department's administrative budget covers that. Every last penny of the money goes toward delivery on the ground. I pride myself on not having set up more groups to run this scheme. It is not for me to criticise urban RAPID, but I would be less than honest if I did not say I am proud of the fact that we are already in the position of rolling out the CLÁR schemes, while RAPID has only just been announced. The water, road and health schemes are under way already, and it is a huge job to do this across nine or ten Departments when one has to secure the agreement of each of the players involved. In fairness to the Departments, they have understood our needs, and I have no doubt that, by the end of this year, <Col N="429" /> the Senators who expressed doubts about CLÁR today will have changed their minds on the matter when they see how well it works.</P>
    <P>Members have doubted me in the past, when I was Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. They have since had to accept that big things happened in that area because the same leverage system of money was used. I have no doubt that such a system is going to work in the case of CLÁR.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be at loggerheads with the Western Development Commission&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>The Western Development Commission was not turned down by the Taoiseach. We studied each project it proposed and produced a detailed response on each one, telling it how it was progressing. Each one of the projects the commission has referred to is progressing. For example, a strategy group has been set up to examine the opening of railway lines, including the one that the commission was talking about. Similarly, action is being taken on various road schemes. I asked the Western Development Commission to give me its views on whether the proposed gasline should run from Claremorris to Sligo, or whether it should be run across the Ox Mountains. I await its reply with interest; I know which route I favour.</P>
      <P>As highlighted by An Bord Pleanála, the main problem with rural planning is sustainable development guidelines. These guidelines, introduced by the previous Government in April 1997, stated that what they termed &ldquo;urban-generated housing&rdquo;&ndash; that is, houses built by people who did not work the land &ndash; should not be permitted in rural Ireland. I assure the Senators that, as part of the process for the spatial strategy, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development has been consulted and we have made a very strong case for this policy to be changed. Those people who have a genuine connection with the countryside should be allowed to settle there. I will wait until the spatial strategy is published before I make any judgment on it. I reiterate that existing planning problems are the result of action taken by the previous Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dúchas has become the whipping boy of everybody who seeks to blame their planning difficulties on people other than themselves. It amazes me that local authority members blame Dúchas when planning permission is refused. When I worked in that Department, I used to check how many planning objections per month were being lodged with Galway County Council. Out of the 6,000 applications made annually, fewer than one per month was objected to by Dúchas, and most of these objections were conditional. In my time at that Department, not one house for a family was ever refused planning permission. Where the application satisfied all other regulations, Dúchas always negotiated a compromise to allow the pro<Col N="430" /> ject to go ahead. I understand that is the situation nationally. Therefore, any planning difficulties that exist are with An Bord Pleanála and the local authorities. Dúchas is not to blame.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief, because having listened to the Minister for the last half an hour, I feel profoundly sorry for him in the task that he has. He certainly seems to have trouble in all Departments. The CLÁR programme is a worthwhile one in that it is trying to co-ordinate activities between various Departments and local authorities. Such co-ordination has been a grave difficulty in the past.</P>
      <P>I want to focus on the issue of rural water supply. In Athenry recently, a very serious issue arose when the drinking water supply there was polluted. I am not sure whether or not the cause of this pollution has been established, but it did not just involve bacteria; chemicals injurious to human health were also present in the supply.</P>
      <P>I sometimes think that we do not take these issues seriously. Last year, as I am sure the Minister will remember because he is a very well-read man, in the eastern part of Canada a small municipal water supply was polluted with cow manure containing an organism called Cryptosporidium, and this caused the deaths of seven people. When we have these sorts of problems, we are inclined to think of them as a cosmetic issue, but there are very serious health implications involved.</P>
      <P>While I applaud the Minister's efforts to bring proper drinking water supplies to all houses, a great deal of effort has to be put into encouraging and teaching people about the correct maintenance of these supplies. Sometimes I do not think people understand that the 41% of rural water schemes which are polluted by human and animal faeces are polluted from a source that is in close proximity to the scheme. When I was in Africa, I was invited to the opening of a rural water scheme project which Irish agencies had been involved in setting up. I asked the people there how often they intended to test the water quality and they expressed shock that such a thing was necessary. I often think that I would get much the same response if I asked similar questions at Irish rural water schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A big effort has to be made to encourage people to maintain these schemes more effectively. I have read reports issued by the Environmental Protection Agency which suggest that, frequently, very little effort is put in to the maintenance of these schemes. I would hope that when the Minister, quite rightly, allocates money for the provision of these schemes, questions will be asked regarding who is going to take control of the testing of the water supply to ensure its safety. I know the Minister is concerned about planning being refused for single houses, but we must be extraordinarily careful that the sewage treatment schemes which are put into these houses are not a source of pollution. It might well be better to aim for having three or four houses <Col N="431" /> in any new development, in order that a more sophisticated scheme could be put in place. I accept that this is not the sort of scenario the Minister of State likes to envisage.</P>

      <P>I raised with the Department of the Environment and Local Government the possibility of giving an extra grant in cases where a proprietary treatment plant is constructed in conjunction with a house. I was asked if I was trying to keep the companies going and informed that a septic tank, properly constructed, is a perfectly efficient way of disposing of effluent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>We must also remember that the spreading of slurry has posed major problems. Groundwater in this country is frequently polluted as a result of the spreading of slurry. This leads to particular difficulties in the west where there is karst limestone and an absence of a good soil base through which water can be filtered. The natural filtration offered by soil is excellent. However, the spreading of slurry in areas where there is heavy rain means that it will filter down into the groundwater and make its way into people's drinking water. In addition to providing money, the Minister of State must try to engender a sense of responsibility among those who are in charge of local schemes. Someone must take responsibility for the testing of water.</P>
      <P>Another area to which I wish to refer is health &ndash; the Minister of State did not say much about it. I support the establishment of day centres and other initiatives the Minister of State is trying to get off the ground. He may not know it, but the Department of Health and Children is encountering serious difficulties in terms of the flight of doctors from rural areas. A huge number of GMS posts are available in rural areas but no applications are being made in respect of them. This is a serious matter because people will not be encouraged to remain in such areas unless they can be sure of access to primary medical care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of good suggestions were made earlier about information technology. It is important that rural health centres are linked, through information technology, to small adjacent hospitals and major medical centres. For example, enormous developments in terms of diagnosis could be made in the west through the linking of medical bases there with medical centres in Galway. We must ensure that people have access to these sorts of facilities. In addition, and with the exception of the enormously rich, medical cards should be given to everyone in these areas. I am sure the Minister of State has it in his power to ensure that this happens because <Col N="432" /> it will be of major assistance to people living in these areas.</P>
    <P>I strongly commend the Minister of State for trying to do something about sport. It is sad to think that people who live in rural areas have less chance of becoming involved in sport than those who live in the suburbs of Dublin.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House agus déanaim comhgairdeas leis as ucht tionscnamh CLÁR a chur ar bun. Tá an-chuimhne againn ar obair an Aire Stáit nuair a bhí sé sa Roinn Ealaíon, Oidhreachta, Gaeltachta agus Oileán.</P>
      <P>We witnessed what the Minister of State achieved when he served in the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. I will refer later to a number of projects that were initiated when he was there.</P>
      <P>When he announced the CLÁR programme, I thought it was merely a dream. I assure him, however, on foot of the report the Donegal County Enterprise Board presented to us at our area meeting on Friday last, that much can be achieved in the towns and villages included in the programme. I agree with Senator Henry's comments about the GMS and the flight of doctors from rural areas. The NoWDOC system operates in north west Donegal and people are clamouring for its expansion to south east Donegal. However, the major difficulty with the system is trying to attract doctors into rural areas such as west Donegal.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to a number of points raised by the Minister of State, particularly those relating to roads. We have, for the first time, received a report from Donegal County Council's engineers on the large number of roads in need of upgrading and repair in the county. Even with the funding we received under the non-national roads programme, many roads remain in poor condition. However, that is a matter for another day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to the LIS programme and the increases that should be available under it this year. The Minister of State represents a rural constituency which is also represented by the Minister of State with responsibility for local improvement schemes. In my opinion, the Department of the Environment and Local Government made a major blunder last year by tightening up the schemes in relation to land holdings on roads. The Minister of State is aware that, with the exception of keeping mountain sheep in the west of the county, it is difficult to be involved in agriculture in Donegal. I plead with the Minister of State to consult his colleague to see if the scheme can be loosened up, particularly in relation to the many private roads in County Donegal. The Minister of State referred to letting families have roads which lead up to their houses. I am not seeking the provision of tarmacadam roads around these people's houses, but the provision of roads leading to those houses. If there are not <Col N="433" /> two farm holdings on a road, it is disqualified by Donegal County Council. I ask the Minister of State to consult the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy, about this matter.</P>
    <P>A number of major sewerage schemes have been put in place in south west Donegal in the past two to three years and I hope that others at Dungloe and Glenties will enter the planning and design phase soon. However, in my electoral area alone, there is a need for in the region of 12 or 13 sewerage schemes for small villages and towns. The cost of this would be approximately £13 million. Many of these towns and villages &ndash; Loughanure, Crolly, Rannafast, Fintown, Arranmore, Kincasslagh, Maghery, Doochary and Lettermacaward &ndash; are situated in Gaeltacht areas. This shows that the west and, in particular, Gaeltacht areas were neglected by successive Governments before this Administration took office.</P>
    <P>I make a special plea to the Minister of State in respect of the scheme for Gortahork, a town of reasonable size with which he is familiar. He and I will have long left politics by the time Department of the Environment and Local Government schemes reach Gortahork, which is thirty-seventh on the priority needs list of Donegal County Council. If any scheme is chosen for inclusion on the CLÁR programme, I hope it will be one for Gortahork.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other matters to which I wish to refer. We put a great deal of pressure on the Minister of State when he was at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands in relation to village renewal schemes. I am sure Donegal County Council has identified a total cost for its needs and I am sure it will be obliged to break it down on an annual basis. There are many small towns and villages which have not yet received funding under the renewal schemes to which I refer and I hope the CLÁR programme will address this point.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to one scheme that has been included by Donegal County Council. In the past, the council built housing schemes without utilising any design or landscaping plans and merely ran roads into these schemes. The residents of three housing estates in Dungloe town have been very active in the past three or four years in terms of having their estates upgraded. I tried continually to obtain funding from Donegal County Council for the maintenance of the housing schemes in question. In its plan it has included a figure of £10,000 for landscaping and upgrading. We made an application to the Ireland Fund for funding of £20,000 but, unfortunately, it did not succeed. If we could obtain the £10,000 being sought by the council, it would be a step forward.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister of State well. I do not like to offend Senator Caffrey, but I hope the Mini<Col N="434" /> ster of State will be returned to the position he holds at present. He has made a great start. It is a question now of consolidating and obtaining funding. I hope that, for the first time, the west and the other areas that have been eligible under the CLÁR programme will receive the recognition and funding they need to help them make the countryside more attractive to those who have left and may return and to future generations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his explanation of the CLÁR programme. In very simple terms, he outlined how he is dealing with the programme and the tremendous progress that has been made with it in a very short period. He has had experience of dealing with State agencies as the Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. They have been flexible and amenable to him and they have experience of co-funding in relation to other projects. That is very welcome.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State is now dealing with other areas which touch on educational and health issues. The recreational aspect is very important and I welcome his developments in collaboration with the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, in that regard. His financial commitment to the local authorities is very positive and provides a great incentive. I have no doubt that it will bring substantial results to the people concerned.</P>
      <P>Some local authorities have a stated policy, as is the case in County Mayo, of supporting the principle that, where there are at least two householders on a road who need transportation and access, they will have tarred roads. We have received substantial funding from the Department of the Environment and Local Government for local improvement schemes. With the support of the Minister of State, I believe we can achieve our targets over a reasonable period. The overall thrust and effectiveness of the programme is excellent and has been very well explained to the House tonight. While it is not for me to speak on behalf of my colleagues on the other side of the House, I believe they fully understand the Minister of State's commitment to this programme. I have no doubt, on the basis of the results of the programme, that the Government will provide further financial support in future.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the work of the Minister of State and the explanation of the programme he has given, I suggest the Opposition considers withdrawing the amendment to the motion. On the basis of the Minister of State's proven record at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands and on the strength of the programme he has outlined, I assure the House that it will be delivered effectively and will make a positive contribution to rural Ireland.</P>

      <P>This is a Seanad Bill which has been amended by the Dáil. In accordance with Standing Order 103, it is deemed to have passed its First, Second and Third Stages in the Seanad and is placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage. On the question &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration&rdquo;, the Minister may explain the purpose of the amendments made by the Dáil. This is looked upon as the report of the Dáil amendments to the Seanad. The only matters, therefore, which may be discussed are the amendments made by the Dáil. For Senators' convenience, I have arranged for the printing and circulation of the amendments. Senators may speak only once on Report Stage.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>My apologies if we have held up proceedings, but there was a vote in the other House. At the outset, I express my gratitude to the Cathaoirleach and the House for being able to take this Bill so soon after its passage through the Dáil. I have made arrangements for copies of this statement to be distributed to Senators so I will be as brief as possible.</P>
      <P>I know from our earlier discussion in this House that Senators share my concern to have the Bill enacted as soon as possible so that the new authority can begin its important work. For ease of consideration, I will discuss some of the amendments in a number of groupings.</P>
      <P>The purpose of amendment No. 1 is to amend the Long Title of the Bill to take account of the fact that amendments were made in Dáil Éireann which necessitated that change, namely, amendments to the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999, and the Gas Act, 1976. There are a number of amendments which are purely technical in nature. In this category, I place amendments Nos. 2 to 4, inclusive, 10 to 12, inclusive, 16, 17 and 20.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 5 provides for the authority to have the power to establish subsidiaries in order for some of its functions to be performed through a subsidiary, if it so desires. It will be a valuable instrument for the authority in the exercise of its functions and could allow it to establish subsidiaries that could support the development of new services in the marketplace or realise the value of intellectual property accruing from research expenditure. It could establish a new activity of a regulatory, certification or data holding kind, where there is a formal need to establish it on a stand-alone basis because of possible conflicts of interest with any promotional activity such as trading schemes and verification schemes. While the current centre has no immediate plans to establish subsidiaries upon its establishment as the new authority, this section will allow them the freedom to delegate functions, as the need arises in the future, subject to the agreement of the Minister and the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>Section 7 of the Bill, as passed by this House, provides for possible assignment of additional functions related to the production, supply, including security of supply, and use of energy. However, during the course of the debate in this House, some speakers expressed the view that the provision was too wide in scope and could, if a plethora of additional functions were given to the authority, dilute its main focus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After further consultations with interested parties, including the Commission for Electricity Regulation, I formed the view that such a precise <Col N="437" /> reference to security of supply in this Bill would be likely to lead to legislative confusion in so far as the mandates of the Commission for Electricity Regulation and the new authority are concerned.</P>
    <P>Senators will be aware from the earlier debate that the assignment of additional functions to the authority by the Minister can only be done by positive statutory order. Under section 8, any such order must first be approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas before being made by the Minister, thereby giving the Oireachtas a say in any function to be transferred or given to the authority.</P>
    <P>Three of the amendments relate to the board. I am anxious that the responsibilities of the board and the management are clear and not in any way compromised by what we might put into the legislation. Amendment No. 8 is necessary so as to ensure the demarcation between the functions of the board and those of management. The issue of the composition of the board and the competencies and experiences of board members is one to which I have given considerable thought.</P>
    <P>Since I was last in this House, similar legislation has been enacted, namely, the Transport (Railway Infrastructure) Act, 2001. This included a section on various competencies and experiences, which board members of that agency should have. That approach has a lot of merit and so, with a few changes, the result is amendment No. 9.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 13 requires the board to meet at least once every quarter. I will impress on the chairman of the new authority that I expect board meetings to be held more frequently than that specified in the proposal and that I consider the provision to be the minimum required for the proper execution of its duties. The interim board, which I appointed in December 2000 to oversee the transition of the centre to the new authority, has met on a monthly basis since then, which is what it deemed necessary to properly execute its functions. It has done excellent work in a comparatively short time.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 14 and 15 concern the chief executive. The first of these defines the responsibility of the chief executive to the board. While the thrust of the amendments is clearly implied in the Bill, I have been persuaded to spell it out in view of its importance. I brought forward amendment No. 15 on Report Stage in the Dáil in response to an Opposition proposal. I will deal first with the situation where the post is vacant, following the retirement, resignation, dismissal or death of the last chief executive. Pending the appointment of a successor, the board may wish to designate someone to carry out the functions of chief executive and I have provided for that in section 14(9)(<i>a</i>) of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The second situation is the most difficult to provide for, such as when a chief executive is hospitalised for some unforeseen reason such as a heart attack or an accident. In such circumstances, the chief executive would be unable to designate someone to carry out his or her duties. <Col N="438" /> However, if the absence is likely to be prolonged, the board might wish to appoint someone to carry out those functions until the chief executive returns. Amendment No. 15 is designed to meet the circumstances of a vacancy and the unforeseen absence of the chief executive. It also avoids the dangers of cutting across the contract of employment between the chief executive and the authority.</P>
    <P>There was some concern in relation to the lack of a definition of &ldquo;household&rdquo; in the Bill. This is a very difficult issue to provide for and, in conjunction with the parliamentary counsel's office, we have given the question much consideration and examined many other items of legislation resulting in amendments Nos. 18 and 19. Rather than use the concept of &ldquo;household&rdquo;, I proposed that we amend the Bill to instead refer to &ldquo;connected relative&rdquo;, a concept used in other Acts, most recently the Transport (Railway Infrastructure) Act, 2001. To do that, it was necessary to amend section 17(2)(<i>a</i>) to (<i>d</i>) so as to refer to connected relative instead of household. It was also necessary to insert a new subsection (7) to define &ldquo;connected relative&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Ensuring that the authority is subject to the freedom of information legislation was an issue of concern in both this House and in Dáil Éireann. It had always been my intention that the new authority would be so subject. I had originally intended that this would be done by ministerial order amending the First Schedule to the Freedom of Information Act, 1997. However, I have been advised that, because the Irish Energy Centre is subject to the Act, the best way to ensure that it continues to be so subject is to amend the First Schedule to that Act in this Bill. That is the purpose of amendment No. 21.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 22 provides for an increase in the borrowing limit of Bord Gáis Éireann. This increase is an integral component in ensuring the completion of the ongoing major infrastructural development being progressed by the company, including the pipeline to the west and the second Scotland-Ireland interconnector. Over the next two years the majority of the capital expenditure involved in this huge investment programme will be utilised as materials are ordered and construction begins.</P>
    <P>This increase in the statutory borrowing limit of the company is essential at this point as it will provide BGE with the flexibility required to best schedule its borrowings to obtain the best value in terms of interest rates and allow the board the resources it requires to schedule the debt effectively and successfully complete the projects.</P>
    <P>During the course of the passage of this Bill through the Dáil, I found it necessary to bring forward certain technical amendments to section 39 of the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999. That section enables the Minister to make a public service obligation order, PSO order, requiring the ESB to purchase the output of certain peat and renewable electricity generating stations in the <Col N="439" /> interests of security of supply and environmental protection respectively.</P>
    <P>The PSO order needs to be made as soon as possible &ndash; many colleagues in this House have been calling for it &ndash; to facilitate the rapidly narrowing timeframe for the construction by the ESB of the two new peat-fired stations at Shannonbridge, County Offaly, and Lanesboro, County Longford, and the orderly closure of the existing antiquated peat stations. The amendment is also urgently needed to pave the way for the issuing of contracts to the successful bidders in the most recent alternative energy requirement, AER, competition. In that regard I am pleased to inform Senators that renewable energy projects to a total capacity of 370 MW have qualified for power purchase agreements under AER V. The making of a PSO order is also necessary to enable the generators concerned to sign power purchase contracts with the ESB.</P>
    <P>The principle of public service obligations was debated in detail and accepted at the time of the passing of the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999. I stress that amendments Nos. 23, 24 and 25 are purely technical in nature. They have been deemed necessary by the Office of the Attorney General to ensure that the enabling power for the PSO order and the introduction of the PSO levy to compensate for the extra-competitive costs incurred in complying with public service obligations complies with European Commission requirements in so far as the PSO funding mechanism is concerned. The Commission approved the PSO arrangements for peat and renewable and sustainable generation on 30 October 2001 and 15 January 2002 respectively.</P>
    <P>These amendments essentially constitute a technical modification to section 39 to ensure that the PSO funding mechanism relates to the maximum import capacity of various categories of electricity accounts held by final customers rather than the actual consumption of electricity by final customers, as had been provided for in section 39 of the 1999 Act. In the case of the levy based on consumption, the European Commission would have insisted that imports of electricity be exempted from the levy and this would have had an extremely distorting impact on the Irish electricity market.</P>
    <P>The 1999 Act anticipated that the levy would be chargeable on the basis of consumption. Amendment No. 23 provides, <i>inter alia</i>, for the deletion of the reference in section 39(5)(<i>a</i>) of the 1999 Act, to &ldquo;electricity provided to such customers&rdquo;, or consumption of electricity, and provides for the insertion of a new section 39(5A) in the 1999 Act, which allows the charging of the PSO levy to final customers on the basis of maximum import capacity of three categories of electricity accounts. The other subsections of amendment No. 23 are minor modifications designed to facilitate the smooth operation of the PSO levy mechanism. Given the technical nature <Col N="440" /> of the funding mechanism, it was decided to place the fine detail regarding the apportionment and computation of the levy payable in a separate Schedule to the 1999 Act. Amendment No. 24 provides for this.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 25 contains the new Schedule 2, which defines the three categories of electricity accounts. They will be &ldquo;domestic&rdquo;, &ldquo;small&rdquo; and &ldquo;medium-large&rdquo; accounts, among which the PSO levy will be allocated on an annual basis by the Commission for Electricity Regulation. It also provides for the precise computation of the amount of PSO levy payable by the individual account holders in these three categories. The revised PSO funding mechanism will not result in an unfair burden on any category of customer and will not distort the market. While these amendments will not have any material impact on public service obligations, they are, nevertheless, necessary from a technical perspective. These provisions will be consolidated in the forthcoming electricity Bill which will shortly be sent to the parliamentary counsel for drafting and is due to be introduced in 2003.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. This legislation has been teased out extensively and comprehensively by the Committee of Public Accounts and by the Dáil and Seanad. There is, therefore, very little to be said of it. I thank the Minister for agreeing to many of the Opposition's amendments and for agreeing to look afresh at many aspects of the Bill. I see in it something to which I referred during the early stages of the debate. There was a possibility of confusion in the demarcation lines between the Commission for Electricity Regulation and the new authority. I am glad the Minister has looked at that and that no confusion will exist in that area. We certainly will not improve the Bill at this juncture. It has been examined thoroughly in both Houses. Though small, yet very effective, this Bill has had the maximum input from the Oireachtas. I will agree to the passing of the Bill and am glad to accept the amendments that have been made to it.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State who has returned to the House with the Bill. I reiterate the sentiments expressed by my colleague opposite. There is no doubt that we have acknowledged the significance of the Bill in the wide-ranging debate that took place here on Second Stage and Committee Stage. I too welcome the open manner in which the Minister has approached this important legislation. We all realise its importance in a rapidly growing economy with a need for sustainability and renewability in energy production and a requirement of strategies to abate or diminish greenhouse gas emissions. This Bill is consistent with overall Government policy, following the Green Paper on sustainable energy and the strategy to address climate change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="441" />There is no doubt that the Minister, through the amendments he has made and accepted, has shown an openness in perfecting the Bill and allowing it to evolve through the debates into its most effective form as a vital cog in the overall strategy to address our energy problems. I welcome that. The Bill has been enhanced and improved significantly through the debates of both Houses and I commend the Minister on seeing it through the Oireachtas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Coralstown is on the route from Kinnegad to Mullingar. I wish to make a case here on behalf of the parents, students and population surrounding the school in Coralstown. Inactivity seems to be the order of the day. Certainly we want an update by the Department on the present position.</P>
      <P>The school in Coralstown was built many years ago. It is parallel to the busy N4 motorway where, on average, 890 vehicles pass every hour. Some 70% of these vehicles are driven at very high speeds and can be construed as a danger to children who are playing just three metres from the road. Over the past year or more, there have been a number of minor accidents and, indeed, some serious ones, the most recent of which damaged the school boundary wall.</P>
      <P>The building is over 70 years old and is structurally unsound. The school lacks many luxuries taken for granted in other schools of its size. Children must leave the comfort of the classroom and the supervision of the teachers to use the toilets, which are wet and damp and have no running hot water. In wet weather they get very badly flooded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="442" />The classrooms in the school are overcrowded and teachers find it increasingly difficult to fulfil the requirements of the new curriculum, which requires more interaction with the students and therefore more space. There is no medical room to administer the various health checks. The facilities for staff are primitive. There is no staff room or private area in which a teacher can have a discussion with a parent. There are no staff toilets and no facilities for the staff to have lunch. It is difficult to teach under such cramped conditions.</P>
    <P>In 1998, the Department of Education and Science agreed to build a new three teacher school on a greenfield site in Coralstown. Since then, the required local contribution of £30,000 has been raised, the site for the school has been purchased by the parish and planning permission for the school has been granted since September last. In December last, members of the board of management of this school met officials of the Department of Education and Science and were bitterly disappointed with the revelations at that meeting. They were told the building of the school would not start for another three years and that it would take two years to complete, that is, that it would be five years in all before completion.</P>
    <P>Coralstown is only four miles from Kinnegad and seven miles from Mullingar. This is a growth area of County Westmeath. It is the nearest area to the city of Dublin in the BMW region. A motorway from Kilcock to Kinnegad is to be constructed, starting in the early part of next year. A new company, Lagan Cement, has moved into the town of Kinnegad and it is starting a new business park. The area could be best described in this way, that Lagan Cement will be to Kinnegad what Seán Quinn is to west Cavan. The companies are in the same line of business and Lagan Cement is a successful company. This will be a major growth area from Kinnegad to Mullingar.</P>
    <P>With that and the needs of the people of this area in mind, this school is long overdue to be built. I call on the Minister and the Department to set in train as a matter of urgency a process whereby this school will be given top priority on the Government's priority list. This certainly does not appear to be the case at present. I hope by raising the matter on the Adjournment Coralstown will be put at the top of the priority list. It should be prioritised for immediate address as a school urgently in need of capital funding.</P>

      <P>I am glad Senator Cassidy has given me the opportunity of outlining to the House the current position of the Department of Education and Science regarding the provision of improved accommodation at Coralstown national school. At present the school has a staffing level of principal, two mainstream class teachers, a shared remedial teacher and a part-time resource teacher. The enrolment at 30 September 2001 was 71 pupils. The school's current facilities consist of two permanent classrooms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="443" />The allocation for primary school buildings in 2002 is &euro;153 million, which is a record level of funding and demonstrates the Government's commitment to the improvement of the accommodation situation in primary schools such as Coralstown national school under its expanded schools building programme. In this context, a proposed major building project for Coralstown national school is currently in architectural planning as part of the Government's programme. The project will continue to the preparation of tender documents and the invitation of tenders, as soon as possible, under the building programme. The Department of Education and Science is fully committed to the provision of improved accommodation at Coralstown national school.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Cassidy again for giving me the opportunity of outlining the present position to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MJNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise this matter. As the Minister of State and many Members of this House, and indeed of the Dáil, will be aware, the single most important issue as far as the people of County Carlow are concerned is the lack of a properly funded locally-based health service. Twenty-five years ago Carlow had a district hospital, a maternity hospital and a psychiatric hospital which catered not only for the people of Carlow and County Carlow but also for the people of County Kildare. Today Carlow still has a district hospital and, thankfully, a geriatric hospital, but the maternity hospital has been closed and the psychiatric hospital has lost the function of servicing the people of County Kildare. Indeed, under care for the psychiatric sector, acute psychiatric admissions are now taken to St. Luke's Hospital in Kilkenny.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Carlow people in urgent need of hospital treatment must travel 26 miles to the general hospital in Kilkenny, that is, St. Luke's Hospital. If they attend the regional hospital, they must travel further again to Waterford, which sometimes is a two hour drive from Carlow. As one of the few counties &ndash; there might be only one other &ndash; without the services of a general hospital, we are seeking immediate action on the part of the Minister and the Department to remedy this unacceptable position. All medical procedures, even minor ones, must be performed outside the county and all births, apart from home births, take place outside the county. Patients are <Col N="444" /> directed to the regional hospital in Waterford to which it can take up to two hours to travel when it could take less than an hour to get to the fully functional and first class facility in Tallaght.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Government's investment in health which has doubled since the Government came to power in 1997. While we do not have the luxury of a general hospital in County Carlow, every other county in the South Eastern Health Board region does. Wexford and Kilkenny have one and Waterford has a regional hospital. Tipperary South Riding, which is half a county, has two general hospitals, while we are a full county without the facility of one. We deserve better treatment than we receive. Perhaps the Minister of State will give a commitment in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health and Children's primary health care strategy, on which I compliment the Minister and his Department, outlines that three diagnostic centres will be established throughout the State on a pilot basis. In welcoming this announcement, I ask the Minister of State to ensure that one of those centres is located in Carlow for all the reasons I have stated. The provision of such a centre would go some small way towards giving the people a limited health service along the following lines.</P>
    <P>Blood tests taken by general practitioners in Carlow are sent to Waterford or Dublin for analysis and are returned a day or two later. Apart from the lack of locally-based facilities, these tests are being sent to places already extended beyond their limits and this increases the pressure on the services there. An ultrascan facility would also be part of the diagnostic service. Until now, patients in need of a gallbladder scan or similar scan have to go to Kilkenny, which takes a full day and places additional pressure on an already over-burdened service. While we have an X-ray facility, the provision of a diagnostic service would give us a new state-of-the-art X-ray unit. A DEXA scan facility for bone scanning would also be part of the diagnostic service.</P>
    <P>The most important part of the centre would be day clinics, the provision of which would be very welcome to the people of Carlow. Appointments could be made locally, saving the South Eastern Health Board the cost of transporting patients to and from Kilkenny hospital. It would also save patients from the frustration they encounter there because of the length of time they must wait to meet consultants. Consultants and specialists would come to the centre to see their patients. This would be part of a one-stop-shop health facility for Carlow. I hope the Minister of State will assure us that he will look favourably on this.</P>
    <P>The first doctors' out-of-hours co-operative service, Caredoc, was established in Carlow in June 1999. It was started on a pilot basis and has proved to be an outstanding success, with patients and providers taking advantage of its merits. This out-of-hours service has been duplicated throughout the country and it is hoped every area will have access to this service by the end of 2003.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="445" />We in Carlow have a proven track record of delivering when we are given the chance and the resources. We have proved we have the expertise by the establishment of the out-of-hours co-op service. All we need is the opportunity and the Minister of State's commitment to our small county. I hope he and his Department will not let us down on this occasion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the opportunity afforded to me by Senator Nolan to set out the position regarding medical and hospital services available to the people of County Carlow. The primary responsibility for the provision of health services for the region rests with the South Eastern Health Board. In 1996 the chief executive officer of the South Eastern Health Board set up a review group to examine the health needs and status of the Carlow population, especially from the perspective of key groups within that population. In determining their service needs, the review group examined the level of existing services and carried out needs assessment surveys of particular client groups. All interested parties were invited to make submissions. Recommendations for service development to meet the identified needs were formulated and published in the policy document, Health and Social Gain for Carlow &ndash; Local Services to Meet Local Need, in November 1996.</P>
      <P>The South Eastern Health Board continues to implement the recommendations contained in this report. There have been a number of significant developments which I will outline. Acute hospital services for the local catchment population of Carlow and Kilkenny are provided at St. Luke's Hospital, Kilkenny. Proposals for the development of services at the hospital have been set out by the South Eastern Health Board. The overall aim is to have a comprehensive, integrated, quality and efficient hospital capable of meeting the challenges of the times.</P>
      <P>This development plan contains proposals to enhance existing services on the St. Luke's site, including general surgery, general medicine, obstetrics, gynaecology, accident and emergency and diagnostic services. It proposes to provide all hospital services on one site in a way that combines ease of access to the public with a cost-effective service. The development plans take account of national policy, which is to have a strong network of local and general hospitals that serve defined catchment areas for general medical and surgical facilities. The plans and developments at St. Luke's Hospital constitute a major increase in the level and quality of services provided to the people of counties Carlow and Kilkenny.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The single most important limiting factor for admission to hospital is bed availability. The Minister for Health and Children recently announced the commissioning of an additional 709 acute beds nationally at a cost of &euro;65 million. This is the first phase of the provision of an additional 3,000 acute beds nationally in the per<Col N="446" /> iod to 2011, as announced in the health strategy. Under this initiative, funding of &euro;2.8 million has been made available for an additional 28 acute medical beds to be provided in Lourdes Hospital, Kilcreene. These beds are in addition to the 28 new beds recently provided in St. Luke's Hospital, Kilkenny, and the new six bed coronary care unit also located in the hospital. This extra bed capacity will help to ensure that the acute services available to the people of counties Carlow and Kilkenny are responsive to their needs.</P>
    <P>The development of the GP co-op, Caredoc, was alluded to and has improved the provision of primary care services in County Carlow. This development has facilitated greater access to out-of-hours services, including improved access to GP services, high quality and up-to-date medical equipment and nurse advice. This is a new service with 35% of the calls being dealt with by way of nurse advice. This is a very beneficial service for first-time mothers and elderly people. I am advised that the introduction of Caredoc has led to a reduced number of attendances at the accident and emergency department in St. Luke's Hospital, Kilkenny. Minor injuries are treated, as required, in the Caredoc premises in Carlow, thereby decreasing the need to travel to Kilkenny.</P>
    <P>The South Eastern Health Board's service plan for 2002 states that the board intends to hold extensive consultation with the various stakeholders on the roll-out of the primary care strategy, including examining the feasibility of setting up a community-based diagnostic service serving community and hospital needs in the Carlow area, as has been alluded to.</P>
    <P>As regards mental health services, the development of the new 45 bed department of acute psychiatry at St. Luke's Hospital, Kilkenny, will ensure that all patients requiring admission for acute psychiatric care will be managed at the hospital. An active therapeutic day hospital will operate at St. Dympna's Hospital on a seven day week basis where patients will be referred by GPs for assessment and treatment on an out-patient basis where they do not require care in an in-patient facility.</P>
    <P>A fuller community based service will be provided at Carlow and a new 14 place high support hostel has also been established that will provide care for patients on discharge from the department of acute psychiatry. A further ten place hostel will also be available. The community focus of the mental health service has been strengthened by the approval of additional posts of family behavioural therapists, nursing staff and social workers.</P>
    <P>The provision of services for older people will be enhanced by the appointment of additional staff to support hospital and community based services and through the appointment of a co-ordinator of services for older people in Carlow-Kilkenny. There are plans to develop a new unit to accommodate elderly mentally infirm patients at the Sacred Heart Hospital, Carlow. This will <Col N="447" /> increase the number of elderly beds available within Carlow and the number of day places.</P>
    <P>Research shows that unhealthy behaviours adopted in childhood have a negative impact on health in later life, particularly where the behaviours are carried on into adulthood. As part of the South Eastern Health Board's health promotion strategy, the board has introduced a five year smoking prevention and education programme in primary schools in County Carlow. The aim of the programme is to delay and prevent the onset of smoking among young people and to encourage participation in active lifestyles. This health promotion programme aims to positively influence the health of the population in County Carlow by providing a supportive environment to help young people make the healthier choice.</P>
    <P>The overall objective is to ensure the services available to the people are responsive to their needs. I am confident the measures I have outlined, which have been undertaken by the South Eastern Health Board, will continue to impact favourably on people in County Carlow who require health care services.</P>
    <P>Some of the services can be improved. Much can be done by way of modern technology at district hospitals and other units in counties such as Carlow because digital radiography facilitates ultrasound and other such services. The basics already exist in Carlow and it is just a matter of providing extra facilities in the unit consistent with modern technology.</P>

      <P>I am pleased the Minister of State is available this evening. We are all aware of the importance of the helicopter rescue service. Looking back over the years we were always very pleased to be in a position to respond adequately and professionally to emergencies. Ireland is a small island state and, as a result, the need for such a service, particularly in relation to the sea, is evident. Over the years we have all been in awe of the courage and bravery of the crews involved. As a small State, we made definite efforts to ensure that we could call on such a service in emergencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The south east has particular needs because of the coastal aspect of the region. Obviously, the area requires special attention. I have no doubt the Minister of State, who comes from the region, is aware of what I am saying in that regard. The main thrust of my matter relates to what is an adequate and professional service. I am interested in a number of responses from the Minister of State in this regard. We are discussing a helicopter or helicopters and considering if the matter is now finalised or if it will involve organic development. If it is found as time goes on that extra helicopters are necessary, will that be taken <Col N="448" /> into account rather than waiting for a situation to develop where other needs arise and there are questions about whether finance will be available?</P>
    <P>I am aware we are talking about very large finance, not buying a Volvo or a Mercedes. We are also talking about the upkeep and ongoing maintenance of the helicopter. Needless to say, this is a vital part of the service. Given the emergency nature of the service, we need to know the helicopter or helicopters are in working order at all times when required. Therefore, a back up service is vital. There is also the question of professionally trained crews. We must focus on this aspect at all times so that the necessary personnel are available immediately and there are opportunities for training personnel in the future. We must ensure continuity in that regard.</P>
    <P>I am not clear about the logistics of the service. I would be interested to know where the helicopter will be stationed in terms of central requirements. I am sure that matter has been considered, but I am interested in the issue. There is also the question of the use of the helicopter. We sometimes think only in terms of sea rescue but many other emergencies arise. If a patient has to be moved in an emergency to a specialised hospital, will that be part of the service? While it might sound a little mercenary, does one have to pay for such a service? Would it be necessary for a business to pay retrospectively?</P>
    <P>The other issue on which I would like to touch relates to the evolution which is now taking place on the whole island, North and South. There are many areas of co-operation such as the setting up of Tourism Ireland, which is a great example. There is co-operation also in the areas of agriculture, rail transport, canals and so on. North-South co-operation, which in the past may have been a sensitive issue, is very important. I was pleased recently to hear Dr. Paisley compliment the Government on the help it provided in relation to a terrible tragedy which occurred in the northern part of the country. That co-operation has existed since World War II. We all recall when the North of Ireland was bombed and Mr. de Valera sent ambulances. This created a certain understanding.</P>
    <P>There should be flexibility and co-operation in regard to humanitarian issues. Perhaps the Minister of State will touch on that matter. People do not raise questions in regard to humanitarian assistance and who is doing what. We all seem to feel we need assistance and help in times of emergency.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to hear the Minister's response but I know that, in putting down the motion and addressing it tonight, I am also putting forward some of the queries and views from the south-east region. I compliment the Minister of State on his proactive approach in this area. There is quite a shocking list abroad at the moment in terms of resources. Each Minister and Minister of State would have to make his own play in that <Col N="449" /> regard. I am well aware that the Minister of State has been very proactive in that regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Byrne)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom a rá go bhfuil áthas mór ormsa teacht anseo inniu chun caint ar an ábhar tábhachtach seo. Ba mhaith liom freisin mo bhuíochas a ghabháil le Seanadóir Ó Murchú as ucht an t-ábhar seo a chur ar an gclár.</P>
      <P>I am absolutely delighted to inform my colleagues in the Seanad that, on Wednesday, 13 February, I announced the award of a five year contract with Canadian Helicopters Corporation (Ireland) Limited &ndash; CHC &ndash; to provide an all-weather, 24 hour marine emergency response helicopter service at Waterford airport. It is Waterford airport at present at least. We still have some details to iron out with the authorities at the airport before we finally make that decision.</P>
      <P>This new service will start on 1 July 2002. In addition, CHC will provide an interim service on a 12 hours per day basis from 1 May to the start of the main contract. The helicopter service in the south east is currently provided by an Alouette 111 single-engined helicopter at Waterford airport. As the Senator will be aware, the Alouette is in replacement, on a temporary basis, of the Dauphin, which crashed on Tramore beach in July 1999 with the tragic loss of four crewmen. That tragic incident occurred as the crew were returning from a successful mission, and we must not forget their bravery and devotion to duty. I had the good fortune to know one of these people.</P>
      <P>We owe all the people who go on mercy missions a tremendous debt of gratitude. They have done enormous work, risking their own lives. The four young men who died paid the ultimate sacrifice. It is nice to know that there are people like that. The role of the emergency services is to be prepared at all times, and we are privileged to have available in the emergency services personnel of such a high calibre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will explain the background to the award of this new helicopter service. Following from the joint Department of the Marine and Natural Resources-Irish Coastguard and the Department of Defence working group report on dedicated marine emergency response helicopters, a tender competition was commenced for the provision of an all-weather marine emergency helicopter at Waterford to replace the Alouette. The competition required that the service be in place for 1 July 2002. When seeking tenders, I made it clear that any new service would have the highest quality features to ensure that a first class service would be provided in the south east, an area which has high-intensity shipping, fishing and leisure activity, which grows by the day, and a corresponding high-casualty potential. It is no surprise that the Hook lighthouse was the first built in Europe. That indicates that, even 800 years ago, <Col N="450" /> it was considered that the waters in that area were the most dangerous in Europe.</P>
    <P>The tender process has now been completed and I am pleased to record that a contract has been awarded for one of the most highly specified marine emergency helicopters in the world to provide the rescue service. The Senator mentioned that he did not think a Mercedes was necessary. I am pleased we have the equivalent of a Mercedes.</P>
    <P>The helicopter features specialised direction-finding equipment and forward-looking infrared equipment, which can detect people in the water through heat transmission. This facility makes it a truly all-weather, day and night rescue facility. This helicopter can carry up to 15 survivors, 25 people in all. It can transport a fully equipped fire fighting crew and has up to five hours' endurance in the sky. The craft has a maximum range of 450 nautical miles. This is far in excess of anything we have had in the past or anything that moves about in our airspace or the airspace of western Europe. The craft has a cruising speed of 110 knots.</P>
    <P>In addition to this service, which will start on 1 July next, negotiations are advanced for the provision of coastguard cover with an all-weather marine emergency helicopter at Waterford from May to July 2002. The helicopter will be on call for 12 hours per day until the start of the main contract. This will provide improved capability, endurance and range over the Alouette during the long hours of daylight at that time of the year. The existing coastguard all-weather, 24 hour helicopters based at Dublin and Shannon will be called on to cover any gaps during the nights in that period.</P>
    <P>I pay personal tribute to all the other personnel who make up the nationwide emergency response team, in addition to our helicopter crews. I am sure all Members of the House recognise the vital role they play in ensuring the safety of our coastal and seafaring communities in particular. More than anything else, marine emergency response demonstrates the benefits of helicopters. The new helicopter will be available for all mercy missions and I am glad the Senator raised the issue. However, it is important to acknowledge that the helicopter is only part of a marine emergency response team.</P>
    <P>It is easy to understand how a helicopter may attract the glare of publicity, but successful rescue services often depend on the combined efforts of search craft, lifeboats and land rescue teams. There are many distress circumstances in which other forms of response are suitable.</P>
    <P>Our marine emergency response benefits greatly from the almost saturated coverage around the coast by a fleet of purpose-built lifeboats provided and operated by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution &ndash; RNLI &ndash; whose craft range from inflatable inshore boats to all-weather offshore boats. I think very highly of the people in the RNLI. Every year in every port in Ireland and indeed beyond, it is said how good they are. People put their hands in their pockets <Col N="451" /> for them and have tremendous confidence in them. I thank them.</P>
    <P>In addition, there are community inshore rescue boats at nine stations: Drogheda, Cahore, Wexford, Tramore, Bunmahon, Bantry, Banna, Ballybunion and Kilkee. The coastguard also has inshore rescue boats around the country.</P>
    <P>All these groups, combined with the invaluable assistance of the Garda, fire brigade, ambulance and medical services and many volunteers, serve to make up an invaluable national emergency capability, for which the nation owes a debt of gratitude.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="452" />Senator Ó Murchú mentioned Dr. Paisley, who complimented and thanked us for the assistance we give. On many occasions we have had to call on the RAF, which, no matter what the circumstances or how sensitive the problem, was always available. It is nice to think we now have equipment in place that will allow us to assist people in British waters and on the whole western European seaboard who may be in difficulties. I am delighted to announce that tonight and I thank the Senator for raising the issue.</P>
