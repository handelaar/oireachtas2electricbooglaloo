      <P>I have received notice from Senator Connor that on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to refurbish the O'Conor Don National School, Cloobonniffe, Castlerea, County Roscommon.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Taylor-Quinn of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to provide a supplementary block grant to Clare County Council for the rural water programme so that group schemes can proceed to construction to overcome water supply problems.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Leader is not here today because if he read out a list of ten items, he would claim it as a personal record and further proof of the great Government we have. At least we were spared that today.</P>

      <P>It will be a busy day. When will the House sit again and what business will be taken between now and the end of the Seanad? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>We should remind ourselves about the matters we take with and without debate. As an efficient method of discharging business, we have always operated on an agreed position that something referred to committee should be discussed at the committee and that the debate should not be anticipated in the House. However, when something comes back from committee, it should be treated like Report Stage of a Bill and people should be allowed to make a point if they wish. There should be communication with the Whips to establish if people wish to speak on a matter coming back from committee. Perhaps it has been disposed of at the committee, in which case we do not need a Report Stage type discussion. However, if people need to make further points, they should be allowed to do so. I do not want to make an issue about it today, but I do not want it to be taken for granted that we can take matters without debate. I do not know of anyone in our group who wants to make a point on these issues today as no one has communicated that to me, but I am not sure that people knew these issues were being raised today. I want to distinguish between matters coming back from committee and those going to committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1439" />I am unhappy with and cannot agree to the proposal to take all Stages of No. 5, the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill. It requires further discussion, thought and complex work on Committee Stage. I do not have any difficulty taking Second Stage and perhaps starting Committee Stage, but I do not agree with taking all Stages today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business takes the biscuit. The Deputy Leader has thrown in everything but the kitchen sink. Ten matters is the largest number we have had on the Order of Business. My main concern is that there are a number of substantial elements we have not discussed before. For example, we have not discussed the McBrearty affair in the House. We are setting up a tribunal to investigate that matter, but we need time to discuss it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are discussing that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with ten matters today. We do not have a considerable amount of time in which to reflect and deal with them. We are to discuss the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) (No. 2) Bill, 2001, which deals with an issue of huge controversy at present. All Stages of that will be taken today without there having been any indication that this was to come before us. We are to discuss a motion on the combating of trafficking in human beings, something on which we have called for a debate for considerable time.</P>
      <P>There is also a motion concerning the extension of the Flood tribunal, something that could have happened and was requested almost 12 months ago. It must now go through without debate. This is far too much to take in one sitting. It would be useful if the Deputy Leader of the House indicated if and when we are to sit next week. Some of these items could be dealt with next week rather than being rushed through today.</P>
      <P>I ask the Deputy Leader to make time available before the House rises for the Easter recess for a state of the nation debate so that we can consider major issues such as health, education, housing and the economy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Labhrás Ó Murchú</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what opportunity may be available in the coming weeks to address a debate that is raging at present in the media. The people have always been particularly generous in terms of making contributions to needy countries. The work of missionaries and NGOs abroad is well documented. The Government has also been generous in this regard. However, the current debate on which countries should have precedence is creating a great deal of confusion among the public. The net result of this might be that people do not provide money <Col N="1440" /> when it is needed. A debate in the Seanad might help to bring balance to this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>We were reminded yesterday of the extraordinarily high level of meat imports. Three years ago, the quantity of meat imported was about 65,000 tonnes; that figure now stands at 102,000 tonnes. It appears most of these imports find their way into the catering trade and the public health sector. Worries have been expressed, which I share, that much of this meat is not as stringently regulated in terms of quality assurance and traceability as that provided by Irish producers. We should debate this matter next week as I understand the Seanad is to sit for one day.</P>
      <P>It is a serious issue. Irish producers operate under the most stringent controls, and rightly so, in relation to quality assurance and traceability. It is very difficult, however, to trace meat that originated outside the State, perhaps in Argentina. Such imported meat now makes up 25% of beef, 35% of pig meat and over 35% of poultry consumed here. For example, beef coming from Latin America&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot debate the matter now, Senator. You have sought a debate and you have made the case for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Some countries from which we import meat do not have the same traceability rules as Ireland. It is incumbent on the authorities here to ensure that rules applied to our producers are applied to all countries from which we import. I hope we can have a debate next week on that issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to the ordering of business in the House. This is not critical of the Leader or the Deputy Leader but I was very disappointed at the scandalous behaviour of the Minister last night. It was childish to keep Members here until a very late hour on the understanding that the business was very urgent and that the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill, 2002 would not otherwise turn up in the Dáil today. It is not there in any case. Report Stage is not being taken until after the break. It is appalling that Members were kept here. My colleagues, Senator O'Toole and Senator Burke, managed to persuade the Minister to accept amendments, but there was no reporting of this at all. It did not appear on &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; or in any of the print media. This is important and the people are entitled to know what the Seanad is doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>That business is finished with and we cannot have a re-hash of yesterday's business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I would like to make regarding today's Order of Business is that if this matter was so urgent, it would be on the Order Paper this morning, but it is not. That proves the <Col N="1441" /> point so effectively made by Senator Manning that the House was treated with contempt by the Minister and also, to an extent, by the media.</P>
      <P>I realise that it is impossible to have a debate on foreign affairs before we break for Easter. However, we have been promised such a debate and presumably that will take place soon after we return from the Easter break. In light of the fact that there are significant developments regarding Tibet, will the Deputy Leader of the House transmit to the Minister for Foreign Affairs that, according to <i>The Washington Post</i>, countries of the European Union are released from their obligation to hold the line regarding China and Tibet? Some people have already made a significant advance in this area, particularly the Dutch Foreign Minister, who, at the United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva yesterday, made a strong statement about the treatment of people in Tibet by China. He is able to do that while Ireland has a seat on the UN Security Council. In light of our continuing interest in Tibet, can we use this window of opportunity to sign and sponsor a motion in Geneva? It is most urgent that we do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I express my disappointment at the treatment of TG4 by some of our national newspapers, especially as it relates to the listing of its programmes in their television sections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not appropriate to the Order of Business and has no relevance to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the only opportunity I have to comment on it. The space given to the programmes of TG4 is no bigger than a large postage stamp. It is a disgrace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The way the business of the House has been ordered for the past few weeks is despicable. It brings the House into disrepute. We are not being covered by the media, as has been pointed out, issues are being forced through, and all Stages of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) (No. 2) Bill, 2001, will go through the House today in a short time. That is not the way to do business. It has been pointed out in the Lower House that no consultation has taken place with outside groups that are affected by that Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>As has been said, there is a huge amount of business to be processed in the House today. I ask the Deputy Leader for a timeframe so that we can bring some structure to the day. Could he say, for example, that No. 7, the Competition Bill, 2001, will not be dealt with before 2 p.m. or 3 p.m.?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>To answer the last question first, I cannot say that. Senator Manning asked about the proposals for the next sitting. It is proposed that the next sitting will take place on Thursday next at 10 a.m. It was suggested at the end of business last night that Report Stage of the Edu<Col N="1442" /> cation for Persons with Disabilities Bill, 2002, would be taken then. It is also intended to take the Civil Defence Bill, the Solicitors (Amendment) Bill, the Medical Practitioners Bill and to take statements on the seventh progress report of the All-party Committee on the Constitution, the one that deals with matters relating to the Seanad. That is Deputy Brian Lenihan's committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a committee that excludes the Independents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Independents are capable of ensuring that they are not excluded. I have the utmost confidence in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy Leader find out about the foreign affairs debate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the point made by Senator O'Toole about matters that come back from committees, I have made the point before that these issues are frequently treated comprehensively by the committees and there is no need to rehearse the arguments. However, I take the Senator's point and, on a case by case basis, it is reasonable that, in certain circumstances where it merits discussion, it should take place. What we are proposing today is reasonable in the sense that these matters have gone to the committees.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) (No. 2) Bill, 2001, which was raised by Senator Costello, I agree that we have a comprehensive workload today. However, there is an obligation on us to complete the legislative programme set out by the Government. That is a difficult task and it is why we must sit again next Thursday. It is important that we complete the work and that this important legislation goes through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Could we take the remaining Stages then?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask for the co-operation of the House with regard to that. We are taking No. 9, the trafficking issue, with debate. You will be the first to know, a Chathaoirligh, that to debate the issue of the Flood tribunal would lead to the possibility of intruding into the workings of the tribunal and you would be required to use your powers to remind the House that there should be no allusion to what takes place in the tribunal. It is therefore preferable to deal with this matter by motion and without debate.</P>
      <P>Senator Ó Murchú raised the matter of overseas development aid and the related matter of private contributions. The Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, produced a report yesterday on overseas development aid but I take the Senator's point and he has made a reasonable case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Connor raised the issue of meat &ndash; beef, pigmeat and poultry &ndash; coming into the country from sources outside the European <Col N="1443" /> Union and particularly from the Far East or South America. I agree with the Senator. The traceability to which we have become accustomed is not evident in the case of meat coming from those countries. Consumers should be aware that when they buy Irish produce they are buying the best. This is a fact that should be promoted and I ask the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development to relay those views to Bord Bia.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>The House should debate the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point made by the Senator but unfortunately we have a crowded programme. I will see what can be done but I cannot give the Senator an undertaking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>This House will probably last until next July.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Norris raised the matter of yesterday's business but, as the Cathaoirleach said, yesterday's business is yesterday's business and it is over and done with. I am aware that he and other Senators have been asking for a debate on foreign affairs and it would be desirable to have such a debate. However, as I explained, the legislative programme is a priority but I will see what can be done. In reply to Senator Norris's point about Tibet, I understand it is now up to individual countries to make clear their position on Tibet. There is no equivocation about Ireland's position but I will convey his views to the Minister.</P>
      <P>I note Senator Glynn's point about TG4 and I accept that it should receive parity of esteem, if I can use that phrase, with other channels. Senator Coogan and several other Senators made a point about how the business of the House is arranged.</P>
      <P>It is traditional before the Easter recess to thank all the various people associated with the Houses. As we are sitting next week it is probably not necessary to do so now but since this is probably the last occasion on which I will occupy this chair I would like to thank you, a Chathaoirligh.</P>

I thank your officials and the Leas-Chathaoirleach. I thank the House for the co-operation which it has always extended to me and I wish success to those who are contesting Dáil or Seanad elections. I hope that their hopes and ambitions will all be realised and that those who are retiring will have a happy retirement.</P>

    <P>It is important to place this Bill in the context of what the Government has achieved in the housing area. Since coming into office, we have achieved record levels of housing output in each of the years from 1997 to 2001. During this time about 216,000 new houses have been built representing about 18% of our housing stock. House price increases have also seen significant moderation, from peaks of some 40% in 1998, to about <Col N="1446" /> 5&nbsp;-&nbsp;6% in the 12 months ending September 2001. A local authority multi-annual approach has been introduced to achieve a total of 25,000 starts for the period 2000-2003, and to allow for greater forward planning and efficiencies of scale in delivering the increased local authority housing targets &ndash; 5,000 units were completed under the programme last year, the highest level in 15 years. Record levels of funding have been committed to support the voluntary housing programme leading to a total of 1,250 units being delivered last year, the highest output ever. A sum of &euro;63 million has been provided for the serviced land initiative which will deliver water and sewerage services for some 165,000 housing units.</P>
    <P>Increased income limits have been introduced for the shared ownership and affordable housing schemes and a new site subsidy for houses provided by local authorities under these schemes. Substantial funding increases have been provided for the various grant schemes. The provision for the special housing aid for the elderly scheme has increased from &euro;5.1 million in 1996 to &euro;11.9 million this year. The disabled person's grant and essential repairs grant scheme allocation has increased sixfold from &euro;5.5 million in 1996 to &euro;32 million in 2002.</P>
    <P>Funding for Traveller-specific accommodation has almost doubled from &euro;12 million in 1997 to &euro;23.7 million in 2001. Last year 137 new units of Traveller specific accommodation were provided and a further 45 refurbished. This is in addition to 162 Traveller families accommodated in standard housing. A comprehensive Government strategy on adult homelessness was launched in May 2000 and a preventative strategy to ensure that people leaving State care do not become homeless was published a few weeks ago.</P>
    <P>The Bill ranges right across the housing spectrum and provides additional legislative supports to the Government's housing policies. The main provisions of the Bill include providing for a significant increase in the borrowing limit of the Housing Finance Agency to enable it provide finance to local authorities for housing capital purposes and extend the power of the agency to lend for additional non-housing capital purposes. It also extends the powers of the agency to lend directly to voluntary bodies for the provision of housing. The Bill places the affordable housing and shared ownership schemes on a statutory basis. It introduces greater flexibility in relation to the administration of the new house grant scheme and provides an up to date statutory framework for financial assistance to organisations providing advice or research on housing issues. It provides power to the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs to make regulations which will allow for the continued payment after 25 July this year of allowances to successor tenants of what were formerly rent controlled dwellings.</P>
    <P>The Bill also makes provision for changes to legislation dealing with unauthorised encamp<Col N="1447" /> ments by amending the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1992 and the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994. Provision is also being made for a number of other amendments to housing and related legislation and technical amendments to the Building Societies Act, 1989.</P>
    <P>I will now refer in some detail to the main provisions of the Bill. Sections 1 to 4 contain the usual provisions of a general nature dealing with such matters as citations, commencement, interpretation, regulations and repeals.</P>
    <P>Section 5 defines affordable and shared ownership housing. Section 6 provides a statutory basis for the affordable housing scheme, giving housing authorities clearly defined powers to build or arrange for the building of new houses for sale by them to eligible purchasers at cost price and, accordingly, at a significant discount from the market value of comparable houses in the area. The Government has set a specific target of 1,000 units of affordable housing per annum under the scheme over the period of the national development plan.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides for the payment by housing authorities of a mortgage subsidy to eligible persons who have received a loan from a housing authority and that these subsidies may be recouped from moneys provided by the Oireachtas, with the consent of the Minister and the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Section 8 requires each housing authority to establish a scheme that determines the order of priority to be given to persons to whom affordable houses are being made available for sale. This section also sets out the matters to which the housing authority must have regard in the making of such a scheme. These include the accommodation needs and current housing circumstances of applicants, the period for which applicants have resided in the functional area of the housing authority and the distance of affordable housing from the applicant's place of employment. There is also provision in this section for periodic review and amendment of the scheme of priorities by a housing authority. Specific provision was made during the course of the Bill's passage through the Dáil to clarify that the making of a scheme for the allocation of affordable houses is a reserved function.</P>
    <P>Sections 9 and 10 recognise that there is a need also to provide housing authorities with some degree of control on the resale of houses supplied under the affordable housing and shared ownership schemes so that undue profit cannot be made by those to whom a house has been provided under either scheme. These sections, therefore, provide for controls, including a clawback of profit, on the first resale of houses purchased under these schemes in the event that houses are sold by the initial owners within 20 years of the date of purchase. Sections 9 and 10 also provide that any moneys accruing to a housing authority under these sections should be used by it for the provision, improvement or refurbishment of housing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1448" />Section 11 updates the general power of the Minister to pay new house grants. This updated provision will allow the removal of a small number of anomalies, in particular to ensure that following a legal separation applicants who are themselves first time purchasers will be eligible for a grant. At present, a grant can only be made available in these circumstances when the applicant can prove hardship. It is also intended to provide flexibility for the payment of grants in the future including provision for differential rates of new house grants to encourage, for example, more efficient use of energy, including the use of renewable forms of energy in line with the national climate change strategy.</P>
    <P>Section 12 brings together and clarifies the existing provisions governing financial assistance to approved housing bodies by way of grant aid. The role of the voluntary housing sector in the provision of social housing and in relation to housing research has been rightly acknowledged on many previous occasions. The extent of activity by the sector requires that it be supported financially in order to continue to grow. Last year we provided over &euro;1.1 million in grant aid to voluntary housing bodies specifically to assist them with their administrative costs and in carrying out research. Section 12 provides powers to the Minister to pay grants to bodies providing research or advice on housing or promoting the provision of housing by voluntary or co-operative bodies. I have also taken the opportunity to clarify the aspects of housing research that may be grant aided which include research in relation to housing needs, standards, management, finance or other aspects of housing policy.</P>
    <P>The availability of accurate and comprehensive information on all aspects of the housing market, in particular trends in relation to house prices, is essential for the development of housing policy and policy instruments. Given the importance of comprehensive house price data, my Department engaged the services of consultants to examine the house price information currently obtained by the Department and data otherwise available and to assess and recommend how to improve the use and analysis of the data. This work is now complete and the consultants have recommended that the existing data collected and published by the Department be augmented and improved by information technology systems developed with the aim of providing a broader range of house price indices for statistical purposes. Provisions are included in section 13 to facilitate this. Data provided to the Department by mortgage lenders on an anonymous basis will be given appropriate protection and can not be disclosed to any other person, except in accordance with arrangements made between the Minister and the mortgage lenders concerned or in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act.</P>
    <P>Section 14 clarifies the management functions of housing authorities in certain cases. It confirms that housing authorities can perform management functions, including the charging of rents in <Col N="1449" /> relation to dwellings procured through arrangements such as a leasing arrangement between a local authority and owners of private accommodation, whereby accommodation is made available for tenants designated by the local authority. This amendment is necessary because section 58 of the 1966 Act empowers them to charge rents only in the case of accommodation owned by the authority. The extent to which local authorities will be responsible for the management of such dwellings will be provided for in agreements with property owners. This is an important provision as local authorities increasingly use a wider range of ways for providing housing including the purchase of apartments in private developments under arrangements provided for in Part V of the Planning and Development Act and otherwise.</P>
    <P>Section 15 clarifies the liabilities of housing authorities following the sale of a dwelling under a tenant purchase scheme, in terms of the provision of services and insurance of the dwelling. Once the dwelling has been sold it is privately owned and the owner becomes liable for all costs arising in upkeep and insurance.</P>
    <P>As a result of the additional functions being introduced for housing authorities under Part II in relation to affordable and shared ownership housing, it is necessary to amend section 23 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1992 which provides for the definition of a housing authority and the housing functions of different categories of local authorities. This is provided for in section 16 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>To maintain momentum on the social housing programmes and to give effect to commitments we made in Action on Housing in June 2000, section 17 provides that the borrowing limits of the Housing Finance Agency be increased from the existing limit of £1.5 billion to &euro;6 billion. The current statutory limit of £1.5 billion has been in place since 1992 and will be reached by the agency by the middle of this year. This increase to &euro;6 billion will cover the agency for about eight years at predicted future levels of activity.</P>
    <P>Section 17 also provides that approved voluntary housing bodies may be afforded direct access to funding from the Housing Finance Agency, subject to terms and conditions which must be approved by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance, including appropriate conditions to minimise exposure of the agency to risk resulting from such lending. At present, voluntary housing associations only have indirect access to funding from the agency through the local authorities under the capital assistance and rental subsidy schemes and under the sale of sites subsidy scheme.</P>
    <P>Section 17 also provides that the powers of the Housing Finance Agency be extended in order that it can lend to local authorities for certain non-housing related capital expenditure purposes. These include funding to allow local authorities finance the up-front capital cost of the commercial and industrial elements of new water treatment and delivery networks, and wastewater <Col N="1450" /> collection and treatment systems. These costs will be fully recovered over time with relevant operational costs from commercial and industrial customers.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill have been extended in the Dáil in relation to the borrowing mechanisms available to the Housing Finance Agency. Sections 17 to 19, inclusive, now provide that the National Treasury Management Agency may perform the borrowing functions of the Housing Finance Agency, including the management of the indebtedness arising, when so requested by the HFA. The NTMA is also empowered to make repayable Exchequer loans to the HFA. This will enable the NTMA to raise funds in the name of the Exchequer at the finest rates and to on-lend these moneys to the HFA.</P>
    <P>Section 20 addresses a concern of the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, that the Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Act, 1982, does not contain statutory authority for the making of rent allowance regulations by that Minister, to allow the continued payment of rent allowance to successor tenants who will cease to be protected under the 1982 Act on 25 July this year. The section will enable the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs to make such regulations.</P>
    <P>The matter of unauthorised encampments is also addressed in the Bill. The encroachment on public and private lands by Travellers has been an issue of much genuine concern recently, particularly in those areas where large-scale encampments were involved. Such unauthorised encampments raise issues wider than accommodation matters proper to the Housing Acts, such as issues of public order, intimidation and trespass.</P>
    <P>Section 21 provides for the amendment of section 10 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1992 as amended by the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act, 1998. Section 10 of the 1992 Act provides powers for local authorities to remove unauthorised temporary dwellings from public places, depending on the circumstances. The scope of the power available to local authorities includes cases where nuisance is caused to any dwelling within a one mile radius of approved Traveller accommodation, not, as at present, dwellings in the immediate vicinity of such accommodation. This section also widens the grounds on which the power may be used where obstruction of, or interference with, public or private amenities is caused by a temporary dwelling. The power will not be mandatory on a local authority which will continue to have discretion to permit those Traveller families in need of permanent accommodation to remain on land pending the provision by it of permanent accommodation.</P>
    <P>Section 24 provides for the insertion of a new part in the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994, to provide for a prohibition on a person entering and occupying land, and bringing any object onto the land without the owner's consent, where such entry or occupation is likely to sub<Col N="1451" /> stantially damage the land or any amenity associated with the land.</P>
    <P>There is also provision that where a member of the Garda Síochána has reason to believe that a person is committing or has committed an offence under the section, the member may demand of him or her his or her name and address and direct him or her to leave the land and remove any object from it which is owned by him or her or under his or her control. Failure to comply with such a request or direction will be an offence under the new provision. Provision is also made for a member of the Garda Síochána to arrest without warrant a person committing an offence under the new provision.</P>
    <P>In the event of the owner of a temporary dwelling or other object not removing the object from the land at the request of a garda, the member concerned may remove or cause to be removed the object from the land in question and arrange for its storage. The Commissioner will be entitled to sell or dispose of an object removed and stored under this provision in certain circumstances. The penalties for a person on summary conviction of offences under the section are a fine of up to &euro;3,000 or a term of imprisonment of up to one month or both. The amendment provides for an effective mechanism to deal with the type of large-scale unauthorised encampments which we have seen emerging in the past year or two.</P>
    <P>Section 22 amends the Dublin Docklands Development Authority Act, 1997. This amendment is an &ldquo;avoidance of doubt&rdquo; provision. It clarifies the powers of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority to attach conditions requiring the payment of contributions towards expenditure incurred by or on behalf of Dublin City Council or the authority in respect of the provision of essential public infrastructure and facilities in the docklands area. It also covers the application of conditions in relation to the social and affordable housing provision.</P>
    <P>Section 23 contains a number of largely technical amendments to the Building Societies Act, 1989, including amendments intended to take account of changing accounting practices in relation to the preparation of annual accounts.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides additional legislative support for the efforts being made by the Government, local authorities, voluntary housing associations and others in the housing area in the delivery of much needed housing. I look forward to a positive and constructive debate on the Bill which I commend to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State. We, on this side of the House, are quite supportive of the thrust of the legislation and welcome many aspects of it. However, some questions have to be teased out and I hope the Minister of State will be able to give answers later. I need to put a halt to his gallop with regard to his opening statement where he said that between coming into office in 1997 and 2001 there were 216,000 <Col N="1452" /> new house starts. He gives the impression that with one wave of a wand, it was possible to immediately build 216,000 new houses, the provisions for which were put in place long before the Government came into being. First, the land had to be purchased, planning sought, etc. before starting to even dig a foundation trench. It is unfair of the Government to try to claim credit for all the houses that have come online.</P>
      <P>In parallel with the increase in the number of houses, there has been an increase in the number of housing applicants. In a recent debate on housing I pointed out to the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, that in three towns I randomly considered the numbers of housing applicants had doubled in recent years. The Minister of State will know that in Cork the number has gone from about 1,700 to over 3,000. In Galway a few years ago there were just about 700 applicants; now there are over 1,200. We are not meeting the demanded needs. I agree and welcome the fact that the Bill will go some way to helping those who can afford affordable housing.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State mentioned research in relation to housing needs, standards, management, etc. Can he be more specific about what he means by research? Does he mean research into the style of housing we should be building, accessibility for the disabled, or management structures for these houses? He was very vague and did not outline specifics.</P>
      <P>I also note the Minister of State is giving additional funding for voluntary groups. Following on commitments made in Action on Housing in June 2000, the borrowing limits of the Housing Finance Agency will be increased from £1.5 billion to &euro;6 billion. Both of these are welcome.</P>
      <P>The changes under sections 21 and 22 will get most attention. They affect people entering land that does not belong to them, perhaps establishing businesses or just using it. We are talking about Traveller families who establish themselves on lands either owned privately or by a local authority and the difficulty of having them removed. We must find a balance in the proper use of land.</P>
      <P>Those engaged in hill walking and those interested in angling and various other field sports have traditionally had access to lands. I am concerned that this change in the legislation might be used to exclude them and those who engage in properly regulated sports. How does the Minister propose to find a balance between this aspect and the right of those to ensure their land is not abused by people who may use it on a temporary basis by parking caravans and carrying on businesses, only to leave behind rubbish and detritus?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened to some of the debate in the Lower House dealing with Traveller families and accommodation. The Minister of State has trumpeted the number of houses built over the past five years but my records indicate that only 110 Traveller hard stands have been provided when there is a need for 2,000. What are the projected future <Col N="1453" /> needs? The &ldquo;not in my back yard&rdquo;&ndash; NIMBY &ndash; syndrome has meant this and previous Governments have failed to meet their targets in this area. Politicians know there are few if any votes in providing hard stands, which means there is no urgency in addressing the issue. An educational supplement in <i>The Irish Times</i> rightly praised a Traveller family with accommodation on a hard stand because a family member had obtained her junior certificate and was looking forward to continuing her education. A photograph of her was taken outside the hard stand. I do not know if it was deliberate or not, but it also showed bicycles thrown against the wall, old beds, bits of cardboard and other rubbish. While there is a duty to provide Travellers with facilities, they have a duty to maintain them.</P>
    <P>Should we aim to ensure that the traditional culture of travelling by the Traveller community is allowed and, if so, how is that to be balanced against the need to ensure that Traveller children are properly educated and to address the fact that life expectancy among Travellers is at least ten years less than in the settled community? There is also the need to increase the likelihood of Traveller children entering third level education, which currently stands at 0.0001%. How do we ensure that Traveller children have equal opportunities to those in the settled community? Does it mean we should ensure that Travellers are pampered? The House should debate these issues.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister of State indicate how it will be possible to exclude trespassers from lands owned by local authorities while ensuring that people have proper and reasonable access to them to engage in traditional sports? I will be proposing an amendment on Committee Stage to deal with damage done to caravans and other objects which are removed by local authorities. In one instance a local authority had to pay compensation for damage to a caravan which occurred as it was being removed. If a local authority goes to court with the Traveller community or any minority group the judge will generally tend to find against the authority on the basis that it can afford to pay. I have seen this happen repeatedly. I hope the Minister accepts my amendment. It will ensure that where local authorities or other parties remove an object with due care, be it a caravan or whatever, they will not be sued for damage that may occur.</P>
    <P>I agree with the general thrust of the Bill. Any measures that provide more and better accommodation are worth supporting. I recently discovered that a party to a joint ownership scheme had to deal with the removal of a ridge tile from the house. The person, who is part of a tenant purchase scheme, wanted to know if, in such circumstances, it is the responsibility of the local authority to insure the structure, as opposed to the contents, of the house. In this instance the authority did not insure the structure of the house. It would be in its interests to ensure that insurance is in place, in its own name or jointly <Col N="1454" /> with the occupiers, especially if it had to re-occupy the house. The Minister of State should address this aspect.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the provisions of the legislation being implemented as soon as possible. I also ask the Minister of State to respond to the points I have raised, including what is meant by research and the implications of excluding people from properties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister of State on introducing this important and much needed legislation. I welcome the increase in the borrowing limits of the Housing Finance Agency, from £1.5 billion to &euro;6 billion. It is an indication of the Government's commitment to ensuring that housing needs are addressed.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the putting of the local authority affordable housing scheme on a statutory basis. It will provide for a claw-back under the shared ownership scheme. It is another indication of the good work undertaken by the Minister of State in addressing the needs of the public.</P>
      <P>Senator Coogan referred to flexibility in the administration of the new housing grants scheme and the provision enabling the Minister to give financial assistance to organisations offering advice and research in this area. There must be research into these areas and the Department and the Minister are going down the right road in that regard. The measures taken by the Minister in the past year or two have brought some sort of normality to house prices. The measures taken in regard to affordable housing were a good step and will allow young married people to buy their own houses.</P>
      <P>Senator Coogan referred to Travellers. Since 1997 the Government has provided &euro;72 million for the provision of Traveller accommodation. It provided &euro;23 million last year for such accommodation. This indicates a commitment on the part of the Government, the Minister and the Department to housing for Travellers and to looking after their needs. I welcome the Bill and compliment the Minister on bringing it to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I welcome the Bill. Its purpose is to provide extra funding for more local authority housing and to put affordable and shared ownership housing on a statutory footing, which is right and proper. I welcome the Bill, although I have not studied it in any great detail. However, I have one or two reservations but the Minister of State may be able to provide guarantees in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the old Acts, someone living in a local authority house would, after a number of years, be able to buy the house for a negotiated price under the tenant purchase scheme. The local authority had a formula for working out the price. This Bill does not govern the voluntary housing sector. People who have been provided with housing by a voluntary housing authority will never be in a position to buy the house under a tenant purchase scheme. This is something the <Col N="1455" /> Minister of State might consider including in the Bill. The Government and local authorities are pumping more money into the voluntary housing sector. However, those who depend on voluntary housing will not have the same concessions as people who get a local authority house from the point of view that they will never be in a position to own their house.</P>
    <P>The aspiration of those who get a local authority house is that at some stage they may be in a position to buy the house from the local authority under the tenant purchase scheme. This will never be the case under the voluntary housing scheme because that sector seems to hold on to houses and not sell them to tenants under a tenant purchase scheme. This aspect should be looked at because all those in the voluntary housing sector have been on a housing waiting list and they should receive the same treatment.</P>
    <P>Another issue which has been brought to my attention recently relates to sporting groups. I would like the Minister of State to give a guarantee that the Bill when enacted will not in any way affect access of fishermen to lakes or rivers and that it will not affect people involved in climbing, mountaineering and so on. If the Bill is enacted in its current form, it could mean that access is denied to people involved in outdoor sporting activities. We all know what the fishing industry is worth to this country from a sporting and tourism point of view. Given our great trout and salmon fishing lakes and rivers, the fishing industry is a major national asset. I hope the Minister will guarantee that when the Bill is enacted, it will not prevent people from gaining access through private lands or from getting boats onto rivers and lakes to enjoy a day's fishing.</P>
    <P>The central and regional fisheries boards have done great work over the years in building up what is now one of our greatest assets. As we all know, the fishing industry is growing. As more people have more leisure time, they are taking up fishing as a sport. People have expressed fears to me that if section 21 is enacted, it will cast a doubt over accessibility to lakes and rivers. I hope this provision can be regulated in a proper fashion.</P>
    <P>Apart from these reservations, this is good legislation which is much needed. As more people come onto the housing list, more money needs to be invested in the housing industry. People who years ago could afford a house can no longer do so. Therefore, there will be more responsibility on local authorities to provide more housing in the future. I welcome the Bill and hope the Minister of State will be able to allay the fears expressed to me in regard to access to rivers, lakes, mountains and so on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and congratulate him on bringing forward this very important and wide-ranging legislation. I would like to refer briefly to the affordable and shared ownership housing scheme which will now be put on a statutory basis. The flexibility in <Col N="1456" /> regard to the administration of grants is to be welcomed. Many young people will be delighted to hear they are now being looked after, particularly young people who are ready to settle down but cannot find accommodation.</P>
      <P>However, I am concerned about one aspect of the Bill of which I have a great knowledge and background. This relates to sections 20 and 24 which deal with huge, unauthorised and illegal Traveller encampments. I wish to preface my remarks by saying that I am, and always have been, committed to the Traveller's programme. A very fine programme is in place in my constituency where young Travellers attend the local school and are involved in the local GAA club. This works very well.</P>
      <P>The sad part is that those Travellers are now suffering from being associated with the huge illegal encampments I have witnessed in my electoral area of Rathfarnham. This time last year, over 150 caravans moved up along the Dodder and encamped in the public space along the linear park. These are people who already have accommodation, who are better off than you and I and who own businesses throughout the country, but because of the very nature of their lives, they decided they wanted to move.</P>
      <P>I do not object to that, it is part of their culture. However, I do object to this huge incursion into public and private land and to the intimidation and breach of public order, and that is why I welcome this legislation. The amendment to the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994 gives the Garda the power to step in and help public representatives and local authorities in tackling this problem.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the huge commitment of the Government to this and that the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, has met county managers throughout the greater Dublin area to try to find a way of getting transient sites up and running. I have no difficulty with that &ndash; we need a transient site in each local authority and to co-ordinate the activities of Kildare County Council, South Dublin County Council and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council so that Travellers moving from one place to another can be accommodated.</P>
      <P>However, we do not and should not have a duty of care for those Travellers who decide to move up from the country to Dublin and destroy our environment, our amenities and public spaces and intrude upon people's lifestyles. The Dodder linear park is a beautiful amenity area which residents and locals use every summer for walks and leisure activities. It was destroyed last summer. It was a disgrace to see the type of objects that were dumped in the Dodder and to see how these people conducted their business and then dumped the leftovers of these business activities in the evenings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had no power to do anything about this. The Garda had no power and when the local authority brought the matter to the High Court it was told the Travellers could not be moved on unless there was a site to move them to. This was <Col N="1457" /> crazy; the whole system had broken down. I congratulate the local residents, who were very fair minded and tolerant in trying to solve this problem with us. They gave us a hard time as public representatives, but we were absolutely frustrated in trying to find a solution. I congratulate the residents for standing back and trying to help us. They were prepared to do everything they could to see how best we could remove the encampments. However, the power to do so was not there, and I welcome this legislation for giving a stronger hand to the Garda to act to move these encampments on if they refuse to move of their own accord. The Garda can now arrest without a warrant, and their hand is also strengthened in terms of the ability to confiscate property.</P>
    <P>I want to see the legislation in action. I ask the Minister to reinforce the point in his reply that when these illegal encampments are established, I can phone the local Garda station and ask them to come down and remove these caravans. It would be great if I could relay this message to the people of Rathfarnham, and I seek the Minister's assurance on this.</P>
    <P>Of course we have a duty of care and a duty to find accommodation for people in our own jurisdiction. However, it is these business Travellers I object to. I am committed to the Travellers programme, and it is most unfair that those Travellers who I know are settling in very well are now being tarred with the same brush. I feel great sympathy with those Travellers, but it is the large, illegal encampments I am concerned about. I was quite nervous when I went to visit one myself. I have spoken at length with the residents around the Dodder and asked them to be patient with us and they have been more than patient.</P>
    <P>The Minister is to be congratulated on this legislation, which I thought was not going to be introduced. The trespass laws are the key issue, and it is a great step forward that the Garda can arrest people, remove objects, take these people's businesses from them and tell them to move on. However, we must compel local authorities to act because county managers are not prepared to reach out and find transient sites. They adhere to the practice in theory and draw up future plans for sites, but each local authority area should have at least one transient site catering for at least 20 caravans.</P>
    <P>Neighbouring local authorities should co-operate to ensure a balanced allocation of places on transient sites. Unless we have the back-up provision of transient sites, we are going to have a repeat of what happened in Rathfarnham last year. As it is, there are ten caravans still in place along the Dodder, which we cannot move because we have nowhere to place them. Even when we do find places for these people, some of them do not want to go because they do not like the other people already in the transient sites. The power of local authorities has to be enforced so that the people in these encampments can be offered alternative accommodation or else an ultimatum to leave the area altogether.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1458" />The public are crying out for support, and the danger is that people might eventually take the issue into their own hands. I do not think this will happen now because we can tell them this legislation will work. It is the first time I have seen real progress in this area, but we now want to see practical action. I compliment the Minister on bringing this legislation forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House, but I wish more time had been taken to consult with groups involved in this issue. There has been a total lack of consultation. It is appalling that in a week when we have been trying to raise awareness of anti-racism, of the need for inclusiveness and understanding cultural differences, we have failed to talk with and get the views of those involved in the consultation process conducted by the Minister's own Department. It is unbelievable that there has been no consultation with that group. The Department set up a group specifically for the purpose of consultation but then introduces legislation without consultation. If I am wrong on this, I stand ready to be corrected.</P>
      <P>All sorts of emotive things can be said about the Traveller issue, which is the core issue I want to focus on, particularly the criminalising of people. On the one hand, members of the Traveller community are citizens of this State and have the same rights and entitlements as everybody else, which need to be protected. However, no one can justify the behaviour of some Travellers, who engage in blackmail and extortion of money when it comes to the issue of illegal encampments in scenic areas, sports fields and residential areas. That is wrong.</P>
      <P>Two incorrect forms of behaviour occur here. The State is not fulfilling its statutory responsibilities to the Traveller community and certain members of the Traveller community are behaving in an anti-social manner. These gaps need to be bridged. However, we must ensure that legislative action is not taken with a blunt instrument approach, as it is in this Bill. This legislation is directed at all Travellers, regardless of whether they are law-abiding. We must not make victims of individual Travellers who, due to over-crowding at halting sites, have no choice but to settle on private grounds. We must distinguish between such people and those who deliberately come into settled communities and terrorise them with a view to extorting money. Let us distinguish between crime and need. The problem I have with this legislation is that it does not make such a distinction.</P>
      <P>We know what the problems in this area are, but we have responded to them with a knee-jerk methodology. Such State action affects all members of the Traveller community. We might just as well have a law that criminalises all Cork people, because some of them have broken the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The consultative committee on Traveller accommodation is appalled by this legislation. <Col N="1459" /> This is the very committee which we set up to assess the needs of Travellers and I want to know why the Minister did not consult it when this legislation was being drafted. Consultation with that committee would not have necessitated any softening of our position on Travellers who break the law.</P>
    <P>A school in Ennis had to be closed down last year when a group of Travellers camped in the grounds there and refused to move. Those Travellers created chaos. That is a fact and I have no problem with saying that. However, we must also remember that most local authorities are failing in their responsibilities to provide adequate accommodation for the Traveller community.</P>
    <P>On the one hand, we are being pushed along by a reactionary, racist view of Travellers and, on the other, we have people who suggest that Travellers can do no wrong. The truth is in the middle. People who represent the Traveller community tend to be sensible, with a clear view of the world, who do not attempt to justify unacceptable or criminal behaviour.</P>
    <P>The section of this Bill which deals with offences relating to entering and occupying land without consent does not take into account the reality of the accommodation situation for Travellers. Where overcrowding takes place, families have no choice but to camp in areas other than a halting site and they should not be criminalised for doing so. This is an issue of justice. If we actually delivered on all of our commitments regarding Traveller accommodation and certain groups continued to form illegal encampments, we could justify taking legal action against them.</P>
    <P>I am opposed to what is taking place along the river Dodder and to what is happening at illegal camps around the country. I am equally appalled by the conditions in which Travellers are living, in wasteland around Blanchardstown, where they have no water. Such Travellers have a high incidence of illness and a high rate of infant mortality. That is criminal.</P>
    <P>It is the lack of balance within this legislation that creates these problems. We must be a humane but strong society. The rules must be implemented. We must not run along with every liberal view, but similarly we must not be driven by every reactionary view. Our society should reflect an intercultural community, where Travellers are respected and are part of what we are.</P>
    <P>It is wrong that some Travellers engage in anti-social behaviour. However, it is equally wrong that, while we live in one of the most advanced communities in the OECD, Travellers have the lowest life expectancy, highest level of infant mortality, lowest levels of access to running water and the lowest levels of housing. Local authorities are not delivering. I am not being pious about this. I appreciate that there are political reasons behind it, but we must acknowledge that it is criminal that kids are dying on caravan sites because we are not housing them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1460" />If there were balance in the legislation, I could accept it. However, I cannot accept the criminalisation of people who are simply trying to find a space to live and raise their families. In every walk of life, there are good and bad people. We must ensure that the people on whom we impose the letter of the law are acting with criminal intent. We must not criminalise those who are merely trying to survive in a set of circumstances which we have created.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very grateful to Senator O'Toole for agreeing to share his time with me. I am very interested in speaking on this issue because I was the person who pioneered those clauses in equality legislation that protect the rights of Travellers. I have great sympathy for their situation. I have reservations about the lack of consultation during the drafting of this Bill. There is a consultative council for Travellers and they were not included in this process. In the interests of democracy, it was important that they should have been included and their reservations and problems be taken into account.</P>
      <P>The lack of accommodation provided for Travellers must also be addressed. Where are they to go? The rights of decent, ordinary Traveller families must be protected. That is a real problem. A former Minister of State, Deputy Chris Flood, has expressed his concerns about this legislation. Others have said that it could lead to confrontation and violence between groups of Travellers and the Garda, which would be regrettable. There is a need for balance.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that as opposed to the individual situation of Traveller families there have been large-scale intrusions of families from the United Kingdom. They bring a lot of vehicles with them, many are wealthy traders and they engage in blackmail. They deliberately target schools, places of public amenity and residential areas. They then use the inconvenience they cause to extort money. We have heard of some demanding £3,000 to move on. They break through gates during the night and say the gates were open and they were therefore not involved in a criminal act.</P>
      <P>There has been a lot of pressure on authorities to resolve this problem. An individual citizen only has recourse to civil law but that is expensive and time consuming. Often by the time a citizen has spent his or her money the travellers have moved to some place else to make another killing. That is unfair. In saying we need balance I mean we must also have balance in terms of the rights of individual residents in any area. That applies in particular when schools are affected. It is abominable that some of the large scale encampments have left sites near schools in not just untidy or unpleasant condition but in an unsanitary condition which is a danger to health. In at least one school a series of scheduled matches had to be put off because of this. That might appear a trivial matter but it is important for the affected community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1461" />For example, the area along the Dodder was a notable cause of complaint and the situation there was nothing other than a public scandal. The decent members of the Traveller community here would be deeply ashamed of the behaviour of others in their community. I have listened to debates on this subject on radio and I pay tribute to the decent corporation spokespersons I have heard. They have endless patience and within the restrictions of their budget and of the political framework provided for them they have attempted to cope.</P>
    <P>I support the Bill but I hope it will be sensitively administered and that our own decent Travellers will be properly treated and not subjected to the strictest provisions of the criminal law in circumstances where fate has driven them into the situation. The House should remember that to travel is part of their culture. There was a wonderful programme on RTÉ some weeks ago which started with a man taking photographs of travellers. It showed the travellers again 30 years after the original photographs. There was one beautiful woman who sang and 30 years later she sang the same song again in Galway. Although her face was now weather-beaten she was really lovely. She visited some friends in Galway city where the husband, a fine upstanding man with a twinkle in his eye, made the point that he is stuck in the house, that the local authority makes it impossible for him to keep animals near the house and that it is in their blood to want to travel.</P>
    <P>We all think of travel at this time of year. As &ldquo;Mise Raftairí&rdquo; says:</P>
    <P>Anois teacht an Earraigh beidh an lá ag dul chun síneadh</P>
    <P>&lsquo;S tar éis na Féile Bríde árdóidh mé mo sheol.</P>
    <P>There is something in the Irish spirit that likes the idea of wandering and on a beautiful day like this what could be more heavenly than trundling around a provincial side road. However, the weather is not always good and travellers have a difficult and harsh life.</P>
    <P>We must ensure the law, when passed, is administered fairly. When I was young Travellers were a sight to behold because they had wonderful barrel-shaped caravans driven by horses. They made tin cans, mended buckets for farmers and were an integral part of our lives. The progress of modern times has dislodged them from this and now a substantial section of the Traveller community, particularly those who come from England with expensive cars and trailers, make a lot of money in hard cash which is not returned for tax purposes. They have all the advantages of taxes paid by the settled community and then use blackmail and operate outside the law.</P>
    <P>We are all citizens and must obey the law. It is a pity the situation has been pushed to the extent where we have got to introduce this legislation. I have great sympathy for Travellers, particularly our own. They have only their own cousins, who <Col N="1462" /> come in from England, to blame for what is happening. I appeal to the Garda to treat sensitively the individual Traveller families who may be suffering hardship and difficulty. The Garda will have the support of the community if they impose the full rigours of the law on the wealthy groups of Travellers who come in and abuse the privilege of being in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and his officials. I also welcome this important Bill. We tend to take notice mainly of the sections in relation to Travellers. There are other important sections in the Bill.</P>
      <P>In relation to housing development, I recall as a member of a local authority in 1997 when Departments made moneys available. We were not in a position then to build houses because we did not have land available and had to be provided with extra land and infrastructure, water and sewerage services, to enable us address the housing needs of people. Will the Minister tell us what allocations were made to local authorities over the last number of years and did any local authority ever use their allocation in relation to the needs of Traveller accommodation? I feel confident in saying that in most cases it was not used. There is an onus on all local authorities to provide serviced hard-stands urgently. If we do not provide them we are on a collision course with the unfortunate people who have no accommodation. Some of them do not want housing but want to continue to travel from place to place.</P>
      <P>Traveller trailers are another problem with which this Bill will deal efficiently and effectively. They created problems in Naas mart where they moved in and wrecked the place. In many cases they moved onto playing fields or onto private lands and would only move on when paid to move. The leader would get a payment of thousands of pounds and only then would they move on for fine pickings elsewhere. That will be addressed in this Bill and we welcome it.</P>
      <P>Local authorities have moved in recent years towards providing &ldquo;turn key&rdquo; houses built by contract developers. Senator Coogan made an important point in relation to the housing finance agency provided for section 15. We must ensure those houses are maintained and insured, otherwise people can walk away from them resulting in huge expense being incurred to bring them back to an acceptable standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State has outlined many important sections in the Bill where there are substantial improvements for developers providing houses. Perhaps the Minister of State would clarify if the total floor area of a house is what is referred to in the legislation for grant purposes. Is it proposed to change the square footage of houses that qualify for grant aid? We need to examine the issue of the floor area as there may be problems for people building standard-type family houses in qualifying for grant aid. We realise that the grant aid is important. I welcome <Col N="1463" /> the provision of grant aid for first time builders of houses.</P>
    <P>There are problems in relation to planning for housing in rural areas. People are moving into rural areas because we are not providing private sites on serviced land in towns and villages. This is a matter for local authorities. The Minister of State's Department has made money available and it should instruct county managers and local authorities to provide more private sites so that people who want to stay in their parishes can build there rather than moving into rural areas where they will have planning problems. This is a matter we must consider.</P>
    <P>There are also problems in relation to halting sites and hard stands and there is an onus on local authority members to deal with them. That is what they are elected for, not to take the soft options. Local authority members are elected to make hard decisions. There will be more problems for Travellers seeking accommodation as a result of this Bill because of regulations as to where they can and cannot park. This means local authorities must provide permanent housing. If they do not, they will have to opt for halting sites or hard stands with ancillary services, the cost of which is not huge.</P>
    <P>The voluntary housing sector needs to be examined. I welcome the section which deals with the tenant purchase scheme because there is a claw-back provision. Many people purchased houses from their local authorities, lived in them for a number of years and sold them, making substantial profits while leaving the local authority with no way to recoup their money. In many cases, local authorities in rural areas had paid between £80,000 to £100,000 to provide accommodation and, within three or four years, people had sold the houses on.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minster of State well with this Bill even though people will have objections, particularly to the section relating to Travellers. People will also recognise that we must move on. We can no longer leave people on the sides of the roads with the dangers of traffic and so on. We must provide facilities for them to get off the public roads and this Bill is a move in the right direction. I compliment the Minister of State and his officials on bringing this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and I welcome certain sections of the Bill but not others. I see this legislation, coming at this time and with the twist that has been put on it, as a blatant political gimmick which masks the bankruptcy of Government housing policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will cite some statistics from the March 2002 edition of <i>Simon Community News</i> to illustrate what has not happened during the term of this Government. In 1991 there were 2,751 homeless people, in 1993 there were 2,367, and in 1996 there were 2,501. In the first half of the 1990s, therefore, the numbers were gradually decreasing <Col N="1464" /> to a manageable level. However, in 1999 the figure jumped to 5,234. The 2002 figure is pending and, although we do not have it yet, I can assure the Minister of State that it will show another substantial increase.</P>
    <P>The number of homeless people was kept to that level when things were beginning to improve with the massive boom that the Celtic tiger provided. It is a disgrace that there was a more than doubling of the number of homeless people in the first three years of the Government's stewardship.</P>
    <P>The housing lists have increased to 150,000 and the figures for Traveller accommodation are scandalous. The 1995 task force report on the Traveller community recommended that 2,200 units of accommodation should be provided. In the seven years since, 111 units have been provided. In other words, 95% of the proposed accommodation has not been provided over a seven year period and Fianna Fáil has been in Government for virtually all of that period. Indeed, we are coming into the seventh year of that period.</P>
    <P>Young couples cannot afford accommodation, sites or property because it is largely the preserve of speculators and the big business community and we have seen what that has produced in terms of corruption around the country. Private rented accommodation is&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I will talk to the Senator later and I may be able to describe some people and building sites, in relation to which questions need to be answered.</P>
      <P>The cost of private rented accommodation is astronomical and there are as many evictions taking place now as during the worst days of the 19th century in rural Ireland. People attending my constituency clinics have been evicted from private rented accommodation because the landlord wants to put in tenants who can pay a higher rent, but the health board cannot afford to pay the higher rental allowance. In the meantime, vast profits are being made by speculators. The Minister is passing the buck in this legislation and placing responsibility for the provision of social affordable accommodation on voluntary housing associations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no objection to housing associations coming into the market to provide affordable housing, but that is not where the major thrust of our efforts should be directed. Local authorities have a responsibility to provide housing and the Government has a responsibility to provide fin<Col N="1465" /> ance for it. Passing it on to another body is not the answer to reaching housing targets. Most of the housing associations are not Irish bodies. Increasingly they are coming in from England, so the majority of such housing is not being provided by indigenous housing associations. I would like the Minister to comment on that.</P>
    <P>These housing associations seem to have a bias towards single unit accommodation so they can obtain a greater capital grant from the Department of the Environment and Local Government. They are to some extent milking the Department for the construction they undertake because in virtually all cases they are getting the maximum grant available. A considerable amount of monitoring of these housing associations is required. They may be good associations, such as the Simon Community or local co-operatives which respond to the direct needs of those whom they represent, but others are business operators seeking to obtain the maximum profit from the market. We must examine the fact that, to an increasing extent, social and affordable housing now comes within the remit of housing associations.</P>
    <P>It is deceitful to introduce the element concerning travelling people in this legislation. The amendment the Minister introduced does not deal with housing, but with trespass, extortion and law breaking. Such matters should be dealt with in legislation introduced by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It is common knowledge that there have been abuses of trespass and extortion and that Travellers have used their position to break the law. That has been reported in the media and it should be targeted, but not in the context of housing the Traveller community. In this Bill, the Minister is tarring every Traveller with the same brush.</P>

      <P>That is what is happening and that is why the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is meeting representatives of the Traveller community today. The Minister should remember that this section was introduced without any consultation with the Traveller community, despite commitments to the social partnership of which the Traveller community forms part of the third strand. A task force was established to examine this situation and make recommendations, but the community was by-passed. That is not a consultative approach. I have come to the conclusion that this is an election gimmick so that Fianna Fáil can say, &ldquo;We have become tough on Travellers because we are looking for votes&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I am not alone in saying this; it is being said by the Traveller community also. If it is not a gimmick, why was there no consultation with Traveller groups? Why has the measure been introduced in this Bill? The Minister should admit that it is a gimmick. It is sad that having introduced this element into the Bill, the statistics reveal the hopelessness of the efforts that have been made by local authorities to house Travellers. Why has the Minister for the Environment and Local Government not insisted on better efforts being made to provide such accommodation? That is the scandal. People, including the Traveller community, can see that discrimination remains. As Travellers have a nomadic tradition, they are all being regarded with suspicion as trespassers who indulge in questionable activities.</P>
      <P>The Minister should have imposed penalties on local authorities, such as the penalties that are to be imposed on Travellers, for not fulfilling their legal obligations to provide necessary housing.</P>

I want the Landlord and Tenant Act to be changed dramatically, but these important issues have not been addressed. A <i>laissez-faire</i> approach has been taken by this Administration to the provision of housing and accommodation generally. Every time Fianna Fáil comes into power, the public sector side of legislation is always neglected. On every occasion that Labour and Fine Gael have been in power we have addressed housing needs in substantial terms and the numbers on the waiting list have always decreased.

      <P>If the Labour Party is in power after the election, I can guarantee that the same procedure will recommence concerning all these <Col N="1467" /> housing matters. We will not come up with simple gimmicks at the eleventh hour to give the impression that something is being done about the problem. This scandal is emanating from the Government side.</P>
      <P>The Bill refers to the Docklands Authority and I am delighted that authority is seeking the same 20% social affordable housing mix as is contained in other legislation passed in the last year. The Docklands Authority has been negligent, however, in terms of its own social remit. The terms of reference of the Docklands Authority aim to provide for social and economic rejuvenation of the area. The authority is providing for economic rejuvenation but it has been negligent in the degree of social services it has provided. There is a considerable backlog to be dealt with in that respect.</P>
      <P>In my constituency, the East Wall area has not been touched by the docklands revival. It might as well be out in the desert. It is an intact community of 3,500 to 4,000 souls which is part of the docklands area, yet it has not benefited one iota from the money pumped into the docklands. This cannot be allowed to continue. The legislation refers to the matter.</P>
      <P>It is already within the remit of the docklands authority to deal with these communities, but it is not doing so. If a body has a dual mandate of social and economic revival, it cannot be limited to the economic side. The Minister has a role in this matter to ensure both elements of the mandate take place. I know good people work for the docklands authority and are on the board, but they are often banging their heads against a wall when it comes to implementing the social side in terms of quality of life, building up communities, landscaping, amenities, recreational facilities and all the items which define community.</P>
      <P>What the Minister of State is bringing into law is welcome, but can he give me some assurance that, in a few years' time, I will see, not just high rise buildings along the docklands skyline, but also the reinvigorated communities of East Wall, Sheriff Street and Ringsend, all of which are still marginalised? The newcomers to the area are doing well and much new business has been established. However, unless it has a ripple effect on local communities, it is not succeeding.</P>
      <P>I do not have any problems with the element of the legislation dealing with affordability. I recommend that the Minister of State keep an eye on some of the housing agencies and bodies entering the market. I also want him to keep an eye on the docklands development authority. Even though it is doing a good job in certain areas, the social factor has been neglected. I oppose the section criminalising the Traveller community.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill and its provisions. A few matters require comment. I note that under section 8 each housing authority is to establish a scheme to determine the order of priority to be given to people to whom affordable houses are being made available for sale. There is a broader dimension to this relating to people on housing lists and the length of time they are on them. It is a problem and causes frustration for the clients of local authorities that they are not able to discover their position on the list. I understand there are emergency cases and priorities which must be dealt with by health board personnel and local authorities. That said, there is probably insufficient transparency in this area. If there was more, some of the disquiet which tends to arise in the allocation of houses could be allayed and people could have a clearer understanding of their position in the order of priorities. We have made some progress in this respect in County Kildare and it is welcome. However, more could be done. This might be taken into account.</P>
      <P>Listening to Senator Costello reminded me of Deputy Stagg's intervention at last Monday's meeting of Kildare County Council. The Deputy appears to disregard the figures enunciated by the Minister of State which have been repeatedly emphasised in debates in the House by the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy. I congratulate both Ministers of State and everyone in the Department of the Environment and Local Government on the progress made during the lifetime of the Government. It appears that, in Deputy Stagg's case, if something is repeated often enough even though it is not a fact, it becomes accepted as a fact. Deputy Stagg appears to disregard the figures for the number of new houses built and starts made by local authorities. A total of 5,000 units were completed under the multi-annual approach last year, the highest level for 15 years. The statistics contradict the assertions made by Deputy Stagg and Senator Costello.</P>
      <P>Another aspect of the Bill concerns information on the prioritisation of clients and points and so on for securing local authority houses. I note that consultants are to examine the house price information obtained by the Department and that there are recommendations regarding information technology. That is welcome because we do not have enough information at our disposal in this area, even regarding housing lists. A great deal has been said about the scale of housing lists and it is correct to say it is disturbing. Any public representative or citizen would be disturbed by the number of people on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is sometimes the case that, when houses are allocated, people do not accept them. There appears to be a mismatch between the number on housing lists and the number who avail of the houses when allocated them. One would expect that, when houses are allocated, those at the top <Col N="1469" /> of the list, the most urgent cases, would be given houses and that they would accept the offer when it came their way. However, it has been my experience that sometimes they do not.</P>
    <P>There is another dimension to this, namely, the fact that local authority houses lie idle for a long time. I receive inquiries on a weekly basis about certain houses which are vacant asking the reason access cannot be gained or they are not allocated. The local authority's answer is that they must be renovated and brought up to a required standard for people to live in them. People are sometimes willing to carry out the works, but the authorities reply that that cannot be done or the people concerned must employ a registered builder. While I accept people must be tax compliant, when the building sector was booming it was extremely difficult to hire contractors or tradespeople to do these relatively minor tasks to bring houses up to a required standard. That is an area which must be examined and about which something must be done.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 14 whereby a leasing arrangement can be made between local authorities and property owners to make their private accommodation available to tenants designated by the authorities. The health boards use this facility extensively. If there are instances when a local authority can bid for a property, that could also be used as a way of relieving the logjam.</P>
    <P>On section 21 concerning the law as it pertains to Travellers, I had experience as a land owner of a small group of Travellers camping adjacent to my residence on a piece of road being installed to facilitate the construction of a bridge. They did not create any trouble, kept the encampment clean and were model citizens in every respect. Suddenly the small group was supplanted by a much larger one and the smaller group had to leave. When I approached one member of the larger group the response I received was: &ldquo;I hope you sleep well in your bed tonight.&rdquo; Fortunately, another member of the group quickly admonished the person who said that to me. However, what the first person had said to me was illegal. It is against the law to make a threat like that.</P>
    <P>The Garda must be given power to operate the law, irrespective of whether it concerns a settled citizen or a Traveller citizen. I see no distinction in that regard. We are all bound by law and, in circumstances where private property is invaded &ndash; and I use that word advisedly &ndash; it should be open to the Garda to intervene if necessary.</P>
    <P>There is a very good model for this in English law, which was shown to me by a Garda officer, in the context of the incursion at Stonehenge by New Age travellers. The law was amended &ndash; very effectively, in my view &ndash; to ensure that, where there was disorder or very large-scale damage to property, the matter could be addressed. I believe that is the correct approach.</P>
    <P>The difficulty with regard to private property, as opposed to public property, as I understand it and subject to correction by the Minister of State, <Col N="1470" /> is that it is up to the private citizen who owns the property to seek recourse through the courts to get an injunction against the people who have entered the property. That is a very expensive and slow process and, in my view, it is wrong that people who look after their property well should be subjected to that cost and inconvenience.</P>
    <P>I accept that local authorities, including elected members, are culpable in that respect. Frequently, local authority members have not had the courage to designate locations for halting sites. In my local authority area of County Kildare, we amended the draft plan for Kilcullen to put in a halting site. Despite considerable controversy, it was designated in the plan. There is still no halting site in existence but at least it is designated.</P>
    <P>It is reasonable to provide that, where a member of the Garda Síochána has reason to believe a person has committed or is committing an offence under the Bill, the member may demand of that person his or her name and address and direct the person to leave the land and remove any object from the land which is owned by, or under the control of, that person.</P>
    <P>I grew up in a rural community. At that time, it was standard practice for people who were then known as &ldquo;tinkers&rdquo;&ndash; which was not then a term of opprobrium &ndash; to arrive on the farm with their small family and their horse and cart and to set up camp there. They were provided with hay for their horses and farm produce for the family during the two or three days they stayed there. They also got jobs during the harvesting of grain or beet crops and then they moved on. Nowadays, if somebody were to take compassion on one particular family, there would be an invasion within a very short time.</P>
    <P>There have been instances in my local town, Newbridge, where money was demanded before Travellers would move on. That is wrong and should not be allowed. We need to distinguish between the categories of persons to whom we are referring. Some of them are definitely operating outside the law and it should be amended to deal effectively with those situations. I do not regard that as racist.</P>
    <P>Issues were raised with regard to field sports people entering land, such as for fishing or shooting purposes. I am chairman of a local angling club with fishing rights on the River Liffey. The riparian owners are very co-operative and we have enjoyed &ldquo;grace and favour&rdquo; rights for a very long time. I do not regard that as being in any way jeopardised. As invitees &ndash; I believe that is the correct technical term &ndash; we are entitled to be on the land. I know of no fisherman who would knowingly cause damage to property. Indeed, in my own experience as a landowner whose land borders on the Liffey, fishermen have often come to the door to report a problem on the farm, such as an animal in difficulty or whatever. That is a positive aspect. I am sure the Minister of State can confirm that there is no question that people <Col N="1471" /> who enjoy legitimate rights to go on to property would be penalised in any respect. If people engage in poaching, they should be dealt with in the same way as others who invade private property and cause damage.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister of State, his fellow Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, and their Department for the action they have taken in this area over the lifetime of the Government. It has been most effective and this Bill seals it very well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. D. Cregan Mr. D. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. He and I have been involved at local authority level since 1979. As a former Lord Mayor of Cork in 1984-85, he is very familiar with the responsibilities of local authorities in relation to housing. I am glad this Bill is being brought to the House by a person who is well aware of the problems in this regard.</P>
      <P>I particularly welcome the Bill in terms of its open approach to the provision of funds. Housing authorities have major problems in meeting the requirement for accommodation. In Cork city, availability of land for public housing is a problem. There are also problems in securing planning permission, against which there are strong objections.</P>
      <P>I am glad that, at long last, the Minister of State and his Department have opened up opportunities for people to do things for themselves. In 1985, when we introduced the £5,000 grants scheme, we eliminated our housing problems in Cork city. That showed what can be achieved by allowing people to take initiatives on their own behalf.</P>
      <P>Section 7 of this Bill provides opportunities with regard to social housing and I hope the Minister of State may elaborate on that in his reply to this debate. The provision for 20% social and affordable housing in new housing developments is a very positive measure. People who are prepared to purchase their own homes deserve every possible support. There is some resistance to the idea of combining public and private housing in the same development. By providing grants and, especially, mortgages at affordable terms, a better image is projected on the basis that people are buying their own homes, even though they are being assisted.</P>
      <P>That was done in the early 1960s when working class people were assisted by the local authority to purchase houses in areas such as Farmlea, with which the Minister of State is familiar. For example, my brother, who bought one of those houses in 1963, paid off his last instalment just 12 months ago. The repayment over a period of almost 40 years was in the region of £2.90 per month. I see no reason to prevent comparable assistance being provided now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rent allowance amounted to £12 million in 1984 and this year's figure will be £140 million. There should be greater emphasis on using the provisions of section 7 of the Bill to promote <Col N="1472" /> house purchase, rather than renting. The Government should give all possible assistance to encourage people to provide for themselves in that regard. That is a much more cost-effective approach.</P>
    <P>Why not consider second generation mortgages? That is common practice in other European countries. Banks seem to expect people to pay mortgages over a period of 20 to 25 years. On that basis, a couple who marry at age 25 would have paid off their mortgage at age 45. In the meantime, they are restricted as to what they can do with the property and they are heavily burdened by the repayments. They should be given every assistance and it is imperative that we be seen to do this.</P>
    <P>This opportunity arises in section 7, which deals with regulations on the social housing mix. We should not use the term &ldquo;mix&rdquo;. There is no difference between the person who is able to buy on the private market and their sister or brother who does not have the same finances. We should say that assistance will be given to some 20% of people, without referring to the fact that they may be on the local authority housing list. For far too long we differentiated between &ldquo;them&rdquo; and &ldquo;us&rdquo; and now is the opportunity to tackle it in this legislation.</P>
    <P>I resent so much focus on the Traveller community with regard to the Bill. There is much more substance in this Bill than its effects on the Traveller community. I do not wish to demean anyone but there is a problem regarding the Traveller community which needs to be addressed, as this Bill is attempting to do.</P>
    <P>Currently the health authorities handle rent allowances. The Minister of State should seek to ensure that this is done by housing authorities. There are some excellent housing authorities, such as the one in Cork, that would be able to handle any problem. There was a recommendation in 1995 that there should be regional housing authorities. What is the point of the health boards allocating money when the city authorities are looking for it? Imagine what the housing authority could do with the amount of money the Southern Health Board has for rent allowance. They could assist people to do something for themselves and we would get much more benefit for our money. More people would benefit than is currently the case. It is important that nobody is demeaned by giving the impression that we are providing charity to them. This is taxpayers' money and we should use every facility possible.</P>
    <P>In 1985 some 5,500 houses were bought back at a cost of £5,000 each in a 14-month period. We did not have a housing problem in 1987. We had a surplus of local authority housing. While I was one of the people who pushed very strongly for it, I admit that the scheme was too good. In the city of Cork there are currently 4,000 applications on the housing list which amounts to some 10,000 people or an average of 3.3 people per application. That is mirrored throughout the country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1473" />There is a problem in regard to where we can build. If an attempt is made to put up 90 houses in an area the people in the neighbourhood object and say they only want 80. There is strong objection to local authority housing schemes.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State should ensure, by regulation, that every assistance possible is given to people who wish to buy their own homes. We should consider the promotion of second generation mortgages. The Minister should not be afraid to do that and every assistance possible should be given to people in this regard.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about section 24 concerning sporting bodies. I know the Minister of State spoke about this area on the radio this morning and I await his reply with interest. Sporting bodies are concerned because they may need to go on to private property to recover balls and so on. This provision needs to be looked at, as it states that if one is seen to enter private lands one can be fined &euro;3,000. I urge the Minister of State to look again at this area.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister of State on the Bill. Progress in this area has been long overdue and a facility has to be given to the vast majority of people who are prepared to do something for themselves if they get the assistance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief so the Minister will have time to reply. Concerns have been expressed about section 24. The Traveller community has been in touch with us saying there has been no consultation with them about it. I am well aware that there are serious social problems with them in various parts of urban areas in particular, but I wonder if we are going the right way with this blunderbuss attempt to deal with the situation. I hope the Minster of State will go very slowly through this section on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Section 22 regarding the Dublin docklands development also presents issues of concern. I hope that the Dublin Docklands Development Authority honours this section more than previous commitments it has made. In the original plan, stack A was to consist partly of a museum of some description but now that tenders have gone in for the museum the allocated space has been severely curtailed. I have been involved in attempts to set up a science museum and have been in contact with the Tánaiste, in particular, regarding it. Much more space has been given to high class retail shops, and while I accept that it is important that such places fund themselves, there are public duties on those who have responsibility for these developments. There is an onus on them to comply with the commitments they have made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank each Member who contributed to the general debate and gave a welcome to the Bill. The Bill reflects the radical approach to housing taken by the Government in the past five years and marks a further stage in the comprehensive and cohesive range of measures introduced in the housing area.</P>
      <P>During a debate on a Private Members' motion in the House on 6 February this year and again at the start of the debate today, I underlined the unprecedented priority attached to housing during the term of the Government. We have been tireless in the pursuit of a fair, equitable and sustainable housing market, in terms of both private and social housing and have set out our aims and systematically achieved them. Our emphasis has been on the attainment of a high level of housing output, stabilising house prices and expanding the range of supply of social and affordable housing, as well as developing the private rented sector and improving the quality of the management of the public housing stock. In all of these we have been remarkably successful.</P>
      <P>The central plank of the Bill is the provision of increased funding to the Housing Finance Agency, which now stands at &euro;6 billion. The increased borrowing capacity and the more flexible lending capacity capabilities of the agency will ensure that the housing targets of the national development plan are met and will help to consolidate and improve on the record levels of output achieved over the past number of years.</P>
      <P>Since the Bill was first published we have introduced an important provision by way of an amendment to the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994, to deal with the problematic issue of unauthorised encampments. The existing law in this area had been overtaken by circumstances. In particular where large-scale encampments were involved, it was felt to be inadequate to deal with all situations involved in such encampments. The inclusion of these provisions in the Bill provides the necessary legislative support to sustain the effort being made by Government which has recently given rise to much genuine concern.</P>
      <P>Total housing output last year reached 52,602 units, up 5.6% on the previous year. Last year was the fifth successive year of record housing output under the Government. Housing output in the greater Dublin area reached almost 16,500 units, the highest level ever. Private housing output was also up last year, by 2%, not down as was suggested in some quarters. The private housing building sector is healthy due to the wide range of measures to increase housing supply introduced in the recent budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the Government came into office, housing output has increased by over 33% and our record speaks for itself. Senator Coogan queried that record and I agree that it takes time to increase output. He also queried research, but the <Col N="1475" /> Bill's provisions in this regard are wide ranging and consolidate a number of existing provisions. It is necessary, for example, for housing associations to carry out research to assess housing needs, which is important if we are to continue to increase housing output. Research may also be undertaken in relation to training and housing policy development.</P>
    <P>The question of a purchase scheme for tenants in rental subsidy scheme houses was raised. There is, advisedly, no provision in the voluntary housing schemes for the purchase of individual houses by tenants. A tenant purchase scheme is not desirable at this stage in the development of the voluntary housing sector, as the sale of individual housing units would undermine the capacity and the resources of voluntary housing bodies to manage and maintain their estates and to continue to provide further housing projects to meet pressing needs.</P>
    <P>Residents of rental subsidy houses who have been in them for more than one year and wish to become owner occupiers may, on surrendering their house to the approved body, qualify for special mortgage allowance over five years to assist with mortgage repayments. They may also qualify for the shared ownership scheme, without having to satisfy the income eligibility criteria, for improvement works in lieu of schemes in respect of the dwelling they are acquiring, for low-cost housing site schemes and for exemption from the income limit for local authority housing levies.</P>
    <P>First-time buyers were referred to by a number of Senators and it has been one of the principal objectives of this Government to help those buyers to access the housing market. Since coming into office, the Government has introduced a successful range of targeted measures to increase affordability for lower-income and first-time purchasers. These measures include abolition of mortgage or interest relief for investors in the residential housing market and the introduction of stamp duty on new houses purchased by investors. Stamp duty payable on second-hand houses was changed in favour of first-time purchasers and the resulting moderation in house price increases indicates the success of such a measure. Further changes to stamp duty in favour of first-time buyers were introduced in Action on Housing, published in June 2000.</P>
    <P>Under this Government, the local authority shared ownership scheme was improved, the qualifying income limits were increased, the mortgage subsidy available under this scheme to lower income households was improved and on-site subsidy has been made available. An affordable housing scheme was introduced in March 1999 with the same qualifying income limits as apply under the shared ownership scheme. Along with the availability of a site subsidy, other improvements include an increase in the maximum local authority house purchase loan <Col N="1476" /> and a doubling of the mortgage allowance scheme.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole referred to the performance of local authorities in the housing area. The impact of the Government's social housing strategy, set out in the national development plan, is now apparent in the provision of local authority housing. We introduced the multi-annual local authority housing programme for the first time, from 2000, to run to the end of 2003. Under the multi-annual programme we aim to provide a total of 25,000 local authority housing starts. The multi-annual approach was introduced to allow for greater forward planning and efficiencies of scale with the introduction of increased local authority housing targets. Local authorities completed some 5,000 units in 2001 and commencements of new house starts this year are estimated at 7,000 units &ndash; the highest level of starts over a 15-year period.</P>
    <P>Regarding Senator Costello's comments, this Government has left no stone unturned in dealing with the issue of homelessness. One of the central planks of the Government strategy is the homeless action plans, which have to be drawn up at local level, by local authorities, health boards and voluntary bodies, to set out clearly what services exist for homeless persons and to outline what services will be needed over the three-year life of the plan. The plans for the main urban areas are already completed and work is well under way in other areas.</P>
    <P>The Government has also made substantial additional funding available to ensure that the recommendations in the homelessness strategy are implemented. Capital funding for direct provision of local authority accommodation for homeless persons is being doubled from &euro;25 million to &euro;50 million over the next five years. Current funding has already been increased by &euro;7.6 million per annum to increase bed-night contribution rates to voluntary bodies and to fund local support and settlement services. Additional funding of &euro;7.6 million is also available from the Department of Health and Children to fund the provision of in-house care in hostels which provide accommodation for homeless people. The Government's preventative strategy, which is the final key element in the overall homeless strategy, was launched recently.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole also referred to the increase in housing supply. Increase in the supply of rental accommodation must go hand in hand with improved regulation of the sector. Senators will be pleased to know that the reforms relating to security of tenure, rents, graduated notice periods, tenancy obligations and dispute resolution, which were contained in the report of the commission to inquire into the private rented residential sector, are contained in the general scheme of the Housing (Private Rented Sector) Bill approved by the Government in January. Pending the enactment of the Bill, the private residential tenancies board was established on an <i>ad hoc</i><Col N="1477" /> basis last October and is currently putting in place procedures to deal with disputes. Having done so, it will begin to mediate disputes voluntarily referred to it by landlords and tenants.</P>
    <P>Several Senators referred to unsatisfactory progress in the provision of accommodation for Travellers. The large-scale encampments on public and private land do not arise from a lack of accommodation in all cases. Nevertheless, the Government is committed to the speeding up of provision of permanent accommodation for Traveller families. To this end, officials of my Department have, in the course of discussions with senior local authority officials, continued to expedite implementation of programmes. In consultation with the national Traveller accommodation consultative committee, we have initiated and improved reporting procedures for local authorities which will facilitate more effective monitoring, under which progress in implementing programmes can be better evaluated. Progress by local authorities in the implementations of their programmes depends on a number of factors, such as the availability of land, planning procedures and local objections which sometimes lead to lengthy legal proceedings.</P>
    <P>It is important to recognise the frustration local authorities experience where, despite their best efforts, attempts to provide halting sites and group housing for Traveller families are thwarted. However, I am happy to see that in the first two years of the Traveller accommodation programme, a total of 550 families have been accommodated in standard local authority housing and group housing, as well as in halting sites and housing provided by voluntary bodies with local authority assistance.</P>
    <P>Total capital expenditure to provide and refurbish Traveller accommodation has amounted to &euro;72.5 million since this Government took office. In 2001 alone, &euro;23.7 million was spent to provide new and refurbished Traveller-specific accommodation and a further &euro;15.7 million has been spent on the management and maintenance of Traveller accommodation, costs of recruitment of social workers, as well as on the national Traveller accommodation consultative committee. The expenditure of &euro;23.7 million in 2001 represented expenditure in the order of &euro;6 million in excess of the original provision. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform provides funding for the Pavee Point mediation service and the citizen Traveller campaign amounting to over &euro;500 million this year.</P>
    <P>It is clear that this Government has adopted an integrated approach to the provision of Traveller accommodation. The accommodation provided is reducing the numbers on the roadside. The last two years have seen the first reduction in those numbers for a number of years, with the annual count for the year 2000-2001 showing a total reduction of 119 families on the roadside. This reduction is welcome when viewed in the context of an increase in the overall number of Traveller <Col N="1478" /> families of 360 in the same period. Our priority is to build on this progress and to achieve even more significant reductions in the number of families on the roadside this year and in the remaining years of the accommodation programme.</P>
    <P>This Government remains committed to the provision of accommodation to Traveller families and it will give local authorities the support they need to meet the assessed needs. I assure the House that the necessary funding will be made available. Since 1997 a total of 1,290 new or refurbished units of accommodation have been provided for Traveller families. Of these, 531 were new standard houses, 166 were new halting site bays and 195 were new group houses. A further 398 halting site bays or group houses were refurbished.</P>
    <P>The new provision in section 24 will apply to any person who, without the consent of the owners of the land, enters or occupies such land or brings any object on to the land where it is likely to substantially damage the land, prejudicially affect any amenity associated with the land, substantially interfere with the land or amenity or the lawful use of the land or amenity. The amendment will therefore apply in general terms to anyone entering land without consent.</P>
    <P>However, it is specifically provided in the amendment that the new power applies to persons who occupy the land or who bring on to the land objects that are likely to substantially injure the land or its associated amenities. The placing of a tent on land for an overnight stay, with no substantial effect on the land, will in my view not be subject to this provision. Campers should not have a problem under this provision. The same would also apply to hill walkers.</P>
    <P>I expect a common sense approach to be taken in the operation of this new provision. I am confident that the existing reasonable attitude of landowners and those using the countryside for recreational purposes will continue to prevail and that the new powers available under this amendment will not have any implication for those amenities. The same applies to activities such as hunting or fishing.</P>
    <P>Before a person becomes subject to the new powers under this amendment, a person must have entered or occupied land without the owner's consent. In the case of hunting and fishing activities, it is normal for persons involved to have either the permission of the landowners or to have long established rights to hunt on the lands. Should persons engage in these activities on land without the owner's consent or without any legal rights to hunt on such land, they could be liable under this provision. Use of the provision in such cases would be dependent on the likelihood of substantial damage being caused to the land. Unless the owner made a formal complaint to the Garda, it is unlikely that the new powers would be brought into play.</P>
    <P>Senator Ormonde asked about enforcement of the provision. It is a matter for the Garda Síoch<Col N="1479" /> ána to ensure that this legislation, like any legislation which its members are required to implement, is enforced in an effective and fair manner. The Garda Commissioner is responsible for all operational matters. Any practical difficulty, such as the availability of storage facilities, etc., which might prevent the provisions being enforced immediately following enactment of the Bill are matters to be addressed by the Garda authorities in consultation with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government may make orders for the commencement of certain sections of the Bill. It is envisaged that the commencement of this provision would be subject to consultation with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Once the provisions are commenced, the Garda will, as in the normal course of events, enforce breaches of public order legislation when they are brought to their attention.</P>
    <P>In some cases, it might be the owner who complains to the Garda that persons entered his or her land without consent. In other cases it might be the residents who complain about persons on open land in their neighbourhood. In the case of public open spaces and parks it is expected that the relevant public authority would take the initiative on enforcement.</P>
    <P>There may be cases where the owner does not object to the presence of temporary dwellings on his or her land and may not complain to the Garda. There may also be cases where a local authority will not take the initiative where a Traveller family or families are on land under the ownership or control of the authority and they are there with the authority's permission pending the provision by the authority of permanent accommodation for them.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole complained about the lack of consultation with Traveller representatives. The issues arising in relation to unauthorised encampments were referred to the committee monitoring the implementation of the task force report on the Traveller community by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform last year. This committee set up a sub-committee to examine the matter. The sub-committee comprised representatives of my Department, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Traveller representatives, the Garda and the private sector. It was charged with seeking a consensus on how the issues could best be approached. This included possible changes to the legislation on unauthorised encampments.</P>
    <P>The sub-committee has not yet reported but the indications are that there will not be a consensus on changes to the legislation. While the Government would prefer consensus on such changes, it cannot refuse to legislate just because a consensus has not been reached. To proceed on that basis would mean that the Oireachtas would find it difficult to legislate for any other issue.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1480" />Senator Costello raised the issue of housing associations. A number of the housing associations that have commenced operations here originated in Britain and Northern Ireland. These bodies have to be separately registered here as a company or a trust. They must not distribute any profits, which must be used for housing matters. These housing associations have provided a valuable boost to the capacity of the sector and will facilitate the achievement of the targets set in the national development plan with regard to the voluntary sector.</P>
    <P>Senators asked if there were any proposals to change the floor area limits for grant purposes. It is possible to provide a reasonably sized four bedroomed house within the current upper floor area limit of 125 square metres. There are no proposals to increase the maximum floor area limit for new house grant purposes. Increasing the new house grant above the current grant level of &euro;3,810 would have no additional benefit for first time buyers as an increase would be likely to add to the inflationary pressures in the new house market. There are no proposals to increase that grant.</P>
    <P>There are no provisions in the Dublin Docklands Development Authority Act in relation to social and affordable housing, although the provisions in the Act in relation to the preparation of a master plan for the Dublin dockland area include the development of housing for people of different social backgrounds and other social objectives consistent with an urban renewal project. The master plan has a stated target of 20% of residential units in developments to be provided for social and affordable housing.</P>
    <P>This Bill strengthens the general range of the provision for social and affordable housing. Its importance is reflected in the fact that we wish to secure its passage through both Houses before Easter. I thank Senators for their co-operation in this regard. I thank them for their contributions and commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>Now that people can get a subsidy for accommodation, is the Minister prepared to recognise that this section provides an opportunity, particularly in the 20% social house area? The Bill is providing for 15% and 5%, respect<Col N="1481" /> ively, in the definitions of social housing and local authority housing. If people buying these houses are prepared to put their own money into it, would this section allow the Minister to subsidise their mortgages accordingly?</P>
      <P>Is the Minister considering asking the relevant authorities, in particular the banks and the building societies, about second generation mortgages? By doing that, he would create an environment where people would find it very easy to provide accommodation for themselves. Is the Minister prepared to agree that there is an opportunity here?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 7 provides that mortgage subsidies may be provided to eligible persons by housing authorities and that these subsidies may be recouped, in part or all, from moneys provided by the Oireachtas and the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>First-time buyers, who qualify for the scheme and are given the opportunity to purchase a new house under the scheme, may obtain a mortgage from their local authority of up to 95% of the sale price of the house. Mortgages are advanced over a 25-year term and the amount of each mortgage will be determined by the local authority with regard to each household's circumstances.</P>
      <P>Under the affordable housing scheme, mortgage subsidies are available to householders who have incomes of &euro;25,395 per annum or less to reduce households' mortgage payments. The maximum subsidy payable is &euro;2,539 and it is payable to the households with an income of &euro;12,697 or less. A sliding scale in terms of the amount of subsidy payable will apply to households with incomes greater than &euro;12,697 but less than &euro;25,395. The shared ownership scheme provides rental subsidies similar to the mortgage subsidy provided under the affordable housing scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State knows that the people who are making the money here are those who are providing the 25-year mortgages. A 25-year mortgage to a person who is 25 years of age will be paid when he or she is 50 years old and the people who will have made the money are the banks. The Minister of State is saying that any person earning over &euro;12,697 per year, which is £10,000, gets a subsidy. These are people earning £200 a week.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State must increase the subsidy. As Minister of State, he has an opportunity to do it and to demand that the Department do it. If he is seen to increase this, he will be giving people the opportunity. If a man is earning &euro;15,000 per year, for instance, he may be entitled to the first-time buyer's grant but he is not entitled to the subsidy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State has a chance, in setting out the regulations, to avail of an opportunity provided by this Bill. He should look at this section again to see how he can increase the limit <Col N="1482" /> to give people the opportunity to provide accommodation for themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This section deals with the control on resale of affordable housing. I mentioned in my Second Stage speech that there should be equal opportunity for persons in the local authority housing, affordable housing or voluntary housing sectors to buy their homes under a tenant purchase scheme. A great deal of money has been ploughed into the voluntary housing sector over the years. No doubt they are providing a great service and they are taking up the slack where the local authorities are not doing it.</P>
      <P>To be fair to the people who are being housed in that sector, anybody who is in long-term accommodation in the voluntary housing sector should have an opportunity to buy his or her home. This is critical. In any area there can be a person in voluntary housing, another person in affordable housing and a third person in local authority housing, but the person in voluntary housing is not being treated in the same way as the other two. I ask the Minister of State to introduce an amendment or a regulation so that the person in voluntary housing has an equal opportunity to buy his or her home.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>While I agree with the clawback and I welcome that section in the Bill because there are people who purchase local authority houses, sell them at a fair profit and build another house in the same locality, there are cases where people have to move because they have been relocated in their jobs or for other reasons. Is there any way that the Department or Bill will give an opportunity to people to seek a reduction if they can prove categorically that they have to move to a new location for their jobs?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. D. Cregan Mr. D. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, there is a contradiction in terms. In the Minister of State's very able-minded reply he made a point regarding the processing of voluntary housing. He said all facilities are available to a person if he or she decides to purchase a house in a joint venture. He or she is not marginalised or assessed in terms of the amount of money he or she can earn. He or she <Col N="1483" /> could earn £50,000 per year and still get all the benefits because he or she is coming from a voluntary house, yet the person who is not living in a voluntary house gets no benefits. The same rule should apply to everyone.</P>
      <P>Is it not true that the person accommodated in voluntary accommodation is entitled to all facilities, to avail of the payback scheme or the 50:50 loan as we call it? He or she is entitled to all the benefits with no accountability in terms of what he or she is earning. If he or she is earning &euro;40,000 or &euro;50,000 per year, he or she is entitled to the benefits and we cannot question this. This is because he or she is coming from a voluntary house. Is that not true? Should it not be the same for everybody else?</P>

I pointed out the incentives available to such people to vacate that voluntary property to allow somebody on a lower income to avail of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This section deals with new house grants. Subsection (1) gives authority to the Minister to make a grant available to a person &ldquo;in respect of a new house.&rdquo; Subsection (2) states:</P>
      <P>Without prejudice to the generality of <i>subsection (1)</i>, regulations made under this section may provide for all or any of the following:</P>
      <P>(<i>a</i>) the class or classes of person to whom a grant may be paid;</P>
      <P>(<i>b</i>) the amount of a grant including the payment of different amounts in different circumstances and subject to those conditions that the Minister may prescribe, including conditions relating to:</P>
      <P>(i) standards of construction of houses and the provision of water, sewerage and other services;</P>
      <P>(ii) the efficient consumption of energy, including the use of renewable forms of energy;</P>
      <P>(iii) sustainable building practices, including the use of recycled or re-usable building materials and the storage, removal, recycling or re-use of builder's waste.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1484" /> Paragraph (<i>c</i>)(ii) refers to &ldquo;payment of a grant to persons who have previously purchased or built another house for occupation by them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is ambiguity. Subsection (1) states the grant is made available &ldquo;in respect of a new house,&rdquo; whereas subsection (2)(<i>c</i>)(ii) speaks of payment of a grant to &ldquo;persons who have previously purchased or built another house for occupation by them.&rdquo; I thought this was a new house grant. Are we confusing this with the first-time buyer's grant, or is this a new grant available to everybody if they had a house previously and moved to a new one? I thought it would be a first-time buyer's grant and available to first-time buyers of a new or second-hand house. However, under the section it would seem that the Minister can make a regulation to give a grant to a person who already has or had a house previously, whether new or second hand. If such a person buys or builds a new house, he or she will get a grant, or perhaps I am reading the section incorrectly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. D. Cregan Mr. D. Cregan">

    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I am. I would have thought that this section would have dealt with a first-time buyer's grant, whether the first-time buyer is buying a new or second-hand house. The Minister of State can correct me if I am wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>The main anomaly in the existing legislation relates to grant eligibility for persons who obtained legal separations following marital breakdown. The current position on a married couple who never bought a house and subsequently obtained a legal separation or divorce is that the first partner to the purchase of the new house can obtain a new house grant. However, the other partner does not automatically receive the grant. This partner must comply with section 25 of the 1988 Housing Act and prove hardship in order to obtain a grant.</P>
      <P>The provision of subsection (2)(<i>a</i>) will allow the removal of this anomaly in the making of regulations governing the class or classes of persons to whom a grant may be paid. The regulations will provide for a married couple who never bought a house, split up and obtained a legal separation or divorce to be treated as first-time purchasers subsequently and qualify automatically for a new house grant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. D. Cregan Mr. D. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, the Minister of State just said &ldquo;who never bought a house&rdquo;. Section 11(2)(<i>c</i>)(ii) refers to &ldquo;payment of a grant to persons who have previously purchased or built another house for occupation by them&rdquo;. I understand that refers to a family. One can have a married couple who get divorced. Section 11(2)(<i>c</i>)(ii) should not use the word &ldquo;them&rdquo; but the words &ldquo;him or her-them&rdquo;. Again, the Minister of State has been misinformed because this <Col N="1485" /> will become a regulation when we are finished with the Bill. It refers to the payment of a grant to &ldquo;persons&rdquo; who have previously purchased or built another house for occupation by them. Therefore, both are entitled to get money if they split up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I take on board what Senator Cregan has said. It looks a little confusing to me. My reading of it is that one or other party will be entitled to a grant. I spoke earlier in respect of the amount of new house grants and the Minister of State replied to my suggestion thereon by saying it would only push up the price of houses. In 1972 about £952 was available for a new house grant. Now, £3,000 or &euro;3,800 is available for those who qualify. This should be looked at.</P>
      <P>Young couples who build houses under the permitted size &ndash; whether because of separation or otherwise &ndash; are entitled to a grant of &euro;3,800. Young first-time buyers or builders should be entitled to more than the grant of &euro;3,800.</P>
      <P>From my reading of the Bill, which I hope the Minister of State will clarify, one or other party of a separated couple will now be entitled to a grant. That is proper because the party in question would have been put at a huge inconvenience in breaking up. If he or she wanted a new house and was not in a position to do so, he or she will now be afforded the opportunity to get a grant, even though one may have been obtained for the original family house.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I reiterate the point that there is flexibility in respect of hardship cases. For instance, if a house is burned down or whatever, there is flexibility to give a second grant. There is provision in the Bill to allow the local authority make representations to allow a grant where hardship cases are established.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I require clarification on subsection (2)(<i>a</i>) which states that a Minister can pay certain moneys to bodies which would represent or promote the formation of co-operative or voluntary groups or associations which have as an object the provision of houses, sites etc. Is the Bill referring to local authorities or housing agencies in this respect? Will the Minister of State indicate if he has any intention of putting together a register of housing associations with the necessary information on who they are, where they come from, what they do, what work they have done in this and other countries, the conditions, the aegis under which they operate, and the relationship they have to the communities in which they con<Col N="1486" /> struct houses and for which they receive funding from the Department?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the question I asked. I asked specifically about money the Minister will make available under the section to housing bodies, whether voluntary or co-operative. What sort of money is he talking about and what will be known about these bodies? Will there be a register of these bodies? There are a lot of question marks over the current housing association business in regard to how it operates in a semi-private, semi-public arena as do-gooder organisations, almost as charities, some of which are excellent. We do not know who these organisations are, nor do we know anything about their boards. In many instances we do not know how they operate. I would like to know what structures will be in place if money is being made available to these bodies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many voluntary housing bodies throughout the country who do an excellent job in providing houses which are substantially grant-aided by the Minister and the Department. Section 12 spells out clearly what is intended in this regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. D. Cregan Mr. D. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand what Senator Costello is asking. I have been a member of the housing committee in Cork City Hall since 1979. The voluntary bodies and associations have taken away the inequality in local authority assisted housing. They have helped people who are no longer tenants, particularly men who are sometimes more marginalised than women. Some single men do not take proper care of themselves or get proper recognition. From a local authority point of view, they do not receive the same recognition as women. Obviously people with young children must be accommodated first but elderly or single women get priority over men. This is why more men than women rely on the Simon Community. I am not suggesting there are no women in this situation. Unfortunately there are, but there are more men, including elderly men, in this vulnerable situation. It is sad that these people are referred to as &ldquo;drop-outs&rdquo; who must be taken care of. I am happy in regard to the voluntary housing groups, particularly in the Cork region, to whom the Minister has made contributions in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Costello made a point about housing groups in other countries, including England, where they have worked well. The questions asked and assessments carried out on these groups at local authority level are very detailed. The Department does not make money available <Col N="1487" /> easily unless it thinks it is right and proper. These housing groups are doing an excellent job. Residents who are provided with this type of accommodation are in no hurry out of it. The accommodation is very good, particularly for single people, especially men. I may have a soft spot for men because of the way they are pushed around. These people are much better looked after by voluntary housing groups.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with Senator Cregan who paid tribute to the voluntary housing associations. These associations do tremendous work throughout the country which I recognised in my statement. A housing association register will be considered.</P>
      <P>The amount of money involved was &euro;1 million for this sector. These bodies must be approved by the Department. The criteria to qualify for approved status are set out in the Department's circular. This must be complied with in order to be recognised as a voluntary housing body.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said earlier on Second Stage &ndash; it is a shame to be dealing with Committee and Report Stages in one sitting &ndash; section 21 has nothing to do with this Bill. It is about nuisance, obstruction, trespass and interference with the quality of water, sanitary, electrical and other services. There was absolutely no hint that this extraneous amendment would be introduced by the Minister. It arrived out of the blue. No one knew about it, including the bodies whom the Minister of State agreed to consult in a process which was provided for under the social partnership. Structures were put in place, and are still in place, for consultations but these have not taken place.</P>
      <P>The problem with the legislation is that it was introduced at the last moment and we are expected to rush it through without question. The same thing happened last night on the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill when the consultation process was not entered into. How can this legislation be finalised in one day?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened earlier to an extremely heated argument on the &ldquo;Joe Duffy Show&rdquo; where the former Minister of State, Deputy Flood, was defending his position on refraining from voting in the other House on this issue. The reasons he gave were very cogent, that is, that the local authorities were <Col N="1488" /> negligent in the provision of housing for Travellers. Of the 2,200 units committed by the task force in 1995, only in the region of 100 have been provided. Some 95% of these units have not been embarked on by the local authorities.</P>
    <P>A sledge hammer approach is being used in regard to all Travellers. These people are being treated in a criminal fashion in that they can be moved from a particular site within 24 hours. Some of these sites may be quite innocuous. We are not talking about wholescale encampments by Travellers. If that is what is being referred to then the legislation should be geared to deal with criminal abuse and activity, which is not the case. It is geared towards tarring all Travellers with the same brush. These are nomadic people who may move from one position on a roadside to another, particularly as the houses, halting sites, hard stands and units of accommodation have not been provided. It is a bit rich to introduce this criminalising legislation.</P>
    <P>A later section of the Bill contains very heavy powers of arrest without warrant. How many citizens of this country can be arrested without a warrant? It would not happen to major fraudsters, paedophiles or those guilty of even the most heinous crimes, yet anybody deemed in violation of this legislation can be arrested without a warrant after 24 hours.</P>
    <P>I do not like the manner in which this legislation is being put through. It will cause endless conflict between the Traveller community, the Garda and local authorities because local authorities will call in the Garda if they perceive breaches of this legislation. The Bill will exacerbate confrontation throughout the country. The summer months are coming, and as Senator Norris said in his fine Irish:</P>
    <P>Anois teacht an earraigh beidh an lá ag dul chun síneadh,</P>
    <P>Is tar éis na Féile Bríde ardóidh mé mo sheol.</P>
    <P>The spring is coming, the days are getting longer and the spailpín fánach, the wandering labourer, is planning to travel around the country. Travellers are so-called because travelling is what they do. If they do not have a proper place or various facilities at which to stop, they will stop at the side of the road or wherever.</P>
    <P>I support legislation that would target those who are abusing their position, who pretend to be Travellers looking for halting sites but instead establish encampments, whether on sports fields or amenity areas, and extort money from residents. That is not tolerable and has to be condemned. However, this legislation will not have such a focused impact. The trawl is so wide that every Traveller in the country will be affected by it. I advise the Minister, even at this late stage, to withdraw this legislation and to pass it on to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform so that it can be examined separately. This is already taking place under the task force monitoring <Col N="1489" /> group in consultation with Travellers, who are in favour of legislation specifically to deal with those who abuse their position.</P>
    <P>Including these measures in a Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill merely exposes the erratic provision of housing for the Traveller community by local authorities. The Bill provides for heavy sanctions on the Traveller community in general and depicts all Travellers as potential criminals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the provisions in section 21, particularly subsection (<i>c</i>)(ii), which deals with the risk to water quality. In these encampments, we sometimes see dismantled cars, batteries, acids and so on which are often close to a water supply for a town or village. A large part of the country depends on underground water sources. Where local authorities perceive a risk to a water supply, it is only right that this section is invoked. I compliment the Minister on these measures to ensure the maintenance of water quality.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge Senator Costello's remarks about hard stands. Much money was given to local authorities to provide these, but we failed as public representatives to take hard decisions. We took up the issue in my county and tried to establish hard stands, but the biggest objectors were some Travellers who objected to the location of the stands. We took initial steps to try to provide these facilities, but they were deemed unsuitable. We all have to work together to make progress on this issue. This legislation may appear tough, but we as public representatives have to take tough stands now and ensure that Travellers have proper areas to park.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. D. Cregan Mr. D. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand Senator Costello's point of view and it is the case that the provision of halting sites in the Dublin region has progressed extremely slowly. Cork has had halting sites for the last 20 to 25 years. Cork got its house in order, making sure there was provision for Travellers coming into the county.</P>
      <P>Senator Costello holds no brief for those who are prepared to travel around the country buying and selling carpets or whatever and taking over entire areas. I have seen parts of Cork devastated by these people. I am not talking about five or six caravans but 25 or 26, together with vans, crews and whatever they are trying to sell. They do a huge amount of damage. There is no question of these people going to a halting site; they just pull in anywhere and destroy the area. Something has to be done about it.</P>
      <P>The Minister made a point in relation to section 24 that must also be relevant to section 21. We must ensure that we are not tarring all Travellers with the same brush. Many Travellers have been living in the same parish or, unfortunately, along the same stretch of road for ten to 15 years. We cannot come along suddenly and tell them they have to move.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1490" />I read a report in the <i>Sunday World</i> that it cost &euro;2.5 million to provide a halting site in Foxrock to satisfy one family. This is an example of how certain families can use intimidation. Regardless of whether we like it, Travellers are the blue bloods of our society. They were here long before most of us and they must be recognised for what they are. However, we cannot allow a situation to develop where they do what they like when they like and destroy a city or village. I have often seen the destruction of local environments on the north and south sides of Cork city and it cost us a lot of money to sort out the problem. We constructed banks to block encampments, but we also provided halting sites. There are five or six sites in various parts of the city.</P>
    <P>A sub-committee is in place in Cork City Hall, of which the Minister was a member for many years, which determines what actions are needed. In the Minister of State's area, a plant employing over 1,000 people was almost lost because of halting sites. We had to move them, and rightly so. The cost per head of providing halting sites in Cork is much more than for local authority tenants. One halting site for ten families costs something in the region of &euro;2.2 million, in other words, &euro;220,000 per family to provide a site. Questions would be asked if this type of money was spent in other areas.</P>

      <P>I fully understand Senator Costello's point of view. My greatest fear regarding this Bill is that it would be used against Travellers who are indigenous to a particular town or county. Most local authorities have conducted surveys to establish which Traveller families are indigenous to their areas. This Bill must not be used to act against families who have lived on the edge of a town for a long time, waiting for housing or a place on a halting site. The protection of Traveller families who are indigenous to a local authority area must be spelt out in the Bill.</P>

      <P>Section 21 is an amendment to the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1992. It was introduced by way of an amendment on Committee Stage of this Bill in the Dáil. The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Bobby Molloy, indicated at Committee Stage that he would bring forward an amendment to include this section in the Bill. It is not true that people <Col N="1491" /> were not aware that an amendment to deal with this problem was forthcoming.</P>
      <P>Under this amendment, the power conferred on the Garda will not extend to temporary dwellings located on any public road. The extra powers provided for in this amendment will not apply to families who live on the roadside. Regarding the removal of unauthorised temporary dwellings located in public places, the existing powers available to local authorities will continue to apply to such dwellings on the roadside or on the lands owned by the local authority.</P>
      <P>There is a significant difference between those Travellers who choose to live in large-scale unauthorised encampments and those who are forced to live in unacceptable conditions while they are waiting for local authority accommodation. In many cases, these latter families are permitted by the local authority to remain on public lands pending the provision of permanent accommodation. The presence of such Traveller families seldom gives rise to any major local objection, as they are in relatively small groups and do not engage in anti-social behaviour. Such families, encamped on the roadside, will not be subject to the provisions of this amendment because they do not come within the scope of the amendment to the public order Act. There will be no change in the legal position of these families.</P>
      <P>Everyone who has spoken on this section of the Bill has acknowledged that there is a problem with temporary dwellings. This Bill addresses those problems in a humane manner and to the benefit of all members of our community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 22, before section 22, to insert the following new section:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;22.&ndash;No compensation shall be payable in respect of any alleged damage to a temporary dwelling or vehicle which occurs in the implementation of any provision in this Act where reasonable care has been taken by <Col N="1492" /> the local authority, Garda Síochána or any person acting on their behalf.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I mentioned this in a speech on Second Stage. This happened where a Traveller's caravan was trespassing on land. When the local authority had it removed it was said there was damage done to the vehicle. The local authority denied this and said the vehicle was already in a bad state of repair. Nevertheless, judgment was found against the local authority which had taken due and reasonable care on the removal of the vehicle. This Bill allows for the removal of many things besides that vehicle.</P>
    <P>My concern is Travellers might use the provisions of the Bill as a vehicle for financing themselves. They could put a caravan on a site, the local authority would remove it but then automatically the authority would be taken to court where it would be expected to cough up with compensation. I am genuinely concerned about this.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister of State realise that there must be recourse through the courts? In cases of a local authority versus any member of the public, the judgment is often given against the local authority &ndash; it is a tradition. I have examples of 13 cases brought against local authorities, some 12 of which were dismissed out of hand while in the remaining one, the judgment found against the local authority in respect of one minor aspect and awarded costs against it because it is presumed to have more money and be the giant against the pygmy. I have a fear regarding this aspect. However, it is essential that a person has his or her day in court.</P>

      <P>I am surprised by the Minister of State's reply because he must be aware of the cost to local authorities of accountability to the public. In Cork city alone, the bill for claims will be £4 million. If it is seen to be in the courts, as Senator Coogan said, irrespective of the case brought by it, the court will against the local authority, which is unfair. There are people who are rogue enough to erect a temporary dwelling on a site thinking they will have costs awarded to cover a brand new dwelling at a much higher cost. They might get away with this if they were prepared to say the matter should go to the court.</P>

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 24 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Minister of State stated section 22 does not apply to public roads, section 24(19)(<i>b</i>) states, &ldquo;This part does not apply to any public road within the meaning of the Roads Act, 1993.&rdquo; While I do not have that Act to hand, I know the National Roads Authority specifies that temporary dwellings are illegal on national primary and secondary routes and can be removed by court order. Does section 24 (19) (<i>b</i>) mean that temporary dwellings on national primary and secondary routes will now be allowed? If that is the case, has the Department consulted the NRA because it has made orders to the contrary?</P>
      <P>On Second Stage I raised the issue of access to rivers, lakes and mountains. The Minister of State said the Bill would not jeopardise such access. However, I am not convinced that is the case because, when the Bill is enacted, it will prohibit direct access to rivers and lakes. We are told it does not apply to public roads, but access to most rivers and lakes is through private property along rights of way. The Bill will greatly affect fishing on lake shores and river banks.</P>
      <P>The Bill is draconian in this respect as it imposes heavy fines. The law can come down severely on someone who seeks access to a river or lake through private property, breaks a twig off a tree and is reported to the Garda Síochána by the landowner. That should not be the case, because our lakes and rivers are a great asset to the national economy and the people living in the surrounding communities who use them for boating, fishing and so on. In this context, some changes must be made to section 24(19)(<i>c</i>), because people may be prohibited from entering private property to access these amenities.</P>
      <P>For instance, one may come across a contrary landowner or a law man. Where people have been using access points to rivers, lakes and mountains, the contrary landowner may decide to put a bush in the gap preventing access that was available for years. I hope the Minister of State will spell out this provision in detail or guarantee that access will not be prohibited if the Bill is enacted as it stands.</P>

      <P>In relation to the issues raised by Senator Burke, we all know of problems where the lake shore and similar places have been completely taken over to the point where one cannot get near them. We must include a particular section in the Bill to address this. In relation to <Col N="1494" /> the provisions of the section for the consent of landowners, in most cases &ndash; if legally entitled &ndash; there will be consent for whomsoever seeks access. Likewise, people have a legal right to use rights of way. There will be anomalous situations, but that happens with even the best of legislative planning.</P>
      <P>In relation to what can and cannot be placed along the sides of roads, particularly in relation to the NRA's regulations, county development plans spell out in detail what can and cannot take place on and adjacent to particular roads. The law of the land and the local authority are disposed towards moving against people who park at locations where they should not. While that is my view, I look forward to hearing what the Minister of State has to say on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>Strong points have been made again which were made on Second Stage. The Bill will become law once it leaves here and is signed by the President. In relation to the provision that a person, without the duly given consent of the owner, shall not enter and occupy any land or bring onto or place on any land any object, the word &ldquo;object&rdquo; could apply to a football. Will there be a problem with sporting activities such as hunting with dogs or drag hunting common in my part of the country? There will obviously be a problem without consent. The section is too demanding of everybody in trying to achieve its aims.</P>
      <P>I understand what has been said about travelling people &ndash; that they could take over and occupy land, and they have done so. We should not create a situation, however, where the wrong person could become involved if, for example, an individual does not provide his or her correct name. Honest, decent people pursuing sporting activities will be caught by this provision. To avoid this, the Minister should table an amendment that is relevant to sporting organisations and which would cover fishermen, climbers, hunters or footballers. One cannot stop people from enjoying sport so something should be added to the section to provide for such activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Dino Cregan and Senator Burke have made cogent arguments about the sweeping powers in this section, but who would ever have thought that those fine contributions would be made in the context of a housing Bill? The debate is covering a wide range of issues that have nothing to do with housing. This is a catch-all Bill which is being used as an excuse to cover a range of other areas that should not be dealt with under the aegis of this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many questions marks hanging over a number of these areas. What are the implications of entering land without the consent of the owner for people who have traditionally used it for fishing, shooting, walking or playing football? The Bill will tie up the use of land as per<Col N="1495" /> sonal, private property without any possibility of enjoyment by the public. That seems to be the interpretation of this section. The Minister is bringing everything into the net if it makes any impact on a person's ownership of land. I do not know why the Minister wants to impose such harsh penalties as arrest without warrant for fairly innocuous matters like failing to give a name and address, failing to comply with a direction of the Garda Síochána or other actions that would obstruct or impede. The Bill will have a sledgehammer effect. Presumably the Minister intends to cast the net as widely as possible to cover any illegal entry upon land in the context of the Traveller community.</P>
    <P>As regards section 19B which refers to the Roads Act, it is not clear whether any temporary dwelling along national primary and secondary routes comes within the interpretation that the Minister has provided. As there seems to be a major question mark over that, I would like to hear the Minister's clarification. Will Travellers still be able to stop at sites along the public highway, as distinct from making incursions on to private property? It is a shame that the Minister should be trying to force such provisions through the House in the context of a housing Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>This section does not apply to public roads. Existing powers under the Housing or Roads Acts cover local authorities regarding other temporary dwellings. Before a person becomes subject to the provisions of the new powers in this amendment, a person must have entered or occupied land without the owner's consent. In the case of hunting activities it is normal for persons involved in this sport to have either the permission of the landowners or long-standing established rights to hunt on lands. Should persons engage in hunting or shooting on land without the owners' consent or without any legal rights to hunt on such land, they could be liable under this provision. Use of the provision in such cases would be dependent on the likelihood of substantial damage being caused to the land. Unless the landowner made a formal complaint to the Garda Síochána, it is unlikely that the new powers would be brought into play.</P>
      <P>The amendment, therefore, will apply in general terms to anyone entering land without consent. However, it is provided in the amendment that the new power applies to persons whose entry or occupation of the land, or the bringing onto the land by such persons of objects, is likely to substantially injure the land or its associated amenities. The placing of a tent on land or an overnight stay with no substantial effect on the land, in my view, will not be subject to this provision. If the placing of the tent or the presence of the person placing it is not likely to substantially affect the land, campers should not have a problem under this provision. The same would apply in the case of hill walkers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1496" />I expect a common sense approach to be taken to the operation of this new provision. I am confident that the existing reasonable attitude of landowners and those using the countryside for recreational purposes will continue to prevail and that the new powers available under this amendment will not have any implications for those using amenities in a responsible manner.</P>
    <P>The Government gave serious consideration to section 24. This was in response to an intolerable situation which emerged in the past few years where we have seen large groups of unauthorised temporary dwellings congregating in open spaces, playing fields and even private lands. Up to recently, the presence of unauthorised dwellings has been tolerated in many cases where the dwellings did not cause any particular nuisance or risk to amenities. This was in the context of families who are waiting for permanent accommodation from the local authority. These dwellings continue to be allowed to remain on local authority lands and on lay-bys on the roadside. I would not wish the affirmative position of families in these dwellings worsened.</P>
    <P>The provision is not intended to deal with such temporary dwellings. These are families for which accommodation is being provided under the Traveller accommodation programme. Many of those unauthorised encampments are there for the purpose of engaging in commercial or trading activities. Many of them have permanent accommodation elsewhere in other parts of the country or outside the jurisdiction. The length of such stays has also increased. In a much publicised incident in south Dublin last year, some Travellers stayed for up to seven months. While some stayed this length of time waiting for permanent accommodation, others were engaged in commercial activities. We have seen indications of this happening again this year.</P>
    <P>This provision was given serious and lengthy consideration by the Government, which is satisfied that this is the appropriate response to large-scale encampments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed by the Minister's reply. He mentions everybody but the people whose fears I raised &ndash; fishermen and others gaining access to rivers and lakes. The Minister mentioned common sense but there is no such thing in any Bill that I have seen going through the Houses of the Oireachtas. When one goes to court, common sense goes out the window. If this Bill is passed today, which it more than likely will be, does it mean that a fisherman will have to ask the landowner for consent to go through his land to gain access to a river or lake for fishing or other leisure purposes? If so, what will the consequences be for the tourist industry? How will fishermen from England or the Continent gain access to rivers and lakes? Will they also have to seek permission from landowners? This legislation will have serious consequences for the tourism industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1497" />The Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation and the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources have both spelled out to us what the fishing industry, and associated leisure activities, are worth to the economy. I have fears about the possible effects of this Bill. If the legislative provisions are followed to the letter, it will have serious consequences in the event of an offence being committed. The Minister of State has not allayed my fears. When the Bill becomes law anyone seeking access through private ground to a river or lake must seek permission or consent to do so. I cannot accept this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Substantial damage must be caused before the provision would apply to property. I expect the current arrangement, where people may walk lands at the pleasure of the owner, to continue. I do not have the same concerns as the Senator. I do not see people who have fished in waters on private land for years being affected by this amendment. I have pointed out that it is to deal with a problem which has developed in recent years, of which everyone in the House is aware and agrees exists.

Why is it necessary to refer to &ldquo;any object?&rdquo; That is as broad as possible. The Minister of State said he understood the term to mean a temporary dwelling. He said a tent would not cause damage. If a group of youngsters pitch a tent in a field to the annoyance of the farmer, in his opinion it might be damaging a corner of his field or meadow.</P>

I will now briefly set out the amendments, by section, that are not of a purely technical nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to section 3, amendment No. 9 makes it clear that only a contributor to a PRSA contract can refer a complaint or dispute to the Pensions Ombudsman, as is clearly the intent in section 4, which introduces this office. A statement of the PRSA contributor's rights in this regard must be contained in the PRSA contract. Amendment No. 11 provides that a review of the coverage position of occupational and personal pensions has to be undertaken within three years of the provision regarding employer mandatory access to PRSAs for their employees being intro<Col N="1500" /> duced. This amendment arose out of discussion in the Dáil. It ensures that the issue of coverage and the success or otherwise of PRSAs will be monitored and a report given to the Oireachtas in this regard. Amendment No. 17 also arose out of discussion in the Dáil and provides that a statement of reasonable projection to a PRSA contributor has to include a reference to the current value of the social welfare old age contributory pension in relation to average earnings. Such a statement will be of benefit to consumers, allowing them to make a better judgment on their overall pension provisions.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill relates to tax provisions for PRSAs. Amendments Nos. 22 and 25 are the two main amendments made to section 4 in the Dáil as follows: The most important amendment provided that accrued rights under an AVC scheme may be transferred to a PRSA, subject to the rules of the AVC scheme being amended to cater for this. A second amendment ensured that the early retirement option will be available to those at age 50 or over, rather than being confined to those at age 50.</P>
    <P>Section 5 relates to the Pensions Ombudsman. There was considerable discussion on this office in the Dáil, where the following amendments were made. Amendment No. 26 removes the requirement that the Pensions Ombudsman cannot be over 61 years of age on appointment, as concerns, with which I agreed, were expressed about that provision. Amendments Nos. 27 to 29 ensure that the time limit of six years prior to the establishment of the office now refers to six years prior to the enactment of this Bill, ensuring that a person does not fall between the two dates of the passing of the Act and establishment day.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 30 and 31 make it clear that complaints or disputes to the ombudsman have, first, to exhaust the internal dispute resolution procedure, both in relation to occupational pensions and PRSAs. Regulations in relation to these procedures will be made with the consent of the Minister for Finance. Amendment No. 34 provides that the Pensions Ombudsman can refer a case to the Garda Síochána, as was suggested in discussions in the Dáil. Amendment No. 36 provides for an improvement in the arrangements for the revaluation of preserved benefit, which will apply in respect of people who leave service after next June.</P>
    <P>With regard to amendments Nos. 37 and 40, given the taxation arrangements for PRSAs and the 15 year limit that applies in the case of transfers from occupational pensions to PRSAs, it is necessary to re-introduce the option of buy-out bonds, which are a form of insurance product, to facilitate transfers from pension schemes where a person has over 15 years service in the scheme. Amendments Nos. 42 and 43 address issues that were raised by Senator Ross in relation to the remittance of employer contributions to the trustees or to other persons on their behalf. Taken together the provisions mean that the contri<Col N="1501" /> butions have to be invested by the Trustees within 31 days of the end of the month in which the contributions were made. This is a definite time scale and puts the onus firmly on the trustees to ensure that proper arrangements are in place to comply with this requirement. If they do not, they can he prosecuted by the Pensions Board. Given the thrust of the Pensions Act and that it operates by placing the duty of care on the trustees, I consider, having taken advice from the Pensions Board, that this is the best way to proceed. On the passing of this Act, the board will inform trustees of their duties in this regard.</P>
    <P>In relation to amendment No. 44, on foot of discussion in this House and in the Dáil, I have decided that, in addition to a representative of consumer interests being put on the board, I will also appoint a representative of pensioner interests. This, I believe, will give a better balance to the board. The other amendments, as I said earlier, are technical and I will, of course, give details of any of these in which the House may have a particular interest.</P>
    <P>I welcome this opportunity to return to the Seanad with this Bill. I appreciate the forbearance shown by the Chair, by Senators and by the staff of the House to allow this complex Bill to pass relatively quickly through the Oireachtas, given the degree of concern within both Houses and outside that it should be enacted before the impending general election.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. This Bill came to the House initially as a rather slim document and there is now much more to the version which will go to the President for signature. It has had a rather unusual history, in some ways. It grew incrementally as various sections arrived in the form of amendments as time went on. I am happy it has been well scrutinised in both Houses and that the Minister has been open minded in trying, in so far as he could, to meet the genuine points raised by interest groups and, in particular, by Deputies and Senators.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to comment in detail on the changes made to the Bill, except to make one or two observations. I regret the Minister did not find it possible to extend the remit of the ombudsman to allow him to deal with cases which go back further than six years. However, I acknowledge that he did move from three to six years, which was very significant. I hope the particular case I have in mind can be dealt with in a manner satisfactory to all concerned.</P>
      <P>On amendments 30 and 31 in regard to the internal dispute resolution procedure, it is stated that these regulations will be made with the consent of the Minister for Finance. In a situation where a person who is in dispute does not have confidence in the fairness of the internal procedures, is he or she then prevented from going to the ombudsman, or is there any other route of appeal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1502" />I am very pleased the Minister accepted the suggestions made by Senator Ross. I am not sure if I may speak on his behalf but his point was a very valid one and its inclusion will strengthen public confidence in the legislation. I am glad the Minister was able to accede to that particular request. I do not know if it satisfied Senator Ross but having listened to what he had to say I suspect it should.</P>
    <P>I am not quite sure what the Minster means in regard to the amendment to section 44 in saying he will put on a representative of pensioner interests. I am unaware of one body representing all pensioners, given the variety of different kinds of pensions and pensioners. I find this very vague and perhaps the Minister will explain what is meant.</P>
    <P>I am happy with the changes made to this Bill in the Dáil. It is important legislation and I wish the Minister and the Pensions Board well with its implementation. I thank the Minister's officials for their great courtesy and help to all sides of the House during the passage of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Minister for bringing forward this Bill. As Senator Manning has said, the amendments that have been accepted by the Minister are of particular importance and, from now on, people who reach pensionable age can expect a far greater service than was heretofore the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and compliment the Minister on it. It has been substantially improved since it was last in this House. The amendment to section 44 has provided balance and recognises that people of pensionable age have a contribution to make to the board.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister be able to do anything for those in receipt of farm retirement pensions, in spite of EU legislation? Will he comment as to whether something can be done about that? It should have been index linked but as it is tied in with EU legislation it may have been let slip through. I compliment all concerned with this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators for their comments. The issue raised by Senator Moylan is not covered by this legislation, but under the rules that were laid down when the farm retirement scheme was dictated at EU level and implemented at national level, there was a system of integration built into it, so that there would not be a danger of the EU double funding pensioners already in receipt of the State pension. That matter is outside my control but there is nothing in this Bill that would affect it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Bill was going through the Oireachtas, I realised it was somewhat incongruous that there was no representative of pensioners <i>per se</i> on the Pensions Board. I received representation on this matter from some of the umbrella bodies. It is open to the Minister to <Col N="1503" /> appoint an ordinary pensioner with some general knowledge of pensions. Equally, the pensioner representative could be taken from one of the interest groups such as the Irish Senior Citizens' Parliament, Age Action Ireland Limited or the National Council for Ageing and Older People, among others. I expect the pensioner chosen would have a particular interest in, and understanding of, pensioners' issues.</P>
    <P>My officials have been in contact with Senator Ross in regard to the amendments prompted by him and passed in the Dáil and he is satisfied with what we put in place. As I explained in the Dáil no later than last evening, both I and my Department felt that we had gone as far as we could when we introduced the three year limit in the Bill initially. As a result of comments made in both Houses, we have extended that to six years. There is flexibility built into the legislation as drafted, which will allow the ombudsman, when appointed, to determine whether a particular dispute is caught by the six year rule. We believe it is better to leave the flexibility to the ombudsman rather than be more prescriptive in legislation.</P>
    <P>I thank all the Senators and everyone who has been part of the process of enacting this legislation. In comparison to the reform of pension legislation in other EU countries this has been a relatively quick process. I thank all those involved in the national pension policy initiative on bringing forward their report. I thank the officers of the Pensions Board, particularly the chief executive officer, Ann Maher. I also thank the members of the board, both past and present, particularly Eamon Heffernan who was very much involved in bringing forward the national pensions policy initiative.</P>
    <P>I thank the staff of my Department. I have been lucky in the past five years to have what I regard as the best staff across the public service. As always they have been excellent in the advice and explanation they have given to me as Minister. They have made my life much easier. I thank the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas for the not inconsiderable difficulty, even up to the very last minute today, in regard to bringing forward this legislation.</P>
    <P>We have put good legislation on the Statute Book and, as I said when I originally launched it, it is a generic thing which will be amended sooner rather than later, because of the monitoring and review provisions both in the legislation and in terms of the social partnership model. There are references to this issue being monitored under the existing PPF. I believe changes will be brought forward to this Bill as we move forward and that is a good thing. I was very much open to listening to submissions both inside and outside the House and we did it as much as we could. I would like to think that the next Government will also be accommodating in regard to making amendments to what is good legislation. Only time will tell.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Seanad for facilitating this matter today. I also thank Members for arranging a temporary adjournment. I was meeting a deputation which included some Members of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill, as passed yesterday by the Dáil, contains 102 amendments to the text passed by Seanad Éireann on 20 February. While some of the amendments are technical in nature, most of the changes relate to important substantive issues, many of which were raised in this House. I particularly wish to draw attention to amendments Nos. 11 and 14 which reduce considerably the scope of the presumption in section 6(2). As a result, the range of practices covered has been restricted to the most serious offences, the presumption now relates solely to the object and not the effect of such agreements, the presumption will only apply to agreements between competi<Col N="1505" /> tors and not to vertical agreements between undertakings at different levels of the economic chain and it will only apply where the purpose of the agreement is to fix prices, share markets or limit production.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 29 and 34 will have the effect of confining to senior officers of a firm the presumption of consent to anti-competitive offences which are carried out by a firm. Part 3 of the Bill, which relates to mergers and acquisitions, now contains significant additional provisions relating to mergers by acquisition of assets, public bids and tacit approval of mergers. We have also met, in amendment No. 38, the concern expressed in relation to mergers involving undertakings which do not carry on business in the State. It will now be a requirement that &ldquo;each of two or more of the undertakings involved in the merger or acquisition carries on business in any party of the island of Ireland&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>On media mergers, we have extended the scope of those provisions to cover new technological developments in the media. The Minister's power to review and overturn media merger decisions of the authority is reduced to &ldquo;positive&rdquo; decisions only of the authority. The effect of that change is that media mergers will have to jump two fences &ndash; a competition test administered by the authority and a public interest test administered by the Minister. The provisions in Part 4, which relate to the Competition Authority, include significant improvements which arise particularly from the deliberations in this House. Section 35 opens up to public competition all future appointments to the authority. Section 38(4) requires the chairperson of the authority to attend, whenever required, before any committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas dealing with competition policy matters. We also empower the authority to publish an annual report and require it to do so within two months of the commencement of the financial year. That is provided in section 42.</P>
    <P>Concerns in relation to the powers of investigation of the authority have been addressed in section 45 by amendments Nos. 88 and 90. In particular, the authority will be obliged to return to the undertaking within 14 days copies of any business records it seizes in the course of a raid. This is intended to alleviate the difficulties encountered by a business under investigation. In addition to those changes, I am also pleased that we have been able to include in section 50 a provision to protect whistleblowers, and to resolve some practical difficulties for the co-operative movement in section 51.</P>

    <P>I thank the Tánaiste for taking into account the deliberations of this House and the spirit of the amendments moved here. She had indicated she would do that. I welcome, in particular, the pro<Col N="1506" /> visions regarding foreign takeovers, media mergers and the new technological changes, the independence of the authority, the fact that there will be open competition for the membership thereof, that the annual reports will be published within two months and that the chairman of the authority will appear before the appropriate Oireachtas committee. I also welcome the provisions regarding Supreme Court appeals which were suggested by my colleague, Senator Norris.</P>
    <P>I thank the Department's officials for the briefings they gave us as the legislation progressed. This Bill is extremely important and we wish it well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I echo the comments of my colleague. He had the onerous duty of carrying the burden of debate on this Bill on behalf of the Opposition. I pay tribute to the Minister for her persistence with this legislation which was, essentially, her brainchild from the beginning. She took a strong public position on the importance of legislation such as this and on its enactment as a priority. It has taken some time to happen and I am sure she is personally and professionally pleased that it has been dealt with.</P>
      <P>I welcome the changes regarding media mergers. It is important that a strong message is sent that there is a double lock in this regard. Those who involve themselves in media acquisitions in this country will know there is a powerful corpus of legislation to prevent monopolisation of the media, which is a most important issue. The protection for whistleblowers is also important. It might not have received prominence in the general discussion on the Bill but the fact that this protection has been considerably strengthened is welcome.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to delay the House or, indeed, the Minister any further, but on a personal basis I again thank her for her normal courtesy and her acknowledgement of the role that this House played in the passage of this Bill, and wish the Bill well on its way.</P>

      <P>I thank the House for its response. I appreciate the concern Members have had for a considerable time regarding competition law. It is hard to believe it is all so new in Ireland but we have learnt a great deal since the first legislation in this area was introduced in the early 1990s. This is the third Bill in just over a decade which I suppose is a sign of the commitment in the pol<Col N="1507" /> itical system to competition and competition policy.</P>
      <P>We have amended this Bill, accepting nine or ten amendments in the Seanad and 102 subsequently. That is a considerable change, not so much to the broad principles but by taking on board the points which were made both here and in the other House, and the Bill is the stronger for it.</P>
      <P>The Bill will make a huge difference in ensuring we remain competitive and that there is a competitive regime which is fair and a law that is enforced independently by the authority. That authority now has the resources, expertise and determination to make sure that happens. Considerable new powers will go to the authority in relation to mergers and the mergers regime, with the exception of the media, has been depoliticised which is a good development.</P>
      <P>I thank the Clerk of the Seanad and all her staff for their co-operation in facilitating this debate and of course I thank all the Members. I especially want to thank the small group of officials, including Mr. Brian Whitney and Mr. Eamon Carey who have been involved with this legislation. They have worked extraordinarily hard in a short timeframe to bring us to this stage. It is a matter for them to ensure the legislation which the Oireachtas has passed and which hopefully will be signed quickly by the President is put into effect as quickly as possible. They know that my horizon in that regard involves a fairly short timeframe. It is important that the necessary orders, in particular the commencement order to ensure this is brought into effect quickly, are put in place as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>I thank everybody concerned and, as is often customary as a way of showing one's appreciation, I invite them to join me after we leave this Chamber. I pay tribute to Mr. Whitaker who has been at every single debate we have had on this matter. I hope the audience for his magazine grows substantially as a result of his hard work.

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is interesting that since 1990 there have been ten pieces of legislation which might broadly be described as courts related Acts. This Bill will be the eleventh in that list. The level of activity to which this testifies is indicative of the importance which attaches to the legal system in our lives. It is also indicative of the pace of change which has been a feature of the last decade in so far as that system is concerned.</P>
      <P>Of the various changes which have taken place I highlight in particular the establishment of the courts service in November 1999 and the establishment of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board in 1995. The Bill before the House builds upon the changes of the past and also contains certain elements which are more novel in nature.</P>
      <P>First, I want to focus on two elements of the Bill which might be seen as developing a number of provisions which were contained in the Courts and Court Officers Bill, 1995. In that Bill, solicitors of ten years' standing were made eligible for appointment as Circuit Court judges. The perception, which has proven to be justified, was that solicitor judges would bring valuable insights to the Circuit Court bench given the particular role which solicitors generally play within our legal system. In a further reforming measure, provision was also made whereby Circuit Court judges of four years' standing would be eligible for appointment to the High Court or the Supreme Court. In effect, therefore, an indirect mechanism was provided whereby solicitors appointed to the Circuit Court bench might, over time, ultimately serve on the bench of both of those courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill takes those provisions one step further in that it gives effect to a key recommendation of a working group set up to consider the question of qualifications for appointment as judges of the High and Supreme Courts. That recommendation was that suitably qualified solicitors should in future be eligible for direct <Col N="1509" /> appointment to those courts. While the Bill does not incorporate the full detail of the group's recommendations, which on closer examination were judged to be overly prescriptive, the broad outline of the recommendations is reflected in the basic policy thrust which underlies it.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, the Bill specifies that practising solicitors of not less than 12 years' standing should be eligible for direct appointment to the High and Supreme Courts. The intention behind this provision is that over time the pool of suitable candidates for appointment to the superior courts will be enlarged and that the greater diversity in profile which may result will enrich further the judicial Bench.</P>
    <P>In 1995 we also saw the establishment of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board. A key function of the JAAB is to recommend to the Government the names of persons suitable for appointment as judges. While the advice of the JAAB cannot be binding on the Government because of constitutional reasons, the Government has direct regard to the names recommended in advising the President on the appointment of a judge and it is a matter of record that all appointments made to date have come from the recommended list.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill the JAAB will have a new responsibility in respect of first-time appointments to the superior courts. When recommending a person for such an appointment, the JAAB should be of the opinion that the person in question has an appropriate knowledge of the decisions of the superior courts and an appropriate knowledge and experience of the practice and procedures of those courts. The JAAB is to have particular regard to the nature and extent of the practice of the person concerned in so far as it relates to his or her personal conduct of proceedings in the Supreme and High Courts. This personal conduct of proceedings which is under scrutiny can be as an advocate or a solicitor instructing counsel, or both.</P>
    <P>Given the important advisory role which the JAAB has, it is considered appropriate to introduce additional elements of transparency and accountability into its procedures. To that end, the Bill provides that the JAAB will make an annual report to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform which will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. This report will set out details of the JAAB's activities and performance of its functions. It may include information relating to topics such as the number of persons considered by the board for appointment to the various judicial offices in the period concerned, the gender, professional qualifications and experience of those people and of those appointed to judicial office. The report may also include information relating to the procedures used by the board for examining applications and selecting persons it recommends to the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for an important safeguard relating to the JAAB's report in that steps <Col N="1510" /> will be taken to ensure it will not include any information which discloses or could disclose the identity of persons considered by the board in respect of appointment to judicial office and who were not appointed to such office.</P>
    <P>Some elements of the Bill might be seen as more novel in nature and were not provided for in the Bill as originally published &ndash; the Courts and Court Officers Bill, 1995. It is of importance that there be no unreasonable delay in the delivery of court judgments. Accordingly, we are providing for a register of court judgments. The 1995 Bill, as published, made provision for a judge of the European Court of Human Rights to be eligible for appointment to the superior courts. During the passage of the Bill, it became clear that there could in future be judges attached to other courts and tribunals who might equally be brought within this Bill's scope, for example a judge of the International Criminal Court. The Bill has been amended to address this point.</P>
    <P>Part III deals with additional appointments. Part IV deals with matters pertaining to both the Circuit Court and the District Court and the question of the increase of jurisdiction. Part V deals with miscellaneous matters.</P>
    <P>The Bill, essentially, is practical legislation designed to enhance the smooth running of the courts and to facilitate litigants in terms of access to justice. I commend it to the House.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I welcome the Bill. On this side of the House we have no particular difficulty with it. The general content of the Bill is extremely welcome. It is very important that the courts are recognised as an independent arm of the State and that justice is seen to be done.</P>
      <P>A number of improvements have taken place in recent years. The current mechanism of appointment has been taken somewhat out of the political arena, but there is still a certain amount of political input.</P>
      <P>Following the Courts and Court Officers Bill, 1995, solicitors who have acted in the High Court can now be appointed as separate court judges, a very welcome development. The division that occurs between the professions of barrister and solicitor needs to be examined more closely. There is no need for such a wide distinction and there needs to be a closer level of interaction between the two professions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to examine the position on sentencing policy and consistency in sentencing across the courts, whether it be in the District Court, Circuit Court, etc. Repeatedly, we see instances in which there seems to be inconsistency in respect of the types of sentences applied by judges. This is unacceptable and there is a need for reform within the judicial system to address that particular aspect of the Judiciary. While I appreciate the Judiciary has to be independent and that the Minister and Department cannot have any specific input into it, the legal <Col N="1511" /> profession needs to address the need for consistency in sentencing by the courts, particularly within the District Court in respect of minor offences. Some such offences in the eyes of some judges seem to merit extraordinarily harsh sentences while in the view of other judges they merit minor sentences. This issue needs to be addressed.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Honourable Ms Justice Susan Denham of the Supreme Court on the work she has done in respect of the Courts and Court Officers Bill, and on the work she has done since she was appointed chairperson. She has brought a breath of fresh air. I appeal to future Ministers and Governments to look at the merit of women. Women in the Judiciary are few in number but their contribution in terms of law and reform within the justice system outstrips their numbers completely. They have made a remarkable contribution. In future, more women must be appointed and a greater balance must be achieved in appointments to the Judiciary.</P>
    <P>The Minister's taking on board of the e-courts to be developed throughout the court system, which has been recommended by the Honourable Ms Justice Susan Denham, is extremely welcome. I look forward to seeing the manner in which that will take place. If it is to be effectively implemented, there will be a need&mdash;</P>

      <P>When the Acting Chairman and the Minister choose to listen to me, I will continue. As I said, it is important that those involved in putting the e-court system in place not only have legal expertise but also a combined expertise in e-commerce and in the entire technological field. I do not believe lawyers, singularly, have the necessary expertise required to properly adjudicate in that matter. There is a need to focus current law students in the dual direction of studying not only commercial law but also e-commerce. There is no point in saying that because one has a degree in commercial and company law one is an expert in e-commerce. Technology and e-commerce are independent areas of expertise. Those involved should be properly educated and equipped to go down that particular route.</P>
      <P>With regard to judicial training and the preparation of judges, it is important to deal with all the new challenges that arise. The Minister has addressed that to a certain degree in the course of his contribution this evening. I look forward to hearing what will happen in the future regarding the type of training systems that will be put in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We live in a modern society. European law is increasingly becoming a feature of national law and, increasingly, European directives are becoming part of national law. The inter-relationship between the two is quite extraordinary. Also, the expansion of international law and the extent of <Col N="1512" /> the declarations we have signed up to over the years, be they UN declarations or otherwise, create a widened legal dimension. While we are now expanding the entire legal system in respect of its European and international dimensions, we need suitably equipped people to adjudicate in that area.</P>
    <P>We can be proud of the people who have gone from Ireland to the European Court of Justice and elsewhere. They have acquitted themselves extraordinarily well. They have demonstrated an expertise, knowledge and ability to interpret and administer the law at a level that is second to none. For that reason we can be proud of those who have represented us on boards internationally in the past.</P>
    <P>With regard to court facilities, the Minister was in my home town of Kilrush last Tuesday opening a refurbished courthouse. However, we need additional refurbishment across the country to modernise standards and ensure there are proper facilities where the public can have its wrongs redressed and where the practitioners can see that the law is applied according to proper up to date standards in what is now a buoyant economy. It is important that the dignity the law deserves is reflected in the type of accommodation in which it is administered. The courts service is doing a very good job and is addressing the aforementioned issue. It is a matter for the Minister to continue to provide funding to meet their requirements so our courts do not degenerate into extraordinarily bad condition and Third World standards, as some of our courts are in at the present. This is unacceptable. We should be proud of our heritage buildings in towns throughout the country. It is important that we maintain these traditional old buildings of which we should be proud because they will lend a greater hallmark of tradition and dignity to towns in the future.</P>
    <P>Given the way in which, I hope, the Good Friday Agreement will develop in the future, there is an opening for the Minister to encourage greater interaction between the Judiciary north and south of the Border. I hope this issue will be addressed in the future. In the past we had to deal with extradition and other difficult cases. I hope a more friendly, co-operative and common bond will develop between the two areas in the future. I appreciate that the systems, North and South, together with the British system, are based on a common system and take a common approach to the law. We inherited this system from the British and we used it in a very formidable fashion in the Republic in the past 80 years. It is important this system continues in the future.</P>
    <P>As time progresses the jurisdiction of the courts should be extended in relation to cases being adjudicated on in the Circuit and High Courts. There is a great need for an opening up between the two professions because there should be no such thing as two professions. There is almost an interest in the professions to main<Col N="1513" /> tain the <i>status quo</i>. I am not sure it is in the interest of the public that that division should continue <i>ad infinitum</i>. Most practising lawyers have similar training but the more academically inclined people will eventually end up in the Supreme and High Courts. There is a need to address this issue because the division is not necessary. That may not be a popular thing to say but I believe we must become more consumer-friendly. This is a small island country of just four million people and we sometimes have the trappings of the empire, for which there is no need. Justice can be seen to be done with a less complicated and pompous approach. The sooner we dilute some of the pomposity in the profession the better it will be for the system in general. I hope the Courts and Court Officers Bill will address that matter in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom fáilte a cur roimh an Aire to dtí an Teach so agus fáilte roimh an mBille seo freisin.</P>
      <P>This is a very good Bill and I congratulate the Minister on the number of Bill he has brought through this House in the past five years. It was all very important legislation which has made Ireland a safer place in which to live and it will make it easier for people to get justice. I welcome in particular the fact that the current jurisdictions of the Circuit and District Courts were set in 1991. The increases now provided for are from £5,000 to &euro;20,000 in the case of the District Court and from £30,000 to &euro;100,000 in the case of the Circuit Court. This is very important because many cases taken in the Circuit and High Courts can now be heard in local courts. It would be a good idea to cap the number of legal people involved in these courts but I suppose that would not be possible. The legal profession currently commands a great amount of money. Of every £100 paid out in motor insurance, approximately £40 goes to the legal profession and £60 to the claimant. The Minister has done something about this issue which is very important. He is setting up a statutory personal injuries assessment board to decide issues of quantum in personal injuries arising from employers' liability and motor insurance claims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very important aspect and I hope he can ring-fence it so that the legal profession does not become involved. It is important to make people realise that by dealing with the personal injuries assessment board they will probably end up with a lot more money in their pockets than if they go through the legal system. While they might appear to get more in the courts, by the time the legal profession is paid they may not have as much as they thought in the first place. Very often when people receive an injury they go to their solicitor. The case can drag on for three to four years and very often these people have no wages for the duration of the case. The solicitor may ask them to sign a form, go to the bank and borrow some money. While they may agree to <Col N="1514" /> borrow so much from the bank, the form signed was an undertaking on the part of the solicitor that when the claim would come through the bank would be paid out of the claimant's cheque. By the time the bank is paid, including the accumulated interest, these people may find that they are left with a very small amount of money. The banks and lawyers get all the money.</P>
    <P>It would be helpful if there was a faster way of pursuing claims. Very often claims are carried a bit too far. I have no doubt if I approached a solicitor after falling and damaging my shoulder I would probably get &euro;25,000 or &euro;30,000 from a local authority . I am almost handless but I have no intention of seeking compensation. I have always believed that people must take responsibility for where they walk. There should be some demarcation line in regard to personal and public responsibility. People should watch where they are walking. If they are stupid enough to fall and get hurt, as I did, that is one's hard luck. It is not right that lawyers should place advertisements enticing people to submit compensation claims. I would like to see some restriction on lawyers who encourage people to make claims by advertising that the first interview will be free and afterwards they will see what they can do. Most of these cases are settled out of court.</P>
    <P>I have a problem with insurance companies which say it is cheaper for them to settle because they settle a multiplicity of cases. This is wrong. Young people nowadays find it very difficult to obtain car insurance and many firms can no longer afford to pay public liability. When I set up my business in the 1960s I had a filling station, garage and restaurant and I was paying £25 public liability. Today my family pays almost &euro;100,000. I admit they have extended the business, but insurance costs have increased dramatically. People must realise that large claims will put firms out of business and put people out of work. I would like to see some restriction on the way in which money is squandered in relation to the courts system.</P>
    <P>I am pleased the number of District, Circuit and High Court judges is being increased. A factor which militates against obtaining insurance is that it takes three or four years for cases to come to court. If cases could be brought to court quickly, it would make the process more efficient and reduce costs. In this country senior counsel, junior counsel and solicitors are involved in cases. Why is all this necessary?</P>
    <P>I have had to give court evidence in a few cases and the advice from solicitors was not to settle because they would get you more money. As soon as they get to the steps of court, they recommend you settle for lesser amounts because they know once the case goes further, senior counsel and junior counsel must be paid. If it was settled out of court, on the other hand, the solicitors would not earn expenses. There is a racket going on in high places and unfortunately it is business <Col N="1515" /> people and ordinary tax payers who are taking the State to court.</P>
    <P>It is important we make full use of judges. I welcome this Bill and I hope that the Minister, in some future Bill, will do something to cap the amount of money going to the legal profession. Young people in rural Ireland cannot get to work because it is impossible to get insurance given the high motor insurance costs. Insurance firms advertise all the time, but when you ring them up, they cherry-pick clients from whom they think they can make the most money. I bought my first car, a little Morris 8, for £25 in 1948. I insured it with Lloyds of London for £15, third party fire and theft, and I taxed it for three months for about £3.50. I had my car on the road for less than £50. Admittedly, I was only earning £50 a week at the time, but it was so easy to get insurance because we did not have the compensation culture that exists today.</P>
    <P>The compensation culture originated in America and Britain and is now rife in this country. Something will have to be done to put an end to it. I had a couple of accidents but did not look for compensation because I think it is unjust. It may be legally right but it is morally wrong and I would love to see a cap on it. I welcome this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this very practical Bill which has a lot of excellent measures that should have been introduced sooner, including the provisions to allow solicitors to be judges and to deal with the division between the solicitor and barrister professions.</P>
      <P>It is dreadful that we need so many judges. There is a great national appetite for litigation and it is extraordinary that life has become so centred upon the courts. Personally, my only involvement with the courts was in acting as an expert witness. I have always found courts to be rather intimidating places, but some people seem to have a great desire to go there. There is greater informal discussion between judges regarding sentencing policies and so on, but it must be extremely difficult for them to keep up with legislation and I hope they are given sufficient time to go on training courses, attend seminars and so on. We pass legislation here, but it is the Judiciary who has the responsibility of interpreting it and I hope they are given sufficient time to do so.</P>
      <P>Many people have expressed concern recently about variations in sentencing policy. Senator Taylor-Quinn referred to this, and I am sure she was thinking of a rape case recently where the rapist got a suspended sentence despite threatening to kill the woman involved. The judge ruled that she had no other injuries, but if she had struggled and had her head beaten in or whatever, would that have made the whole process more acceptable? It seemed an extraordinary decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am less than enthusiastic about rapists being allowed to give monetary compensation to vic<Col N="1516" /> tims rather than serve custodial sentences. It sends out a message that the rich can escape penalties while the poor cannot, even though the crime is equally bad regardless of who commits it. I am sure the Minister is well aware of the public's concern about this.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrell talked about the difficulty of trying to reduce costs, and it is extraordinarily difficult to do so. My main interest is in medical litigation and the Department of Health and Children proposes to introduce, on 1 July, enterprise liability or indemnity whereby the Department rather than insurance companies will be liable for the costs of medical negligence cases. I do not know how this will work, but I hope the Department understands what an extremely tricky area it is entering into and the extent of the costs involved. The Department will have to employ experts and will have to be in the position of advising those individuals who are being pursued for negligence.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that Dr. John Harding-Price, who was employed as a psychiatrist in this country despite being suspended by the General Medical Council in Britain, was yesterday acquitted of everything he was accused of. There was great uproar here about the South Eastern Health Board and the Irish Medical Council letting him work when he was suspended in Britain. We are very inclined to prejudge cases. This man managed to demonstrate his innocence even without the aid of a lawyer.</P>
    <P>With medical litigation, we had hoped when the ruling regarding the exchange of expert witnesses came into being that there would be a reduction in costs. This is where both sides had to exchange the reports from their expert witnesses early in the case. Unfortunately, this seems to have been generally overlooked. In addition, plaintiffs are being allowed introduce a new expert witness on a totally different track if it discovered that the defendant's expert witness has undermined the original case.</P>
    <P>This is a very difficult area which seems to be encouraging more and more litigation. Senator Farrell talked about lawyers luring people into court with the enticement of getting more money. I have had a great deal of information from insurance companies which tell me they try to settle long before a case goes to court, but on the steps of the court the settlement takes place because all fees are paid up to then. There are many more practising lawyers now than there used to be, but then we also have more courts and more judges. I hope we can call a halt to the amount of litigation that is taking place because it is costing the State an enormous amount of money.</P>
    <P>I have had a motion on the Order Paper for some time which reads:</P>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann, concerned that some of those involved in child custody cases before the Family Courts feel aggrieved about their <Col N="1517" /> treatment, asks the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to consider allowing some reporting of cases from these courts on an anonymous basis, so that the public may have a better knowledge of the workings of the courts.</P>
    <P>Had I known that this Bill was coming forward, I would have asked the Minister to include legislation to deal with this issue. I am sure I am not the only Senator being contacted by people in relation to family law cases where they consider that they were badly treated. We cannot have any notion of how such people were treated because, quite correctly, family law cases are heard <i>in camera</i>. I have contacted the courts service about this and they told me that, over a year ago, a barrister was appointed to report anonymously from the family courts. It was anticipated that this would facilitate a greater understanding of the nature of family law cases. I gather the Attorney General advised that the <i>in camera</i> law is so strict that the barrister could not report and that additional legislation would be required to allow him to do so. Unfortunately, it is too late for me to propose an amendment that would allow such reporting to go ahead. Nevertheless, I hope the Minister will take this idea on board and act on it at a later date. Family law is a difficult area to discuss because all we can rely on for information is gossip and anecdote. A proper, anonymous report of cases from the family court would be extraordinarily useful in facilitating a greater understanding of the scope and judgments of the court.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill and congratulate the Minister on it.</P>

      <P>I thank the Senators who have contributed to this debate. This Bill is essentially a practical piece of legislation. It is worthy of enactment by virtue of the very real benefits which it will confer in relation to the smooth running of our courts system. It provides that solicitors may now be eligible for direct appointment as judges of the High and Supreme Courts. The monetary jurisdiction of the Circuit and District Courts have been increased to levels which are reflective of today's society. Additional judges are to be appointed to the High, Circuit and District Courts. County registrars are to be conferred with a range of additional and extended powers which will build on the foundation laid by the Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995.</P>
      <P>The provision in respect of county registrars will simultaneously enhance the quasi-judicial nature of that role and reduce the workload of Circuit Court judges in routine administrative problems.</P>
      <P>In relation to sentencing policy, an issue which has been raised a number of times, there is now a judicial studies institute which deals with judicial training. Consistency of sentencing is dealt with by this institute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding e-courts, I was recently presented with a report that considers the merits of estab<Col N="1518" /> lishing a commercial court in Ireland. It would be accessible electronically and could develop links with arbitration centres. The report and recommendations prepared by the committee on court practice and procedure, chaired by the Honourable Ms Justice Susan Denham of the Supreme Court, proposed that e-courts should be developed throughout the courts system. The committee found that a commercial court would underpin and reinforce Ireland's position as an e-commerce hub and recommends that a pilot commercial court be developed in the High Court.</P>
    <P>Real advances have been made in the area of satisfactory facilities for litigants. There has been an improvement in the service provided by the courts to all those who engage in court related matters. The courts service building programme has resulted in the refurbishment of a significant number of courthouses in recent years. Indeed, I was in Senator Taylor-Quinn's home town of Kilrush recently, where I opened the refurbished courthouse. I said then and I say now that I have blazed a trail which many others will no doubt follow.</P>

      <P>The enactment of this Bill will support the Judiciary, the courts service and, most importantly, the users of the courts. It is an important Bill, notwithstanding that it is composed of many diverse elements.</P>

      <P>On balance I feel it should not be &ldquo;at the request of&rdquo; the President of that court. All cases should be completed by the judge who initially hears the case. I am aware there have been situations where two different judges have adjudicated or heard the same case. A judge who starts a case is more familiar with the details than a judge who comes in along the line. It is not in the interests of best practice of administration of justice to have two judges hearing a case.</P>
      <P>This section refers to the completion of partly heard cases by judges appointed to higher courts. It states that it can be &ldquo;partly heard by the person in the Court in which the judicial office is vacated if, at the request of the President of that Court.&rdquo;. In order to have equity and consistency one person should have charge of a case right through. Cases where two different judges have been involved have shown that it has not always been in the interest of either the defendant or the plaintiff. Will the Minister review that matter?</P>

For example, take two judges of the Supreme Court who go out golfing and are unfortunately both killed in a car accident on the way home. Two High Court judges will have to be promoted almost immediately to take up their places because we cannot have only three Supreme Court judges &ndash; we must have five on the Bench. Those promoted judges may have to leave behind some cases but they will do their utmost, as at present, to hear them. That is the practice at the moment. How about that Minister for dead judges?</P>

This has been going on for over a year and I keep hearing that it will require legislation. We constantly receive complaints, based on anecdotal evidence, from people who feel they have been badly treated by the courts and about which we can say nothing but if there were generalised reports, we could do so. Essentially, the courts function well.</P>
      <P>The Courts Service appointed a person but the Attorney General said that the <i>in camera</i> rule was so strict that, without further legislation, the woman, who is a barrister, could not report.

      <P>I support Senator Henry's comments on this section. There are constant reports from people who feel they have not been treated well in the family court and comments of an unacceptable nature have been made in some cases. Sometimes people try to ensure their case is not heard by certain judges because they are apprehensive that they will not do as well in front of them. This has to do with balance, consistency and the necessity for proper training. More female judges are required to bring balance, particularly to the family court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The <i>in camera</i> rule has merit and is commendable from many points of view but because of the rule, unacceptable comments that could not be made in open court may be made behind closed doors. People have been subject to unacceptable remarks during<i> in camera</i> court hearings. The <Col N="1523" /> onus is on the Minister and his Department to ensure this does not happen.</P>
    <P>While anonymity is required for plaintiffs and defendants, I do not accept that the details of these cases cannot be reported using the forms of &ldquo;case A&rdquo; and &ldquo;plaintiff B&rdquo; and so on. It is in the interests of justice that this matter is closely examined. There is a tendency towards a more chauvinistic attitude in our society. This attitude permeates certain courts, including the family court, and the Minister has a responsibility to examine that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion comes before the House as a result of advice I received last December from the Attorney General when dealing with proposals for a framework decision on a European arrest warrant and a framework decision on combating terrorism. The practice established by that advice is that Dáil and Seanad motions approving framework decisions are necessary and, accordingly, I am bringing forward the motion.</P>
      <P>The motion was discussed and approved at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights on 20 March 2002. The full subject matter of the motion I am bringing before this House today is a draft Council framework decision on combating the trafficking of human beings for the purposes of labour and sexual exploitation. While expressed in gender neutral terms, the vast majority of persons trafficked across international borders, or within countries, for such purposes are women but may include a not insignificant number of children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1524" />Trafficking for the purposes of the exploitation or prostitution and other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labour or services, or practices similar to slavery or servitude, is not new. It was recognised in legislation as far back as the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1885, which made it an offence to procure a girl to leave this country to become a prostitute. However, to some extent it has crept up on us in Europe in recent years, in particular since the opening of the Iron Curtain. For example, ECPAT, an organisation dedicated to ending child prostitution, pornography and trafficking, in a recent publication quotes police forces in the UK as estimating that the first signs of this form of trafficking were detected about ten or 11 years ago in the UK. Literally millions of women and children have been and continue to be trafficked worldwide and while the Irish share of that may be tiny, we may be a receiving country for victims of trafficking, even though on a relatively small scale.</P>
    <P>To give some idea of the current scale of the problem of trafficking, the United Nations has estimated that it is a $5 billion to $7 billion operation annually, with four million persons moved from one country to another and within countries. Some of the world's most familiar criminal groups are involved in trafficking which is not surprising given the vast amounts of money to be made from it. The trafficking can take many forms, the most obvious being the movement of women from central and eastern Europe, the Far East and Africa to work in the sex industries of western Europe and other wealthy and industrialised countries.</P>
    <P>Many if not most such women are duped or coerced into prostitution and remain in prostitution through a combination of fear and threats as well as lack of knowledge of how to seek help in what for them are strange countries. Other forms of exploitation include the mail order bride industries and sex tourism. Children are often the victims of sex tourism, in particular in parts of Asia where children as young as eight years of age are sold to recruiters and end up in brothels catering to international sex tourists.</P>
    <P>That is just a flavour of the scope, criminality and degeneracy of the appalling crime of trafficking. It is a global crime, an organised crime and a lucrative crime. Therefore, it has to be dealt with on an international basis. To do so it will be necessary for countries to have broadly similar criminal offences. The penalties should be of sufficient severity to adequately reflect the seriousness of the crime and cross-border police co-operation and judicial co-operation generally should be promoted.</P>
    <P>I wish to briefly outline relevant legislation in this country that protects children and other vulnerable groups against sexual abuse and exploitation, and the relevance of that legislation to the fight at international level against exploitation. Even before I was appointed Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I published the Sexual <Col N="1525" /> Offences (Jurisdiction) Bill in 1995, which was backed by the then Government and became the Sexual Offences (Jurisdiction) Act, 1996. That Act dealt specifically with the problem of international sex tourism. The Child Trafficking and Pornography Act, 1998, made it an offence to traffic children into, through or out of Ireland for the purpose of their sexual exploitation and criminalised the possession, production and distribution of child pornography. In doing so, it gave effect to the EU joint action on trafficking in human beings and the sexual exploitation of children, except in so far as the trafficking aspects related to adults. I will explain the reasons for that exclusion in a moment. The recent Sex Offenders Act provided children and other vulnerable persons with a comprehensive package of protections against sexual abuse and attack, including the establishment of a sex offender register. Sex offenders from abroad are obliged to register with the Garda Síochána as are sex offenders living in this country when travelling abroad.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that the 1998 Act did not deal with trafficking in adults for the purpose of their exploitation. The reason was that that legislation was specifically aimed at protecting children &ndash; the protection of adults was outside its aim and scope. The intention had been to legislate later to protect adults against being trafficked for the purpose of their exploitation. However, in December 1998, the UN General Assembly established an <i>ad hoc </i>committee on the exploration of a convention against transnational organised crime. One of the protocols to the convention, which was negotiated at the same time as the convention, dealt with trafficking in persons, especially women and children. In December 2000, in Palermo, I signed that convention and protocol on behalf of Ireland. Shortly after that, in February 2001, the proposal for a Council framework decision on combating trafficking in human beings was presented. Negotiations on the framework decision were ongoing throughout last year. The final text is now available and is ready for formal adoption as soon as all parliamentary scrutiny reservations have been lifted.</P>
    <P>The framework decision replaces the joint action I referred to a few moments ago in so far as it concerns trafficking in human beings. A separate framework decision, still being negotiated, dealing with the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography, will replace the remainder of the joint action.</P>
    <P>I will now outline the purpose and terms of the framework decision on trafficking. A need was identified to follow the joint action concerning action to combat trafficking in human beings and the sexual exploitation of children, with further action aimed at addressing the divergence of legal approaches in the member states and contributing to the development of efficient judicial and law enforcement co-operation against trafficking in human beings. It is now universally accepted <Col N="1526" /> that such trafficking constitutes a serious violation of human rights and human dignity and involves ruthless and unacceptable practices such as the abuse and deception of vulnerable persons, as well as the use of violence, threats, debt bondage and coercion. Dealing with the problem requires a comprehensive approach in which the definition of constituent elements of criminal law common to all member states forms an integral part.</P>
    <P>Article 1 of the framework decision creates a criminal offence concerning trafficking in human beings for the purposes of labour exploitation or sexual exploitation. Criminal acts will include acts such as the recruitment, transportation and reception of a person for the purpose of exploiting that person's labour or services, including forced or compulsory labour or services, slavery or servitude, or for the purpose of sexual exploitation, including prostitution, pornography or other forms of sexual exploitation.</P>
    <P>For an offence to be committed there must have been coercion, force, abduction, deceit, fraud, abuse of authority or of a position of vulnerability or the making of payment or giving of benefits, to achieve the consent of a person such as a parent having control over another person. Where any of the above means have been used, any consent given by the victim is irrelevant and where the victim is under 18 years of age, none of the above means need have been used.</P>
    <P>Article 2 ensures that the instigation of, aiding or abetting or attempting to commit an offence under article 1 are also offences. Article 3 sets out the penalties. The penalties for offences under articles 1 and 2 should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive criminal penalties which may be extraditable, that is, have a minimum penalty of at least six months imprisonment. There are circumstances where the penalties would have to include a maximum term of imprisonment of not less than eight years. These include where the life of the victim has been endangered through deliberate action or gross negligence; the victim was particularly vulnerable, such as when under the age of sexual majority or consent; serious violence was used or serious harm caused to the victim; and the offence had been committed within the framework of a criminal organisation.</P>
    <P>With regard to the circumstance of particular vulnerability, the age of consent in this country is 17 years. The above penalties may seem lenient when compared to the level of penalties for analogous offences in Irish legislation. For example, trafficking in children for the purposes of sexual exploitation carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. The penalty structure is a compromise between the high and low penalty countries but in no way affects our ability to provide for higher penalties if we so wish.</P>
    <P>Article 4 is a standard provision in framework decisions concerning the liability of legal persons or corporations and article 5 ensures that legal <Col N="1527" /> persons can be punished by sanctions that are effective, proportionate and dissuasive.</P>
    <P>Article 6 deals with the requirement to establish jurisdiction where the offence is committed in whole or in part within a member state's territory, where the offender is one of its nationals or where the offence is committed for the benefit of a legal person established in the territory of that member state. Optional jurisdiction arises in the latter two cases where the offence is committed outside the territory of the member state.</P>
    <P>Article 7 contains important provisions aimed at protecting victims and offering them assistance. Investigation into or prosecution of offences will not be dependent on the victim reporting the crime or making accusations against another person. Children will be considered particularly vulnerable victims for the purposes of the relevant articles of the framework decision on the standing of victims in criminal proceedings. Article 4 of that decision concerning the right to receive information will apply to the families of child victims.</P>
    <P>Article 8 obliges member states to comply with the framework decision within two years of its adoption, and article 9 repeals the relevant provisions of the 1997 joint action.</P>
    <P>I recommend the proposal to the House. It provides for a co-ordinated and comprehensive response to the growing problem of trafficking in persons for the purpose of their labour or sexual exploitation. It will require legislation to implement and preparatory work on that legislation has commenced in my Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this motion and look forward to legislation being presented to the House so that effect can be given to its terms. As a member state of the European Union and as a member of the United Nations, we must deal with this matter. Over the past ten to 15 years, the level of human trafficking in Europe, including the exploitation of women and children in particular, has risen appallingly and this country has not remained untouched by it. Various reports have highlighted the trafficking of women between England and Ireland for purposes of prostitution. Equally, the abuse of children in this country is continuing. While the motion deals with trafficking in human beings between countries, in our country we have seen the abuse of children, particularly the homeless who live on the streets of Dublin. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform must monitor this situation intently to ensure that such children receive the necessary protection. I appreciate that the Sex Offenders Act affords some protection to children but, nevertheless, children who are most vulnerable remain so. The Minister should liaise with the Garda Síochána to ensure that this will not continue to be the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The figures the Minister has laid before the House are astounding, particularly the UK statis<Col N="1528" /> tics which indicate an increase in human trafficking. A UN report has estimated that between $5 billion and $7 billion is spent annually on combating human trafficking which involves over four million people worldwide. At the start of the 21st century, we are supposed to be living in an advanced, civilised world, yet we seem to be regressing as far as the dignity of human beings is concerned. It would appear that the more vibrant an economy becomes and the more affluent people are, the more abusive they are towards the underprivileged and deprived. Vulnerable women and children should not be subjected to such appalling abuse. The type of criminal gangs involved, who resort to fear and intimidation to achieve their ends, deserve to receive the full force of the law in every country that has signed up to this protocol. No one has a right to take away another person's individual dignity, independence and integrity. The perpetrators of such crimes must be pursued with the full rigour of international law.</P>
    <P>Children are being moved around in this country and health boards are finding it difficult to track their movements. I am sure the Minister knows that there are few towns in this country where children are not being abused, and that continues to be the case. Signing up to framework decisions is highly commendable, but for it to be fully effective and to be implemented fully the personnel need to be put in place.</P>
    <P>What is being done to stop these gangs who traffick people between England and Ireland? What have the Minister's colleagues in the European Union done to effect this framework decision? Apart from signing up to it and incorporating it in legislation, what additional personnel have been put in place to ensure it is effected? I am not aware of any and unless those personnel are put in place, the framework decision will not be implemented.</P>
    <P>A huge amount of American money is obviously used in this operation. What discussions has the Minister had with the American Government and the people in the equivalent department to his on this issue? A massive amount of money is generated by people flying from American to Asia for the purposes of using and abusing children there. This must be condemned and outlawed. How will those children in Asia be protected from the wealthy Americans and Europeans who go to Asia to use and abuse them? I am not sure how this protection might be given and I wish the Minister would put some detail on record in this regard.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the legislation which will be produced as a result of agreeing to participate in this framework decision. The increase in the trafficking of humans is appalling and deserves to be condemned. It removes a person's dignity. Women are subjected to considerable intimidation by pimps and criminal gangs who ferry them in to this country from England or who fly them in through Dublin and other airports. They <Col N="1529" /> are set up for weekends in Dublin and other parts of the country to provide prostitution services. The pimps reap the reward.</P>
    <P>What are the Garda authorities and the Minister's Department doing to protect these women and to stop the men who bully and intimidate them into the set-up I described? How many arrests and prosecutions of these men have there been in Dublin city in the past two to three years? Let us hear the record. We need action and, while this framework decision is a welcome step in the right direction, I want details from the Minister about how successful his Department and the Garda authorities have been in rooting out this crime.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will be able to put on record in his reply what he proposes to do to protect prostitutes. Legislation in this area is extraordinary in that prostitutes are prosecuted and the pimps go free. When gardaí make arrests in this area, it is of prostitutes. Have pimps been arrested, pursued through the courts and prosecuted? In most instances women are forced onto the streets or into various establishments in Dublin city and towns throughout the country. They are bullied and beaten by pimps to enter and remain in prostitution to make money for these ruthless men. The Minister has a responsibility to ensure these ruthless people are brought to justice.</P>

      <P>I welcome the motion and congratulate the Minister on what he has done. The Bill we passed yesterday will prevent people entering the country without proper documentation, and I congratulate the Minister on bringing it in. I could talk about the subject of this motion for a long time but I will not make a speech. The motion the Minister has brought to the House says everything we want it to and I am delighted that there will be a life sentence for those caught trafficking. I would like that to mean imprisonment for the rest of their lives without a review and not just for 21 years. These traffickers are violent, evil criminals and must be put out of business at all costs. The Minister will introduce follow-on legislation from this motion which we will discuss at a later stage. I welcome the motion and congratulate the Minister on bringing it before the House. I am sure it has the support of all Members.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the motion has the support of all Members. This issue concerns an extraordinary development in recent decades. I sincerely hope the unfortunate abuse of modern technology, the Internet and e-mail is being carefully policed because this is where a considerable amount of trafficking deals take place. I understand the trade is worth more than trafficking in drugs, which is incredible. People not only come from behind the old Iron Curtain countries of Moldova, Ukraine, etc., but also from Africa. If the Minister is ever in Italy, he will notice the <Col N="1530" /> appalling spectacle of African girls left in lay-bys for the day for the benefit of truck drivers and others going past. A considerable number of them have paid people to come to Italy in the belief they would get jobs. Their families are blackmailed if they do not co-operate in the trade. It is a difficult issue.</P>
      <P>Senator Taylor-Quinn raised the lack of protection for prostitutes in this country. One of the problems for the trade created by the legislation is that it has forced it indoors. Prostitutes felt safer when they were on the streets because they had the option of choosing clients, whereas they must accept whoever turns up at these massage parlours, as they are described. As Senator Taylor-Quinn said, prostitutes do not make large amounts of money from the trade, rather it is pimps who do so.</P>
      <P>One concern about people coming to this country and being coerced into prostitution is that work permits for non-EU nationals are held by employers. That gives them a terrible hold over the employees. People are required to work for one employer. If the work permit was given to the person coming into the country, he or she would be in a position to choose their employer. The system at present means an employer has a tremendous hold over his or her employees. I do not have evidence that the system has been abused, but I am less than happy with it. Perhaps the Minister might ask his officials to discuss this with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and her Department to see if they have evidence that it has been exploited.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned ECPAT. We should praise Muireann Ó Briain, the lawyer at the head of the organisation in Bangkok. It was she who first got me involved in this issue and encouraged me to bring my Private Members' Bill on child sex tourism before the House about eight years ago. We have not been too slow off the mark in this area, even though we are on the periphery. I hope the Minister's Department will bring forward the necessary legislation as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate on the proposal for a framework decision on combating trafficking in human beings. The matter remains to be fleshed out by way of legislation in due course and I sincerely hope that, at that stage, effective measures will be taken in this regard and that we will have a legislative framework to ensure traffickers will be caught and punished. The existing legislation on trafficking in human beings, which was enacted a few years ago, has not been very effective and that also applies to similar legislation in other European countries. To the best of my knowledge, no trafficker has ever been convicted in this country, although we know they operate here. I was rapporteur for the Council of Europe in a report on trafficking in human beings for domestic slavery and the findings were quite extraordinary. The major problem is that the <Col N="1531" /> authorities in most countries tend to regard victims of trafficking primarily as illegal immigrants. In many countries, this places the victim at risk of being subjected to an expulsion measure. Indeed, our existing legislation allows the Minister and the relevant authorities to enforce expulsion from this country. In some countries that status deprives them of all legal, social and even medical assistance. I do not know if that also applies here. However, it is quite clear that people who are brought here by illegal traffickers have no other status than that of illegal immigrants. That is how the Government and the Minister's Department regards them.</P>
      <P>In some countries, the situation is so bad that illegal immigrants hesitate to report the serious offences perpetrated against them because they know that, while the traffickers might possibly be convicted, the migrants themselves are virtually certain to be expelled, even though they are simply victims of the situation. I suggest to the Minister that the relevant legislation, when it is brought forward, should recognise the victim status of those people and that, on humanitarian grounds, they be given temporary residence if they are willing to give evidence against traffickers. Our legal systems should be so well integrated that a trafficker could be convicted in a French court on the evidence of a person trafficked into Ireland. Our current legislation does not provide for that. The Minister and I have clashed on that issue previously; we have fundamentally different views and approaches to this issue of migration and the definition of victims and culprits. Obviously, the relevant new legislation will not be enacted in the present Oireachtas but it must happen in the next one, whoever may be Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in the next Government. Whether the present Minister has any influence in that context, from the Opposition benches or otherwise, I hope the approach I have advocated will be taken.</P>
      <P>In my report for the Council of Europe, I was surprised by the evidence that came forward about trafficking in human beings by people in the diplomatic services of certain countries. It is an extraordinary situation that there are people working in embassies in various European countries, perhaps even in this country although I have no evidence to that effect, who have been trafficking workers as domestic slaves, while hiding behind the Vienna convention of 1961 which provides a system of privilege and immunities for members of the diplomatic corps. The purpose of such privileges and immunities is, of course, to protect diplomats from pressures which might be brought to bear against them by the host state. Staff of international organisations, such as the United Nations and its agencies, also enjoy such privileges and immunities as laid down in the agreements concluded with the receiving state or in the organisation's statute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1532" />Article 31 of the Vienna convention stipulates that diplomatic agents shall enjoy full immunity from jurisdiction, criminal, civil and administrative and from enforcement measures in the host state. At the same time, diplomats' persons and property are rendered inviolable under articles 29 and 30 of the agreement. These privileges are extended to diplomats' spouses and even to their minor children. There is clear evidence of abuse of this diplomatic immunity in the context of trafficking people to work in servitude in embassies and diplomatic residences in many European countries, including France and the United Kingdom. As I said, I have no evidence that it is taking place in Ireland but, since it is so widespread in other European countries, I would not be surprised to find it happening here to some extent. While there is great difficulty in relation to the Vienna convention and the diplomatic immunity which it confers, we need to question its role in the trafficking issue to which I have referred. The meanest of criminals are profiting from this vile trade. The Minister's comment coincides with my finding that some four million people are trafficked every year, a majority of whom are women. It is quite appalling that diplomats should have any part in that activity and that it has, by all accounts, the sanction of certain countries, mainly in Asia and Africa. That aspect of human trafficking has not been sufficiently highlighted.</P>
    <P>I hope to be in one of these Houses when the relevant legislation comes forward.</P>

      <P>The legislation should not be just a measure against traffickers but should also have regard to their victims, who should not be regarded as simply illegal immigrants to be expelled. If we are to tackle traffickers effectively, we need the evidence of their victims and we should create the conditions whereby temporary residence permits would be available to these people in consideration of their evidence. They should have that minimum protection in the host countries, including Ireland.</P>
      <P>I am glad this proposal has been promulgated by the European Union and that all member states are now expected to legislate accordingly. I hope the Irish legislation will be along the lines I have indicated.</P>

      <P>Senators asked what is being done at European level to prevent trafficking. As recently as 28 February, the Justice and Home Affairs Council of Ministers approved an action plan to combat illegal immigration and trafficking into the European Union. This is a comprehensive plan which is aimed at defining a common, integrated approach to all the questions linked to illegal immigration and human trafficking. The <Col N="1533" /> plan identifies seven areas where this is necessary, including visa policy, exchange and analysis of information, re-admission and repatriation policies, free frontiers, measures relating to border management and Europe-wide penalties.</P>
      <P>I was also asked what is being done to deal with pimps. The Sexual Offences Act, 1993, provides severe penalties for persons who coerce or compel persons into prostitution and also criminalises living off the earnings of prostitution. The example which was given of what is happening in Italy illustrates the type of situation with which this framework decision deals. With regard to existing anti-trafficking legislation, this was based on an EU joint action which is now considered inadequate to deal with the problem, hence the need for this framework decision and the legislation that will flow from it. In drawing up the legislation we will look at the position of victims, in particular in the context of the EU framework document on the standing of victims in criminal proceedings.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann:</P>
      <P>&ndash;&nbsp;bearing in mind the serious public concern about allegations that members of the Garda Síochána in the Donegal division engaged in unethical and criminal behaviour;</P>
      <P>&ndash;&nbsp;noting the decision of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in November 2001 to request Mr. Shane Murphy, SC, to conduct an independent review of all the relevant papers and the progress on the investigations into these allegations generally with a view to the Minister receiving expert independent advice as to whether there are measures that might now be taken to bring matters to finality sooner rather than later;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ndash;&nbsp;noting that having completed his review, it is the opinion of Mr. Shane Murphy, SC, that a tribunal of inquiry represents the only comprehensive method of inquiry to resolve <Col N="1534" /> outstanding issues of fundamental public importance;</P>
    <P>&ndash;&nbsp;mindful that a number of criminal proceedings have been instituted arising from some of these allegations, and mindful of the ongoing investigation into the death of Mr. Richard Barron, and not wishing to prejudice these or related criminal proceedings;</P>
    <P>resolves that it is expedient that a tribunal be established under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts, 1921 to 2002, to inquire urgently into the following definite matters of urgent public importance:</P>
    <P>(<i>a</i>) The making of extortion and hoax telephone calls to the home of Michael and Charlotte Peoples on 9 November 1996 and the subsequent Garda investigation into that complaint;</P>
    <P>(<i>b</i>) Investigations in relation to the death of Mr. Richie Barron of Raphoe, County Donegal, on 14 October 1996 with particular reference to the arrest and treatment of persons in custody in connection with that investigation, the progress, management and effectiveness of the Garda investigation with particular reference to the management of informants;</P>
    <P>(<i>c</i>) Allegations of harassment of the McBrearty family of Raphoe, County Donegal, and of relatives, associates and agents of that family by members of the Garda Síochána subsequent to the death of Mr. Barron including the issue and prosecution of summonses relating to offences alleged to have occurred between 28 October 1996 and 28 September 1998;</P>
    <P>(<i>d</i>) The circumstances surrounding the arrest and detention of Mark McConnell on 1 October 1998 and Michael Peoples on 6 May 1999;</P>
    <P>(<i>e</i>) Complaints that some gardaí in County Donegal may have been involved in hoax explosives and bomb-making equipment finds (in particular discoveries on 11 September 1993, 19 November 1993, 11 January 1994, 14 March 1994, 4 June 1994, 13 June 1994 and 18 July 1994) and a review of the management and investigation of these issues;</P>
    <P>(<i>f</i>) The circumstances surrounding the arrest and detention of Frank McBrearty Junior on 4 February 1997 and his subsequent prosecution in the Circuit Criminal Court in relation to an alleged assault in December 1996 on Edward Moss with particular reference to the Garda investigation and the management of both the investigation and the role of the gardaí in the subsequent prosecution;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1535" />(<i>g</i>) Allegations relating to the Garda investigation of an arson attack on property situated on the site of the telecommunications mast at Ardara, County Donegal, in October-November 1996;</P>
    <P>(<i>h</i>) Allegations contained in documents received by Deputy Jim Higgins on 25 June 2000 and in information received by Deputy Brendan Howlin on 25 June 2000 that two senior members of An Garda Síochána may have acted with impropriety;</P>
    <P>(<i>i</i>) The circumstances surrounding the arrest and detention of seven persons at Burnfoot, County Donegal, on 23 May 1998 and the investigation relating thereto;</P>
    <P>(<i>j</i>) The effectiveness of the Garda Síochána complaints inquiry process <i>vis-à-vis</i> the complaints made by Frank McBrearty Senior and his family between 1997 and 2001;</P>
    <P>and to report to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and to make such findings and recommendations as it sees fit in relation to these matters;</P>
    <P>and further resolves that&ndash;</P>
    <P>(I) the tribunal shall report to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on an interim basis not later than four months from the date of establishment of the tribunal and also as soon as may be after the tenth day of any oral hearings of the tribunal on the following matters:</P>
    <P>(<i>a</i>) the number of parties then represented before the tribunal,</P>
    <P>(<i>b</i>) the progress which will then have been made in the hearings and work of the tribunal,</P>
    <P>(<i>c</i>) the likely duration (so far that may then be capable of being estimated) of the proceedings of the tribunal,</P>
    <P>(<i>d</i>) any other matters that the tribunal considers should be drawn to the attention of the Houses of the Oireachtas at the time of the report (including any matters relating to its terms of reference),</P>
    <P>(II) the inquiry shall be completed in as economical a manner as possible and at the earliest possible date consistent with a fair examination of the matters referred to it;</P>

    <P>(IV) the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform shall within 14 days of receipt of any report from the tribunal either apply to the High Court for directions regarding <Col N="1536" /> publication of the report or arrange to have it laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter was discussed earlier today in the other House. The purpose of this motion is to enable the establishment of a tribunal of inquiry to examine the matters set in the proposed terms of reference. I thank Members of the House for agreeing to deal with this matter before the Easter recess.</P>
      <P>The Garda Síochána has served this country exceptionally well from the foundation of the State and the majority of members, including those based in Donegal, have done so in a professional way and with the greatest of integrity. This State owes a great deal to the Garda Síochána, which has stood as a bulwark of democracy, often in the most difficult of circumstances. Members of the Garda Síochána have been called upon to make the ultimate sacrifice in the service of the public. Despite the gravity of the matters we are discussing today we should not lose sight of that fact.</P>
      <P>In our discussions today, I am constrained in what I can say regarding aspects of the terms of reference because, as the House is aware a number of court proceedings remain to be dealt with and I do not wish to say anything which might affect those proceedings.</P>
      <P>In the early hours of 14 October 1996, the body of Mr. Richard Barron was found on a roadside in Raphoe, County Donegal. Once again I express my deepest sympathy to the family of the late Mr. Barron and my particular regret that this case has not yet been brought to finality, despite the passage of time and intensive Garda investigations. The Garda investigation is ongoing. The finding of the remains of the late Mr. Barron set in train a chain of events which have led to today's draft resolution being laid before the House.</P>
      <P>I do not intend nor would it be appropriate for me to outline the details of the Garda investigations, criminal proceedings, civil proceedings, disciplinary proceedings or complaints made to the Garda Complaints Board. It is enough that I say that all the papers held by various bodies were examined, at my request, by Mr. Shane Murphy, SC, who was nominated to me for appointment by the Chairman of the Bar Council. Following his examination, he reported that &ldquo;a Tribunal of Inquiry represents the only comprehensive method of inquiry to resolve outstanding issues of fundamental public importance&rdquo;. The Government is grateful to Mr. Murphy for his work which will be of assistance to the tribunal in its work. I also again thank Judge Frederick Morris who has agreed to chair this tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not been against the principle of a public inquiry but establishing a tribunal of inquiry is not something to be undertaken lightly. On 7 February 2001, in response to a parliamentary question, I made it clear that I had an open mind <Col N="1537" /> as regards setting up a tribunal. I stressed that I wanted to see the truth of this matter determined. I said that I wanted to see public confidence in the Garda restored. However, the question I posed then went to the heart of the problem, how do we do this in an open and transparent way without interfering with potential civil and criminal proceedings? </P>
    <P>I also said on that date that the current arrangements for dealing with complaints are not satisfactory and need to be revised. I said I was looking at the possible establishment of new processes which would not only deal with complaints against individual members but would address wider issues of the type raised by the occurrences in Donegal. I made it clear that I had not ruled out the option of a public inquiry but I was not convinced at that time that it would necessarily be the best way of dealing with the matter.</P>
    <P>On 23 May 2001, I again referred to the problem of possible prejudice to criminal proceedings and advised Deputies that I was seeking the advice of the Attorney General. His advice confirmed that holding such an inquiry at that time could prejudice the civil and criminal proceedings which had been instituted as a result of the alleged misconduct and that, on the basis of the information then to hand, the best course was to let the criminal and civil proceedings run their course. If matters were not fully ventilated during those proceedings, a tribunal of inquiry could be set up. However, neither the criminal nor civil proceedings advanced very quickly and there was real concern, which I shared, over the length of time it was taking to bring the various inquiries and proceedings to finality.</P>
    <P>When we debated this matter last November, I made the point that this is a complex matter. I stated that the law, which provides for due process, cannot be shaped or moulded to fit the mood of the time. Rights must be respected. Due process must be protected. These are the fundamental principles which are the foundation of our legal system.</P>
    <P>The Tribunal of Inquiry Acts, as amended by the Bill I introduced, provide the necessary mechanism to address these concerns. It is now a matter for both Houses of the Oireachtas to decide on the tribunal's remit, safe in the knowledge that the tribunal will be able to do the job it is called upon to do. I am absolutely convinced that to have tried to set up a tribunal without fully teasing out the very complex issues posed by the interplay of criminal trials, civil proceedings and the capacity of a tribunal to effectively operate would have resulted in a legal quagmire.</P>
    <P>I have explained why I do not want to go into too much detail on the actual terms of reference. I urge other speakers to be careful when making their contributions on the issue. There are, however, one or two points I wish to make. The terms of reference are specific but they are carefully drafted to ensure that the tribunal of inquiry is not restricted in the scope of its inquiries. Fur<Col N="1538" /> thermore, while the primary purpose of establishing the tribunal is to get at the truth, we must also look to the future. We must establish not only whether something went wrong, but why it went wrong and what can be done in the future to prevent it happening again. For that reason, I emphasise the power of the tribunal to make recommendations as it sees fit. The recommendations of the tribunal may be of particular value in maintaining public confidence in the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>The tribunal is asked to report to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who is the appropriate Minister to determine, in the first instance, whether the report contains material that might pose a threat of prejudice to criminal proceedings. This means it is prudent to refer the report to the courts for a direction regarding publication.</P>
    <P>The allegations that give rise to this resolution are matters of great public concern. We need to establish once and for all what happened in Donegal and to determine the truth of the allegations that have been made. The tribunal, as provided for in this resolution, will discharge effectively this obligation without prejudicing various criminal proceedings which have already been instituted in relation to the alleged misconduct. I commend the motion to the House.</P>

      <P>To insert the following paragraph after paragraph (j):</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(k) Allegations of Garda misconduct relating to the criminal prosecution of Frank Shortt with particular reference to the Garda investigation and the management of both the investigation and the role of the Gardaí in the subsequent prosecution and any investigation conducted by the Garda authorities into these matters.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At long last this matter is before the House, though it should have been before us three or four years ago at least. In the dying days of this Government, the Minister has come before the House with the terms of reference for the establishment of a tribunal of inquiry, but it is appalling that it has taken so long for him to present the matter. This issue was raised in the Dáil on many occasions and questions were asked repeatedly by many Members. The Minister and the parties in Government, Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, voted down all requests to establish this tribunal. Indeed, a Private Members' motion was hotly debated some time ago, only to be defeated by the narrow margin of one vote. It is only upon facing a general election that the Minister and the Government have realised the huge public demand for an inquiry <Col N="1539" /> and decided to establish a tribunal. However, its terms of reference fall short of what is needed and I ask the Minister to include in them the amendments being tabled here this evening.</P>
    <P>Let us not have a repeat of the circumstances we have had in relation to other tribunals where the chairmen have had to ask the Legislature to expand terms of reference to allow them to conduct effectively their inquiries. It is in the interests of transparency and accountability to accept these amendments. Justice must be seen to be done. We live in a democracy, where all the citizens of the nation should be treated equally. That means the rule of law should apply equally to all citizens, regardless of their position and regardless of their standing. We have not seen that in the cases of the McBrearty family and of Richie Barron, with whose family we sympathise. The family's loss came in extraordinary and questionable circumstances. The McBrearty family has suffered seriously over the last number of years and has sought justice in the courts, pursuing its case against all the odds before, finally and in the dying days of this Government, the tribunal's terms of reference were presented to the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil this matter was discussed extensively and pursued strongly by Deputy Jim Higgins and Deputy Shatter on behalf of Fine Gael and by Deputy Howlin on behalf of the Labour Party. The Opposition pursued this matter vehemently, but unfortunately the Government chose not to respond. Making the proposed amendments is essential if the inquiry is to proceed fairly and is essential to ensure that justice is seen to be done. There is a question mark over the activities of a number of gardaí and it is important for the credibility of the force that the question mark be removed. The Garda does a tremendous job in maintaining law and order and has done since the foundation of the State. Many members of the force have lost their lives in upholding the rule of law, while others have put their lives at risk, and they deserve the highest commendation for the way they pursue their duties. The Minister must be criticised for delaying this inquiry and leaving question marks hanging over the heads of many gardaí. As long as he delayed, the entire force was under suspicion and public scrutiny because of the misconduct of perhaps two or three of its members.</P>
    <P>The negative impact on the Garda resulted from the Minister's inaction and he failed the force by refusing to pursue this matter in a speedy and clear manner. When he eventually allowed a Garda investigation, it was with reluctance. When it was evident that the inquiry was not at all satisfactory, leaving many questions unanswered, there was an onus on the Minister and his Department to ensure a more detailed inquiry. He did not do that and the result has been to bring bad publicity to the force, which is something it does not deserve given that it acquits itself extraordinarily well. Some members of the Garda do work <Col N="1540" /> of a social nature across the communities they serve, which is something many people are unaware of. The Minister has a duty to ensure the reputations of all members of the force are upheld and that those members who bring the force into disrepute are suitably reprimanded by the Commissioner.</P>
    <P>The amendment is important because the terms of reference of this tribunal do not include provisions to investigate the case of Frank Shortt. He served three years in prison before being released on an appeal which the State did not contest. It let the case go. If the State had a case to make, it would have defended it strongly. Why did they State not contest the appeal? This inquiry could also examine this man's wrongful imprisonment, but its terms of reference preclude it from doing so. I ask the Minister to ensure that it investigates the matter by accepting my amendment. I do not know of any reason why the Minister would not accept it.</P>
    <P>It is in the interests of transparency in the administration of justice that the Minister accepts these simple proposals. If he does so, less questions will be left unanswered. We need all questions to be answered and the Minister has the opportunity this evening to make that happen. I do not look forward to seeing the chairman of the proposed tribunal returning to seek additional powers to continue the inquiry because the Minister failed to accept these amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment. We should first remember the family of the late Mr. Richie Barron and put on record, some years later, our deepest sympathy to his relatives and friends. I also wish to express my concern for the McBrearty family and what they have been through over the years subsequent to the death of Mr. Barron.</P>
      <P>I am interested to hear from the Minister how we reached this point and to learn from him what the options were for investigating the sad saga that started with the death of Mr. Barron. An independent review was conducted by Mr. Shane Murphy SC of all relevant papers and of the progress of investigations into the allegations surrounding this case. In Mr. Murphy's opinion, a tribunal of inquiry represented the only comprehensive method of inquiry to resolve outstanding issues of fundamental public importance surrounding the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Initially, therefore, there was an independent review to see if there was sufficient concern to establish the tribunal of inquiry, if I correctly understand the sequence. Will the Minister outline the difference between an independent review, a public inquiry, a statutory inquiry and a tribunal of inquiry? What is the legal difference in their structures? It is important to know that. There is a particular difficulty at present in the diocese of Ferns in County Wexford. I will not go into the details of it; enough has been said publicly. However, the full facts need to be put on record and I want to learn from the Minister what <Col N="1541" /> would be the correct procedure, from the menu of investigations I have mentioned, to facilitate the emergence of the full facts in that case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to learn what facts were pertinent in arriving at a tribunal of inquiry in this case whereas other cases, such as the Kilkenny review, did not go this far. They were all matters of major public concern at different stages. As a public representative I am asking the Minister for the benefit of his wisdom as to why a tribunal of inquiry is warranted in this case &ndash; I am not arguing that it is not warranted &ndash; following the initial independent review. What is the difference between this tribunal of inquiry, a public inquiry, a statutory inquiry or a Dáil investigation? What factors are taken into account before a decision is made as to which option should be selected to get the full facts and to do justice to the victims in all cases? All involved are entitled to natural justice in the treatment of serious allegations.</P>
      <P>I listened closely to the Minister's speech and I congratulate him on his speed reading powers. I had a copy of his speech so I was happy for him to travel swiftly through it. Interestingly, however, he omitted a paragraph and I wish to put it on the record. I have read it several times and I cannot understand why it was omitted. Did the Minister have a reason for omitting it? The paragraph reads:</P>
      <P>When dealing with parliamentary questions or motions in the Dáil on alleged misconduct by gardaí in Donegal, I have consistently stated that it is a matter of great concern that individual members of the Garda Síochána might be implicated in wrongdoing. It is essential for the reputation of the force that any alleged wrongdoing by members are investigated thoroughly and, if well founded, appropriate disciplinary or criminal proceedings should be initiated. I have also consistently pointed out that individuals have a constitutional right to the protection of their good name and a fair trial. An integral part of our justice system is the presumption of innocence and the right to due process and I would not be party to any attempt to breach those rights by arbitrarily condemning individuals or trying to prejudge the outcome of proceedings.</P>
      <P>Why did the Minister choose not to put that paragraph on the record? What is meant by &ldquo;I would not be party to any attempt to breach those rights by arbitrarily condemning individuals or trying to prejudge the outcome of proceedings&ldquo;? Is there a suggestion that the tribunal of inquiry could prejudice the outcome of future criminal proceedings? What is the problem with the paragraph?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much has been said about this matter. It is a pity it had to be politicised. I would have pre<Col N="1542" /> ferred an all-party approach and all-party agreement on how it should be handled. There have been years of agonising and much suffering. There are allegations in relation to certain individual gardaí and others. Everybody is entitled to natural justice and due process. Justice delayed can be justice denied and this issue has been ongoing for many years. I hope that the Minister's prevarication and the delay in establishing this tribunal of inquiry have not denied justice to the parties involved.</P>

      <P>The terms of reference suggested by Mr. Shane Murphy SC, who reviewed all relevant documentation, did not include any proposals on the lines now put forward by the Opposition. In any event, the proposed resolution suggested by me and, in particular, the instruction to make such findings and recommendations as it sees fit in relation to these matters gives the tribunal the scope to address any issue which contributed to or failed to address Garda misconduct found to have taken place in respect of Donegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1543" />The terms of reference are specific but they are carefully drafted to ensure the tribunal of inquiry is not restricted in the scope of its inquiries. Furthermore, while the primary purpose of establishing the tribunal was to get at the truth, we must also look to the future. We must not only establish if something went wrong but also why it went wrong and what can be done in the future to prevent it from happening again. For that reason, I particularly emphasise the power of the tribunal to make recommendations as it sees fit. The tribunal is asked to report to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It is appropriate that the Minister should be the person to determine in the first instance whether the report contains material that might pose a threat of prejudice to criminal proceedings, making it prudent to refer the report to the courts for direction regarding publication.</P>
    <P>The allegations that have given rise to this resolution are matters of grave public concern. We need to establish what happened in Donegal and determine the truth of the allegations. The tribunal, as provided for in this resolution, will be able to effectively discharge this obligation without prejudicing various criminal proceedings which have already been instituted in relation to the alleged misconduct.</P>
    <P>On Senator Avril Doyle's questions, the review by Mr. Shane Murphy SC was an independent examination of all the papers relating to Donegal. Mr. Murphy SC was given access to all the papers which were available and it proved a most valuable exercise. The review's conclusion is that there should be an inquiry under the Tribunal of Inquiries Acts which will have all the powers to examine witnesses, determine facts and discover the truth of what happened in Donegal. The public inquiry will of course have full statutory powers which were not available to Mr. Murphy SC.</P>
    <P>On the question of the quotation from part of my script, I was simply trying to emphasise that we should not prejudge the issues, and we certainly should not.</P>
    <P>On the question as to why it would be felt that a public inquiry is necessary in this case but not in another, public inquiries, under the legislation dating back as far as the 1921 Act, as amended, which we had to amend recently, provide that the issue to be inquired into should be one of urgent public importance. This issue is one of urgent public importance. It was not possible for Mr. Murphy SC, who I appointed to look at the papers before Christmas, to examine witnesses and to seek discovery of documents, in other words, he did not have any judicial powers. Obviously the tribunal will have such powers.</P>
    <P>The question of having a public inquiry, an independent review, a private inquiry or a statutory inquiry is obviously one which can be confusing. It had a great relevance to everything that happened in this matter. First, I want to put on the record again that at no stage did I say that I was opposed to a public inquiry into the events <Col N="1544" /> in Donegal. Quite the contrary, I made it clear at all stages that I was open to the idea of a public inquiry. That is on the record of the other House. Nobody has been able to bring forward a quotation to say that the position was otherwise. I am not saying that an attempt was made to convey the impression that the situation was otherwise. I am not saying that for one moment&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;but the reality is of course that I always said I was open to a public inquiry.</P>
      <P>I had advice of a very serious nature from the Attorney General to the effect that I could not hold a public inquiry because I would prejudice criminal proceedings and-or civil proceedings. In particular, the Attorney General was concerned that if there were a public inquiry in relation to these issues, certain facts might come out which would grossly interfere with the possibility of a person getting a fair trial afterwards. In that event, and if a court were to hold in that direction, I am not so sure that the case could be proceeded with. Therefore, one of my principal problems all along was how to have an inquiry which would not prejudice subsequent criminal proceedings.</P>
      <P>After a great deal of thought and having consulted widely, I eventually came to the conclusion that there was a way forward but that the way forward was difficult and fraught with possibility of failure. The way forward which was finally determined in any event was that we could hold an inquiry provided that those parts of the inquiry which might subsequently prejudice a criminal trial be held in private. If the chairman of the tribunal determines that there is certain evidence which could subsequently interfere with a person's right to fair trial, he will be allowed to hold that part of the inquiry in private. Subsequent publication would be a matter to be determined and that is why, in the terms of references, it is stated that there will be power for the Minister to go to the High Court on the question of publication in order that judicial personages will decide when certain parts of the report should be published, if, indeed, there is a need to hold back any part of the report to ensure that a person's right to a fair trial is not interfered with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept it is very cumbersome and very difficult and it is a most unusual situation, but there were several Garda investigations, there were complaints to the Garda Complaints Board about this matter, there were several civil proceedings in this matter and the Director of Public Prosecutions was considering papers in this matter. I <Col N="1545" /> suppose it was reasonable for me, as Minister, to have hoped that one or other of these independent adjudicating bodies would come up with a resolution to the problem which presented itself. As it turned out, the matter kept going on and on and ultimately I decided that the best approach was to ask a senior counsel to look at all the papers. I asked Mr. Shane Murphy SC to do that and to come back to me with his recommendations. Ultimately he did that but of course he emphasised the necessity to preserve the integrity of proceedings.</P>
    <P>The solution, which has been put forward by <Col N="1546" /> the Houses of the Oireachtas through proposals which I made to the Government, which were accepted there, is cumbersome but I honestly believe that it will succeed in getting at the truth of what happened in Donegal. In the final analysis that is something, outside of all political considerations, which I feel everybody is anxious to see. I am confident that this procedure will succeed. I thank the Senators for their co-operation in hearing this motion at this late hour on Holy Thursday.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise the condition of a school in County Roscommon called O'Conor Don national school at Cloobonniffe near Castlerea. This school was built in 1875 and most of the original features of the school are still in place. It was built by Charles Owen O'Conor Don, who was an MP for Roscommon for 40 years in the latter half of the 19th century. He was a very famous benefactor and promoter of education at a time when there was no national school system. He provided a number of schools in the area, but the Cloobonniffe school is one of only two surviving so that indicates its historical significance.</P>
      <P>About four years ago the board of management of the school applied to the Minister's Department for funding to provide a general purposes room and new toilets and to renovate existing classrooms, which are well below the minimum size now demanded by the Minister's Department. The toilets are all outdoors. The windows and doors in the school are the original fittings. The windows can no longer open, causing a serious ventilation problem. The floors are, by and large, the original wooden floors, and are rotten and vermin ridden. The electrical wiring has been examined by a competent electrical engineer and found to be unsafe and outdated. The play area of the school is a mess of broken tarmacadam and loose maintenance. The school has many hazardous features. It is a school that should be included in the 2002 schools building programme.</P>
      <P>As far back as 1998 that the board of management first contacted the Department. The Department soon agreed that the programme of refurbishment I have outlined urgently needed to be done, but so far nothing has happened. I hope the Minister's statement will offer me the good news that this school will be included in this year's schools building programme.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Senator has given me the opportunity of outlining to the House the Department of Education and Science's current position regarding the provision of improved accommodation at O'Conor Don national school. The school has a staffing level of principal, one mainstream classroom teacher and <Col N="1547" /><Col N="1548" /> a shared, non-based, learning support teacher. The enrolment at 30 September 2001 was 24 pupils. The school's accommodation consists of two permanent classrooms in the main school building.</P>
      <P>Following an assessment of the long-term accommodation needs of the school, the Department approved the commencement of architectural planning for general purpose classroom and appropriate ancillary accommodation plus refurbishment of the original school building. This project is progressing to the advanced stages of architectural planning. When the stage 4-5 tender documentation has been received and examined by the Department of Education and Science, tenders will be invited for this project as soon as possible under the expanded building programme. The Department is fully committed to the provision of improved accommodation at O'Conor Don national school.</P>

      <P>There is an urgent need for the Minister of the Environment and Local Government to provide an additional block grant to Clare County Council for the rural water programme. This is essential so that the group water schemes that have prepared detailed designs and drawings under the council's guidance can proceed to construction to overcome problems of poor water quality, poor water air supply, low pressure and defective piping. The importance of this is beyond question. I refer particularly to those group water schemes that are ready to go to construction.</P>
      <P>A number of households throughout Clare have been badly affected by lack of water supply, particularly in isolated rural areas. Many of them are involved in farming and as a result dairy herds are affected and quality of production is undermined.</P>
      <P>Many women are finding it difficult to undertake ordinary household duties because of lack of water supply. The Government has strongly promoted the concept of rural tourism, but this cannot proceed if the basic essentials, such as a supply of water, are not available. Tourism is affected because of the inadequacy of the water supply. More importantly, planning permissions are being refused repeatedly by Clare County Council because of the inadequate water supply in areas of the county. It is incredible in this day and age, with such a buoyant economy, that these basic essentials are preventing development in rural Ireland, particularly by young couples trying to build homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation is disastrous and seriously needs to be addressed by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. This year, Clare County Council received an allocation of &euro;2.75 million, a drop of 25% on last year, given inflation, which is completely unacceptable. It is particularly unacceptable given that a large num<Col N="1549" /> ber of group water schemes are ready to go to tender and are just awaiting funding. This is the case with Quilty, Clohanes, Leadmore, Corbally, Doonaha East, Cree Clonwhite, Kilcredawn, Rathfolan, Ballaghboy, Legard South, Cahersherkin, Breffa South, Ballinagaddy and Fanore. The total cost of these would be &euro;7,369,500, so there is a shortfall of &euro;4,619,500 in the block allocation from the Minister of the Environment and Local Government to Clare County Council, which is a huge deficit in relative terms. There is an urgent need for the Minister to revisit this allocation and to see the totally inadequacy of it.</P>
    <P>I note the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, is yet again taking the Adjournment debate. I appeal to the Minister to use her not inconsiderable persuasive powers with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, to ensure that this matter is looked at within the Department. Additional funding must be provided to allow basic development to proceed in County Clare. Such funding would facilitate the ordinary daily business of householders, farmers and people in the tourism industry.</P>
    <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for affording me the opportunity of raising this matter on the Adjournment.</P>

      <P>I am pleased that, since the Government took office, the upgrading and renewal of rural water supply infrastructure, particularly group water schemes, have been afforded high priority. The necessary direction, finance and technical support is being provided by the Department of the Environment and Local Government to the group sector. This will allow them to participate as equals in the business of supplying quality water to consumers.</P>
      <P>Last February, a record allocation of &euro;80 million for the rural water programme in 2002 was announced. This completed a sequence of five successive record annual allocations, representing an eightfold increase in annual investment levels since the beginning of the Government's term in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are significant challenges involved in bringing group water schemes into compliance with the standard set in the drinking water regulations. Under the National Development Plan 2000-2006, a total of &euro;600 million is being provided for rural water supplies. The vast majority of this will be for the upgrading and accelerated <Col N="1550" /> installation of treatment and disinfection equipment in privately-sourced group water schemes.</P>
    <P>In County Clare, 72 group water schemes will be required to meet the standards set out in the drinking water regulations by 2003. Some 59 of these schemes are connected to the public mains, where water quality is generally not a problem. The most pressing problems are associated with 13 large, privately-sourced schemes, most of which are without adequate water treatment facilities. The modernisation of these schemes to meet EU standards and customer expectations has to be the main priority.</P>
    <P>Clare County Council and the national federation of group water schemes are, with the support of the Department, actively promoting the provision of high-tech water treatment facilities for these schemes by way of design-build-operate contracts with recognised service providers. This entails the grouping or bundling of schemes under a single contract that covers the provision of state-of-the-art water treatment equipment and its subsequent operation and maintenance. To advance these DBO projects, a sum of &euro;500,000 is included in this year's allocation to the council.</P>
    <P>In keeping with the recommendations of the national rural water monitoring committee, the bulk of the record 2002 Exchequer provision for rural water is being ring-fenced for the quality-deficient group water sector. A sum of &euro;40 million has been allocated to meet group water capital grant expenditure, with priority being given to upgrading substandard privately-sourced schemes. A sum of &euro;6 million has been allocated for the taking charge of group water schemes by county councils.</P>
    <P>Last year in County Clare, only 59% of the &euro;2.54 million allocated for group water scheme capital grants was drawn down. By contrast, the expenditure by the council in taking charge of group water schemes far exceeded its allocation of &euro;571,000. In 2002, the council requested a block allocation of &euro;1.897 million for group water scheme grants, including &euro;850,000 for DBO projects. Under this heading, the Department has approved the granting of &euro;1.5 million, &euro;500,000 of which is for DBO projects. The current state of planning with DBO projects is unlikely to permit the full plan drawn down by the council. Essentially, the council's requirements are being met fully.</P>
    <P>In relation to the group water scheme take-over measure, the council sought an allocation of &euro;5 million for this year. The main priority of the rural water programme is to eliminate drinking water quality problems in privately-sourced group schemes. The taking over by the council of group schemes which are connected to public mains, where water quality is not an issue, is a lower priority. On that basis, the national rural water monitoring committee has recommended a cap of &euro;6 million nationally for the take-over measure this year. Against that background, it <Col N="1551" /> was simply not possible to accede to Clare County Council's request. An allocation of &euro;700,000 has been made to the council for the take-over measure this year, the third highest allocation in the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister is satisfied that the overall shape of Clare County Council's rural water allocation for this year properly reflects that focus that must be applied to solving the problem of substandard <Col N="1552" /> group water supplies as quickly and efficiently as possible. The Minister is also confident that the council, working in partnership with the group scheme sector will, with the support of the Department, make significant progress towards eliminating this problem between now and the end of this year.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 7.05 p.m. until 10 a.m. on Thursday, 4 April 2002.</P>
