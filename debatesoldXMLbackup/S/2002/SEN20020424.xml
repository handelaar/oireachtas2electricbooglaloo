      <P>I have received notice from Senator Henry that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to outline the proposals he has to address the current unsatisfactory situation whereby no reports have been made by the barrister appointed by the Courts Service to report on the family law courts.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Costello of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Finance to extend the disabled drivers and disabled passengers (tax concessions) scheme to members of the Blind Car Owners and Users Association.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>The proposed Order of Business is No. 1, Data Protection (Amendment) Bill, 2002 &ndash; Order for Second Stage and Second and Subsequent Stages, with the contributions of spokespersons on Second Stage not to exceed ten minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed seven minutes; No. 2, Official Languages (Equality) Bill, 2002 &ndash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage, with the contributions of spokespersons on Second Stage not to exceed 20 minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes and on which Senators may share time.</P>

      <P>In so far as it matters, the Order of Business is agreed to. I do not see much point in taking Second Stage of two Bills which will remain becalmed until the new House returns. There is no way the House will pass this legislation as we will also have an election in the sum<Col N="1746" /> mer months. However, if they are ordered by the Leader of the House, we will take them.</P>

      <P>Order, please, Senator O'Toole to continue without interruption.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs about the position of the Government, the UN Security Council and the European Union in relation to the happenings in Venezuela. A democratically elected Parliament has been overthrown in a huge and strategically important country in South America. However, there does not seem to be any response from Western Governments. That country is now being run by the head of the business community and we do not know who put him in place. He is now in charge and he has set Parliament and the laws of the land aside. Nobody is worried about doing business with him. It is time the rest of the developed world took a stand against that and immediately made its position known. It is crucial to do that in terms of foreign affairs and international relations. We would not put up with such action from any other country.</P>
      <P>I do not know the thinking behind it, but it is unacceptable. We have opposed developments in certain parts of Latin America in the past. This is a coup. An elected Government has been overthrown, but no one has said a word about it. It stinks to high heaven. The House should at least make its views known on it. I will not ask for a debate on it because time will not be available. However, it is important for the Government to take a stand on this disgraceful action. It looks bad from the point of view of international relations. I ask the House to take a strong and firm view on it, to condemn it and to break off all relations with Venezuela.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator O'Toole. There has not been a peep out of the media about the change of Government there, which seems to have been backed by the United States. As a member of the UN Security Council, it is appro<Col N="1747" /> priate for our Minister for Foreign Affairs to make a statement. It is almost as though it did not happen. It is amazing how certain events can take place without the media barely acknowledging them. Venezuela is a rich, oil producing country. Perhaps that is why the Western media have been so quiet on the matter. The Irish media should not take it sitting down. They should let the public know what is happening.</P>
      <P>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business to allow a debate on the economy, which would be a pre-election debate. The issues on which the election will be fought are how the economy will be funded and where the resources will be targeted. The Progressive Democrats published their views on where funding will be found for the national development plan. We have done likewise. However, the major party in Government, Fianna Fáil, has not given any indication of how it will fund the national development plan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring briefly to some of the important underlying reasons the debate should take place. I ask the Leader to allocate time tomorrow, which probably will be the last day of the other House, for such a debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I second Senator Costello's proposal about the economy. The economy is fast approaching a crisis at a time when political parties are making extraordinary promises, which are based on 8% growth when public finances are growing by 22%. It is obvious we will be treated to a large number of manifestos in the coming weeks &ndash; we have had some already &ndash; which are based on complete and utter fantasy. The premise upon which these manifestos is based completely ignores the cost of so-called benchmarking. It is incredible that benchmarking, which will be responsible for the biggest explosion in public spending&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I was interrupted by an ATM machine and will now continue. To make a serious point without interruption by the sometimes spokesperson of some Independent Members, it is important that we do not allow the House to adjourn while promising a false dawn &ndash; it is not just being promised by one political party but by all &ndash; because the public finances are in crisis, and will be in serious crisis by the end of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is terrible that politics should enter the House, and atrocious that Members should be interrupted for bringing politics into the House coming up to a general election.</P>
      <P>I again want to raise events in the Middle East. For the first time in many years there has been a 15-0 vote at the UN Security Council. I cannot remember there being such vote ever before. The vote was in favour of sending a group to Jenin, just to take a look and report back. No constraints were to be put on the group; it was simply to go in and report back. Now, even this has been blocked by Israel.</P>
      <P>Israel is one of only two countries created by a vote of the United Nations, which was not unanimous. The Security Council has, for once, agreed to do something. Its 15 members have agreed, but of course Israel has now discovered that it would not be in its best interests if military personnel, whom it would nominate, were part of the team going in. This is atrocious and comes after a very senior military person &ndash; a former United States general &ndash; has been added to the team. This is unprecedented. I cannot find words to describe the horror around the world at the baseness of the decision by the Israelis not to allow access. The UN Security Council, which represents every nation in the world except, apparently, Israel, should be allowed access.</P>
      <P>The humanitarian situation in Jenin is worse than in places where there have been earthquakes and natural disasters. The United Nations and NATO were quick to go into eastern Europe in recent years. There is no excuse for not making the same humanitarian effort in Jenin and other places in the West Bank.</P>
      <P>I would also like to raise the issue of the preliminary election for the presidency in France. We must be careful how we deal with the result and remember that democracy is at issue. Who are we to say France should not abide by the decision of its electorate just because democracy does not give what is considered the right result? The French people have a chance to change their decision. Perhaps the huge number who voted for Mr. Le Pen will do so. Who are we to interfere? The same was said about Mr. Haider in Austria&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I resigned myself months ago to the fact that we were not to have any legislation concerning mentally ill persons before the courts or in prison, even though it was promised last autumn. Will the Leader of the House ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come to the House to tell us what he proposes to do about the situation of the Central Mental Hospital which is refusing to take any more mentally ill prisoners? No other patients are being admitted when patients are discharged because the hospital is so short-staffed. It is quite unsuitable to have dangerous, violent and ill persons within the prisons and unfair on staff, prisoners and the ill prisoners concerned. What does the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform propose to do about this?</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader to ask the Minister for Health and Children to explain what has happened to the BreastCheck programme. I thought it was running satisfactorily in the three health board areas where it had been introduced, but yesterday I discovered that not alone is the rest of the country not included in the screening but that in the three health board areas where it was set up people who are supposed to be screened are not being screened. Tallaght is the same size as Limerick city and people have not been screened there. I have received telephone calls today from people in Enniskerry, Kilmainham and Drogheda to say that nothing has happened, even though all these places should now be getting the second round of screening.</P>
      <P>The doctor in charge of the screening programme resigned last year and did not give the reason for her resignation. I wonder if it was due to lack of resources. Is this programme just a smokescreen to indicate that something is being done for women while only a very small and select group are being screened? A woman told me she wrote to the Minister informing him that she was reaching the age of 65 years and had not been called for screening. The Minister's office wrote in reply that the programme was by invitation only and there was no guarantee she would be called.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that between now and the end of this Seanad the Leader will be faced with significant constraints on the time available. If the opportunity arises I ask the Leader to consider a debate on the Dublin and Monaghan bombings on account of the reports last weekend which illustrated that the neighbouring island intended to seek immunity with regard to aspects of that appalling incident. Those reports were the result of very good investigative journalism and the journalists are to be commended. I ask the Leader to consider this for discussion. It is a mat<Col N="1750" /> ter which has all the ingredients to become what Lord Denning once described as &ldquo;an appalling vista&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask for endorsement by the House of the unanimous decision of the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business. Senators Farrell, Gibbons, Henry and I are members of that committee, which will be gone soon. I am sure the new committee will agree with the decision to investigate the insurance industry using the excellent report by the Motor Insurance Advisory Board as a book of evidence, in the same manner that the Committee of Public Accounts based its DIRT investigation on a report by the Comptroller and Auditor General. Consumers have been conned and there are huge vested interests to be confronted.</P>

It has been a great honour and a privilege to represent the electorate which puts us all here as local authority members. I look forward to very many more years in the House, or in the other House if the electorate of Westmeath so wish.</P>
      <P>In reply to Senators Manning, O'Toole and Costello, the appointment of a Member to fill the vacancy caused by the retirement of Senator Fitzgerald will be notified to me by the Taoiseach in due course. When he informs me I will inform the House immediately.</P>

      <P>Senators Manning, O'Toole and Costello all expressed various strong views regarding matters in Venezuela. I will pass on these to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Costello and Senator Ross proposed an amendment to the Order of Business. As I indicated earlier, it was my intention that this debate should take place. In the past five years, we have allowed as much time as was required to let the House review progress that had taken <Col N="1751" /> place. All fair-minded people would agree there has been unprecedented progress over the past five years. There has been a growth rate of 10% and 380,000 new jobs have been created. I know the people of Dublin Central will bear this in mind when they go to the polls. Having the first posters up does not guarantee a seat in any constituency. However, the good Senator beat them all to the punch. He is in a happy mood these times and we do not want to spoil it for him.</P>
    <P>In relation to the points raised by Senator Ross and Senator Costello, whenever there was a crisis in the history of the country, was it not Fianna Fáil that always came to the rescue and solved it?</P>

I will pass on Senator Henry's view to the Minister regarding the two very important points she raised on the Order of Business. I will pass on the views of Senator Walsh to the Minister for Foreign Affairs regarding the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.</P>

      <P>All of us have very harrowing experiences of the insurance industry and I look forward to many Senators coming in tomorrow to share them. This is one of the most pressing issues to be debated in the House because it interferes with the operation of many family businesses and it will lead to job losses unless something is done urgently. Although it seems obvious that the general election will be called tomorrow, with the agreement of the House and the leaders after the Order of Business today, I propose that we sit at 10 o'clock tomorrow to discuss this very serious issue. This will allow Senators to make their contributions during the all day debate on this long awaited report.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business. - Data Protection (Amendment) Bill, 2002: Order for Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Bill entitled an Act to give effect to Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, for that purpose to amend the Data Protection Act, 1988, and to provide for related matters.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary purpose of the Bill is to give effect to the provisions of Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and the Council on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data. It may appear on the surface to be a technical measure, not least because it seeks to amend existing rather technical legislation, the Data Protection Act, 1988. While that may be so, it actually contains important provisions that will enhance the fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals in the State.</P>
      <P>It is no exaggeration to say globalisation and the development of information systems and technologies &ndash; most notably the Internet &ndash; are having a profound impact on the way we work and live today. One dimension of this process of change is reflected in the extent to which personal data are used increasingly for commercial, leisure and learning purposes. Another is the speed and ease with which such information can be processed, passed on to others, or used for purposes for which it was never intended. This mobility of data is beneficial in many ways, but it is also true to say recent developments have once again raised fears about a possible erosion of privacy and other fundamental personal rights. What is required, therefore, is an appropriate set of safeguards that protects the privacy interests of individuals while, at the same time, facilitating the processing of personal data for legitimate and beneficial uses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Directive 95/46 sets data protection standards across the European Union in order to ensure a <Col N="1753" /> consistent level of protection across member states and a set of rules that facilitates the free movement of such data in the internal market. The objective of the Bill is to transpose those standards into our domestic law.</P>
    <P>As indicated in the Title, the Bill amends the Data Protection Act, 1988. In particular, it establishes conditions for processing personal data, including more stringent conditions in relation to sensitive personal data, and strengthens individuals' rights with regard to the processing of their data. It also extends data protection rules to certain manual data relating to living individuals recorded as part of a relevant filing system and contains a set of new rules relating to the transfer of personal data to countries and territories outside the European economic area, EEA, that is, outside the EU member states, Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein.</P>
    <P>A number of amendments to the 1988 Act not directly related to the directive are intended to improve the operation of the Act. The existing Data Protection Act, 1988, transposes Convention 108 of the Council of Europe into Irish law.</P>
    <P>There are three key features of the data protection convention which establish protection for individuals with regard to their personal data, of which the first is the set of data protection principles set out in chapter II which has been transposed into our law by section 2 of the Data Protection Act, 1988. It includes the following provisions: personal data undergoing automatic processing must be obtained and processed fairly and lawfully; they must be stored for specified and legitimate purposes and not used in a way incompatible with these purposes; they must be adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to these purposes; they must be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; and they must be preserved in a form that permits identification of the persons concerned for no longer than is required for the purpose for which the data are stored. Moreover, appropriate security measures must be taken to protect such data from unauthorised access and accidental loss or destruction. There are certain exemptions, subject to adequate safeguards, where, for example, the data are used for statistical, research or other scientific purposes.</P>
    <P>Second, the convention establishes a set of safeguards for individuals with regard to their personal data. The term &ldquo;data subject&rdquo; is coined in the convention to mean an individual, the subject of personal data. A data subject has the right to establish the existence of personal data, a description of the data and the purposes for which they are kept. A data subject also has a right, subject to certain restrictions, of access to such data, as well as a right to rectification or erasure of the data in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>Third, the convention provides, in Article 10, for the establishment of appropriate sanctions and remedies for violations of the law giving effect to the principles and safeguards. While the convention does not strictly require the appoint<Col N="1754" /> ment of a supervisory authority, the 1988 Act made provision for a data protection commissioner with both investigatory and enforcement powers. The commissioner has the power to investigate individual complaints, but also has an important awareness raising and information role. The commissioner's enforcement powers, as set out in the 1988 Act, include the issuing of information notices, enforcement notices and prohibition notices. I am pleased to take the opportunity to express my appreciation of the work of successive data protection commissioners in vindicating the rights of data subjects with regard to the processing of their personal data and developing an awareness of data protection rules and requirements.</P>
    <P>The question may be raised as to the reason it was considered necessary to develop a data protection instrument at European Community level when all member states were already members of the Council of Europe and had ratified the convention. The main reason was a feeling at Community level that the scope of data protection law should be widened and existing safeguards strengthened, particularly in relation to the transfer of personal data to countries without data protection safeguards.</P>
    <P>The directive builds on the provisions of the convention but is a more extensive and detailed instrument. The additional features of the directive include the following: it extends the mandatory application of data protection rules to certain categories of manual data; it establishes a right to object to the processing of personal data in certain cases, including where the data may be processed for the purposes of direct marketing; decisions based solely on automatic processing of data that have a legal effect or impact in a significant way on a data subject are prohibited; detailed provisions are set out relating to the conditions under which personal data may be transferred to countries and territories outside the European economic area; member states are required to establish one or more independent supervisory authorities with investigative and enforcement powers; the supervisory authorities in each state are required to establish a system of &ldquo;prior checking&rdquo; of processing that may present specific risks to individuals' rights and freedoms; the development of codes of practice is to be encouraged and facilitated.</P>
    <P>Towards the end of 1997 my Department launched a consultation paper in connection with the transposition of the directive into our law as part of the process of preparing the new legislation. The aim was to raise awareness of the directive's additional requirements and elicit the views of interested parties on how best to implement these provisions where member states have been given a margin of flexibility and discretion. The outcome of this consultation process was taken into account in framing the Bill before us today.</P>
    <P>I will mention some of the areas of flexibility and discretion when I come to the detailed pro<Col N="1755" /> visions of the Bill. Before moving on to deal with them I want to explain the situation regarding implementation of the directive. Measures to implement it were required to be in place by October 1998, with member states having a further three years to ensure full conformity with its provisions. I very much regret that transposition of the directive has been delayed due to a combination of factors, including the consultation exercise that I outlined, pressure of other work and, not least, the complexities arising in this particular context. I understand Ireland is one of a number of member states which have experienced difficulties in this regard.</P>
    <P>In this context, many of the directive's provisions, some of which I have outlined, have already been given legal effect in the Data Protection Act, 1988. These include key provisions such as those relating to the establishment of a supervisory authority, liability, remedies, sanctions and codes of conduct. Moreover, on 19 December last the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, signed the European Communities (Data Protection) Regulations, 2001, which gave effect to certain additional provisions of the directive included in the Bill before us today, with effect from 1 April 2002. These regulations are intended as an interim measure, pending enactment of the Bill. They deal, in particular, with an area no longer adequately covered by the provisions of the 1988 Act &ndash; transfers of personal data to countries and territories outside the European economic area. The regulations provide that such transfers may only take place where adequate standards of data protection are deemed to exist. I will mention the provisions that have entered into force by means of these regulations when I come to the sections concerned.</P>
    <P>Turning to the detail of the Bill, I draw attention to a number of particular aspects. Section 2 amends section 1 of the 1988 Act in several important respects. First, it adds new definitions, including &ldquo;automated data,&rdquo;&ldquo;manual data&rdquo; and &ldquo;sensitive personal data,&rdquo; while replacing certain existing definitions, including &ldquo;personal data&rdquo; and &ldquo;processing&rdquo;. For data protection purposes, &ldquo;manual data&rdquo; is defined as information recorded as part of a relevant filing system.</P>
    <P>The term &ldquo;relevant filing system&rdquo; is defined as any set of information relating to individuals that is structured either by reference to individuals, or criteria relating to individuals, in such a way that specific information in relation to a particular individual is readily accessible. This means that to enjoy the cover of data protection provisions, data processed manually must comply with the following four criteria: first, the personal data must be part of a set; second, the set must be structured; third, the structure must refer to individuals or to criteria relating to individuals; and, fourth, specific information relating to a particular individual must be readily accessible. If any of these criteria are not fulfilled, the manually pro<Col N="1756" /> cessed data concerned will not be covered. While some might say this is an unnecessarily restrictive approach, it is consistent with the aim of the directive since the manual processing of data does not present the same risks to personal privacy as automated processing. The Department drew attention to this issue in the consultation paper and it elicited no alternative approaches to defining manual data.</P>
    <P>The term &ldquo;personal data&rdquo; is defined as data relating to a living individual who is, or can be, identified either from the data, or from the data in conjunction with other information that is in, or is likely to come into, the possession of the data controller. It is also worth noting that the new definition of &ldquo;processing&rdquo; set out here is not based on technical or technological processes but encompasses a broad range of functions such as the collection, recording, storage, retrieval, etc, of data.</P>
    <P>This section of the Bill is also important in so far as it clarifies the scope of data protection law in line with the provisions of Article 4 of the directive. It provides, as set out in a new subsection (3B) to be inserted in the 1988 Act, that the Act will apply to data controllers established in the State who process data in the context of that establishment and to data controllers who are neither established in the State nor within the European Union, but who make use of equipment located in the State for processing purposes. Section 23 of the 1988 Act is being repealed as a consequence of the new provisions. These two provisions &ndash; the addition of the new subsection (3B) and the repeal of section 23 &ndash; have been given effect in the regulations I mentioned earlier and are already in force since 1 April 2002.</P>
    <P>In the new subsection (3C), an exemption from data protection rules is provided for in cases where data is processed solely for the purpose of historical research. This complements the exemptions already provided for in the existing subsection (4). However, while the existing subsection (4)(<i>b</i>) contains an exemption for personal data consisting of information that the person keeping the data is required by law to make available to the public, a new subsection (5) provides that the exemption will not apply where such data is processed for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was collected.</P>
    <P>The collection, processing, keeping, use and disclosure of personal data is dealt with in section 3. It amends section 2 of the 1988 Act. In particular, it replaces subsection (1) with a restatement of data protection principles as enunciated in Article 6 of the directive. Exemptions from certain principles for personal data used for statistical, research or other scientific purposes are retained but may be made subject to prescribed requirements.</P>
    <P>The text of the existing subsection (7), which deals with direct marketing, is to be replaced with a new text that will allow a person, in accordance with Article 14(<i>b</i>) of the directive, to request a data controller, prior to processing, not to process <Col N="1757" /> personal data for the purpose of direct marketing. A new subsection (8) provides that individuals must be informed of their right to object. These provisions are not intended to discourage the practice of responsible direct marketing, which is an important commercial activity, but rather to raise awareness of the right, and give individuals the opportunity, to opt out of receiving direct marketing material if they so wish.</P>
    <P>Section 4 is a substantial provision and it inserts no less than four new sections &ndash; sections 2A to 2D &ndash; in the 1988 Act. The new section 2A deals with the processing of personal data and takes account of the provisions of Article 7 of the directive. It provides that, subject to satisfying the conditions already set out in section 2, personal data can only be processed where one of the listed conditions is satisfied.</P>
    <P>The new section 2B deals with the processing of a new category of sensitive personal data, which is defined earlier. Processing of this data will in future be subject to more stringent conditions in accordance with Article 8 of the directive. It provides for a prohibition on the processing of such data except where, in addition to satisfying the conditions set out in sections 2 and 2A, one of an additional set of listed conditions is also met.</P>
    <P>The new section 2C deals with the security of processing operations, as set out in Article 17 of the directive. It provides that data controllers must implement appropriate measures to protect personal data and such measures must ensure a level of security appropriate to the risks presented by the processing and the nature of the data to be protected. Section 2D takes account of the provisions of Articles 10 and 11 of the directive and it provides that personal data will not be treated as having been processed fairly unless, when personal data is obtained, the data subject is provided with certain information, including where data is obtained directly from the data subject, the identity of the data controller and the purposes for which the data will be processed and, where the data comes from a source other than the data subject, the name of the original data controller.</P>
    <P>The important right set out in section 3 of the 1988 Act, that is, the right to establish the existence of data, remains unchanged. However, section 5 of the Bill strengthens the right of access provisions set out in section 4 of the 1988 Act. The new text of subsection (1) builds on the current provisions by providing, in line with the terms of Article 12 of the directive, that where an access request is made under the Act, the applicant must be provided with certain additional information, such as the source of the data and the purpose of the processing.</P>
    <P>The new subsection (13) is not related to the directive. It will in future prohibit a person, in connection with the employment of another person, the continued employment of another person or a contract for the provision of services to him or her by another person, from requiring that per<Col N="1758" /> son to make an access request under section 4 of the Act or from supplying him or her with personal data obtained on foot of such an access request. This amendment is intended to prevent a type of abuse, known as &ldquo;enforced subject access&rdquo;, that has arisen in relation to employment under the current right of access provisions.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of the Bill takes account of Article 12(c) of the directive and amends section 6 of the 1988 Act in order to give persons an additional right to have incorrect or inaccurate data &ldquo;blocked&rdquo;, that is, marked in such a way that it is not possible to process it for purposes in relation to which it is marked. This new provision will supplement the existing rights to have data rectified or erased. It also provides that where data have been blocked, there is a requirement to notify any person to whom the data were disclosed in the previous 12 months unless such notification proves impossible or involves disproportionate effort.</P>
    <P>Section 7 of the Bill inserts two new provisions in the 1988 Act to take account of Articles 14 and 15 of the directive. The new section 6A extends a person's right to object to the processing of personal data relating to him or her where the processing of such data is considered necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or where the processing is for the purposes of the legitimate interests of the controller. However, the objection must be on compelling legitimate grounds. The right to object will not apply in certain circumstances such as where the data subject has given consent to the processing; the processing is necessary in the course of entering into, or performance of, a contract; for compliance with a legal obligation; to protect the data subject's vital interests; and the processing is carried out by political parties or candidates for elective office in the course of electoral activities. The new section 6B provides for a general ban on decision making that is based solely on automated processing of data intended to evaluate certain personal aspects where such a decision produces legal effects concerning a person or otherwise significantly affects a person, except in the circumstances outlined in that section and where suitable safeguards to protect the person's legitimate interests are in place.</P>
    <P>This Bill also provides in section 8 for certain additional functions for the Data Protection Commissioner. In future, the commissioner will be the supervisory authority for the purposes of the directive and will be responsible for the dissemination of information in relation to &ldquo;Community findings&rdquo; regarding the adequacy of data protection rules in countries and territories outside the EEA. The commissioner will also be required to perform any functions in relation to data protection that the Minister may confer on him or her and which would enable the Government to give effect to any international obligations of the State. The commissioner will have a monitoring role for the purposes of Council Regulation 2725 of 2000 &ndash; Eurodac.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1759" />Section 9 amends section 10 of the 1988 Act to bring it into line with current practice as it has evolved since the entry into force of the 1988 Act. It recognises the possibility that complaints between parties may be resolved in an amicable way and that in such cases no further action by the Data Protection Commissioner may be necessary. An important new provision in the Bill will allow the Data Protection Commissioner to monitor the application of the directive. This proactive role will complement the existing functions of the commissioner in providing advice and dealing with complaints.</P>
    <P>One of the key sections of the Bill is section 10 which takes account of the provisions of Articles 25 and 26 of the directive. It deals with restrictions on the transfer of personal data to countries and territories outside the EEA and replaces in its entirety section 11 of the 1988 Act. Almost all this section has been given effect in the regulations that came into force on 1 April 2002.</P>
    <P>The new section 11 provides that a transfer of personal data to a country or territory outside the EEA may not take place unless an adequate level of protection is deemed to exist. Subsection (1) lists the factors to be taken into account in any assessment of adequacy. The Data Protection Commissioner is required to inform the European Commission and other member states of any case where he or she considers that a country or territory outside the EEA does not ensure an adequate level of protection. It should, however, be noted that where the European Commission makes a Community finding in accordance with the decision making procedures set out in the directive, in relation to whether an adequate level of protection is ensured in such a country or territory outside the European Economic Area, that decision must be complied with.</P>
    <P>A number of Community findings of this nature have already been made. Commission decisions have been taken in relation to Switzerland and Hungary. This means that both countries are considered as having an adequate level of protection for personal data transferred from member states. More recently, a Commission decision has been made in relation to Canada that covers transfers of personal data to recipients who are subject to the Canadian Personal Information and Electronic Documents Act.</P>
    <P>Following protracted negotiations between the European Commission and the US authorities, a Commission decision has been taken on the adequacy of protection provided by a set of so-called &ldquo;safe harbour privacy principles&rdquo;. Personal data may, therefore, be transferred to organisations that have unambiguously and publicly disclosed their commitment to comply with these principles and are subject to the statutory powers of a government body that is empowered to investigate complaints and to obtain relief against unfair or deceptive practices as well as redress for individuals.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1760" />There are circumstances in which transfers of personal data to countries and territories outside the European Economic Area may take place without Community findings in relation to the adequacy of the data protection arrangements. These are set out in the new subsection (4).</P>
    <P>In addition, the commissioner is required to inform the European Commission and other EEA states of any such authorisations and must comply with any decision of the European Commission in relation to such authorisations. The commissioner must also comply with any Commission decisions that certain contractual clauses offer sufficient safeguards for the transfer of personal data. Two such decisions have been taken to date: one dated 15 June 2001 contains a set of standard contractual clauses and one dated 27 December 2001 contains a set of standard contractual clauses adapted to cover the transfer of personal data to data processors located outside the EEA.</P>
    <P>Before moving on from this section, I want to draw attention to an important provision in subsection (6). It provides that where personal data are transferred with the protection of contractual clauses, the person to whom the data relate shall have the right to enforce the terms of that contract as if he or she were a party to it.</P>
    <P>Subsections (7) to (15) are provisions of the existing section 11 of the 1988 Act and they allow the Data Protection Commissioner to prohibit a transfer of data to a place outside the State and set out the administrative procedures to be followed in connection with such a prohibition. In determining whether to prohibit a transfer of personal data, the commissioner must also have regard, as heretofore, to the desirability of facilitating international transfers of data.</P>
    <P>Section 11 provides for the insertion of a new section 12A in the 1988 Act. Taking account of Article 20 of the directive, it makes provision for a system of &ldquo;prior checking&rdquo; by the Data Protection Commissioner of processing operations likely to present specific risks. A processing operation which is the subject of a prior check may not take place until the checking procedure has been completed. An appeal can be made against the result of any such prior check.</P>
    <P>While the 1988 Act already contains provisions relating to codes of practice, section 12 amends these provisions in order to take account of Article 27 of the directive. The revised provisions will allow the Data Protection Commissioner to consider, and approve as appropriate, draft codes of practice submitted by trade associations or other bodies representing categories of data controllers or to prepare such codes in consultation with relevant interests. A new subsection (6) provides that approved codes of practice may be taken into account by the courts in relation to the settlement of disputes.</P>
    <P>Section 14 contains another important amendment of the 1988 Act. It extends current registration requirements, in accordance with Article 18 of the directive, to almost all data controllers <Col N="1761" /> and data processors. A limited number of exemptions are provided for, an example of which is where the sole purpose of processing is the keeping of a register that is intended to provide information to the public and is open to consultation, or the processing is carried out by a non-profit seeking body in relation to the members of the body or those that have regular contact with it. Certain categories of data processing may also be specifically exempted from registration requirements by means of regulations where the processing in question is unlikely to affect the rights and freedoms of data subjects. These categories will be prescribed by regulations made by the Data Protection Commissioner with the consent of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    <P>Section 18 contains another important set of provisions that have regard to the special importance of the public interest in freedom of speech. A new section 22A to be inserted in the 1988 Act provides that personal data that are processed only for the purposes of journalism or artistic or literary purposes will be exempt from certain provisions of the Act once such processing is either undertaken solely with a view to the publication of any journalistic, literary or artistic material or the data controller believes that such publication would be in the public interest, and where the data controller believes that compliance with those provisions would be incompatible with journalistic, artistic or literary purposes.</P>
    <P>The provisions in the Act referred to here include the sections that deal with processing of personal data; processing of sensitive personal data; fair processing of data; the right of access; the right to rectification; the right to object; and restrictions on decisions based on automatic processing. The possibility of developing codes of practice under section 13 of the Act for approval by the Data Protection Commissioner is referred to in subsection (3 ). Such a code could set out guidelines for determining whether publication of material would be in the public interest.</P>
    <P>In accordance with Article 32 of the directive, automated data will be brought into conformity with the Act two months from the date of its passing. Annual data will come within the scope of the Act at the same time, with one exception &ndash; manual data already held in filing systems need not be brought into conformity with sections 2, 2A and 2B of the Act &ndash; Articles 6, 7 and 8 of the directive &ndash; until 24 October 2007. However, the right of rectification, erasure or blocking of data that are incomplete, inaccurate or stored in a way that is incompatible with the legitimate purposes pursued by the data controller will apply progressively to such manual data during that period, in particular where a person makes an access request under section 4 of the Act.</P>
    <P>The Bill before us today is designed to bring our domestic data protection law into line with the requirements of the EU directive and make certain improvements to existing arrangements in the light of experience gained since 1988. In doing <Col N="1762" /> so it seeks to establish an appropriate balance between the protection of the privacy of data subjects and the need to facilitate the international flows of data that are an essential feature of today's information society. Providing protection for data subjects in this way will encourage greater support for and participation in efforts to reap the full benefits of the information society, whether by way of e-commerce or e-government.</P>
    <P>Since they build on the existing data protection infrastructure established under the 1998 Act, the additional provisions of the Bill should not involve or impose undue additional burdens on operators. Neither should they serve to unnecessarily restrict transfers of personal data to destinations within the State or outside the European Union. On the contrary, the enactment of the Bill will ensure agreed European Union level standards of data protection will operate here in the best interests of individuals, commercial and other interests and international operators.</P>
    <P>As I said, this is a rather technical Bill. As there may be aspects which Senators may wish to have clarified, I shall endeavour to do so when replying, or on Committee Stage. Careful consideration will be given to questions raised or suggestions made during the debate today, while bearing in mind that the primary purpose of the Bill is to give effect to the provisions of a European Union directive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. D. Cregan Mr. D. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which, as the Minister of State said, is very technical and detailed. It is an update and improvement upon the Data Protection Act, 1988, and based upon an EU directive. We are adopting more and more EU regulations, rightly so, given that we are part of the European Union. One really has to examine the Bill in detail to discern exactly what purpose it serves. Companies are now in a position where they will be required to possess more details and information regarding their employees. They will have to seek this information. There will be a mutual obligation upon employers and employees to provide each other with information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is all fine in theory, but we must consider the details of the measure which I can understand, but many others may not. The word &ldquo;consent&rdquo; is rightly used a lot in the Bill. It is an important one. I do not believe there is a consensus regarding information about individuals available to financial institutions, in particular. I wonder whether we are now moving to a situation where nobody will be allowed to seek data or information about individuals without consent as regards personal business. That is not the current situation. I find very frightening, particularly for those involved with financial institutions, the amount of information these organisations have on particular individuals. They possess a large amount of information which they can pass on to others, whether former employees, security organisations, private investigators or whoever. It is only right that agencies such as the Department <Col N="1763" /> of Justice, Equality and Law Reform or the Garda Síochána should have access to relevant information on people who live in this State but I am worried by the ease with which security organisations and private investigators can access personal information on private citizens held by large businesses and financial institutions.</P>
    <P>From a European point of view, the Data Protection (Amendment) Bill, 2002, is very important. Protection of European citizens in their everyday lives is an important issue. Now that we have freedom of movement between the 15 member states, it is understandable that the relevant authorities must have access to information on people who travel throughout Europe. It is the only way we can guard against another act of terrorism such as that which took place in America last September. However, I am concerned about the issue of consent, as raised by this Bill.</P>
    <P>In Britain, potential employers are permitted to access police files to see whether someone whom they wish to hire has a criminal record. Will this also be the case in Ireland and, if so, does the Minister think that such a situation should be allowed to prevail? I do not think so. I carry no flag for those who break the law. However, I do believe that, when someone has served their time in prison, their crime should not hang over their heads for the rest of their lives. Organisations other than the Garda Síochána should not have access to that sort of information about a person. It could prevent a person from getting a job, somebody who is making an effort to get on with their lives and make good their past errors.</P>
    <P>I am also against the sharing of information between financial institutions. This is unfair to individuals who seek credit from such institutions. A person's circumstances may change over a period of time and a credit record that is five years old may no longer reflect their financial situation.</P>
    <P>This is a very technical Bill, but I would appreciate it if the Minister would re-examine the notion of individual consent when it comes to the availability of personal information. I understand that there is a need for a Bill such as this and I congratulate the Minister on her work in this area. I do not think that the Data Protection Bill, 1987, was detailed enough and I hope this new legislation marks an improvement in this area. For a long time, I have felt that financial institutions have had too great a level of authority over individuals. That must be brought to an end.</P>
    <P>We must make sure that financial institutions from other European countries are allowed to do business here, giving a greater choice to consumers. For too long, the same few institutions have had too much authority over people. This stifled the potential of some people who wished to run their own businesses. Data protection worked against these individuals, who were denied access to certain kinds of information that <Col N="1764" /> would have helped them to succeed in their endeavours.</P>
    <P>Our membership of the EU has proven to us that we are all equal and are entitled to equal treatment. Information that is passed between financial institutions should not be given without the written consent of the person in question. The Central Bank now has the authority to ensure that insurance brokers, accountants and banks stay in line with regulations. Such authority is relevant to data protection. The Central Bank can decide what sort of information about any individual can be issued to the financial institutions. This gives a certain degree of protection to the individual. It proves that it is possible for the State to exercise a similar authority over the dissemination of personal information to various businesses or organisations. Such authority must be exercised &ndash; the EU has indicated that it believes our legislation is out of line.</P>
    <P>I accept that anyone who has appeared before the courts or is known to the police should be on a file to which the relevant authorities across the EU have access. It is frightening that there could have been people in this country who assisted the al-Qaeda terrorists in the 11 September attacks. The French authorities have discovered that it has many such people living there, as has Britain. Nobody ever thought that could happen. Any information relevant to such people and organisations must be made available to all member states.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill. I do not agree with everything it contains but I understand what it is about. I congratulate the Minister on her hard work. This Bill allows for us to protect each other and create a better society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this very technical legislation whose main purpose is the updating of the Data Protection Bill, 1997. I have no doubt that, in another five years, the Bill with which we are dealing will have to be updated. With current advances in technology, it is difficult to keep ahead of the posse.</P>
      <P>It is vitally important that personal information relating to any individual is protected. Provision must be made for people to give their consent before such information can be issued. I particularly welcome that part of the Bill which &ldquo;extends data protection rules to certain manual data relating to living individuals, which is recorded as part of a relevant filing system&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Bill also sets out conditions for processing personal data, including more stringent controls in respect of sensitive personal data such as that relating to physical or mental health, trade union membership, political opinions or religious beliefs and racial or ethnic origin. This is an extremely important area because such information relates to particular individuals who have the right to ensure it is protected. Nobody, through computers or any other means, should have a right to pass on information of that kind without the prior consent of the person to whom it relates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1765" />The Bill will strengthen individual rights and will protect people's right to be informed about the processing of data relating to them. I am familiar with a number of decent people who, some years ago, were refused hire purchase finance on their cars on foot of outdated data which showed that they had not made their repayments on loans from 20 years before. The banks and hire purchase companies refused to give them finance as a result of this data. When I was in the motor trade I had to argue the point with the financial institutions and ask whether they believed that people could change. One of the men in question owned a house and property, but when he was in his late teens he purchased a car and was not ready for the financial responsibility that entailed. It is not fair that is held against people for their entire lives.</P>
    <P>If, as Senator Cregan stated, a person falls foul of the law and either pays a fine or serves a sentence, they have paid their debt to society and there is no way it should be left hanging over them. The only exception I would make is in regard to what has become an awful problem for society, namely, paedophilia. I must admit that I did not know the meaning of that word ten years ago. Data relating to people such as paedophiles who are a danger to others should be made available, but this must be done carefully and it should only be distributed, where necessary, to the Garda, legal representatives, etc. Such information should not be available on the Internet where people can just download it from a computer and make it public. That would be very dangerous.</P>
    <P>Data protection is more important now than ever because our world is becoming smaller on foot of globalisation, etc. In the area of business, it has often happened that an individual might invent something but another person, who came into possession of information relating to that invention, developed a similar product which had only been slightly modified. Data must be protected. We live in a competitive world and if a business is dealing with a wholesaler or manufacturer, the information it provides must be protected and it cannot be allowed to be passed on to its competitors. That would be grossly unfair. This type of information could not be given out in the past because business was carried out through the sending of letters or by telephone and methods of communication were not as fast. Now, however, people can send messages by computer or mobile phone to New York, Russia or any other part of the world which arrive seconds after they are transmitted.</P>
    <P>This is an extremely important matter and we must protect data, particularly that which can be used for commercial, criminal and a host of other purposes. The Bill is an important legislative development. While many of the technicalities it contains would go over the heads of many lay people, everyone is familiar with its fundamental principle, namely, to protect individuals, companies and businesses and data relevant to them. I <Col N="1766" /> welcome the fact that before anyone can seek data on a person, they will be obliged to approach that person and obtain their signed approval. Before now, that protection did not exist and banks, for example, could obtain information on people. If they do so now, however, it will be a criminal offence. Individuals will also now be aware if people are seeking information on them. That was not the case in the past.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill, which brings us into line with the EU. I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, although I do not understand the logic of introducing it on the eve of the dissolution of the Dáil. I am not sure what is the purpose of that because it is difficult to see the Bill being enacted.</P>
      <P>The European approach to data protection differs greatly from that of the United States. My daughter was in America last year and she wanted to rent an apartment. She phoned home to say that the landlord required a guarantee from someone who earned $80,000 per year. I contacted a friend who I thought was well off &ndash; I did not mention the $80,000 &ndash; and stated that my daughter required someone to act as a guarantor for her. He said he would be happy to oblige and, when I asked for it, he provided me with his social security number. However, he was turned down because apparently he does not earn $80,000 per year. I subsequently rang another individual who was approved.</P>
      <P>I did not realise that the kind of information to which I refer is available to anyone in America. I had assumed that protection and individuality were valued in that country but, as Senator Cregan and Senator Farrell both stated, the Americans take a different approach to this matter. In America, personal data is not considered personal in any real sense as we understand it. One can buy access there to an extraordinary range of personal information that people in Europe would consider private. It is the objective of Directive 95/46/EC to protect such information.</P>
      <P>This is a practical issue and it arises in cases where companies operating in Europe want to transfer data to the American jurisdiction. This happens all the time because an increasing number of companies, particularly those that are important to our economy, work seamlessly on a worldwide basis. What happens when two different philosophies regarding personal information clash with each other? Who wins? It is clear that the American way wins. Under the directive, data can be transferred to any country that is deemed by the EU to operate safe practices and the US is deemed to be such a country. It is worth pointing out that this arrangement, however useful it may be in business and commerce, is essentially a political arrangement. Europe and the US confronted each other on this issue and Europe blinked first. The result is that a coach and four is being driven through the protections set out in the Bill and we must be aware of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1767" />It is interesting that whenever an issue arises concerning personal freedoms such as the question of carrying compulsory identity cards, which has again arisen as a result of the crime situation in this country, the spectre conjured up is that of Big Brother. In my opinion it is not so much the State about which we should be concerned in this area, but rather other entities that will not be bound by the regulations or principles that usually constrain the behaviour of the State. It seems to me to be a shocking invasion of privacy that details of a person's police record can be bought on the open market in the United States.</P>
    <P>There are certain kinds of information that it is right for the State to possess, but these should not be accessible to anyone else. Telephone companies know a great deal about people, credit card companies know where they spend their money and supermarkets know whether their children are boys or girls, whether they drink much wine or whether they own a dog. Members will recall the case of the nominee for the Supreme Court in the United States and the fact that on the day before he was to appear in the Senate, details of all the videos he had rented for the previous five years were published. I do not remember whether there was a scandal about this, but it is a matter of concern that such personal information is readily available in the US. There appears to be an uneasy compromise that allows the free transfer of data from Europe to the United States and I hope this will not come back to haunt us in the future.</P>
    <P>The Bill is the last of a fairly short list of legislation relating to information society matters introduced by the Government during the past five years. When I consider that period, I cannot help but be struck by the way the drive to make Ireland a world leader in the information society has been lost. In 1996 I noticed a sudden upsurge of interest in this area, which is one I had been championing for some years. Overnight it became the conventional wisdom that the information society offered Ireland a unique opportunity to wipe out the structural and geographical constraints and obstacles which stood in our way for centuries because of our position on the periphery of Europe. We appeared to embrace the prospect of a new industrial revolution in which, this time, Ireland could play a full role because of modern communications.</P>
    <P>I am not decrying the progress to date but, while I acknowledge we have achieved a great deal, it is not nearly enough. For instance, it was a correct and very imaginative stroke for the State to get into the business of bringing broadband capacity here and acting as a wholesale distributor of this capacity in the initial years. Unfortunately, however, the initiative was not carried through to the equally vital task of distributing broadband capacity around the country. Only now, very late in the day, are we trying to play catch up in this area. I am not sure it is fully realised that having broadband available <Col N="1768" /> throughout the country is not sufficient given that its potential will never be realised unless it is sold cheaply enough to enable universal access. If it is too expensive, people will not use it. Therefore, it should not become a niche market restricted only to businesses which can afford it. If we are really serious about becoming a world leader in the information age, we must regard broadband as a tool of mass communication.</P>
    <P>Those of us with children will realise that youngsters &ndash; indeed, anybody under the age of 40 &ndash; never write letters. They text and e-mail each other using poor yet understandable English. Recently, I was in Singapore which, a couple of years ago, in recognition of the fact that it was set to become an e-commerce hub, decided to give every citizen an e-mail address. While I am sure An Post still has a bright future, I would not like to be in my old position of chairman as I would be hoping that people would continue to write letters in the traditional manner. Like Singapore, we should aim to give every household an e-mail address.</P>
    <P>Another area in which we have made useful progress is e-government. A recent survey showed that Ireland leads the European Union in this respect, which is a tremendous and worthwhile achievement. Even in embryo form, the two websites which bundle Government services &ndash; Oasis and Basis &ndash; are doing an excellent job. They demonstrate that the real potential of the information age is not just one of productivity. The gain from e-government is not just efficiency, but also effectiveness; it works and makes it possible for Government to reach out to more people more quickly than ever before. This is the reason that I and other Members of the House have proposed that matters which must be published in newspapers should also be published on the Internet. E-government gives citizens a measure of control over the way in which they do business with Government in a way that never existed before.</P>
    <P>It is a pity we have not yet done enough to seek out the benefits of the information society in regard to the political process, about which this House should be so proud, as opposed to the administration of Government services. New technology offers us dramatic opportunities to draw citizens into the process of law making. If we really believe in democracy, we should be rushing to embrace the opportunity to do everything we possibly can in this area. We wring our hands and bemoan the apathy and cynicism that permeate our society in regard to the political process and complain about not getting thanks for the work we do. This is akin to talking about the weather in that we never do anything about it. However, unlike the weather, this is a challenge we can do something about.</P>
    <P>This Bill has implications right across the board, for us as individual citizens and for every business enterprise operating here. It is in the latter area that I feel most steam has gone out of our earlier drive to become a world leader in the <Col N="1769" /> information age. We have lost a great deal of early enthusiasm. Somewhere along the way the Government appears to have lost a grip on the vision it had five years ago. It seems to have receded from being an urgent priority to being just one of a list of platitudes. Perhaps it lost some faith in the project when the dotcoms collapsed about a year ago. Collapse may be too strong a word for what happened, but if it led to a revision of Government thinking, as I am suggesting, or a lessening of its interest in the area of the information age and Ireland's opportunities in it, the mistake should be speedily rectified. The setback experienced by the dotcoms was nothing more than the sort of shake up and shake out which inevitably happens when there is a new technology or development. Invariably too many people get involved and while some fail, others succeed. The experience merely cleared the decks so that real development could begin under more realistic circumstances, which is, I suggest, possible.</P>
    <P>The fact that this Bill implements an EU directive which has been in operation, as the Minister of State informed us, since as far back as 1995, is an indicator of the way in which the steam has gone out of the Government's approach to the information age. I hope the new Government, whatever its shape or hue, will rediscover this opportunity and run with it as fast as possible. I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will begin with the points made by Senator Quinn on the drive to become a world leader in the information age. The Taoiseach announced the appointment of a new Information Society Commission on 27 November last, chaired by the former president of DCU, Dr. Danny O'Hare. The commission will act as an independent advisory body to the Government, drawing on high level representation from the business community, the social partners and the Government itself. It will report directly to the Taoiseach and the secretariat to support its work is being provided by the Department of the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>The remit of the new commission is to highlight the challenges and opportunities presented by information society developments, monitor Ireland's performance in its evolution as an information society both nationally and internationally, identify areas of co-operation with other jurisdictions, including the establishment of links with the Northern Ireland information age initiative, and establish working groups as required to provide expert advice on specific areas of public policy development.</P>
      <P>I understand the new commission is in the process of establishing its work programme, including arrangements for setting up the working groups it has decided to establish. It is expected that the commission will play a key role in shaping the public policy framework for the evolving information society here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1770" />As the Senator said, the growth of e-commerce in recent years means that many consumers have already become used to buying goods and services over the Internet and an increasing number of people now do their weekly shopping on-line. Businesses have been choosing to buy services in the same way. A certain amount of personal data will inevitably be collected in the course of such transactions &ndash; registration details, for example, including name and address &ndash; which creates a risk that it could be used for other purposes without the knowledge or consent of the data subject.</P>
    <P>For this reason, the Data Protection Commissioner made regulations last year requiring all Internet access providers &ndash; IAPs &ndash; to register with his office. The commissioner took this decision because of their extensive databases and the sensitive and personal nature of much of the data they hold. Any company which operates a website is also likely to be a data controller for the purposes of data protection and will also need to register. The registration process requires data controllers to indicate the nature and extent of their processing operations and this safeguard will help to build confidence in e-commerce and encourage consumers to avail of the on-line services that are now emerging.</P>
    <P>With regard to the points made by Senators on transfers of personal data to countries and territories outside the European Economic Area, the intention is not to hinder such data flows, but rather to ensure that adequate data protection safeguards are in place in the country of destination. Problems arise in this regard in countries such as the United States which takes a sectoral approach to data protection. There, reliance on a mix of legislation, regulation and self-regulation is the norm and no overarching provisions are in place.</P>
    <P>Given the extent of our commercial, trade and other links with the United States, the ability of US organisations to comply with the adequacy requirements of the directive is a matter of concern. The agreement, therefore, worked out during extensive negotiations between the European Commission and the US authorities hinges on a set of data protection principles to which organisations in the United States can voluntarily sign up and which provide the necessary safeguards for data supplied for such organisations. This mechanism is designed not only to facilitate existing data transfers but to encourage international flows of data which operate to the advantage of operators in both the countries of origin and destination. The US Department of Commerce website contains a list of organisations which have informed the Department that they adhere to the safe harbour principles. This does not mean that organisations not on the list do not have privacy data protection policies, but rather that they cannot avail of the benefits of the safe harbour agreement in terms of adequacy of protection.</P>
    <P>As regards transfers to other destinations, the standard contractual clauses jointly developed by <Col N="1771" /> the European Commission and member states provide the required level of protection. However, if these are considered unsuitable for certain transactions, transfers may be made on terms approved by the Data Protection Commissioner.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrell raised some important issues. He said data should not be kept any longer than is necessary. I agree with him. It is an important basic principle of data protection. As regards the point about exceptions made in connection with detecting and combating crime, this is already allowed and not being changed. The Senator was right when he said data protection is relevant to us all. He also referred to the importance of consent enshrined in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator Denis Cregan was also concerned about the importance of consent. Individual rights are being strengthened in the Bill. The need for consent is recognised. Registration provisions are also being strengthened in the Bill. Holders of data must have approval for all processing. The Senator also referred to enforced access requests. Such requests will be prohibited in future following the enactment of the Bill. It is an abuse of the system which we are addressing. The 1988 Act went beyond what was required at the time. Information technology and the Internet have moved on rapidly in the meantime. While the Bill is technical, it is about the protection of individuals.</P>
    <P>The Bill aims to establish an appropriate balance between potentially conflicting policy objectives and rights. We must ensure personal data are not used for purposes for which they were not intended while, at the same time, encouraging and facilitating data flows. We must reconcile personal privacy considerations with the needs of historical research, statistical requirements and scientific discovery. We must protect personal privacy while, at the same time, recognising the special importance of the public interest in the freedom of expression.</P>
    <P>We live in a society which is often referred to as the information society in which huge quantities of data, including personal data, can be stored and processed with an ease unimaginable a few years ago. The information society brings many benefits in its wake, including improved communications and delivery of services. However, there are also risks involved. People's legitimate concerns must be addressed if we are to reap the full benefits of new information and computer technologies. I am convinced the data protection safeguards set out in the Bill will serve to further enhance confidence in e-commerce and e-government and yield significant benefits which outweigh whatever additional costs may arise in the context of its implementation.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators for their contributions. I appreciate hearing their views on a subject which, <Col N="1772" /> we must all agree, affects each of us in our daily lives.</P>

      <P>Is cúis áthais dom inniu an díospóireacht a oscailt sa Seanad ar an mBille seo. Is é cuspóir ginearálta an Bille comhionannas a chothú don Ghaeilge agus don Bhéarla mar theangacha oifigiúla an Stáit agus foráil a dhéanamh maidir le cearta teanga an tsaoránaigh ina chaidreamh nó ina caidreamh leis an Stát.</P>
      <P>Tá sé mar bhunaidhm pholasaí ag an Roinn Ealaíon, Oidhreachta, Gaeltachta agus Oileán &ldquo;An meath ar úsáid na Gaeilge mar phríomh-mheán cumarsáide sa Ghaeltacht a fhreaschur agus úsáid na Gaeilge sa chuid eile den tír a leathnú.&rdquo; I ráiteas straitéiseach na Roinne don tréimhse 2001-2004 tá ocht gcúspóir straitéiseach luaite le feidhm a thabhairt don bhunaidhm seo, ina measc: leanúint d'fhorbairt teanga, shósialta, fhisiciúil agus eacnamaíochta na Gaeltachta a chur chun cinn; tacaíocht reachtúil a thabhairt do stádas Bunreachtúil na Gaeilge; an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht; agus tacú leis an Fhoras Teanga, a fheidhmíonn ar bhonn uile Éireannach. Feidhmítear réimse leathan de scéimeanna agus gníomhartha tacaíochta leis na cuspóirí seo a thabhairt i gcrích. Tá lúcháir orm a rá go bhfuil cuid mhór bainte amach le roinnt blianta anuas leis an Ghaeilge a cothú agus le feabhas a chur ar bhunstruchtúr na Gaeltachta i gcoitinne.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá dea-thoil don Ghaeilge le feiceáil go forleathan. Tá comharthaí dóchais ann don Ghaeilge cheana féin &ndash; tá an fás leanunach i líon na Gaelscoileanna, obair cheannródaíochta TG4 agus Raidió na Gaeltachta, obair forbartha na Roinne, Údaras na Gaeltachta agus An Fhorais Teanga, ina n-ábhair spreagtha. Taobh amuigh den Bhunreacht, áfach, níl aon reachtaíocht ann chun cearta lucht na Gaeilge a chinntiú. Mar gheall ar an easpa reachtaíochta seo, bionn sé deacair ó am go chéile a chur ina luí ar eagrais Stáit go bhfuil cearta ag pobal na hÉireann maidir le seirbhís trí Ghaeilge a fháil. In ionad cothrom na féinne a thabhairt do lucht na Gaeilge, bídís on nGaeltacht no bídís lasmuigh di a roghnaíonn an Ghaeilge a úsáid mar a bpríomhtheanga labhartha, tá an meon ann seirbhísí a chur ar fáil trí Bhearla <Col N="1774" /> amháin. Nil mórán amhrais faoi ach go bhfuil neamh-aird a tabhairt go forleathan ar na treoirlínte neamhreachtúla a réitigh Bord na Gaeilge, mar a bhi, i 1993 maidir le seirbhísí Stáit a chur ar fáil trí Ghaeilge.</P>
    <P>Is léir nar éirigh agus nach n-éireoidh le tionscnamh deonach nó le treoirlínte deonacha gan aon phleanáil shonrach taobh thiar dóibh bunaithe ar na riachtanais éagsula. Sna cúinsí uilig glactar leis anois go bhfuil gá le hathrú ó threoirlínte neamhreachtúla go dtí córas foirmiúil reachtúil. Glactar leis go forleathan nach mbeidh an t-aitheantas ceart ag an Ghaeilge go dtí go mbeidh aitheantas cuí aici sa Státchóras agus sa saol poiblí. Is mar gheall ar sin gur chinn an Rialtas go raibh gá le reachtaíocht agus go bhfuil Bille na dTeangacha Oifigiúla (Comhionannas), 2002 á chur faoi bhráid an tSeanaid inniu. Creidim gurb é an Bille seo ceann de na rudaí is tabhachtaí don Ghaeilge le fada an lá. Ar ball beidh deis agaibh bhur gcuid tuairimí a chur in iúl agus tá mé ag tnúth go mor le cloisteáil uaibh.</P>
    <P>Is Bille réasúnta gearr é &ndash; 33 mír atá ann san iomlán. Ba mhaith liom anois léargas a thabhairt ar na príomhfhordlácha atá ann ina n-ord de réir riar na n-alt. Mar is iondúil sa reachtaíocht, &ldquo;sé alt 1 a leagann amach gearrtheideal agus tosach feidhme an Bhille. Leagtar amach anseo freisin go meastar go mbeidh an tAcht i bhfeidhm go hiomlán tráth nach déanaí ná trí bliana tar éis é a rith. &ldquo;Sé alt 2 an foráil míniúcháin. Tá miniú le fáil ann ar &ldquo;na Teangacha Oifigiúla&rdquo; maraon le sainmhínithe ar théarmaí eile a úsáidtear sa Bhille. Deanann alt 3 foráil go n-íocfar aon chaiteachais a bhaineann le riaradh an Achta as airgead a chuirfidh an tOireachtas ar fáil, le toiliú an Aire Airgeadais. </P>
    <P>Tugann alt 4 an chumhacht don Aire, le toiliú an Aire Airgeadais, rialacháin a dheanamh i ndáil le fordlácha an Achta. Leagtar amach ann go bhféadfaidh ceachtar Teach den Oireachtas Rialacháin a dhéanfar faoin Acht, a neamhniú laistigh de 21 lá suí ach, i gcúinsí áirithe beidh gá le rún ó Thithe an Oireachtais chun dul ar aghaidh. Baineann alt 5 le cearta comhaltaí an Oireachtais ceachtar de na teangacha oifigiúla a úsáid i dTithe an Oireachtais. Baineann alt 6 le foilsiú Achtanna go comhuaineach sa dá theanga oifigiúil.</P>

Leagtar amach ann freisin go bhfuil an ceart ag duine éisteacht a fháil sa teanga oifigiúil is rogha leis nó leí. Baineann alt 8 le cearta an duine cumarsáid a dhéanamh le comhlacht poiblí agus seirbhísí a fháil uaidh i gceachtar de na teangacha oifigiúla i gcomhréir le haon scéim atá i bhfeidhm faoi alt 15. Leagann alt 9 dualgas ar chomhlachtaí poiblí a chinntiú gur féidir le daoine cumarsáid a dhéanamh leo agus seirbhísí a fháil uathu i gceachtar de na teangacha oifigiúla i gcomhréir le aon scéim atá i bhfeidhm faoi alt 15.</P>
    <P>Forálann alt 10 go bhfuil dualgas ar chomhlachtaí poiblí a chinntiú go núsáidtear na teangacha oifigiúla ar stáiseanóireacht, ar chomharthaí agus ar fhograí, i gcomhréir le haon scéim <Col N="1775" /> atá i bhfeidhm faoi alt 15. Leagann alt 11 dualgas ar chomhlachtaí poiblí, ar chomhlachtaí Stáit iad freisin, doiciméid áirithe ar díol spéise iad don phobal, mar shampla, tograí polasaithe, tuarascálacha bliantúla, ráitis straitéise a fhoilsiú go comhuaineach sa dá theanga oifigiúil.</P>
    <P>Baineann alt 12 le cead a thabhairt don Aire treoirlínte chun cuidiú le comhlachtaí poiblí scéim a ullmhú agus a eisiúint. Leagtar amach ann na nósanna imeachta chun na treoirlínte sin a tharraingt suas, lena n-áirítear próiseas comhchomhairle. Déanfar cóip de na treoirlínte ceadaithe a leagan faoi bhráid gach Tí den Oireachtas. Is féidir na treoirlínte a leasú ó am go ham. Leagann alt 13 dualgas ar chomhlachtaí poiblí dréacht-scéim reachtuil ina dtabharfar sonraí maidir leis na seirbhísí a chuirfidh siad ar fáil trí Ghaeilge a ullmhú. Is é tús an phróisis ná iarratas oifigiúil ón Aire chuig comhlacht poiblí ag iarraidh air dréacht-scéim a ullmhú agus a chur faoi bhraid an Aire laistigh de thréimhse shonrach ama (nach déanaí na 6 mhí ó dháta an iarratais).</P>
    <P>Baineann alt 14 leis na nósanna imeachta a bheidh le leanúint ag comhlachtaí poiblí maidir le hullmhú dréacht-scéime, lena n-áirítear próiseas comhchomhairle poiblí. Cinnteofar sa dréacht-scéim go mbeidh dóthain daoine ar fáil chun seirbhís a chur ar fáil trí Ghaeilge agus cinnteofar freisin go bhfreastalófar ar aon riachtanais ar leith a bhaineann le seirbhísí trí Ghaeilge a chur ar fáil sa Ghaeltacht. Baineann alt 15 leis na nósanna imeachta a bheidh le leanúint ag an Aire roimh dréacht-scéim a dheimhniú. Tar éis an dréacht-scéim a dheimhniú leis an gcomhlacht poiblí lena mbaineann sé, cuirfidh an tAire cóip den scéim ar aghaidh chuig Coimisinéir na dTeangacha oifigiúla. Fanfaidh scéim i bhfeidhm ar feadh tréimhse trí bliana de ghnáth. Tugann alt 16 an chumhacht don Aire athbhreithniú tréimhsiúil ar scéimeanna a iarraidh.</P>
    <P>Tugann alt 17 an chumhacht don Aire scéim a leasú i gcás go dtiocfaidh aon athrú ar fheidhmeanna nó ar chúinsí comhlachta phoiblí. Tugann alt 18 an chumhacht don Aire aon teip, diúltú nó neamhábaltacht scéim a ullmhú, a thuairisciú do Thithe an Oireachtais. Leagann alt 19 dualgas ar chomhlacht poiblí scéim a bheidh ceadaithe faoin Acht a chur i bhfeidhim. Forálann sé leis nach mbeidh raon na scéime ina theorainn ar an gcomhlacht poiblí ó thaobh na mbeart a ghlacann sé chun seirbhísí a chur ar fáil sa Ghaeilge. Forálann alt 20 nach féidir le comhlacht poiblí aon chostas a ghearradh ar dhuine de thoradh aon dhualgas a thitfidh ar an gcomhlacht poiblí sin faoin Acht.</P>
    <P>Baineann alt 21 le bunú Oifig Choimisinéir na dTeangacha Oifigiúla. Beidh an coimisinéir neamhspleách i gcomhlíonadh a fheidhmeanna nó a feidhmeanna agus ceapfaidh an tUachtarán é nó í.</P>
    <P>Baineann alt 22 le feidhmeanna an Choimisinéara. Chomh maith le monatóireacht a dhéanamh ar chomhlíonadh an Achta ag comhlachtaí poiblí, <Col N="1776" /> beidh de chead ag an gCoimisinéir fiosrúcháin a dhéanamh agus comhairle nó cúnamh a chur ar fáil do chomhlachtaí poiblí agus don phobal.</P>
    <P>Baineann alt 23 le cumhachtaí an Choimisinéara ó thaobh a fheidhmeanna nó a feidhmeanna faoin Acht a chur i gcrích. Leagann sé síos, mar shampla, go bhfuil de chumhacht ag an gCoimisinéar dualgas a chur ar dhuine faisnéis nó taifid a sholáthar agus leagtar amach ann an pionós a chuirfear ar dhuine nach ndéanann amhlaidh.</P>
    <P>Baineann alt 24 leis na nósanna imeachta a bheidh le leanúint nuair a bheidh fiosrúcháin a dheanamh ag an gCoimisinéir. Leagtar síos in alt 25 nach feidir leis an gCoimisinéir gearán is ábhar d'imeachtaí dlíthiúla sibhialta a fhiosrú, mura rud é gur cuí déanamh amhlaidh de bharr cúinse speisialta. Leagtar síos in alt 26 nach feidir faisnéis a gheobhaidh an Coimisinéir i mbun a c(h)uid dhualgas a úsáid ach amháin chun na críche sin.</P>
    <P>Baineann alt 27 leis na nósanna imeachta a bheidh le leanúint i ndáil le tuarascálacha ar thoradh fiosrúcháin ag an gCoimisinéir. Beidh de chead ag an gCoimisinéir moltaí a dhéanamh í dtuarascálacha den sórt sin agus, mura gcuirfidh an comhlacht poiblí na moltaí sin i bhfeidhm, féadfaidh an coimisinéir tuarascáil maidir leis sin a thabhairt do Thithe an Oireachtais.</P>
    <P>Tugann alt 28 an chumhacht don Aire amach anseo, le toiliú an Aire Airgeadais, scéim cúitimh a thabhairt isteach a bheidh le riaradh ag an gcoimisinéir, sa chás go dteipeann ar chomhlacht poiblí foralácha an Achta a chomhlíonadh. Leagtar síos in alt 29 gur féidir achomhairc a dhéanamh chuig an Ard Chúirt, ar phointe dlí, i gcoinne cinntí de chuid an choimisinéara. Tugann alt 30 an chumhacht don choimisinéir tráchtaireachtaí ar fheidhm phraiticiúil agus ar oibriú an Achta a ullmhú, d'fhonn cuidiú le comhlachtaí poiblí agus leis an bpobal.</P>
    <P>Leagann alt 31 dualgas ar an gcoimisinéir tuarascáil bhliantúil a ullmhú maidir lena ghníomhaíochtaí nó lena gníomhaiochtaí gach bliain agus ní mór dó nó di an tuarascáil sin a chur faoi bhráid Thithe an Oireachtais. Féadfaidh an coimisinéir freisin, más cuí leis nó léi déanamh amhlaidh ar mhaithe le leas an phobail, tuarascáil a fhoilsiú i ndáil le haon fiosrúchán a bheidh déanta aige nó aici nó i ndáil le haon fheidhm eile a bheidh comhlíonta aige nó aici faoin Acht.</P>
    <P>Forálann alt 32 nach ndéanann forálacha an Achta aon difear do chumhachtaí an Ombudsman. Forálann alt 33 nach dtabharfaidh an tAcht aon cheart do dhuine cás dlí a thógáil in aghaidh comhlacht poiblí dá dteipfeadh air a dhualgas maidir le scéim reachtúil a chomhlíonadh faoin Acht. Forálann sé freisin nach mbeidh aon chás dlí ann, in aon chúirt i gcoinne an choimisinéara nó bhaill dá fhoirne i leith aon ghnó a bheidh déanta acu de mheon macánta.</P>
    <P>Sa Chéad Sceideal, leagtar amach na comhlachtaí a bheidh ina gcomhlachtaí poiblí chun críocha an Achta. Leagtar amach ann freisin an nós imeachta i gcás ina mbeifear ag iarraidh <Col N="1777" /> scóip an Achta a leathnú amach anseo chuig earnálacha den gheilleagar, seachas an earnáil phoiblí, atá ag soláthar seirbhísí go díreach don phobal (e.g. bainc-thráchtála, gníomhaireachtaí eile a thugann iasachtaí, cuideachtaí árachais, cuideachtaí iompair, soláthraithe cúraim sláinte, cuideachtaí teileachumarsáide). D'fhéadfadh sé go leathnófar an scóip chuig cuideachtaí a chuireann seirbhísí atá comhchosúil leis na seirbhísí a chuireann comhlachtaí poiblí ar fáil nó chuig comhlacht a bhí, tráth theacht i bhfeidhm an Achta seo, ina chomhlacht poiblí ach a rinneadh príobhadú air ina dhiaidh. D'fhéadfadh sé go leathnófar í freisin chuig comhlachtaí a fhaigheann airgead go díreach ó Aire den Rialtas nó ó Roinn nó go díreach ón bPriomh-Chiste más rud é nach lú ná 50% de chaiteachas reatha comhlachta i mbliain áirithe an méid a fhaightear.</P>
    <P>Sa Dara Sceideal, leagtar amach foralácha a bhaineann le hoifig Choimisinéir na dTeangacha Oifigiúla. Ba mhaith liom iarraidh ar an Seanad tacaíocht a thabhairt don Bhille seo, atá fíor thábhachtach do chothú na Gaeilge sa Gaeltacht agus go deimhin ar fud na tíre. De bharr seo molaim an Bille seo don Teach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. In the short time that she has held the office of Minister of State, she has made a very strong and positive impact and has brought great enthusiasm to everything she has done. I am very pleased that she is the person presenting this Bill to the House this afternoon.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to appear churlish when I say that we certainly could not agree to take all Stages of this Bill today. I was informed by the Leader of the House after the Order of Business that this was the intention. The Leader has many other things on his mind at the moment but clearly it would not have been possible for us to table any amendments in the hour since then or to give the Bill the attention it requires. An important Bill such as this deserves to be taken seriously and time for reflection is needed after the Second Stage debate today. Given that the Dáil will be dissolved tomorrow, it is unlikely that this Bill will make any further progress until the autumn session, so no time will be lost and a great deal will be gained. Members will remember the Bill recently introduced by the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods. It would have benefited from a time of greater reflection. It is now in a limbo in which it will remain until the new Dáil assembles and the new Minister decides its fate. We are not being difficult. We are not opposed to the Bill, but we see a number of important points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a great logic to this Bill. It makes reality of the constitutional position of the Irish language which was adopted in the Constitution of 1937, Bunreacht na hÉireann. Arguably, a Bill such as this should have been introduced fairly soon after the enactment of the adoption of the Constitution in order to give reality to the provision of the Constitution to ensure that what was <Col N="1778" /> an aspiration had statutory and institutional backing. The treatment of the Irish language by official Ireland &ndash; by all political parties and all Governments &ndash; since that time has been one of great emptiness.</P>
    <P>This Bill in many ways seeks to institutionally fill the void that has been there. We can talk in a moment about the way in which the Irish language has developed since the foundation of the State and I assure the House I will be brief on that subject. Between the elements of compulsion and the bureaucraticisation of language policy and in later times the very welcome incentive-driven and imaginative approach to the revival of Irish, this lacuna has existed, and the State is responsible.</P>
    <P>My good friend and former colleague, Pól Ó Foighil, as a Member of this House consistently railed against the absence which this Bill is designed to address. I am not sure if the Bill will fully address it. His view was that as a Senator and a Member of the Oireachtas he needed to see the text of legislation in both languages. This lacuna may not be remedied by this Bill because as I understand it the Bill will be published in both languages after it has been enacted rather than a version of the Bill in both languages being available from the outset. Members wishing to speak in a debate must make their own translation.</P>
    <P>I remember the genuine anger of Senator Pól Ó Foighil as he sought over a long period to draw attention to this matter. He was prepared to spend his own money in taking the issue to court if necessary. He can take a certain pride in the fact that this Bill is being taken in the House today.</P>
    <P>This is a comprehensive and radical Bill and requires to be discussed in detail. If we do not get the implementation of this Bill right, the outcome could be as meaningless as what it is designed to replace. For that reason we need to consider the practical implications of this Bill and more importantly the resources needed to make sure the Bill can work in practice rather than finding a great number of institutions unprepared or without the resources. If the result of this Bill is a great deal of contention in the courts and with public bodies, that would ultimately create the sort of controversy that would do harm to the Irish language and to those who want to see it more widely used. We must ensure proper resources are put in place.</P>
    <P>I strongly support the principle of the Bill and the principle that all Bills be available in both official languages simultaneously. I may be wrong in my reading of the Bill, but it would be wrong if the Bill was merely translated at the end of its passage into the language in which it was not first published. I would like the Minister to clarify what happens. As we all know the drafting of legislation is a very complex and precise business. When I was Leader of the House, I sat on the Government's legislation committee along with the parliamentary counsel every week. At the <Col N="1779" /> time there was great difficulty getting competent draftsmen &ndash; if I may use that term &ndash; and they were being recruited from Australia and Canada, countries with the same common law system as Ireland. Even with the extra recruits there was always a bottleneck.</P>
    <P>A Bill is drafted in very precise legal terms and then translated into Irish. Are there sufficient draftsmen? Clearly there are some because this Bill is drafted in Irish as well as in English. What resources would be needed to equip the parliamentary counsel's office to ensure that Bills can be drafted in both languages rather than being translated? The committee on the Constitution reported that there are significant differences in the Irish and English versions of the Constitution. A court must decide what is meant on the basis of the Irish text, which is the superior text. If we have debates largely in English on an English text, which is subsequently translated into Irish, and this appears before the court, I understand the court will make its decision on the basis of a translation. This may not be the precise document as drafted and debated. I would like clarification on that. There is not always the same precise meaning of words from one language to the other. I raise that point to get some elucidation.</P>
    <P>I am very conscious of the number of occasions when people go to court and want their cases heard in Irish. They were often treated with great contempt. In many ways our court system has not changed much since the days of Pádraig Pearse and his experiences of the attitude of the courts to those who wanted to pursue their cases through Irish. Until comparatively recently people felt there was a certain arrogance and that they were not treated as full citizens if they wanted to pursue their cases through Irish. I am very conscious that there is no rigorous requirement on judges to be competent to hear detailed technical court cases in Irish. I wonder whether there should be an attempt to have courts that are Irish speaking only or where there is competence to hear cases in Irish. In the days of Cearbhall Ó Dalaigh there would have been no difficulty in putting together a Bench in the Supreme Court to hear any case through both languages. I doubt that is the case today. This is partly because lawyers are not in the habit of using Irish on a regular basis either professionally or socially.</P>
    <P>We appear to be on the way to becoming one of the most regulated societies in the world and one aspect of the Bill slightly frightens me. The title of &ldquo;official languages commissioner&rdquo; has shades of George Orwell about it, reflecting a society where virtually everything is regulated. I would like to be persuaded that this new office does not just herald the creation of another bureaucratic structure. We have various different regulators. All the major utilities have their own regulators and these offices become bigger and more powerful as time goes on. I wonder if this office is appropriate. I accept that unless this Bill <Col N="1780" /> has some sort of oversight body, it will not be effective. I would like to be persuaded that this will not become some kind of large bureaucratic outfit that further clogs the system.</P>
    <P>This Bill will place a very big onus on public bodies at a time when they often find their pleadings for funding fall on deaf ears in the Department of Finance. On enactment, will this Bill ensure that public bodies get the resources they need? This Bill will require public bodies to recruit people who are competent in Irish to a high level. I wonder how many of the people leaving school today have that competence. I teach at university and I talk to many of my students. I mark their essays, listen to them in tutorials, etc, and while many of them have very high competence in English and in their subjects, very few left school with any great competence in Irish. This is in many ways a reflection of the low standards that still pertain. The levels have gone down, the numbers of students taking Irish in universities have dropped and the number of points required for students wanting to take Irish has been dropping consistently in recent years. In many ways the Irish departments in universities have been trying to invent new courses to keep their student numbers up. The numbers of graduates is quite small for a variety of reasons that I will not cover now.</P>
    <P>I worry whether we will be producing the graduates with the high level of competence in Irish who will be required to implement much of what is proposed here. When dealing with strategic or draft plans and a whole range of public documents, precision, accuracy and a good knowledge is certainly required. We will need to discuss these further on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>We need to face up to a certain reality in dealing with this Bill. I do not mean to be either offensive or defeatist, but the battle to restore Irish as the spoken language of the majority of Irish people, which was the ambition of the founders of my party and of the Minister's party in the 1920s and which remained an integral part of the policies of our parties over the years, has now been lost. The battle to make Irish the spoken language of the majority of the people was lost a long time ago, and there is no point in pretending otherwise.</P>
    <P>Perhaps that goal was unrealistic from the very beginning. Perhaps it failed because of the policies of compulsion, the identification of Irish as being part of a self-promoting system, the arrogance of some of the Irish-speaking elite and the narrowness of their philosophy. If we trawl through Irish literature of the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s, as well as the Oireachtas debates of the time on the subject, we may find part of the reason Irish was not revived as a widely spoken language. Perhaps it was too late, but it does not matter much now.</P>
    <P>The irony, as the Minister of State indicated, is that the approach to Irish now is one of imagination and fun. There is an element of joy about those who speak Irish and encourage others to do <Col N="1781" /> so. That certainly was not present in the past when Irish was identified as part of a killjoy culture. The effect of TG4, Raidió na Gaeltachta, Údarás na Gaeltachta, gaelscoileanna and the many enthusiastic Irish speakers has been enormous. Today, people look at the Irish language in a very different way from my generation.</P>
    <P>I remember having the gold fáinne, receiving a gold medal for debating in Irish, and winning a prize for writing a school essay in Irish. When I attended university I was turned off by the Irish language towards which I developed an antipathy which, happily, I have now overcome. I do not believe, however, my Irish is sufficiently fluent or up to date to engage in a debate through the medium. I regret this. My old feeling of antagonism towards Irish, however, has long since gone. My experience was similar to that of many of my generation who went through university in the 1960s and entered Irish life in the 1970s. Now it is very different because there is no hostility towards Irish and people who speak the language are not regarded as some sort of freaks or second-raters. They have established a strong sense of equality concerning their right to speak Irish, and believe that what they are doing is worthwhile. This represents a major cultural change.</P>
    <P>The fact remains that the overwhelming majority conduct their educational, business and social lives through English. Therefore, what the Bill seeks to do may well run counter to the prevailing culture, although I am not saying the Minister of State is wrong to have introduced it. It is both brave and good. I hope, when implemented, it will be able to ensure the wish of some citizens to conduct official business through Irish, as enshrined in the Constitution, can be exercised as a right rather than as a favour or concession. My concern is that the machinery provided for in the Bill will be adequate to accomplish the task. If that is the case, the Bill will require serious resources from whatever Government has the job of implementing it. The Bill needs to be given real teeth, otherwise it will become as meaningless as were many of the Irish language policies of the last 50 or 60 years. They did harm to the language rather than fostering it and encouraging its use.</P>
    <P>With great sincerity, I wish the Minister of State well with the Bill. While nobody can be sure of this, I look forward to being on the Government side of the House when the Bill returns to the next Seanad. One way or another, I wish the Minister of State well with the legislation and compliment her and her officials on its introduction.</P>

      <P>Fáiltím roimh an Aire Stáit agus tréaslaím léi agus le hoifigigh na Roinne toisc an Bille seo a bhreith ar an saol. Tá an Bille ilgabhálach, misniúl agus praiticiúil. Uaireanta <Col N="1782" /> bíonn sé deacair na nithe seo a cheangal le chéile ach tá sin déanta go maith ag an Aire Stáit.</P>
      <P>Le blianta anuas tá éileamh ar a leithéid de Bhille. Tá an-díospóireacht déanta i measc na n-eagras, sa chóras oideachais agus ag dreamanna eile, agus mar gheall ar an ndíospóireacht sin tá tuiscint níos fearr againn go léir ar na riachtanais atá ann maidir le bunús reachtúil a thabhairt don nGaeilge. Tá seo luaite ag an Seanadóir Manning. Tá sé soiléir go raibh a leithéid de reachtaíocht ag teastáil níos luaithe ná seo ach thug an díospóireacht poiblí sin seans dúinn macnamh a dhéanamh agus cinntiú go gcabhródh an Bille le stádas na Gaeilge, le cur chun cinn na Gaeilge agus leis na seirbhísí a bhíonn ag teastáil ó mhuintir na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta a chur ar fáil. Tá áthas orm go raibh an seans againn a leithéid a dhéanamh.</P>
      <P>Tá an-chuid daoine ann a cheap go raibh an cath á chailliúint maidir le cur chun cinn na Gaeilge. Tá sé intuigthe go mbeadh an dearcadh diúltach sin ann. Tá sé deacair a thuiscint conas is féidir le duine freastal ar scoil agus Gaeilge a fhoghlaim ar feadh breis agus 10 mbliain agus gan a bheith in ann comhrá a dhéanamh i nGaeilge. Baineann seo, ní leis an gcóras oideachais ach le heaspa muiníne ag daoine úsáid a bhaint as an nGaeilge. Ceann de na cúiseanna leis seo nach raibh an timpeallacht ag cabhrú leo. Foghlamaíonn daoine Gaeilge, tuigeann siad gramadach ach ní chabhraíonn an timpeallacht leo chun an Ghaeilge a úsáid. Ní bhíonn an Ghaeilge le clos nó le feiscint in aon áit. Is í an chúis atá leis an mBille seo, ní hamháin an timpeallacht a Ghaelú ach cabhrú le daoine gur bhreá leo a leithéid a fheiceáil.</P>
      <P>Tá dea-thoil ann don nGaeilge le breis agus 10 mbliain anuas. Cuireann seo ionadh ar dhaoine mar bhí díospóireacht diúltach ann ar feadh na mblianta roimhe sin. Is cuimhin liom nuair a bhí an Language Freedom Movement i mbéal an phobail go raibh an díospóireacht ar siúil ar feadh cúig nó sé bliana agus bhí an díospóireacht féin nimhneach. Ní raibh aon ghrá do theanga nó do chultúr i gceist ann. Dhein sin an-dochar don nGaeilge toisc go raibh daoine naimhdeach faoin rud. Bhí daoine ag briseadh suas i ndreamanna beaga, cuid acu ar thaobh na Gaeilge agus cuid acu ina coinne. Mhair an t-atmasféar sin ar feadh breis agus 20 bliain agus cheap daoine nach dtiocfadh feabhas ariamh ar an scéal. Níor chreid éinne go n-éireodh linn Bille bunúsach a bhain le bunstructúr na Gaeilge a bhreith ar an saol. Tá ár mbuíochas tuilte ag an Aire Stáit agus ag an Roinne gur deineadh a leithéid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Chuir an fáilte a chuir an Seanadóir Manning roimh an mBille áthas ar mo chroí. Beidh roinnt mhaith díospóireacht le déanamh agus tá mion-rudaí a gcaithfimid a phlé, ach chuir an Seanadóir fáilte roimh an mBille. Mothaím i gcónaí an grá atá sa Teach seo don nGaeilge. Dá dtugtaí a leithéid de Bhille os comhair an Tí na blianta ó shoin bheimís ag caint faoi thábhacht na Gaeilge agus bheadh daoine ag rá nach raibh an teanga ag teastáil agus go raibh am á chur amú ag fogh<Col N="1783" /> laim na Gaeilge. Táimid ag caint anois ar bhonn dóchasach. Mar adúirt an t-Aire Stáit, seo ceann de na rudaí is tábhachtaí a tharla don nGaeilge le fada an lá. Aontaím léi. Cabhróidh sé linn go léir aontu le chéile go dearfach &ndash; in a positive way &ndash; maidir le cur chun cinn na Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>An chéad rud atá ag teastáil is ea mácántacht. Caithfimid a bheith mácánta faoin nGaeilge. Ní hionann sin agus a rá gur cóir do éinne an Ghaeilge a bhrú ar dhuine atá gan Ghaeilge nó ar bheagán Gaeilge. A mhalairt atá sa Bhille mar táimid ag caint faoi theangacha oifigiúla, faoin nGaeilge agus faoin mBéarla ag an am céanna agus faoi stádas a thabhairt don dá cheann acu.</P>
    <P>Féachaimís ar an dul chun cinn atá déanta. I mbliana beidh 30 bliain á ceiliúradh ag Raidió na Gaeltachta. Bhí daoine ag an am a raibh amhras orthu an mbeadh an stáisiún proifisiúnta, an mbeadh sé in-déanta nó an raibh an maoin ann chun é a chothú ach tá a fhios ag éinne a bhfuil seans aige nó aici éisteacht le Raidió na Gaeltachta go bhfuil an stáisiún thar a bheith proifisiúnta agus ar aon chéim le haon stáisiún radió. Tá Raidió na Gaeltachta tar éis an t-atmasféar a ullmhú do Bhille den tsaghas seo.</P>
    <P>Nuair a bhí TG4 á tosú chonaic mé clár painéil ar RTÉ ina raibh daoine ón lucht gnó, ón gcóras oideachais agus ó na heagrais ag caint faoin gcostas a bheadh ar stáisiún teilifíse Gaeilge. Chuir sé ionadh orm an oíche sin gur bheag duine a chuir i gcoinne an smaoinimh, fiú agus costas ag baint leis. Dúirt baill an phainéil go gcaithfear bunstructúr a thógaint chun forbairt a dhéanamh ar an nGaeilge má táimid dáiríre faoi cheist na Gaeilge. D'fhéadfaí an rud céanna a rá faoi an-chuid rudaí atá tar éis tarlú ar leibhéal áitiúil. Tá Foras na Gaeilge ag obair tras-Teorann agus an dá thraidisiún pairteach ann. Ceann de na rudaí a tháinig chun tosaigh maidir leis an bpróiséas síochána ná an ceann a bhain leis an nGaeilge agus leis an gcultúr. De réir dealraimh tá sé ag obair go han-mhaith ar fad.</P>
    <P>Molaim Foras na Gaeilge agus Bord na Gaeilge, mar a bhí. Chuaigh Bord na Gaeilge timpeall ar na húdaráis áitiúla ag iarraidh orthu beart áirithe a chur i bhfeidhm maidir leis an nGaeilge agus ag tabhairt treoirlínte do na húdaráis. Níl mé ag rá gur deineadh gach rud a iarradh orthu a dhéanamh ach aon údarás áitiúl a raibh baint agam leis le blianta anuas, thug mé faoi dearadh gur cuireadh fáilte ann roimh an nGaeilge. B'fhéidir nach raibh an córas i gceart acu ach bhí fáilte iontu roimh an nGaeilge agus bhí lucht na n-údarás dáiríre faoin bhfáilte sin. Ní raibh éinne ag iarraidh bac a chur le cur chun cinn na Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>Mar sin féin tá an Bille seo ag teastáil uathu. Ní brú ar na húdaráis áitiúla atá ann ach cabhair. Beidh ar na húdaráis a n-aigne a dhíriú ar spriocanna áirithe agus scéim a cur le chéile. Beidh seans ag údaráis, ar feadh sé mhí, scéim a chur le chéile agus é bunaithe ar an taithí atá ag na húdaráis agus ar na treoirlínte a chuirfear amach ag an Roinn. Dá mba rud é go raibh gach rud á bhrú orthu tá seans nach mbeadh an dea-thoil chéanna <Col N="1784" /> ann don iarracht seo. Toisc go bhfuil an dá rud seo ag teacht le céile san mBille, cinntíonn sé go n-éireoidh leis.</P>
    <P>Tá breis agus 100 bliain caite ag Conradh na Gaeilge le cur chun cinn na Gaeilge agus tá sár-obair déanta ag Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge agus ag eagrais deonacha eile. Níor deineadh an obair seo ar leibhéal árd amháin ach deineadh é i measc an phobail chomh maith. Is minic a chuala mé daoine ag gearáin nárbh fhiú obair dheonach a dhéanamh nuair nach bhfuil an córas oifigiúil i bpairtnéireacht leis na heagrais deonacha. Ní féidir an pairtnéireacht sin a dhéanamh gan bunús reachtúil a thabhairt d'aon iarracht a bheadh á dhéanamh. Mar thoradh ar an mBille seo beidh na heagrais dheonacha agus an saol oifigiúil in ann cabhrú lena chéile.</P>
    <P>Tá géar-ghá leis an gcoimisinéir do na teangacha oifigiúla. Tugann sé gradam don iarracht seo coimisinéir a bheith ann, go mórmhór nuair atá an coimisinéir á cheapadh ag an Uachtarán féin. Beidh i bhfad níos mó i gceist ag an gcoimisinéir seo ná obair ombudsman. Tá sé soiléir go mbeidh an coimisinéir in ann cabhrú chomh maith leis na comhluchtaí poiblí, ní hamháin go mbeidh cigireacht á dhéanamh ach go mbeidh cabhair ar fáil freisin. Má thosaíonn an iarracht ar an mbonn dearfach sin in ionad brú a bheith taobh thiar de cabhróidh sé leis an dul chun cinn.</P>
    <P>Beidh an chéad bhliain thar a bheith tábhachtach. Má chuirtear an reachtaíocht i bhfeidhm go mall sa chéad bhliain nó má chuirtear bac leis, ní eireoidh leis amach anseo. Ach léiríonn óráid an tSeanadóra Manning go bhfuilimid ag tosú ar an mbonn dearfach sin.</P>
    <P>Nuair a fhéachtar ar an nGaeltacht feictear go raibh ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta an Ghaeilge a cosaint agus a cothú nuair nach raibh an dea-thoil ann nó bunús reachtúil ann don nGaeilge, seachas í a bheith luaite sa Bhunreacht. An Ghaeltacht a thug an treoir agus an dea-shampla dúinn agus a theaspáin duinn gur féidir leis an nGaeilge a bheith mar ghnáth theanga labhartha agus cumarsáide. Gan an Ghaeltacht ní bheadh an cruthú sin ann. Tá sé tábhachtach, mar sin, go mbeadh an Ghaeltacht i gcónaí ann mar sampla. Dá mba rud é gur theip ar an nGaeltacht nó gur tháinig truailliú iomlán uirthi, níl aon amhras ach go mbeadh an cath caillte. Tá áthas orm go bhfuil an Ghaeltacht i gcroí lár an Bhille agus go bhfuil sé soiléir go bhfuilimid ag cabhrú leis an nGaeltacht i slí atá reachtúil agus praiticiúil ag an am gcéanna.</P>
    <P>Lasmuigh den nGaeltacht féin caithfear iarracht náisiúnta a dhéanamh chun taispeáint go bhfuil fáilte roimh an nGaeilge. Ní leor go dtiocfadh an t-iarracht seo ón Oireachtas nó ó na heagrais Gaeilge. Tá mé ag féachaint ar an Seanadóir Feargal Quinn, gur thug a comhlacht an sort dea-shampla a bhfuil mé ag caint faoi. Feictear an Ghaeilge á húsáid go nádúrtha i bhfógraí a comhlachta. Dá mba rud é go ndearna gach comhlacht agus gach grúpa a leithéid bheimís ar fad ag cabhrú le Gaelú na timpeallachta.</P>
    <P>Tá daoine ag rá go bhfuilimid idirnáisúnta anois agus nach bhfuil gá a thuilleadh le teanga <Col N="1785" /> náisiúnta dár gcuid féin. Níl sin fíor. Tá tíortha mar an Fhrainc agus an Ghearmáin ag tabhairt le fios nach mbeidh aon truailliú ar a dteangacha náisiúnta agus go bhfuiltear chun iad a chosaint, ní hamháin taobh istigh den tír féin ach go hidirnáisiúnta freisin.</P>
    <P>Tá na turasóirí a thagann isteach chun na tíre ag iarraidh rud as an ghnáth a dhéanamh. Níl an taithí a fhoghlaim siad sa bhaile ag teastáil uathu agus is breá leo fógraí Gaeilge a fheiceáil. Is minic a bhuailim le turasóir a iarrann orm cúpla focal Gaeilge a labhairt mar ba bhreá leis an teanga a chloisteáil. Cabhraíonn sin atmaisféar éagsúil a chur ar fáil do thurasóirí más rud é go bhfuil na comharthaí náisiúnta ar fad curtha ar leataobh. Cén difríocht a bheidh eadrainn agus achan tír eile? Má amharcann duine ar aon suirbhé atá déanta le fada ag Bord Fáilte nó gníomhaireachta eile, deir turasóirí i gcónaí go bhfuil taithí ag teastáil uathu ar an gcultúr sa tir seo. Tá an Ghaeilge mar pháirt den chultúr sin. Cabhraíonn an teanga ó thaobh eacnamaíochta.</P>
    <P>Caithfimid a bheith cinnte go mbeidh cumhacht sna treoirlínte a chuirfidh an Roinn amach. Ní chóir dúinn a bheith ag díriú ar an lowest common denominator. Caithfimid glacadh le gradam na Gaeilge faoi mar atá; má fhéachann duine ar aon suirbhé ar an Ghaeilge, deir 70% na dtuismitheoirí gur bhreá leo go mbeadh Gaeilge a mhúineadh ag na páistí scoile. Tá 30% na ndaoine a úsáideann an Ghaeilge ag baint úsáid asti achan lá. Tá figiúirí lucht féachúna agus éisteachta TG4 agus Raidió na Gaeltachta ag méadú. Toisc go bhfuil an timpeallacht á neartú ó thaobh na Gaeilge de, caithfimid bheith cinnte go mbeidh an obair reachtúil atá i gceist sna comhlachtaí poiblí láidir chomh maith, agus go bhfuil siad ag tabhairt aird ar an dul chun cinn atá déanta ag an Ghaeilge gan an cabhair sin agus gan an cumhacht reachtúil sin a bheith taobh thiar di.</P>
    <P>Agus sinn ag caint faoi airgead, deirtear sa Bhille go mbeadh a leithéid curtha ar fáil. Tagaim ar ais chuig an scéal nuair a cuireadh Teilifís na Gaeilge ar bun. Ní raibh tacaíocht ag a lán daoine maidir le bunadh Teilifís na Gaeilge toisc go gcosnódh sé méid áirithe airgid. Is rí-annamh a bhíonn an argóint sin le clos anois. Dá mbeadh an Rialtas agus an Roinn Airgeadais flaithiúil leis an Roinn Ealaíon, Oidhreachta, Gaeltachta agus Oileán, bheadh fíor-bheagán daoine ag gearán. Bheadh daoine ag gearán dá gcaillfaí no dá laghdófaí na seansanna atá sa Bhille in aon shlí.</P>
    <P>Tá áthas croí ormsa go bhfuil Aire Stáit óg, le fuinneamh agus neart inti, ag tabhairt na hoibre seo futhi. Bhí mé ag Fleadh Ceoil na hÉireann i Lios Tuathail anuraidh agus bhí 230,000 duine i láthair ansin, trí huaire níos mó ná an slua a bhí ag U2 an deireadh seactaine céanna. Bhí 10,000 ceoltóir óg ag seinm ag an bhfleadh sin agus aon áit go bhfuil suim sa cheol agus san oidhreacht, tá suim sa Ghaeilge. Tá an t-atmasféar torthúil ag an am seo.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1786" />Tá an Bille seo misniúil ach sé an rud is tábhachtaí ná go bhfuil sé praicticiúil. Bhí go leor tacaíocht béil ann le fada anuas maidir leis an teanga agus tá sé tábhachtach anois a thaispeáint go bhfuilimid dáirire, dóchasach agus misniúil agus go gcuirfimid an Bhille seo i bhfeidhm go hiomlán. Beidh na glúine ag gabháil buíochais leis an Aire Stáit, leis an Roinn agus leis an Oireachtas toisc gur thóg muid an seans chun Bille na dTeangacha Oifigiúla a chur i bhfeidhm.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Is breá an obair í an Bille seo agus is breá a chloisteáil go bhfuil daoine chun tacaíochta a thabhairt dó. Cuirim fáilte roimh aidhmeanna an Bhille. Thar an méid sin, amh, níl seans liathróide sneachta i gceartlár ifrinne ag an Bhille seo dul chun críocha. Tá deacrachtaí d'achan sórt ag baint leis.</P>
      <P>Dúirt an Seanadóir Ó Murchú go bhfuil an Ghaeltacht i gceartlár an Bhille. Ní fíor sin, níl ach tagairt amháin don Ghaeltacht ann. Dúirt an tAire Stáit go bhfuil sé mar aidhm ag an Roinn an Ghaeilge mar theanga shoisialta, fhisiciúl agus eacnamaíochta na Gaeltachta a chur chun cinn. Tacaím go mór leis an aidhm sin &ndash; is mór an trua nach bhfuil sé déanta cheanna féin &ndash; ach níl aon dhul chun cinn sa Bhille seo. An t-aon tagairt don Ghaeltacht sa Bhille ná go gcaithfidh comhlachtaí poiblí a chinntiú go bhfreastalófar ar aon riachtanas áirithe teanga a bhaineann le seirbhís a shólathar i limistéir Gaeltachta. Is breá an rud é sin ach conas is féidir é a dhéanamh? Conas is féidir leis na hollscoileanna seirbhís a chur ar fáil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta i gceartlár na Gaeltachta? Conas is féidir le bunscoil an Ghaeilge a chur ar fáil dóibh siúd atá ag freastal inti nuair nach bhfuil téacsanna inti? Is furasta a chur i gcló go gcaithfimid a chinntiú go mbeidh na téacsanna agus gach rud eile ann agus go mbeidh riachtanas ar na comhlachtaí ach ní bheidh na hacmhainní ann dóibh. Tá an reachtaíocht gan na hacmhainní. Sin an deacracht.</P>
      <P>Níl mé ag cur i gcoinne aidhmeanna an Bhille &ndash; tacaím go mór leo &ndash; ach is deacair gan bheith ciniciúil. Cúpla mí ó shin, sa Teach seo, bhí muid ag plé Bille dóibh siúd atá ag fulaingt de ghalair intinne. Sa Bhille bhí alt ann a bhain le daoine le galar intinne a chur in ospidéal i gcoinne a dtoil. Bhí an tAire Stáit sa Roinn Sláinte agus Leanaí ina shuí ansin agus ceanntar Gaeltachta in a dháilcheanntar féin. Chuir mé leasú an-bheag don Bhille síos. Sa Bhille bhí sé riachtanach go mbeadh tuiscint ar dhaoine a bhí á gcur i gcoinne a dtoil in ospidéal le galar intinne ar a gcearta agus go mbeadh sé riachtanach a gcearta a léamh dóibh. Tá a lán muintir Gaeltachta scioptha óna áit dúchais ag plé le dochtúirí agus ospidéal nua. Chuir mé leasú an-bheag amháin gur chóir go mbeadh an rogha acu a gcearta a bheith léite dóibh i nGaeilge ach ní raibh an Rialtas sásta aontú leis sin mar, dar leis an Aire Stáit, tá a lán dochtúirí ó áiteanna lasmuigh den tír seo gan focal Gaeilge. Cén fáth nach mbeadh duine ann chun aistriúcháin a dhéanamh?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1787" />Tá deá-thoil don teanga ach caithfimid a admháil nach bhfuil sa Bhille seo aidhmeanna deasa. Tá muid ag baint úsáid as an dteanga arís mar uirlis chanbhasála roimh toghchán. Níl mé ciniciúil fán teanga agus bheinn sásta tacaíocht a thabhairt d'aidhmeanna an Bhille ach níl seans dá laghad acu. Samhlaigh duine ag déanamh a chuid ghnó leis an Roinn Airgeadais, agus é ag iarraidh cúrsaí cánach a phlé. De réir an Bhille ba chóir go mbeadh sé nó sí in ann a chuid oibre a dhéanamh frid an Ghaeilge. Ní féidir sin a dhéanamh agus ni féidir an seirbhís sin a chur ar fáil. Ní féidir coinníolacha an Bhille seo a chur i bhfeidhm.</P>
    <P>Tá muid ag cur rud éigin ar son na Gaeilge os comhair na tíre agus beidh muid uilig in ann seasamh leis an Bhille seo ag rá go bhfuil beart déanta againn ar son na Gaeilge agus ansin dhul ar aghaidh le cúrsaí toghcháin. Ag féacháint ag na comhlachtaí poiblí i sceidil 1, ón Chrannchur Náisiúnta go dtí Aer Lingus, ní bheidh siad in ann na hathruithe atá sa Bhille a chur i bhfeidhm. Má cheapann aon duine tar éis reachtáil an Bhille seo go mbeidh na comhlachtaí Stáit sásta agus ábalta a gcuid seirbhísí a chur ar fáil tri Ghaeilge, deirim leis nach mbeidh.</P>
    <P>Cén fáth go bhfuil deacrachtaí ann agus cén sórt tús a ba cheart dúinn a dhéanamh? Dá mba rud é go raibh muid sásta aidhmeanna an Bhille a dhíriú ar na Gaeltachta agus tuiscint a bheith againn go bhfuil todhchaí na Gaeilge bunaithe sna Gaeltachta agus gur chóir dúinn gach seans a thabhairt dóibh a gcearta sibhialta a bheith acu. Mar shampla, ba chóir don leanbh sa Ghaeltacht a chuid oideachais chéad, dara agus triú leibhéal agus gach seirbhís eile a bheith ar fáil tri Ghaeilge. Bheadh tús mar sin maith. B'fhearr liom coischéim chun tosaigh mar sin, a thig linn a chur i bhfeidhm, a dhéanamh ná an méid atá againn seo.</P>
    <P>Chuir an Seanadóir Ó Murchú an cheist cén fáth go bhfuil leanaí ag fágáil na scoile gan cumas comhrá Gaeilge acu. Is ceist macánta sin a ba chóir dúinn a chur. Thosaigh muid ar chúrsa léinn nua Gaeilge anuraidh sna bunscoileanna. Bheartaigh muid á chur in ionad sna Gaeltachta i dtosach ar an 1 Meán Fomhair. Rinne muid gach iarracht seans a thabhairt do mhúinteoirí freastal ar chúrsaí chun gnéithe nua an chúrsa seo a bheith mínithe go mbeidís in ann á chur i bhfeidhm. Caidé a tharla? Ní raibh téacs ar fáil. Cuireadh freagracht ar mhúinteoirí sna Gaeltachta curriculum nua a mhúineadh gan téacs.</P>
    <P>D'fhéadfainn seasamh anseo go dtí meánoíche ag tabhairt samplaí ar na slite nach bhfuil tacaíocht ann do mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus go bhfuil i bhfad níos mó béime ar dhaoine lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht a mhealladh chun cúpla focal Gaeilge a fhoghlaim ná chun tacaíochta a thabhairt do mhuintir na Gaeltachta atá ag maireachtáil trid an teanga lá i ndiaidh lae gan aon cabhair ón Stát. Cén fáth go raibh níos mó tacaíochta ann do ghaelscoil taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht ná mar a bhí ag gnáthscoil sa Ghaeltacht go dtí an bhliain seo? Cén fáth go bhfuil a lán leanaí ag <Col N="1788" /> freastal i scoileanna Gaeltachta tagtha isteach mar thoradh ar imirce? Tá seans ann gur rugadh i Sasana nó sa Spáinn iad ach phill a dtuismitheoirí go hÉirinn gan focal Gaeilge. Samhlaigh na múinteoirí ag iarraidh Gaeilge a chur chun cinn sna scoileanna sin. Níl Gaeilge ón gcliabhán ag leath na leanaí ag teacht isteach chuig scoileanna Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Ba bhreá dá mba rud é go raibh an Ghaeltacht i lár an Bhille ach níl. Tá muintir na Gaeltachta i gcónaí fágtha ar lár. Bím go minic i ngleic leis na heagrais Gaeilge agus cuirim an cheist orthu, dá mba rud é gur éirigh linn an teanga a athbheochain agus go raibh gach aon duine ar an oileán ag labhairt Gaeilge, an mbéadh aon suim ag na heagrais Gaeilge i mhuintir na Gaeltachta? Cuireann sé isteach ormsa nach bhfuil a gcearta sibhialta á fháil ag muintir na Gaeltachta. Tá brú orthu an teanga a chosaint. Tá an Ghaeilge i gceartlár a saol lá i ndiaidh lae agus tá siad sásta aon rud atá a teastáil a dhéanamh ar a son, ach níl an seans á fháil acu. Níl gnáth rudaí ar nós bóithre, infrastructúr, fostaíocht, ospidéil, ollscoileanna, scoileanna agus téacsleabhair ar fáil dóibh.</P>
    <P>De réir an Bhille, caithfidh gach comhlacht poiblí cinntiú go bhfreastalófar ar riachtanais áirithe teanga, et cetera. Is mór an trua nach dtarlóidh sé sin. Tá caiteachas dúbalta, nach mór, san mBille ach ní chreidim gur féidir dul chun cinn, de réir an Bhille, a chur i bhfeidhm.</P>
    <P>Tá altanna 8, 9 agus 10 i gcroí-lár an Bhille, agus go mórmhór alt 10, ina ndeirtear:</P>
    <P>Cinnteoidh comhlacht poiblí go mbeidh gach ceann de na teangacha oifigiúla ar aon stáiseanóireacht a úsáideann sé agus ar aon chomharthaí nó fógráin dá chuid, de réir aon scéime atá i bhfeidhm i ndáil leis an gcomhlacht sin.</P>
    <P>Tá a fhios againn cad a tharlóidh. Bí cinnte go n-úsáidfear cúpla focal Gaeilge ar chlár teilifíse an chrannchuir náisiúnta agus sin an méid. Is deacair gan a bheith ciniciúil faoi rudaí mar sin. Nach mbéadh sé i bhfad níos fearr achmhainní a dhíriú ar na Gaeltachtaí, an teanga a fhorbairt ó na Gaeltachtaí amach agus tacaíocht, gan amhras, a thabhairt do dhreamanna lasmuigh de na Gaeltachtaí, na gaelscoileanna mar shampla, atá ag iarraidh an teanga a chur chun cinn. Ba bhreá an rud é sin a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>The Bill attempts to make every State company, a chuid oibre a dhéanamh agus seirbhísí a chur ar fáil tré Ghaeilge at a time nuair nach bhfuil siad in ann iad a chur ar fáil tré Bhéarla. Ní féidir é sin a dhéanamh. Is breá iad na haidhmeanna atá sa Bhille agus is breá an obair atá déanta ag an Roinn ach ní féidir é seo a thabhairt chun críche. We should start small agus dul chun cinn mar sin.</P>

      <P>Chuir an méid a bhí le rá ag an tSeanadóir O'Toole an-droch mhisneach orm. Cheapfaí go rabhamar ar ais i lár chaogaidí na haoise seo caite. Labhair sé faoin mbéal bocht agus an nGaeltacht in aon ghuth. An rud is mó a thugann dóchas domsa go bhfuil deireadh curtha <Col N="1789" /> go deo leis an gceangal a bhíodh ann fadó idir an Ghaeilge agus an béal bocht. Tá deireadh curtha leis an dearcadh sin agus tá sé imithe uainn anois.</P>
      <P>Nuair a bhí mé féin ag fás anuas bhí an-bhaint idir an Ghaeilge ar thaobh amháin agus an bochtanas agus an imirce ar an dtaobh eile. Ní raibh aon spreagadh ag daoine a bheadh ag dul go Meiriceá no go cathracha na Breataine an Ghaeilge a fhoghlaim nó a choiméad beo. Cén úsáid a bhainfí as an nGaeilge agus an imirce rompu chun slí bheatha a bhaint amach. Ach a mhalairt ata fíor anois. Níl líon na ndaoine óga ag fágáil na tíre a thuilleadh. Tá deis acu fostaíocht a fháil agus clanna a thógáil sa bhaile. Tá spreagadh i bhfad níos mó acu siúd an Ghaeilge a choimeád beo, agus is fiú leithéid a dhéanamh nuair atá siad chun maireachtaíl ina dtír féin. Tá an-athrú tagtha ar an saol ón am a raibh an Seanadóir ag trácht air. Ní féidir liom a thuilleadh a rá mar níl an líofacht cainte agam chun deireadh go deo a chur leis an tSeanadóir O'Toole.</P>
      <P>Fáiltím roimh an Aire Stáit go dtí an Teach agus cuirim fáilte ar leith roimh an mBille. Bille é seo a raibh éileamh air le blianta fada anuas agus a raibh muintir na Gaeltachta agus lucht cothú na Gaeilge á lorg le blianta. Seo an saghas reachtaíochta a bhí ag teastáil agus an saghas reachtaíochta a bhfuil gá leis agus gur féidir a chur i bhfeidhm amach anseo. Dá bharr san, cuirim fíorchaoin fáilte roimh an mBille, más maith is mithid. Is mór an chéim ar aghaidh an Bille seo.</P>
      <P>Tá athrú mórchorrálach tagtha ar dhearcadh na ndaoine i leith na Gaeilge le blianta anuas. Níl an brú céanna ar na scoileanna chun an Ghaeilge a mhúineadh. Níl an éigeanntacht ann a thuilleadh. Tá difríocht an-mhór idir an dearcadh atá ag muinteoirí Gaeilge agus ins na téacsleabhair i leith múineadh na Gaeilge agus a bhíodh ann tráth. Tá líon mór páistí ag freastail ar na Gaelscoileanna anois agus is breá leo an Ghaeilge agus baineann siad taitneamh aisti. Is brea leo agus is cúis mórtais dóibh go bhfuil cumas orthu rud a rá sa dá theanga. Is mór an t-athrú atá tar éis teacht ar stádas na Gaeilge agus ar mhúineadh na Gaeilge sa chóras oideachais.</P>
      <P>Tá breis agus 150 Gaelscoil sa tír faoi láthair agus fás agus borradh ag teacht ar líon na scoileanna sin. Léiríonn seo dearcadh na dtuismitheoirí i leith oideachais tré Ghaeilge agus léiríonn sé chomh maith an taitneamh agus tairfe a bhaineann leanaí as bun-oideachas a fháil tré Ghaeilge. Tá dearcadh an-dhearfa ag na páistí seo agus ag a dtuismitheoirí. Níl an sean-diúltachas ann. Tá módhanna nua ann chun teanga a mhúineadh agus a fhoghlaim. Déanann an nua-teicneolaíocht an-difríocht do dhaoine agus iad ag foghlaim teanga nua. Tá tuiscint i bhfad níos fearr ag muinteoirí na linne seo ar conas a fheidhmíonn meoin an duine, maidir le teanga a fhoghlaim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tugann líon na ndaoine fásta atá ag freastail ar chúrsaí Gaeilge iontaobh dom. Nuair a chuirtear san áireamh an méid duine agus baint acu le hIonad na Gaeilge Labhartha i gColáiste na hOllscoile i gCorcaigh, in aon bhliain amháin bíonn breis agus 2,000 duine &ndash; ag freastal ar ran<Col N="1790" /> ganna, ar dhíospóireachta, ar an Idirlíne frid an Ghaeilge. Daoine fásta formhór acu. Tá an dearcadh sin ar an bhfoghlaim anois, ní amháin ag foghlaim teanga ach ag foghlaim ábhar eile chomh maith. San am fána labhair an Seanadóir Ó Tuathail, pé foghlaim a rinneadh, rinneadh ar scoil é agus nuair a fágadh an scoil, fágadh an fhoghlaim. Ní hé sin an dearcadh anois. Bíonn an-chuid daoine ag foghlaim le blianta &ndash; life long learning. Tá daoine ag teacht ar ais go dtí an córas oideachais agus iad meánaosta nó níos sine, agus a lán acu ag foghlaim na Gaeilge. Mar gheall ar an teicneolaíocht agus an tuiscint atá againn ar fhoghlaim theanga, tá sé i bhfad níos fusa ar dhaoine cumas cainte a bhaint amach i dtrí nó i gceithre teanga. Sin é an t-atmasféar.</P>
    <P>Rinne Seanadóir Manning trácht ar an stádas a tugadh don Ghaeilge sa Bhunreacht. Dúirt sé gur mór an trua nach raibh reachtaíocht cosúil leis seo ann ag an am chun an dá rud a chothú ag an am céanna. Ní ghlacaim leis sin. Tá difrócht idir an dearcadh atá ann don Ghaeilge anois agus a bhí ann 50 bliain ó shin. Tá an t-am ceart anois leis an reachtaíocht seo. It will be much easier for this Bill to fulfil its objectives because of the attitude towards and atmosphere surrounding the Irish language. Modern language learning technology makes it easier to achieve the objectives of the Bill now than at any time since the foundation of the State.</P>
    <P>Tá an t-atmasféar difriúil anois. Tá béim ar an cheol agus tá meas againn air nach raibh againn riamh. Tá meas ag an aos óg ar an cheol Ghaelach. Ní amháin go bhfuil seancheol traidisiúnta ann, tá ceol nua a chumadh ag cumadoirí agus tá seancheol a eagrú, mar a rinne Seán Ó Riada, ag Micheál Ó Súilleabháin. Tá grúpaí ag léiriú ceoil Ghaelach agus is iontach an difríocht a dhéanann sin do dhearcadh na ndaoine i leith gach rud Gaelach.</P>
    <P>Is iontach fosta an dul chun cinn atá déanta ag Raidió na Gaeltachta. Tugann sé taitneamh domsa go háirithe. Tá sé deacair an Ghaeilge a choimhéad beo nuair nach mbíonn deis á húsáid gach lá ach bainim an-taitneamh agus mé i mo ghluaisteán le Raidió na Gaeltachta ar an raidió. Tá an-dhul chun cinn déanta leis an raidió agus le TG4.</P>
    <P>Sna nuachtáin, áfach, cosúil le <i>The Irish Times</i>, is beag Gaeilge a bhíonns ann a bheadh ar ár gcumas a léamh lá i ndiaidh lae. Tá <i>Foinse</i> agus foilseacháin eile ann chomh maith ach sna gnáthnuachtáin is beag Gaeilge atá ar fáil le léamh. Is trua sin mar ní amháin gur gá á clos, is gá a fheiceáil fosta. Is maith liom an Ghaeilge líofa a chuireann Pól Ó Muirí agus Liam Ó Muirthile os ár gcomhair i <i>The Irish Times</i>, agus molaim an nuachtán dá bharr, ach tá súil agam, nuair a bheidh an reachtaíocht seo i bhfeidhm, go mbeidh níos mó le feiceáil.</P>
    <P>Tá an-chuid Ghaeilge le feiceáil i ngnáthobair an lae. Nuair a théann duine isteach i siopaí an tSeanadóra Quinn, tá stádas tugtha d'fhógraí as Gaeilge. Téann sin i bhfeidhm ar mheon na ndaoine mar feiceann siad cé chomh nadúrtha agus atá <Col N="1791" /> sí. Léiríonn sé go bhfuil meas ag Superquinn ar an Ghaeilge, ar mhuintir na tíre agus ar a gcumas dealáil leis an dá theanga.</P>
    <P>Nuair a bhí daoine ag iarraidh an Ghaeilge a bhrú fadó &ndash; an teanga a bheith ag duine go beacht agus gan aon Béarla &ndash; bhí sin frith-thorthiúil. Theip air sin. Tá dearcach dátheangach ann anois agus sin an fáth nach gceart idirdheighilt a dhéanamh idir an Ghaeltacht agus an Ghalltacht. Is fíor gurbh í an Ghaeltacht tobar na Gaeilge ach muna mbíonn an Ghaeilge scaipthe ar fud na tíre, ní fiú an Ghaeltacht bheith ann. Téann an Ghaeltacht agus a teanga i bhfeidhm ar muintir na tíre.</P>
    <P>Ní bheidh mé anseo leis an reachtaíocht seo a chur frid an Teach seo ach tá áthas orm go raibh mé anseo don chéad chéim mar is maith an reachtaíocht é. Beidh bród ar an-chuid de mhuintir na tíre an Ghaeilge a chothú sa tslí céanna agus atá siad ag cothú an cheoil, na filíochta agus litríochta. Beidh bród ar a lán daoine deis níos fearr a bheith acu chun pé Gaeilge atá acu a labhairt. Spreagfaidh an reachtaíocht seo daoine an Ghaeilge a bhí acu fadó a labhairt arís. Tá níos mó Gaeilge ag an ghnáthdhuine ná a úsáidtear ach níl aon spreagadh ann á labhairt ach beidh nuair a chuirfear an reachtaíocht seo i bhfeidhm.</P>
    <P>Tá súil agam go seolfar an Bille seo frid an chéad Dáil eile gan mhoill. Tá suim ag an Aire Stáit sa reachtaíocht agus sa Ghaeilge. Is ambasadóir maith í don Ghaeilge. Bean óg í an t-Aire Stáit gur féidir léi a hobair phroifisiúnta a dhéanamh tré Ghaeilge. Is dea-shampla é sin do dhaoine ógá eile. Tugann sí an-mhisneach dom go bhfuil sí i bhfeighil an Bhille seo. Molaim í as ucht an mBille seo a thabhairt os comhair an tSeanaid. Tá súil agam go mbeidh dea-thoradh ar obair an lae inniu.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom fáilte a thabhairt don Aire Stáit. Tá suim mhór agam sa teanga agus tá brón orm nach féidir liom labhairt i nGaeilge amháin inniu.</P>
      <P>Is cuimhin liom seanfhocal a d'fhoghlaim mé ar scoil: &ldquo;Éist le fuaim na habhann agus gheobhaidh tú bradán; listen to the sound of the river and you will catch a salmon.&rdquo; I have listened to people in the marketplace and know that there is immense goodwill towards the Irish language. In recent years attitudes towards it have changed. In my company it is used a lot. When the idea was first introduced, I was impressed by the enthusiasm shown for it. Using Irish is also good for business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In principle, I support the thinking behind the Bill for the same reason I supported the establishment of TG4. We all want to see a situation where the Irish language is perceived as acceptable, interesting and fun. If a language is to be more than a museum piece, it must be possible for people to carry out the main activities in their lives through that medium. Given the standing of the Irish language in the Constitution, it is logical that people should be able to conduct their business with the State through the national language. However, I cannot support the Bill. The legis<Col N="1792" /> lation is right, but the timing is wrong. Everybody who has spoken wants to see Irish becoming a widely spoken language, but the Bill does not represent good value for money. In recent months we have heard many sermons to the effect that public spending is in danger of running out of control. In the current economic climate the aim should be to reduce costs, not increase them. The Bill will bring about an unnecessary increase in costs.</P>
    <P>Last night I visited the Northern Ireland Assembly where all speeches are translated into three languages: Irish, English and Scots Gaelic. It is good to see such enthusiasm for our various native languages and several translators were on hand. Nevertheless, the implementation of the Bill will have enormous implications for the cost structure of all public bodies. It will add a new layer of expense to the provision of every public service. In addition, sections 21 to 24 indicate that it will bring about the creation of a language police. At this stage in Ireland's economic development we need this Bill like a hole in the head. Regrettably, the majority of our citizens are not competent to conduct their business as Gaeilge. If everybody could speak Irish, there would be no costs involved in the implementation of the Bill. In fact, there would be no need for it. The reality is very different.</P>
    <P>In order to make public services more widely available as Gaeilge, fluency in Irish would have to become a basic entry requirement for all public service jobs. When this approach was tried in the past, it was a dismal failure. It led to a culture in which candidates were selected and promoted on the basis of something that had nothing to do with how well they performed in their job. If such an approach failed at a time of high unemployment, it has no chance of succeeding during a period of almost full employment. It will not work at a time when public service pay rates compare unfavourably with those in the private sector. Beggars cannot be choosers and in the current jobs climate the State is the beggar.</P>
    <P>To implement the Bill successfully each public body will have to recruit and maintain a core of staff to service the small number who choose to conduct their business in Irish. I do not deny their constitutional right to demand this service, but economic constraints require that legislation such as this can only be put in place when resources become available. These are words I thought would never pass my lips, but I am using them today. We simply cannot afford this measure. Any Government which claims otherwise is not living in the real world.</P>
    <P>Outside of a small group of enthusiasts, there is no public demand for the Bill. By introducing this legislation at this time the Government is seeking to pander to it. As the Government is aware that this legislation will not pass during its lifetime, it is only paying lip service to those who want it. There will be a public outcry when people hear that, instead of improving the health service, <Col N="1793" /> the Government proposes to spend money on making services available in Irish.</P>
    <P>The economic climate has changed. The days when we could afford to do anything we wanted are over. We can no longer afford luxuries such as this. If we want to make it possible for some to do their business in Irish, something else will have to give. There is something the Government should do for the Irish language, but this Bill is not it.</P>
    <P>The real task at hand has been avoided by successive Governments. Given that our young people learn Irish from the first day they start school, why can so few people speak it? Why do so few adults wish to speak Irish in their daily lives? </P>
    <P>All of my five children attended the Gaeltacht and a number of them attended Coláiste na Rinne. They emerged from both with an enthusiasm for the language and loved nothing better than to meet their friends and converse in Irish. They do not speak Irish now, however, though a number of them have become fluent in French and Spanish. How did we fail our children and what must we do to succeed in engendering in them a love for the language?</P>
    <P>If we have to invest money, enthusiasm, commitment or effort, I would prefer if these were invested elsewhere. There is a massive State apparatus devoted to the teaching of Irish. In spite of that apparatus, however, the vast majority of young people do not learn the language effectively.</P>
    <P>I am impressed by what TG4, the establishment of which I supported, has achieved. The station, which was originally Teilifís na Gaeilge, has employed modern marketing methods and uses subtitles in such a way that it makes it easy to watch the programmes shown. In my opinion we can generate enthusiasm for the language, but we must consider how this can be done in both management and marketing terms. I do not believe the Bill is the mechanism to generate that enthusiasm. It is in danger of being seen as pandering to a demand which is, in constitutional terms, understandable, but it will give rise to huge costs and it will not achieve what we are setting out to achieve.</P>
    <P>A large number of young people leaving school do so not just with a lack of enthusiasm for but also with a negative attitude to the language. It must be possible to overcome this difficulty, which has been overcome in other countries and, it must be said, in this jurisdiction in other ways. Given that if one spends money on one thing, one cannot spend it on something else, in my opinion the time and resources we devote to forcing Irish down the throats of young people could be better spent in other areas to prepare them better for the highly demanding world they will enter into when they become adults.</P>
    <P>The current system of teaching Irish has failed utterly and miserably to engage the majority of the population. Why is that? Why have we failed so badly? It is not that Irish is a particularly diffi<Col N="1794" /> cult language to learn and it is certainly not that we have failed to devote enough time or resources to the teaching of Irish. There must be some other reason for this monumental failure to achieve the objectives we set down for ourselves but which we have not reached. If we genuinely have the interests of the Irish language at heart &ndash; I believe the House has shown today that this is the case &ndash; we should be asking questions such as those I have posed and we should pursue the answers, regardless of where they lead us. How can we achieve our objectives? How can we obtain the best value for money? How can we ensure that we will achieve what we are setting out to do?</P>
    <P>I do not believe we will serve the Irish language well by trying to install another level of compulsion in the form of establishing a language police. I urge the Minister of State to return this Bill to the shelf until such time as more pressing problems in regard to the language have been dealt with and until the emergence of new bright enthusiastic ideas about how we can achieve what we are setting out to do.</P>

      <P>Fáiltím roimh an Aire Stáit agus cuirim fáilte mhór roimh an mBille seo, a raibh lucht na Gaeilge ag tnúth go mór leis le tamall anuas. Fáiltím roimh an gcóras scéime atá molta san mBille. Níl aon amhras ach gurb é seo an bealach is fearr chun seirbhísí tré Ghaeilge a chur ar fáil agus a fheabhsú sa Stát chóras.  </P>
      <P>Senator Quinn's contribution has certainly given us much food for thought, particularly in terms of his attitude towards the Bill. Molaim go mór an t-Aire Stáit, an t-iar Aire Stáit, Éamon Ó Cuív, agus an Rialtas as ucht an obair atá déanta chun an Bille a thabhairt chomh fada seo.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. A number of questions have been posed which must be addressed. Like Senator Quinn, I have the privilege of serving on the Forum on Europe. Also like the Senator, though in a different context, I have had the great privilege, as a Member of this House, to be able to travel widely within Europe during the time I have been here. In recent years, because of the enlargement process which Europe is undergoing, I have had an opportunity to visit many of the applicant countries. One of the things that struck me about the applicant countries, particularly those which were formerly part of the Soviet system, is the great love their people have for their culture and their language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the House will be aware, Soviet domination was somewhat similar to the domination experienced in this country. It was not just a physical domination, it was also cultural in nature. In this country, this domination literally wiped out the Irish language. Fortunately, that did not happen to the same extreme in, for example, the Baltic states and in some of the countries, such as Slovenia, which made up the former Yugoslavia. I single out those states because they are quite small. Slovenia has a population of 1.8 million, that of Estonia is approximately the same, while the <Col N="1795" /> population of Lithuania is approximately 1.5 million. Once these states gained their independence, they set about attempting to resurrect their native languages and they enshrined laws in their constitutions and legislative frameworks to ensure that those languages were given precedence. This is not surprising and it is perfectly acceptable.</P>
    <P>These applicant countries are about to enter a community of nations in an enlarged European Union where they will be, like Ireland, relatively small in economic and military terms. However, the passion with which they have approached the retention of their identities in a wider Europe must be admired. I suggest to Senator Quinn, who, I presume, is also reflecting a wider view from outside the House, that we should also consider that the legislation before us is as much about establishing a place for our language as it is about dealing with the practical difficulties to which he referred.</P>
    <P>The Bill is concerned with enhancing the separateness of our nation within the commonality of Europe. It is stated in the Title that it is &ldquo;An Act to promote respect for Irish and English as the official languages of the State.&rdquo; I have no doubt whatsoever that much of what Senator Quinn said is true. I do not doubt that there are children emerging from the education system who have an antipathy towards the language. My children, who are aged between ten and 14, have a difficulty in learning the language whereas they have no such difficulty in learning other subjects. I have no doubt that there is a need to inject a more modern approach to the teaching of the Irish language. I understand this is being done in any event, but there is a need to accelerate the process.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, the introduction of TG4 and, before that, Raidió na Gaeltachta was an attempt by the State to inculcate Irish into the mainstream of life in this country in order that it would not be elitist or set aside in a separate category but that it would become part of who we are. TG4 uses the slogan &ldquo;Súil Eile&rdquo; or &ldquo;Another View&rdquo;. In other words, the station is not saying that it is separate or outside of society but that it offers another view of who and what we are and how we present ourselves to the world.</P>
    <P>I have real difficulty in agreeing with the conclusions reached by Senator Quinn. I am not singling him out <i>per se</i> because I know he thinks deeply about matters he raises in the House and I do not disagree with him in terms of his philosophy, particularly as I am aware of the experience he brings to bear on what he says. The Senator referred to his children and stated that they attended the Gaeltacht and developed an enthusiasm for the language but that, sadly, they no longer speak Irish and have become fluent in other languages.</P>
    <P>During a discussion with people involved in the language freedom movement debate 25 or 30 years ago I discovered something which now seems to be self-evident. The argument put for<Col N="1796" /> ward against the freedom movement, which was something of a misnomer because we all felt imprisoned in the language, was that the acquisition of a second language, even if it was confined to the rudimentary structures of Irish, was an advantage in terms of learning continental languages. Even if one is not competent in the language, the mechanism by which one exposes one's thinking processes to another language unlocks one's mind to the possibility of learning, for example, French, German or Italian.</P>
    <P>While the Senator is ahead of me on this, I also actively encourage my children to go to the Gaeltacht. My son Andrew pointedly refuses to go, despite knowing nothing about what lies in store. This has led to internal family negotiations, with which most families will be familiar, which would do justice to the peace process, the aim of which is to encourage him to go to the Gaeltacht for a few weeks. Once it was pointed out to my eldest daughter that a number of her friends could go with her to the Gaeltacht and it is not a prison camp, she became very happy about the idea. It will do no harm to plug the language school she will attend, Coláiste na bhFiann, one of the best we have checked.</P>
    <P>I fully understand everything that has been said about the legislation and the public reaction from people who are perhaps, like myself, of this country and its culture and proud to be Irish, but somehow feel outside the language. I confess that I have some empathy with the nuance of Senator Quinn's comments in that I would love to be able to speak the Irish language as fluently as I speak English. I have to get my Irish language contributions to debates written for me because I am not sufficiently competent to do it myself. I thank the people who do it, but as they would be embarrassed if I named them, I will not do so. I am able to say a cúpla focal but when it comes to a coherent contribution &ndash; I am not suggesting that all my contributions in English are coherent &ndash; I would not be competent, which pains me.</P>
    <P>Like my colleagues, Senators Bonner and Ó Murchú, I am a member of the Committee on Heritage and the Irish language. I compliment Senator Ó Murchú on his speech. Like myself, he is also a spokesperson on this matter. All the other members of the committee can speak and understand Irish. Time and again, when contributions and submissions are made by outside parties, which occurs frequently, I find myself with no translation facilities in the brand new state-of-the-art committee rooms in the new wing of the House. As lowly Senators we cast envious eyes at the splendour in which our Dáil colleagues are accommodated. The new wing, a splendid architectural achievement, was opened 18 months ago. Its committee rooms are first class, yet there are no translation facilities. Despite repeated representations by the distinguished chairman of our committee, Deputy Donal Carey, since we first moved into the new building, nothing has been done.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1797" />Senator Manning referred to a former distinguished Member of the House, Senator Pól Ó Foighil, and the way in which, in his own inimitable manner, he focused the attention of the House on the Irish language by raising its lack of translation facilities and many other elements which impacted on his preference to speak Irish as a first language. He got some things done.</P>
    <P>I also remember that when he was a Member of this House the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Ó Cuív, could not get an Irish language secretary and had to write all his correspondence by hand. This occurred in the past decade. Now I, as one of a dozen or 14 members of a committee which deals, to a significant degree, with Irish language matters, do not have translation facilities available to me and must try to muddle my way through.</P>
    <P>While I do not want to labour the point, I wish to articulate my sense of frustration in the context of Senator Quinn's comments. I do not agree with his fundamental position that this is a bad Bill which has been introduced at the wrong time. It is a good Bill and there has never been a bad time to introduce it. The former Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy Ó Cuív, may have initiated the legislative process, but the current Minister of State, Deputy Coughlan, fought to get the Bill through the parliamentary draughtsman and Cabinet and into the House in a manner akin to a mountaineer climbing the highest peak in County Donegal. It is a compliment to her that she has got it this far. I am also aware that representatives of the Irish language movement have applauded her for the efforts she has made on their behalf.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to take on board a point raised at the Forum on Europe which, while it does not directly relate to the Bill, is linked to its implications for wider society. Irish does not have official language status at European Union level. Up to a dozen states, many of which I mentioned earlier, will join the EU in the next five years. They include the small Baltic states and some of the eastern European states. They will insist that their language is given the same respect and importance as the other languages in the European Union. We missed the opportunity to ensure Irish was given this status when we acceded to the European Economic Community in 1973. Perhaps it was not considered to be the thing to do at that time but, irrespective of the reason, the reality is that 30 years afterwards, Irish, the language of a leading member state, does not enjoy the respect it deserves. I ask the Minister of State to use whatever representations are available to her, either in her current ministerial guise or in any future role she will have in Government, to raise this matter. While I am aware that I am preaching to the converted, it is important to emphasise that this legislation, which I hope will be passed by the next Administration, enshrines Irish. We should not be ashamed of it or make excuses for it being treated <Col N="1798" /> as a second class language in the European Union.</P>

      <P>Níl mé ábalta caint as Gaeilge anois ach fadó, fadó bhí fáinne agam. Like everybody else, I learnt Irish a long time ago. I sympathise with Senator Manning's comment that it was taught repressively when we were at school. I always remember asking my Irish teacher in Alexandra College, Miss Golden, if there were not any funny stories in Irish because they all seemed to be sad. Eventually she found one about a man who drowned in his poitín still, which is not an hysterically funny story when one thinks about it, but the funniest she could come up with. It is sad that for so long learning Irish was made such a misery for so many of us at school to the extent that many people, including Senators Manning, Mooney and myself, could not now hold a conversation in Irish, despite having attained quite a proficiency in it.</P>
      <P>The inhabitants of the Gaeltacht are very nice and intelligent people. When one asks for a &ldquo;buidéal beag of shampoo&rdquo; they will provide it, which is very encouraging. It has been very good to listen to the excellent Irish speakers here today being so sympathetic to those of us who have lost fluency in the language. It is a big start because Irish had become extraordinarily exclusive with some people.</P>
      <P>Senator Ó Murchú referred to people having lost the confidence to speak in Irish as opposed to not being able to speak it. There was a time when people, who were not as intelligent as the people from the Gaeltacht and did not speak Irish properly, were give as bad a reception as the Parisians gave people about speaking French. The Parisians were told to be more civil to foreigners because they were damaging the city's business. It would be a good idea if those who spoke Irish were more friendly to those who try to speak it.</P>
      <P>We must take seriously what Senator Quinn said. Senator Quinn's supermarket was one of the first places I remember seeing signs for food in Irish. It is not that he is unenthusiastic about the language. He feels it is a good idea to promote it. It is useful to know what biscuits and pet food are as Gaeilge in case one is in the Gaeltacht and wishes to buy pet food or a few packets of biscuits.</P>
      <P>Everyone praised TG4, which is correct. I notice the Bill requires the permission of the Minister for Finance. He always gets in on every act. It is like a dead weight around the neck of everything. Even with the Minister of State's great enthusiasm, I do not know how rapidly she will be able to make progress. As regards advertising for TG4, the newspapers and magazines which list the television programmes should be obliged to properly explain TG4 programmes, such as &ldquo;Súil Eile&rdquo;, which Senator Mooney mentioned. If one does not know what &ldquo;Súil Eile&rdquo; is about, one might not watch it. One might watch &ldquo;Inspector Morse&rdquo; or something else, although &ldquo;Súil Eile&rdquo; might be more interesting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1799" />TG4 has been generous in putting subtitles on everything. &ldquo;Súil Eile&rdquo; does not have subtitles and I have got lost in fights between Eithne Fitzgerald and Deputy Dukes. &ldquo;Mná na hÉireann&rdquo; always has subtitles. A friend from Cork, Dr. Siobhán Barry, was on it one night. When I met her afterwards I told her she was great on the programme, but I asked her why TG4 had not given her subtitles. I understood her Irish better than I would understand the language of those who come from Donegal. Something must be getting through if one does not notice it some of the time. I am sure the Minister of State saw those excellent programmes on which people spoke frankly. I enjoy them.</P>
    <P>It is unfair the way TG4 programmes are listed at the end of newspaper and magazine pages and that only the times and the barest information about the programmes are given. They should be obliged to give more information. It has become more popular to state what will be in programmes. It is extremely funny to watch Spanish football with an Irish commentary. That is one of the best things I have seen. However, it is usually too fast for me to keep up with it.</P>

      <P>TG4 needs to be given as much space as it can because it has done an excellent job. It has put much thought into what it does.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I could help Senator Mooney to get his son into the Gaeltacht. My sons went to the Gaeltacht and there is more to it than Gaeilge. The boys could not be stopped from going to it. I am not sure what was going on there, but they were extremely enthusiastic about going back to Corca Dhuibhne. I do not know if any of them emerged from school with some Irish language, but they enjoyed other things.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State should take note of what Senator Quinn said because it will be expensive. I thought Senator Manning was daring when he suggested that all Bills should be in English and Irish. I could see us being here for the rest of our lives going through them phrase by phrase to ensure the phrase in Irish is comparable to that in English. We must remember the Irish phraseology will always be taken as the first and superior language.</P>
      <P>I wish the Minister of State luck with the Bill. I am sorry it has come into the House late in the day because it would have been enjoyable to have gone through it with the Minister of State. We might have picked up a bit of information. The Minister of State was rightly described as a great ambassador for the language. We could not have anyone better than her to promote it.</P>

Bhí an méid a bhí le rá ag an Seanadóir Ó <Col N="1800" /> Tuathail dochreidte ó fhear a bhí ina mhúinteoir scoile. Tá sé ag rá go mbraitheann seo uilig ar chostas agus ar airgead. Ní sin an dóigh cheart amharc ar an Bhille seo. Níl anseo ach tús, agus mar a deirtear, tús maith leath na hoibre.</P>
      <P>Dúirt an Seanadóir Ó Tuathail gur uirlis canbhasála é an Bille. Ní aontaím leis sin mar is fada an lá ó bhí an t-Aire Stáit Ó Cuív ag chruinniú den chomhchoiste a dealann le cúrsaí teanga. Gheall sé ag an am sin, trí bhliain ó shin, go raibh an Bille le theacht. Caidé mar a ghlac an tAire Stáit an Bille isteach anseo ag iarraidh é a úsáid mar uirlis canbhasála? Tá suíochán docht aici agus i ndiaidh an toghcháin, beidh sí isteach anseo arís.

Anois beidh reachtaíocht againn. An cúspóir taobh thiar den Bhille ná comhionnanas a chothú idir an Ghaeilge agus an Béarla mar theangacha oifigiúla an Stáit, go háirithe leosan atá ag iarraidh an dhá theanga a úsáid.

Tá oifig nua bunaithe sa Chlochán Liath ina mbeidh foireann ag dul isteach ann i dtrí mí. Tá daoine ann san fhoireann agus níl a chuid Ghaeilge chomh líofa agus atá ag daoine eile. Tá siad ag freastal ar ranganna Gaeilge agus beidh siad in ann an teanga a úsáid nuair a thiocfaidh na daoine as ceanntracha Gaeltachta isteach chun a chuid ghnó a dhéanamh.</P>

Is as baile lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht é ach tá an-fhuinneamh aige agus tá sé ag tabhairt tacaíochta do choiste Ghaeilge an chomhairle chontae dhul ar aghaidh. Nuair a bheas an Bille seo isteach agus an oifig sin oscailte, beidh lucht na Gaeltachta ábalta dhul isteach ann agus feidhm a bhaint as a gcuid Ghaeilge. Osclófar oifig choimisinéara teanga nua agus beidh rannóg nua i Roinn Ealaíon, Oidhreachta, Gaeltachta agus Oileán a dhealfaidh leis na cúrsaí seo. Beidh a lán rudaí ar fáil as Gaeilge nach bhfuil faoi láthair, fiú ceadúnais tiomána agus a leithéid. Beidh stáiseanóireacht uilig i Ranna Stáit ar fáil frid an Ghaeilge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Molaim go dtabharfar seans don Ghaeilge san Oireachtas agus go mbeidh Billí uilig sa dhá theanga. Tá a lán Baill Seanaid báúil don Ghaeilge ach níl deis acu Gaeilge a fhoghlaim. Dá mbeadh ranganna ar fáil bheadh i bhfad níos mó daoine sa Teach seo sásta Gaeilge a labhairt. Tógadh mé féin i mbaile ar imeall na Gaeltachta. Nuair a bhí mé ag an bhunscoil, bhí Gaeilge <Col N="1801" /> bhreá ag na múinteoirí agus labhair mo mháthair agus m'athair í liom ach ní hí an Ghaeilge an príomhtheanga a d'úsáid mé taobh amuigh den scoil nó den bhaile. D'imigh mé go meánscoil chónaithe nuair a bhí mé 12 bhliain d'aois agus ní raibh seans agam Gaeilge a labhairt ó shin go dtí cúig bhliain ó shin nuair a tháinig mé isteach anseo. Bhí mé lonnaithe i Litir Ceannain, baile ina bhfuil gaelscoil mhór, ach ní féidir a rá go bhfuil Gaeilge líofa thart ar an bhaile, agus ní raibh seans agam feidhm a bhaint as an Ghaeilge agus mé ag dul i mbun oibre. Nuair a tháinig mé don pholaitíocht, áfach, tri éisteacht le Raidió na Gaeltachta go háirithe, tháinig muinín orm Gaeilge a labhairt. Bheadh an seans sin ag achan Ball den Teach. Ní cheart eagla bheith ar dhuine ar bith Gaeilge a úsáid cé chomh cumasach agus an méid atá acu. Éistfidh duine ar bith aga bhfuil an Ghaeilge leis nó léi.</P>
    <P>Anuraidh nuair a bhí an comhrac ar siúl i gcoinne na línte aibhléise i dTír Chonaill, an chéad lá a bhí cruinniú poiblí ann in Ostán na Rosann, ní raibh Gaeilge ag duine ar bith ó BSE, ag an bhreitheamh nó ag an duine a bhí i gceannas ar chruinniú do dhaoine Gaeltachta a bhí ag iarraidh a gcás a phlé frid an Ghaeilge. Le Bille mar seo, beidh ar chomhlachtaí mhóra an Ghaeilge a chur ar fáil do lucht na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Molaim Raidió na Gaeltachta agus TG4. Tá siad ag gluaiseacht ar aghaidh leis an Ghaeilge. Nuair a bhí mé ar scoil, cuireadh brú ar pháiste an Ghaeilge a fhoghlaim. Anois is cúis phleisiúir í. Ba cheart an seans a bheith ag duine á labhairt. Frid an riarachán sa Bhille seo, beidh an seans ag daoine aon rud atá le déanamh frid an Ghaeilge. Ní cheart costas a chur air sin. Níl mé ag iarraidh go mbeidh gach rud réidh ar an chéad lá. Tá a lán seirbhísí a ba cheart bheith ar fáil ach tá an-chostas leo. Níl mé ag rá gur cheart go mbeidh seirbhísí aitheantas do dhaoine míchumasacha ar fáil as Gaeilge go hiomlán achan lá. Má oibrímid air, ámh, tá seans go gcuirfear seirbhís níos fearr ar fáil.</P>
    <P>Is maith go mbeidh aitheantas san cúirteanna dóibh siúd a bhaineann úsáid as an Ghaeilge. Cuimhním an t-iarbhreitheamh Seán Delap as Gaoth Dobhair, atá ar shlí na fírinne anois, a bhí i gcónaí réidh an Ghaeilge a úsáid. Fear an-mhácánta agus fairáilte a bhí ann.</P>
    <P>Molaim an tAire, an Roinn agus na hoifigigh as ucht an Bhille seo. Is as ceanntar Gaeltachta mé agus glacaim leis an obair a cuireadh isteach ann. Beidh seans níos fearr ag bunadh na Gaeltachta post a fháil sa Státseirbhís mar beidh siad a dhíth ar an Stát chun an Bhille seo a chur i gcríoch.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Ms Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Gabhaim buíochas leis na Seanadóirí uilig a ghlac páirt sa díospóireacht seo. Seo ocáid thábhachtach do Sheanadóirí a dtuairimí a chur os mo chomhair mar gheall ar an Bhille. Seo an díospóireacht is fearr a bhí agam sa Teach seo ar stádas na Gaeilge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1802" />Senator Manning referred specifically to a number of issues which I will go through as quickly as possible. He spoke about the simultaneous publication of Bills on enactment. It is not the intention at this time to insist that they be published simultaneously, but that they be published simultaneously on enactment in order that we do not have a situation where important Bills are not dealt with quickly. I appreciate that it would be best if we could publish simultaneously. Perhaps this will be possible at a later date when the relevant facilities are provided. However, I am pragmatic enough to know that it would be wrong to prevent very important legislation going through the Houses as quickly as possible, as often happens. This is similar to the idea of changing from the current constitutional prerogative which is that this be done as soon as is practicable. It will now be done simultaneously under Article 25.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning also spoke about the drafting of legislation. Bills are always drafted in one language, including this one. This is the authoritative legal text, not a translation of the drafted Bill.</P>
    <P>Many Members spoke about resources. While there will be implications and I appreciate the concerns expressed in the House, not every person in the public service and not every section of every public body has to be proficient in the language chun seirbhíse a thabhairt d'achan duine. Níl cíall leis sin agus bheadh costas go díreach chun sin a dhéanamh ach that is not the intention of the legislation. The intention is that for those bodies for which there are implications in this regard, particularly those in Gaeltacht areas, there will be a need for proficiency in the language.</P>
    <P>I disagree with Senator Quinn's analysis that this is the wrong time and that resources would be best spent elsewhere. This is the right time.</P>
    <P>Bhí diospóireacht ann cheana mar gheall ar TG4 agus dúirt gach aon duine nach bhfuil ciall aon airgead a thabhairt don stáisiún. Tá athrú mór meoine ann anois. Cuidíonn an stáisiún go mór le pléisiúr a thabhairt do dhaoine óga a bhfuil suim acu sa Ghaeilge. Nuair atá an Bille seo sínithe beidh athrú meoine ann faoi na seirbhísí a bheith le fáil ó na Stát córais uilig.  </P>
    <P>The Senator also referred to the Official Language Commissioner. I do not intend to establish a police service; rather it will be a monitoring service. Duine neamhspleách a bheadh sa choimisinéir a dhéanfaidh monatóireacht ar an méid atá le déanamh. The commissioner will not be part of a bureaucratic layer; he or she will not be another addition to the bureaucracies already in existence. The intention is that an independent person will assess the progress of this legislation. Someone outside the Department would be best suited to this task. The person concerned will be given powers along the lines of those of an ombudsman to investigate complaints. It is not the intention to waste resources in the provision of a huge office which, at the end of the day, would have no teeth.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1803" />This is a three year scheme in respect of which training will be important. Tá córas tréanála ag dul ar aghaidh. Training schemes are available, but they are often viewed as a holiday rather than a working opportunity. Additional training will be provided.</P>
    <P>Tá sé tábhachtach go gcuirfeadh daoine brú ar an gcóras poiblí seirbhís a thabhairt dóibh tré Ghaeilge. There is no sense in providing legislation and getting enthusiastic people to support it if there is no demand. It must be demand led. Iarraim ar dhaoine brú a chur ar an gcóras Stáit seirbhís a thabhairt dóibh. It will work in tandem; it is not a demand led service because if it was, it would not work. However, when we have the statutory provisions in place, I ask that there be a demand. Ní bheadh ciall ar bith seirbhísí a thabhairt gan iarracht a bheith orthu.</P>
    <P>Ní aontaím go bfhuil cás na teanga caillte againn. Aontaím le mo chomhghleacaithe a deir go bhfuil athrú mór tagtha ar dhearcadh na ndaoine ar an nGaeilge. Amharc ar na Gaelscoileanna agus ar an suim atá ag na páistí agus ag daoine fásta sa teanga. Tá gach tacaíocht le fáil ó mo Roinn-se do mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus do dhaoine a bhfuil suim acu sa Ghaeilge. Tá seans ag daoine Gaeilge a fhoghlaim. Tá cúntóirí teanga ann chun seans níos mó a thabhairt do pháistí óga atá ina gcónaí sa Ghaeltacht agus nach bhfuil Gaeilge acu, an teanga a fhoghlaim. Níl an Ghaeilge caillte. Tá sí beo sa tír agus caithfimid gach iarracht a dhéanamh chun go mbeidh sí le clos, ní hamháin sa Ghaeltacht ach ar fud na tíre fosta. We will not support the idea that the language is only for those living in the Gaeltacht. Tá sí mar aidhm agam agus ag an Stát an Ghaeilge a caomhnú. Níl difir ar bith idir na spriocanna atá ag Fianna Fáil agus ag Fine Gael mar gheall air sin.</P>
    <P>Cuireann an méid a bhí le rá ag an tSeanadóir O'Toole imní orm. Ní raibh an méid a bhí le rá aige mar gheall ar sprid agus na spriocanna atá agam sa Bhille seo ionraic. Tá fiacla agus cumhacht sa Bhille. Beidh scéimeanna aontaithe idir rannóga na Ranna agus na Ranna éagsúla chun go mbeidh scéim aontaithe agus monatóireacht déanta ar an scéim. Seo an obair a bheidh ag an gcoimisinéir teanga. Bhí treoirlínte ann cheana ach ní dhearna siad difríocht ar bith. Caithfear rud reachtúil a dhéanamh chun a bheith cinnte go ndéanfar difríocht.</P>
    <P>Tá ceist agam don tSeanadóir. Cén áit a d'fhoghlaim sé a theanga dhúchais? D'fhoghlaim sé é sa bhaile agus ar scoil. Caithfear rud éigin a dhéanamh mar gheall ar chaighdeán na Gaeilge sna scoileanna agus ar fud na tíre. Níl mise i mo chónaí sa Ghaeltacht ach tá ómós agus grá agam don teanga toisc go raibh grá ag m'athair agus ag mo chuid múinteoirí uilig don teanga. Cén fáth go bhfuil suim ag an aos óg ins na Gaelscoileanna agus brú ar an Rialtas meán-scoileanna lán-Ghaeilge a chur ar fáil. Tá sé mar aidhm agam, ag mo Roinn-se agus ag mo pháirtí, deis a <Col N="1804" /> thabhairt do dhaoine leanúint ar aghaidh lena gcuid scolaíocht tré mheán na Gaeilge agus go mbeadh ollscolaíocht tré mheán na Gaeilge le fáil fosta. Cuideoidh an Bille le caighdeán na Gaeilge, le deis a thabhairt do dhaoine óga an Ghaeilge a fhoghlaim agus a úsáid agus, mar a luaigh an Seanadóir Ó Cnáimhsí, postanna éagsúla a fháil sa Stát chóras.  </P>
    <P>Cuidíonn alt 31 sa Bhille Oideachais a reachtaíodh bliain go leith ó shin le cúrsaí oideachais tré mheán na Gaeilge. Tá mé dóchasach go n-aithreoidh sin rudaí go mór, go mbeidh téacsleabhair ar fáil agus go mbeidh teicneolaíocht úr ar fáil chun tacaíocht a thabhairt do pháistí óga níos mó Gaeilge a úsáid agus go mbeidh an Ghaeilge le clos taobh amuigh den nGaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Luadh an tionchar a bheadh ag an mBille seo ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus rinneadh gearán nach mbeadh tionchar ar bith ag an mBille ar an nGaeltacht. Ba mhaith liom alt 14 a léamh:</P>
    <P>Le linn dréacht-sceim a ullmhú, déanfaidh an comhlacht poiblí a chinntiú go bhfeastalófar ar aon riachtanais áirithe teanga a bhaineann le seirbhísí a sholáthar i limistéir Ghaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Tá sin ann agus beidh sé ann. Is é an sprioc atá againn go mbeidh seirbhísí tábhachtacha le fáil sa Ghaeltacht. Luaigh an Seanadóir O'Toole an deacracht a bhí ann maidir leis an mBille Shláinte agus bhí an Seanadóir ag cur brú ar an Aire seirbhísí speisialta a chur ar fáil do dhaoine sa Ghaeltacht. Aontaím leis sin ach má's é an rogha dochtúir a cheapadh gan Gaeilge nó gan dochtúir a cheapadh ar chor ar bith, níl aon rogha ann. Caithfear an seirbhís a thabhairt do dhaoine. Ag an am chéana tá sé riachtanach, fóirsteanach agus tábhachtach go mbeadh rogha ag daoine sa Ghaeltacht agus, go mór mór, go mbeadh Gaeilge ag dochtúirí, ag banaltraí, ag daoine atá ag obair in oifig an phoist agus mar sin de, agus go mbeidís ábalta seirbhís a thabhairt tré Ghaeilge.</P>
    <P>B'fhearr liomsa gan brú a chur ar dhuine ar bith ach gach aon duine a thabhairt liom. Tá go leor oibre déanta ag oifigigh na Ranna le cúig bliain anuas. Ní raibh rud ar bith déanta faoi Bhille teanga cheana. Caithfear tús a dhéanamh cúig bliain ó shin mar ní raibh éinne i ndáiríre faoi sin a dhéanamh ach mo pháirtí féin. Ní cleas polaiticiúil an Bille seo a bheith os comhair an tSeanaid. Bhí sé mar aidhm agam agus ag an Rialtas go mbeadh gach seans an Bille a fhoilsiú agus a thabhairt os comhair an Oireachtais, dá mb'fhéidir é. Tá muid ionraic faoin Bhille seo agus fá seans a thabhairt do dhaoine seirbhísí a fháil tríd an Ghaeilge.</P>
    <P>Seo an Bille is tábhachtaí chun tacaíochta a thabhairt don Ghaeilge le fada an lá, go speisialta mar go gcuirfidh sé an chéad rún ag Coimisiún na Gaeltachta i bhfeidhm &ndash; an Bille féin a fhoilsiú. Cuideoidh sé go mór-mhór le Gaeilgeoirí atá ag gearán nach bhfuil seirbhísí ar fáil leo. Is Bille cearta teanga agus comhionnanas é seo. Cé go bhfuil muid ag caint ar chearta teanga, is ceart á phlé agus tacaíocht a thabhairt dó.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1805" />Ní aontaím go bhfuil costas mór ann. Fiú má tá costas ann, is cuma mar tá muid ag caint fá chearta. Tá sé ceart go dtabharfaidh na hacmhainní riachtanach do na haidhmeanna atá sa Bhille. Tig liom a ra go mbeidh na hacmhainní ag teacht mar gheall ar an tacaíocht láidir a fuair mé leis an Bhille seo a dhréactú agus a fhoilsiú.</P>
    <P>Beidh seans ag an Dáil agus an Seanad poíntí easgsúla a lua. Má beidh sé tábhachtach go leasófar an Bille, beimid sásta sin a dhéanamh. Ba mhaith liom dhul ar aghaidh leis, agus achan duine a bhreith liom, go dtí go mbeidh athrú mór i seirbhísí san earnáil phoiblí. Tús maith leath na hoibre. D'athraigh Bille teanga mar seo an Bhreatain Bheag. Tá an-méadú anois ar an méid daoine atá ag baint úsáid as an Bhreatnais mar ghnáththeanga. Tá dhá Bhille theanga acu ansin agus cuidíonn siad le húsáid na teanga. Cuideoidh an Bille seo l'achan duine seirbhísí a fháil agus tuilleadh Gaeilge a chloisteáil san Oireachtas agus ar fud na tíre.</P>
    <P>Gabhaim buíochas leis na Seanadóirí uilig as ucht na tacaíochta a thug siad don Bhille agus domsa sna díospóireachtaí eagsúla a bhí againn frid an Ghaeilge. Is cúis bróid go bhfuil a lán Seanadóirí sásta an Ghaeilge a úsáid agus tacaíocht a thabhairt don teanga mar theanga oibre sa Seanad. Tá súil agam go bhfuil sé mar aidhm ag go leor daoine go mbeidh an Bille seo críochnaithe roimh deireadh na mbliana.  </P>

      <P>We will proceed as Béarla so that there is some sense around here.</P>
      <P>Mrs. Justice Susan Denham recommended in the sixth report of the courts commission that a specialist reporter be appointed to report on family law cases on a pilot basis. A report in <i>The Irish Times</i> by Carol Coulter a few weeks ago stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year a barrister, Ms Siobhan Flockton, was appointed as family law recorder and given a three-fold brief: to provide information about the operation and day-to-day activity in the family law courts of a general nature; to provide more in-depth statistical information <Col N="1806" /> on the family law courts; and to record, with the consent of the parties, judgments in the District and Circuit family law courts for publication.</P>
    <P>Following her appointment, some concern was expressed about the legality of the third aspect of her work, the publication, with the consent of the parties, judgments in the District and Circuit family law courts. The Courts Service Board, which consists of senior members of the Judiciary and representatives of relevant Departments and of the legal profession, sought senior counsel opinion. The opinion given stated that the <i>in camera</i> rule governing family law cases meant that Ms Flockton could not attend the cases, not to mind report on them, even with the parties' consent. This was a very strict interpretation of the rule, but apparently represents the law as it stands at the moment.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have noticed that in recent discussions by Women's Aid and at the recent conference on rape and family violence, there was a great deal of discussion on the issue of domestic violence and people felt that more reporting of these cases would be extremely useful so the public could understand the seriousness of them. At present, even barristers are unsure what is happening in these cases unless they are involved in them because they are not allowed in. There is a great deficit of knowledge about how serious are these cases. When I listen to people discussing boys who become involved in car theft, I am fascinated at their suggestions of what must be done to their parents and the fines they should pay. Sadly, in a huge percentage of the cases of such children that come before the courts, the parents do not even turn up and the children are very much out on their own.</P>
    <P>I believe the Attorney General was considering this issue and had thought of introducing legislation. Ms Flockton was appointed well over a year ago and it is very unfortunate that all that time has gone by without any legislation. What does the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform intend to do about this unsatisfactory situation?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Ms Coughlan Ms Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Ms Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Gabhaim buíochas leis an Seanadóir as ucht na deise a thabhairt dom labhairt faoin ábhar tábhachtach seo.</P>
      <P>I am sure Senators will agree that our courts system is currently undergoing the most comprehensive and radical reform of court administration since the foundation of the State. The Courts Service was formally established as an independent body on 9 November 1999 and is now responsible for the management and development of the courts in Ireland. The formation of the Courts Service was recommended in the first of six reports of the working group on a courts commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The structures, which have now been put in place will allow the Courts Service to meet the <Col N="1807" /> demands placed on it in the new millennium and enable it to provide a first class service for judges, practitioners, court staff and, most importantly, the users of the system. In order to reflect the Government's commitment to ensuring the success of the Courts Service we have increased the allocation to the courts Vote from &euro;38.6 million in 1997 to &euro;84.9m this year, an increase of 119%.</P>
    <P>One of the important functions delegated to the Courts Service under the Courts Service Act, 1998, is a power whereby the Courts Service board can establish sub-committees to examine and consider the performance of its functions. The Courts Service established a family law court development committee some time ago which meets on a regular basis. The members of the committee are the Hon. Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness, the Hon. Mr. Justice Peter Kelly, Judge Michael White, Judge William Early, Mr. Rory Brady, SC, Ms Olive Braiden and the chief executive of the Courts Service, Mr. P. J. Fitzpatrick.</P>
    <P>The functions of the committee are to prepare short, medium and long-term proposals for the development of family law services and, in particular, to pursue the recommendations contained in the sixth report of the working group on a courts commission, which dealt with family law, including the recommendations on regional family law courts, the publication of <i>in camera</i> family law judgments, court accommodation and facilities for the hearing of family law cases, and case management of family law cases.</P>
    <P>Some time ago the board of the Courts Service approved a recommendation from the committee that a pilot project be established in the Dublin Circuit and District Family Law Courts to report family law judgments. The main aims of the <Col N="1808" /> family law recording pilot project are: to provide general information for the public on the day-to-day operation of the family law courts; to provide statistical information on the family law courts; and to report on decisions of the family law courts.</P>
    <P>A barrister with extensive family law experience was engaged on contract as a recorder, and a monitoring committee was established to oversee the development of the project, the first two elements of which are proceeding well. Already two information bulletins have been published and widely circulated. They are available from the Courts Service information office, if the Senator would like to familiarise herself with the results of the pilot project to date. They were well received by members of the Judiciary and others involved in this area of law.</P>
    <P>As the Senator knows, family law cases are heard <i>in camera</i>. This rule exists by virtue of legislation. Difficulties have arisen in relation to the third element of the project, as to whether it is legally permissible for a recorder to attend the family law court and record judgments, even with the consent of the parties involved. I understand the Courts Service board is considering this issue and has obtained counsel's advice in the matter. If the board concludes that the problem which has been encountered can only be resolved by legislative amendment, the Minister will be happy to consider its recommendations. It will be considering this matter at its meeting on 29 April, and the Senator can be assured that the Minister will give consideration to any recommendations made by it.</P>
