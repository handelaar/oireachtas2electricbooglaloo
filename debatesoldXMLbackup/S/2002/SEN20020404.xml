      <P>I have received notice from Senator Norris that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to make funds available for necessary repairs to St. Anthony's boys' national school, Kilcoole, County Wicklow.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by the Senator as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>Fograím don Seanad go bhfuair me teachtaireacht ón Seanadóir Tomás Mac Gearailt go bhfuil sé ag éirí as bheith ina Chomhalta den Seanad.</P>
      <P>I announce to the Seanad that I have received notice in writing from Senator Tom Fitzgerald of his resignation from the House. When Senator Fitzgerald told me a few days ago that he was stepping down from the Seanad for health reasons, I felt a great sadness. Nobody was more aware than I of how much a part of Senator Fitzgerald's life was his membership of this House. He enjoyed every minute of his time here and until a few weeks ago he was looking forward to contesting the next Seanad election. He was a totally committed and dedicated Senator. His contributions to debates were always well informed and laced with common sense, never more so than when he spoke on matters pertaining to the marine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Government Chief Whip, Senator Fitzgerald made an outstanding contribution to this Seanad. His good humour, patience and understanding and above all his absolute integrity gained for him the respect, loyalty and affection of Members on all sides of the House. We all owe him a great debt of gratitude. On my own behalf and on behalf of the entire staff of the Seanad and, I am sure, on behalf of all of you, I thank Senator Fitzgerald for his contribution over the <Col N="1554" /> years and wish him well. I am aware of how difficult his decision must have been. I sincerely trust that the excellent medical care he continues to receive will in due course see him restored to full health. Gura fada buan thú, Tom.</P>
    <P>As this may be the last sitting of the Seanad before the general election, I wish to say that it has been a great honour and privilege for me to have served as Cathaoirleach over the past four and a half years. I express my sincere thanks to all of you for your co-operation, support and assistance over those years. I wish those of you who are seeking election to the other House good luck and every success.</P>
    <P>I expect that I will have a further opportunity to extend good wishes to all those Senators who will in due course be seeking re-election to this House or who will be retiring, as I will be, from active service. When that opportunity comes, I will also pay a well-deserved tribute to all the staff of the Seanad. However, today I acknowledge my admiration for and appreciation of the professionalism and dedication of the Clerk and Assistant Clerk and I thank them for their huge contribution to the efficient working of this Seanad. I will say more about that on another day. I now call on the Leader of the House and the other leaders as I know they wish, on behalf of their respective groups, to pay tribute to Senator Fitzgerald.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been asked by Senator Fitzgerald to read out the following letter:</P>
      <P>It is with great regret that I have today decided to resign as Government Chief Whip and as a Member of Seanad Éireann due to health reasons.</P>
      <P>I first stood for the Seanad in 1977 but was unsuccessful. I was, however, successful in getting elected in 1981 and 1982 but lost again in 1982 and was re-elected in 1987 until 1997 when after losing the last Seanad election I was nominated by the Taoiseach and have served in the Seanad as Government Chief Whip to the present day.</P>
      <P>I thank all those whom I have met and have worked with over the years in both Houses of the Oireachtas, particularly the Cathaoirleach and Leas-Chathaoirleach and their secretaries, the clerk and assistant clerk of the Seanad and their staff, the gardaí, the ushers and security, the Captain of the Guard and the Superintendent, and all the reporters from radio, television and the newspapers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To all the Members of Seanad Éireann, I say how privileged I am to have known you all and to have worked with you. I thank you for your courtesy and co-operation at all times. In particular I thank the leaders and whips of Fine Gael, the Independent group and the Labour Party. I thank the Leader of the Seanad, who has been a great friend, the assistant leader, Senator John Dardis, the Chief Whip in my absence, Senator Willie Farrell, and acting assistant whip, Senator Pat Moylan. My sincere <Col N="1555" /> thanks to all the Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats Senators who make up the Government side of the House.</P>
    <P>I wish a very sincere thanks to my secretary, Ellen Byrne, who has been a great friend and secretary over the years.</P>
    <P>Coming to the decision of resigning from the Seanad was not easy and, in that respect, I thank my wife, Bridie, and my family Tommy, Siobhán, Michelle and Breandán, for their understanding and consideration in helping me to come to this decision. I will miss Seanad Éireann and will remember my time there with pride. I wish all who are going for election to either House every success and those who are retiring a long, healthy and happy life. God bless you all and slán go fóill from Senator Tom Fitzgerald.</P>
    <P>As Leader of the House, I express my warmest good wishes to Senator Fitzgerald and his family for a long and happy retirement. I have known Tom on a personal level for many years and will remember him not only for his commitment to Seanad Éireann, but for his love and dedication to his favourite place, Dingle. He always told us what a great place it was, with fine fishing and a beautiful harbour. Tom made many important contributions in this House but his greatest was to the Harbours Bill, which was brought before the House by the then Minister of State, Deputy Gilmore. Tom felt very strongly about this issue and was successful in having 15 amendments accepted, an unprecedented occurrence at the time. One amendment involved the conveying of radioactive waste and, as a result, all our harbours are today nuclear free.</P>
    <P>A committed parliamentarian, Senator Fitzgerald was also a champion of environmental issues and in the late 1980s was instrumental in introducing a motion in the House that called for a ban on strychnine. This motion was passed and was later accepted by the Government and became law.</P>
    <P>Tom was proud of his heritage and culture and took every opportunity to promote the use of the Irish language. He was cathaoirleach of the Irish language committee and made many major contributions to it.</P>
    <P>As Leader of Seanad Éireann, I am proud to have had the honour of serving with Senator Tom Fitzgerald and to have benefited from the wealth of experience he gained from his many years as Assistant Whip and Chief Whip. Many Senators will recall that Tom was first appointed Assistant Whip in 1991 by his great friend, the then Taoiseach, Charles J. Haughey, and served with former Senator Wright, who was Chief Whip, and the late Senator Seán Fallon, who was Leader of the House at the time. He was reappointed by the Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, in 1992 and served with the current Cathaoirleach, who was Chief Whip, and former Senator Wright, who was Leader of the House. In 1997 he was appointed Chief Whip by the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, with Senator Farrell as his assistant and <Col N="1556" /> me as Leader. During our time together, Senator Fitzgerald has shown himself to be a person of great integrity, loyalty and diligence with a total dedication and commitment to Seanad Éireann. He never failed to offer support, advice and assistance to all who called on him. I will miss him for his support and good humour.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the Fianna Fáil group and all Senators, I wish him well in his retirement. To his children, Michelle, Tommy and Breandán, who are in the Visitors Gallery, I say, your father is a very fine man who has served the community well both at national and local level. I wish his wife Bridie, all his family and, in particular, Tom himself very many years of happiness and I look forward to him visiting us some time, please God, when his health improves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>It was with great regret that I heard the news this morning that Senator Tom Fitzgerald is resigning from the House. Obviously, our first concern is for his health and that now, free from the pressure of politics, he will have the time and space to make a full recovery. We extend our best wishes for a full recovery in order that he may enjoy many years of retirement.</P>
      <P>Tom Fitzgerald is one of the great gentlemen of Irish politics. It is a privilege to know him and to have worked with him. He was always courteous and showed a sense of charm which, while very much his own, rubbed off on everybody who came into contact with him. He was utterly sincere in everything he did, in his love of this House and politics and in his simple, straightforward belief in the matters which he felt were fundamental to politics.</P>
      <P>Working across the floor from him both as Leader of the Opposition and of the House, I always found him to be a man of his word, which was his bond. Once a deal was done, it was respected without the need for a written agreement. He is a person of great generosity, not only in the manner in which it is normally understood, but also in terms of generosity of spirit. He showed great concern for other people, who were central to his belief in politics.</P>
      <P>Senator Tom Fitzgerald was a person of extraordinary loyalty to his party and to Charles Haughey, who was, as the Leader pointed out, a great friend and mentor. While others developed a sense of amnesia as far as Mr. Haughey was concerned, Senator Tom Fitzgerald did not. He always acknowledged his friendship and while he admitted that matters could have been different, he was not a fair weather friend, but stood by his friends through good days and bad.</P>
      <P>It was always a pleasure to listen to him speak in the House, especially on the subjects about which he knew and cared a great deal &ndash; matters related to the marine, nature and County Kerry, in particular, come to mind. His use of Irish is very colourful. Tom also had to fill in for others from time to time, but when he spoke on his topics he was unbeatable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1557" />It has been a privilege for me and members of my party to have counted Senator Tom Fitzgerald as a friend, to have worked with him and to have witnessed his very fine qualities. He was a friend of everyone in the House and added greatly to public life through his participation in it. Our main concern now is that he makes a full recovery and enjoys many years of good health.</P>

Is fear den scoth é i meon an phobail. Is mór an trua go bhfuil se ag éirí as ach tuigim a chás. Is breá a chloisteáil go bhfuil biseach ag teacht air anois. Is mór an trua nach mbeidh Bridie ag teacht chugainn le linn an toghcháin ag rá &ldquo;An dtabharfaidh tú vóta do m'athair?&rdquo;, mar a dúirt sí go minic.</P>

      <P>Less than ten days ago I said I did not want to hear anyone else in the House refer to a Kerry man as a man of integrity because one could not trust what he would do next. I will put that on hold now because no other word would describe Senator Fitzgerald. He is and always will be a colleague, friend and neighbour. I hope to hear about his retirement many more times in the future. His health prospects are better now. Once he has made the decision, he will be able to look forward to greater participation and his treatment can start in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He has been a stalwart of the House from the time he came here. His respect for the House knows no bounds. I know the staff of the House will agree that he has been the oil in the machinery of the Upper House in the sense that it continued to work and there was always consistent movement. He has always shown respect not only for the Members on his own side, but for those of us on this side of the House. I reiterate what Senator Manning said, his word is his bond. While there are often rows, fights and tension across the floor about ordering business etc., I have not had to query any agreement he made with me or others on this side of the House in all the years I have dealt with him. While we on the Independent benches rarely speak with one voice, we can speak with one voice on this issue this morning. We had total trust and confidence in him. I knew that was the case before we both sat in the House as it was reflected in his family background. Anyone who had the great pleasure to meet his mother, who we referred to as Nell Brien &ndash; the tradition in west Kerry is that women do not change their names when they get married &ndash; would realise that her son had the same level of integrity, commitment and directness. He is and <Col N="1558" /> will continue to be held in the highest regard at home.</P>
    <P>I am delighted Senator Fitzgerald's health is improving. I will miss him around the House. As well as his knowledge of the sea, he gets completely energised about the lack of conservation in the sea and the methods of fishing to which he is opposed and which he feels are not good for the environment or for the future of fishing. He is a mine of information on such areas as we have seen in the House. He will not change from being loyal, co-operative and dependable. He has served us with dignity and commitment.</P>
    <P>Tá sé ag éirí as mar chomhghleacaí, mar chara agus mar chomharsa. As a west Kerry man, I hope he breathes the air which keeps us well. I hope he visits us regularly to convey some of his wisdom to us. I thank his family, particularly Bridie. The families of public representatives always make a huge commitment because it is an intrusion in their lives. There are better times ahead as they will have more time together. I am sure we will see a lot of him in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the other speakers, I greatly regret that Senator Tom Fitzgerald is retiring from the House and from his post as Chief Whip. It is sad that he is doing so on grounds of ill health. I hope he returns to good health as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>Senator Tom Fitzgerald is a good friend of mine as he is of everyone else in the House. He is a decent, honourable, sincere and humble man. He is very natural, with no airs or graces whatsoever. He is a straightforward, direct man of integrity. Of all of those who have come out of Kerry, and out of Dingle, Senator Tom Fitzgerald is certainly the greatest gentleman of them all, with due respect to anybody past or present. Others may perhaps grow into his shoes but he is at present a man of the greatest stature there and I am delighted that members of his family are in the House today so that they can hear how much we appreciate him.</P>
      <P>Senator Tom Fitzgerald is appreciated as much on this side of the House as he is on his own side. He never made any bones about where he stood as a parliamentarian. He was a very staunch Member of the House who was very concerned with the structures of the House and that respect for the House be paramount. In his position, he worked to ensure that was the case and when problems arose he was quick to smooth them out. His great strength is that he is a conciliator. He is a person who avoids unnecessary confrontation. At the same time, he is very direct and was always able to smooth out any difficulty that arose. I will always see him in that capacity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The finest tribute to Senator Tom Fitzgerald is to acknowledge what he wrote in his letter to the House today. It showed all his human qualities and was concerned for everybody in the House and all those he worked with. He did not leave anybody out and that is his approach to everything &ndash; that all should be included and every<Col N="1559" /> body should be given due respect and attention. I wish Senator Tom Fitzgerald well in his retirement and hope that he returns to good health.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a surprise to be told this morning that Senator Tom Fitzgerald was retiring. While we all knew that he had been ill, retirement was not something I expected. It must have been a particularly hard decision for him because it is obvious that he loves this place so much and has such affection for all who serve here, whether Members or staff. It has been said by Senator Manning and others that he was a very good parliamentarian. That might not be readily appreciated in the wider community and it is important that it is said. Reference has been made to the work he did on various pieces of legislation within the House and I particularly recall the Harbours Bill, 1995, on which he had a major impact. It was remarkable, and a measure of his stature and the knowledge that he had of the fishing industry, that he could achieve so much when he was in Opposition.</P>
      <P>We will also miss him because he was very helpful to all Members, particularly new Members, irrespective of what party they belonged to or what side of the House they were on. That should also be recognised and perhaps has not been referred to. The Seanad was such a huge part of Senator Tom Fitzgerald's life that it is difficult to imagine him not having it as a part of his life. I hope that he will return to us many times to visit us and to be with us here. I am sure that is something both he and all Members would like to happen.</P>
      <P>Senator Tom Fitzgerald made many friends while a Member of the House. He was always even-handed and an excellent Government Whip. Even those who at times might have suffered the wrath of his tongue because they may not have sought a pair, or may have slipped away quietly &ndash; or what they thought was quietly &ndash; for a few hours, will acknowledge that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>That was a result of the deep commitment he had to the House and its workings and to the respect that he had for parliamentary tradition.</P>
      <P>I saw Senator Tom Fitzgerald cry on one occasion &ndash; the day Mr. Haughey stepped down from office as Taoiseach. I met the Senator coming across the bridge between Government Buildings and Leinster House and he was crying because his Taoiseach had resigned. He bore that with very good grace. Senator Manning was correct when he spoke about his loyalty and said that he never forgot his friends. It is a privilege for all of us to have served with him and to know him. We wish him very well in his retirement and a full recovery to health. We wish him and his wife and family all the best for the future.</P>

      <P>The proposed Order of Business is No. 1, Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill, 2002 &ndash; Report and Final Stages, to be taken today; No. 2, Civil Defence Bill, 2002 &ndash; all Stages, with contributions of spokespersons on Second Stage not to exceed 12 minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed seven minutes, and Senators may share time; No. 3, Solicitors (Amendment) Bill, 1998 [<i>Seanad Bill amended by the Dáil</i>] &ndash; Report and Final Stages, to be taken today; No. 4, Medical Practitioners (Amendment) Bill, 2002 &ndash; all Stages to be taken today, with contributions of spokespersons on Second Stage not to exceed 12 minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes, and Senators may share time.

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to the Order of Business as announced by the Leader. It was indicated that the Civil Defence Bill would be taken at 2.30 p.m. and I ask if that is still the intention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is what I meant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I am slightly concerned about the Order of Business today. I believe that the House should not be taking the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill today because there is still a wide degree of consultation required with interest groups. I freely concede that the Minister has gone a long way towards meeting many of the objections raised last week by Senators Burke and O'Toole. Otherwise I have no objections to the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Order of Business. In a recent Order of Business, the Leader gave a commitment that before the House finishes its business this term there would be a discussion on the report on the Seanad produced by the constitutional non-independent group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not independent in any way. The report of the all-party group is a creature of the parties and excluded those of us with independent voices. We should have a discussion on this topic and I will have a lot to say when we do. It would be useful for Members on all sides of the House. During the Seanad elections our opinion on the role of the Seanad is always sought and this discussion would allow Senators to put their opinions on the record at an important time and put forward views on how <Col N="1561" /> matters may be dealt with in the future. I ask that a debate on this topic be held before the House finishes its business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator Manning, I wonder why we are dealing with the Final Stages of the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill. The Taoiseach indicated in the Dáil on the last sitting day before the Easter recess that the Easter period would be available for consultation with the various disability interest groups so that the difficulties could be resolved. Whatever amendments might arise out of that consultation should be available to the House when the Bill is being debated here. I am not aware that the consultation has yet taken place and it would be more appropriate to withdraw the Bill and reintroduce it when that consultation has taken place.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader to consider holding a debate on the state of the nation. It would give the House an opportunity to discuss where we are in economic and employment terms and the issues of health and homelessness. The number of homeless people has quadrupled since the Government came into office.</P>

      <P>Chuala mé an scéal ar maidin. Cuireann sé brón orm ach cuireann sé áthas orm fosta. Casadh Tomás orm i 1977 i rith fheachtas thoghchán an tSeanaid sin. From that day we have been great friends. Senator Fitzgerald and I had much in common. We come from very similar backgrounds. I started my first job at 14 earning ten bob a week, roughly 60 cent in today's money. There were no set hours; I worked from sunrise to sunset. Senator Fitzgerald did a bit better in his first job, earning 15 bob a week, about 75 or 80 cent in today's money. We often spent time talking about the wonderful changes we have seen in our time.</P>
      <P>Senator Fitzgerald has always been a true friend, someone to confide in and talk with. I always felt and knew that I was someone he could confide in. We became very close, especially in the past ten years. He is a man of great integrity, great honesty and as Senator Manning said his word is his bond. Senator Fitzgerald amazed me by his wonderful knowledge of so many subjects and how much he knew about the administration and workings of this House. At our group meetings, Senator Fitzgerald had an intimate knowledge of every Bill that was discussed. I often thought of Goldsmith:</P>
      <P>and still the wonder grew</P>
      <P>That one small head could carry all he knew.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Fitzgerald should write a book. He has brilliant stories and a brilliant mind. Earlier I said I felt both sadness and joy. I feel joy that I have known and worked with Senator Fitzgerald, a wonderful person, and that he will be able to enjoy his retirement when with the help of God and His Blessed Mother his health will return. So often we pay tributes to people when they cannot <Col N="1562" /> hear us. Senator Fitzgerald knows we hold him in very high esteem.</P>
    <P>I feel somewhat emotional at times like this. Senator Fitzgerald and I have spoken almost every day since he got sick and our friendship will continue into the future as will our phone calls and chats. To Senator Fitzgerald, his wife, Bridie, and family I send every God's blessing in the future. I hope and pray that Senator Fitzgerald will return to really good health to enjoy his retirement.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzgerald is a great amateur photographer. He travelled the world, both on Oireachtas business and on holidays, and he captured everything on film. In his retirement, I know he will spend many days on this pastime of editing, splicing and putting together the many reels of film that he has accumulated. If his collection was ever placed in a museum, it would be worth seeing.</P>

      <P>I leave it to others to decide if that is a saving grace. Bhí an Seanadóir Tom Fitzgerald an-chairdiúil domsa agus thug sé an-chabhar dom nuair a tháinig mé isteach sa Seanad. Mhínigh sé rialacha an Tí seo dom agus bhí sé i gcónaí macánta agus, mar a dúradh cheana, ba fhear mór é agus is cailliúnt mór gan é a bheith linn feasta. Tá áthas orm go bhfuil a bhean chéile agus a chlann anseo chun a bheith ag éisteacht lena raibh á rá ag na Seanadóirí. Guím rath Dé agus sláinte air.</P>

      <P>I will not abuse the opportunity, a Chathaoirligh, but I am grateful that you are allowing us say something about our good friend, Tom Fitzgerald. I am very sad that he is leaving the House. I had no idea this would be put in front of us this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very pleasant to be able to say nice things about somebody who is still alive because so often at this point on the Order of Business we speak about people who are dead. Sometimes it is boring because there are times when people are elderly, they have been out of the House for a long time and nobody knows or remembers them, with the result that pleasant platitudes about <Col N="1563" /> them are manufactured. However, it is obvious from what Senators have been saying that Tom was a greatly loved Member of this House. It is appropriate that there should be a degree of emotion. He was a very decent man&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg your pardon. This is what happens when we only pay tribute to the dead. Long may he continue to delight us. He was a remarkable contributor to this House. I have often told the story &ndash; I have used it as an illustration of how the Seanad works &ndash; that on one of the first days I was in the House I heard him speak on a fishing Bill. I was fascinated because of the depth of his commitment, his knowledge and understanding and his capacity to deal in an accessible way with complex issues about an industry he knew. I told him his contribution was fascinating and was as good as a good lesson. He responded that of course he knew something about it because of his involvement in the fishing industry. It shows how important it is to have people in the Seanad from different aspects of life. That is what this House was intended for. We had another classic example in the contribution of my colleague, Senator O'Toole, on the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill. The Seanad is about having people with this level of professional expertise adding to legislation.</P>
      <P>I am very sorry at today's news. I wish Tom and his family many years of enjoyment in his retirement. I hope he will be here many times to visit us.</P>
      <P>I understand this may not be last the day but in case of accidents, may I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for your contribution. I am sorry you are retiring because you have done an exceptional job with good humour and wisdom. It will be difficult to find a replacement. I wish you well in your retirement and am sorry you are going.</P>
      <P>I understand there may another day's sitting after the general election. Will the Leader consider organising a debate on the report of the Rowntree Trust, reported in the newspapers today? It is worrying because it indicates that corruption is &ldquo;a central theme of Irish life and politics&rdquo; and that Ireland is now regarded as one of the more corrupt European states. There is a need to consider the report. It refers to the inadequate treatment of asylum seekers and the lack of an independent police complaints procedure. Most worryingly, it says that Ireland's standards of human and civil rights are below internationally acceptable levels. It reports that Ireland has the second fastest-growing prison population in Europe. The House must address this issue.</P>

      <P>When I arrived at the House this morning, I was very surprised to hear that Senator Fitzgerald was retiring. We can all <Col N="1564" /> become emotional on the occasion of a colleague's retirement.</P>
      <P>Senator Fitzgerald's honesty and integrity were absolute. He also had a great sense of humour. In his approach to canvassing for election, he was always organised and got everything right. I recall an occasion when he canvassed in County Meath and visited the home of a bachelor county councillor. Despite his thorough preparation, Senator Fitzgerald made little headway in trying to secure the councillor's vote. As he was a Kerryman and the councillor was from Meath, he decided that he would talk football with the man and asked that he would vote for him on the grounds that they were both from great footballing counties. The councillor responded that he would not vote for him because &ldquo;that ball was never over the line in 1939&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am sure that Senator Fitzgerald's wife, Bridie, will forgive me for mentioning that he was partial to the occasional late night. On one such night, when he and I were photographed at a charity event, the caption stated that we were the two cuddliest toys present. That went down very well with us.</P>
      <P>Senator Fitzgerald will be missed. I thank his family for their courtesy in attending this meeting of the House and I thank Senator Fitzgerald for his friendship.</P>

      <P>Like everyone else, I am very disappointed to hear that Senator Fitzgerald is retiring from this House, not least because my medical powers are not what they used to be. A couple of weeks ago, I wrote to him telling him that I would be down at once to give him a thorough overall examination. I felt sure the thought of that would horrify him so much that he would recover immediately. I did the best I could for him. I am very disappointed that the Senator is retiring. He has been a splendid friend.</P>
      <P>If this House will sit for another day before the election, I ask the Leader to organise a debate on the Mental Health (Amendment) Bill, 2001. The Mental Health Bill went through the Houses of the Oireachtas before the end of last summer. To date, all that has happened is that the commission has been appointed. The members of the commission are splendid people, but we need more action than that. I would be most grateful if the Leader would organise such a debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I was shaken when I heard that Senator Fitzgerald had tendered his resignation. I have known him for a long time. We first met in 1977 when we were both contesting a general election for the first time. I was on the party's agricultural panel and Senator Fitzgerald was on the administrative panel. We helped each other. On that occasion, I was lucky enough to be elected but Senator Fitzgerald lost out by a narrow margin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1981, both Senator Fitzgerald and I were on the same panel and we were both elected. I do not know whether we helped each other on that <Col N="1565" /> occasion. Since then, we have developed a strong friendship. We are from neighbouring counties and our friendship has never waned. When Senator Fitzgerald was a Whip, he was most courteous and fair. He had the co-operation of all those with whom he worked.</P>
    <P>Through my friendship with Senator Fitzgerald, I also developed a good friendship with his wife, Bridie, and their family. I am delighted to see that they are attending this meeting of the House today. I will treasure this friendship forever. I am delighted to hear that the Senator is on the road to recovering his good health. I wish him good health and happiness in his retirement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that, since the last election, arrangements have been made to welcome newcomers to this House. When I joined this House in 1993, no such arrangements were in place, but there was Senator Tom Fitzgerald. He met me on my first day, took me around and explained to me the traditions, customs and little rules by which we should abide. I had not met him before, but we established an immediate friendship. The House will be poorer without Senator Tom Fitzgerald and I am delighted his family is here to recognise and to acknowledge the huge admiration and love so many of us have developed for him over the years. His role of welcoming new Members to the House presumably will be taken over by administrative staff, but nobody can replace the joy, enthusiasm, humour and commitment he demonstrated. He will be greatly missed.</P>
      <P>I was not under the impression this was likely to be the last day of our session and I therefore want to support Senator Costello regarding the need to debate the economy. The management of our economy at present could be compared to a business coming close to its AGM when the financial controller says: &ldquo;Do not worry, we are looking after things. I know we have problems, that the expenditure is a bit over and the income is a bit less than we planned, but our mind is distracted at the moment because we have this big AGM coming up.&rdquo;  I have a fear that nobody is minding the shop as we approach the election. I always have this fear in election year. It is not necessarily any different this time, but some of the figures coming through concern me. The inflation rate is double the European average and we are over-spending. On that basis, the Leader must find time for a debate on the economy. We must ensure somebody is minding the shop when we are all distracted by the proximity of an election.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I also wish to refer to the retirement of Senator Tom Fitzgerald. I did not know Senator Fitzgerald before I came to this House, although I had heard much about him from friends and clients of mine in the fishing industry. Everything they told me about him was confirmed when I got to know him. I was only in this House a few days when he abdicated as spokes<Col N="1566" /> person on the marine and natural resources and I was appointed to the role.</P>
      <P>In my first two or three days here, I had the opportunity to make my maiden speech on an issue that I knew nothing about, the famous Loran C mast that was to be erected in County Clare. Senator Fitzgerald brought me to his office, removed his file and lectured me for hours on the Loran C mast. He gave me great advice on many subsequent occasions in relation to marine matters.</P>
      <P>I was delighted both of us were successful in changing regulations in relation to a special class of white fish licence introduced by his good friend, Charles Haughey, but which restricted fishermen on the west coast from entering Box 6 to fish for white fish. We succeeded in having the Minister, Deputy Woods, overturn the regulations. While his friend, Charles Haughey, introduced the legislation, it was Senator Tom Fitzgerald who eventually obtained proper rights for fishermen.</P>
      <P>In all the years I have known him in this House, he has always been very helpful, courteous and friendly, although stern when necessary. I met two of his children, who are here today, and I know they are very proud of his achievements. I know also that he was equally proud of them. I wish him many years of happiness in retirement and wish himself and Bridie many years together.</P>
      <P>I asked a number of weeks ago for a debate on the fishing industry. I thought about it and decided to do what Tom would have done, which is to represent the people of my constituency. I am, therefore, asking the Leader if it is possible to have a debate on salmon quotas in Dingle and Donegal. I am not convinced that we know the full story, despite the scientific evidence. The Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources should attend the House to debate this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, was saddened to hear of the retirement of Senator Tom Fitzgerald. I worked closely with Tom as Assistant Whip from 1994 to 1997. I could not believe the dedication and commitment he had for his position. He was a natural politician rather than an applied one and he worked hard to meet people and work with them. He did his job as a people's representative without stress or strain and found it easy to deal with all sorts of personalities, from academics to the man in the street. No matter what a person's role in society, Tom was able to talk to them on all levels. His capacity to do so was a revelation to me and it demonstrated how important it is for a politician to have such flair, which is becoming less evident these days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I saw how Senator Tom Fitzgerald worked and behaved with people and I will miss him as a colleague in the House. I had many rows with him but within five minutes he would put his arms around me as if nothing had happened. I might still be seething but it did not matter to Tom because the Seanad was running smoothly. He was very committed and always fearful that the <Col N="1567" /> job would not be done properly. One would have to award him 100% plus for the work he did as Chief Whip. He was a real parliamentarian and I am sorry to see him go. I am delighted to see his family present in the Visitors Gallery. I wish Tom well in his retirement and I wish good health and happiness to him, his wife Bridie and their family for many years to come. Over the next few months I will be rambling around Kerry and I look forward to seeing him at home there and in good health.</P>

I met him on various occasions when he was canvassing from 1979 onwards, but I got to know him really well in 1989 when I became a Member of the House. Senator Tom Fitzgerald is a very kind man who always took time to explain the procedures of the House to new Members. I am grateful to him for having taken the time to explain the workings of the House to me when I first arrived in 1989. I am delighted to have served in the Seanad with him for almost 13 years. I wish him, his wife Bridie, and their family every good health, happiness and God's blessing in the years to come.</P>

      <P>I join with others in paying tribute to Senator Tom Fitzgerald whom I first met in 1981. It was the year in which I was able to exercise my first Seanad vote, having been first elected to the House in 1979. At around the same time, I met a young candidate from Strokestown, County Roscommon, by the name of Brian Mullooly who was on the Labour Panel. As my wife is from Roscommon, I was reminded that I had to support Mr. Mullooly, although there was opposition in County Westmeath at the time.</P>
      <P>Senator Tom Fitzgerald has a heart as big as the Kerry mountains. On a number of visits there, I stayed with the Fitzgerald family. Tom's wife, Bridie, was a very genial hostess and Tom took great pride in showing the attractions of Dingle, including the aquarium, and recalling the history of the town. When I first arrived in this House as a new Member, he advised me of the great honour which had been bestowed on me by being elected to the Seanad. He took great pride in his own membership of the House and he instilled that same pride in other colleagues. To Tom and Bridie, to the members of their family who are present in the Visitors Gallery and to their many friends, I extend my good wishes and the good wishes of my wife. I wish Tom the very best of health and good luck in the future. Seanad Éireann will be the poorer for his absence from the House.</P>

I met him first in 1987, as a new councillor, when he came to visit me in the course of the Seanad election. In subsequent elections, he was one of those to whose visits I always looked forward. It was a great pleasure to know him then and it was a particular pleasure to know him here as a Member of the Seanad. As other Members said, I found, on my arrival here as a novice, that he was always available to guide, assist and support. In particular, he tried to familiarise me with the IT system, with which he had a special fascination. Regretfully, I have not yet managed to emulate his skill with PCs and laptop computers. I wish Tom and his family long life and happiness together as a just reward for his magnificent service to the State in this House.</P>

      <P>I join colleagues on all sides of the House in paying a warm tribute to Senator Tom Fitzgerald. One of his great strengths, which has already been recalled today and which struck me in earlier days when I was in the other House, was his tremendous sense of loyalty to his party leader at that time, Mr. C. J. Haughey. Perhaps I had a somewhat different perspective during those times, which I do not wish to recall in detail. At all times, one of the great features Tom displayed was his friendliness and sense of accommodation for all points of view within our party. I greatly valued his particular gifts and strengths which he brought to his relationship with people. I also valued his lovely, disarming smile, even when times were bad &ndash; and there were bad times. It is a great strength in a politician to have the depth of conviction which Tom showed and, <Col N="1569" /> at the same time, to have the ability to accommodate other points of view.</P>
      <P>Like others, I will miss Tom greatly from the House, particularly for his sense of friendship and commitment to the job. Occasionally, over the past four or five years, words may have been exchanged in the House but Tom was always first to come forward with a gentle, kindly reminder of our duties and the purpose we are here to serve. His many strengths have been well articulated by other speakers. I wish him, his wife, Bridie and their family many happy years together.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Senator Tom Fitzgerald, I know he would feel greatly honoured by the tributes paid to him in the House today by 22 Senators over 70 minutes. In my 20 years as a Member of the House, I cannot recall such tributes as have been expressed this morning on the major contribution of a Senator who is a very humble man, but very firm. He has played a major role in what has probably been the most successful term of Seanad Éireann, with some 61 Bills initiated in the House. The report of this morning's proceedings will be with him by the weekend and I know he will appreciate the spirit of the heartfelt tributes paid to him by Senators for the great work he has done in the national interest.</P>
      <P>With regard to Senator Manning's point on the Order of Business, the Minister has accepted many amendments which were highlighted during the Second Stage debate on the Bill in question. I thank the Leaders and the Whips for their co-operation in the passage of this Bill.</P>

His contributions in that area were extraordinary. His interest in marine issues did not lie in Dingle or Kerry alone, he was interested in all such areas throughout the country. He constantly represented those who lived by, and on, the sea from a leisure and fisheries point of view. I wish him a speedy return to good health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment arises from a suggestion made by Senator O'Toole on Committee Stage. The focus of the Bill is such that a child with special educational needs cannot benefit from the ordinary school programme in the way the child without such needs can. While this is implicit in the definition as drafted, it is desirable it is made explicit to remove any possible doubt in this <Col N="1571" /> regard. The amendment, as drafted, will achieve this. I thank Senator O'Toole for his help in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not mean to gazump the Leader of the Opposition. I welcome this amendment which, as the Minister has put in context, is in response to a detailed debate on Committee Stage led, in particular, by Senator O'Toole who is unable to be here as he had to attend a very important meeting. He asked me to welcome this amendment on his behalf. The 14 Government amendments tabled reflect the intensity of the debate on Committee Stage. We, on this side of the House, are very glad the Minister has taken on board so many of our amendments which materially alter and improve the Bill.</P>
      <P>It is one of the benefits of Seanad Éireann that when legislation is introduced in this House for the first time we are able to bring the kind of expertise which Senator O'Toole has, coming from the education area. If I may humble myself, I taught for a while in Trinity College and have taken enormous interest in this issue. That the Minister has introduced this amendment is very much to be welcomed. I hope there have been parallel discussions with the interest groups &ndash; this matter has been repeatedly raised by Senator Manning.</P>
      <P>I welcome this amendment which makes clear that the interests of the child are paramount and that the child must not be seen in a negative sense but rather in a positive sense. I appreciate that the Minister has accepted this wording which is virtually exactly as proposed by Senator O'Toole and supported by me during the debate.</P>

The Bill has been significantly changed by the inclusion of these amendments.</P>
      <P>However &ndash; I do not wish to seem churlish &ndash; I regret we are taking this Bill today. While the Minister has gone part of the way and listened to the points raised from a teaching and educational point of view, he has not listened to the views of those with disabilities. The National Association for Mentally Handicapped of Ireland has very fundamental problems with this legislation. The Minister, before coming to this House to take Report Stage, should have consulted with the association and he could have been as generous with it as he was with Senators O'Toole, Burke and Norris in this House last week.</P>
      <P>I welcome the way the Minister has handled the points raised last week. I welcome all the amendments although I will not speak on any more of them. I regret we could not have waited until the required consultation took place.</P>

      <P>I welcome this amendment. Like Senator Manning, the representations received from the various societies and associations &ndash; parents of people with disabilities or people who are disabled themselves &ndash; leaves me wishing the Minister had waited to hear some of their points. The position remains whereby &ldquo;a child&rdquo; means a person not less than three years of age and not more than 18 years of age. Many of those who contacted me on this Bill are particularly anxious that the education of the child should begin immediately the disability is discovered. They are also anxious about the provision whereby a person is merely referred to the health boards having reaching 18 years of age. This amendment improves the Bill.</P>

      <P>I will not delay the House by repeating what has been said. When I first became a Member of this House I was not too sure about how I would look upon Bills because I did not have legislative experience. Coming from a business background, I decided to look for the customer in every Bill, be it a health Bill as it relates to a patient or a road traffic Bill as it relates to users of the roads.</P>
      <P>The Minister has, in this case, responded to the customer from an educational point of view in particular. Due to the time limits, I welcome the amendments tabled by the Minister. It is a reminder of the benefit of this House and of being able to take a second look at things. However, I agree with Senator Manning's concern that, in the limited time, it is unlikely that anything more than this could have been done. Questions remain to be answered and I hope we can return to this in the future.</P>
      <P>Senator Henry touched on the question of pre-school education. There is a strong case to be made for pre-school education in any form but an even stronger case for pre-school education for those who suffer from disabilities. Families who have this disadvantage and the trauma that goes with it would benefit from this and serious attention should be given to this issue in the immediate future.</P>

      <P>In the last week I have been very critical, and rightly so, of a number of issues. However, the progress that has been made on school-based education is acceptable to me and this meets some needs in terms of delivering education through the school system. I do not know what consultation took place with other groups, but since the consultation with the INTO last week I appreciate the efforts that have been made to deal with the six or seven substantial problems I had with the Bill. I accept that progress has been made in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very narrow Bill, but we must accept that it is to do with school rather than education from womb to tomb or education for life. Whether more should be done is another issue. It is somewhat impractical to consider delivering an education plan through teachers at school level <Col N="1573" /> for children under the age of three years. That is not to say that there should not be appropriate provisions for younger children with disabilities but I am not sure that the education plan could be delivered effectively to those younger than three years. Education does not finish at 18 years of age and I have spoken regularly about this outside the House. When the Constitution mentions the right to primary education, what it means is the right to a fundamental education and there is no age limit involved. This Bill is useful within the narrow confines of what can be delivered in schools for children aged three to 18 years. This should be seen as meeting one level of need and we should now look at the wider area of people with disabilities beyond the age of 18 years. We should have a Bill to deal with their needs as this Bill does not do so.</P>
    <P>This Bill recognises the input schools can have, which, in a way, has never been seen before. It recognises the importance of the school in developing an educational plan and the importance of getting teachers involved. Last week Senator Burke and I spoke on a number of occasions about the problems of having this plan implemented at school level. The relationships were a little complicated but this has now been addressed. More importantly, the Bill also deals with making money available at school level for implementation. I will support all the amendments today. They represent progress, but there are still aspects of education for persons with disabilities which are not dealt with in this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators for their contributions. The discussion has highlighted the fact that this is a Bill about education. I am not attempting to resolve all the other problems that exist, but I am specifically attempting to resolve the problems with education. This Bill provides what many parents have long demanded: close involvement in decisions on their children's education, a statutory right to assessment of needs and a statutory duty for the State to fulfil these needs, individual education plans, early intervention, integrated education, continuing education and training for adults with special education needs and co-ordinated action from the education and health agencies. It goes a long way towards meeting these requirements. It is not perfect but it is a huge leap forward in terms of statutory provision for children within the education system and for adults when they go beyond that stage. Section 15 deals with early intervention before the age of three years, but, as Senator O'Toole said, school is not necessarily the best place for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already obtained the agreement and resources to do many of these things administratively. However, I want to go beyond that and give people a statutory right, a right which is enforceable. That is what is in this Bill and it is very important that we get these rights onto the Statute Book. I have been anxious to do this as I know, as Senators mentioned, that time is run<Col N="1574" /> ning out. As I explained earlier, there has been some difficulty in getting to this point but we are here and I would like to copperfasten the changes which have been made. Any future Dáil or Seanad may refine these provisions further, but very important basic rights are enshrined here.</P>
    <P>We have already obtained an agreement where children with autism and other disabilities will be taken into the school system from the age of three. The legal age for starting school is six but almost everybody starts from age four. A child cannot start school before the age of four. There are many questions to be dealt with in terms of the pre-school side of things. However, children with special needs can now start at age three. That is being introduced administratively &ndash; it can only be set up where an agreement to that effect has taken place. This Bill, however, will enshrine this as a legal entitlement from the age of three.</P>
    <P>In section 15 there is provision for a statutory right to early intervention. This has been misunderstood by the public, largely because the Bill mentions specifically the formal education system from ages three to 18. In section 16 there is also provision for adults beyond age 18 and that, again, has been slightly misunderstood. My officials have already begun the further consultation process on the provisions in the Bill, based on long consultation and discussions and the findings of task forces and review bodies. Senator O'Toole mentioned that he is happy with the consultation that took place and recognises that the Bill is useful.</P>
    <P>I accepted some of Senator Burke's amendments on Committee Stage, so they are already in the Bill. I agree entirely with Senator Quinn that we have to consider the customer, particularly in this area where the customer is the child with special needs. The national council which is provided for in the Bill on a statutory basis will have the duty of looking after that customer. We are setting this up administratively. I have staffing and other approval and the advertisements should come out within the next couple of weeks. Senator O'Toole mentioned the difficulties and impracticalities involved in providing pre-school education for children with special needs below the age of three. Now they are legally entitled to this at the age of three, which I think is very good from the point of view of introducing them to mainstream education. I have only mentioned these points because they were raised by Senators.</P>

Under the provisions for this Bill, the principal of a school will have a statutory obligation to prepare an education plan for the appropriate education of a child where an assessment has been carried out. To fulfil this duty, he or she will need access to the advice of a multi-disciplinary team in the same way as the special needs organiser under the Bill where an education plan is prepared at the direction of the council.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Concern was expressed on Committee Stage about section 10(4) of the Bill. As currently drafted, the principal, in preparing an education plan, cannot depart from the guidelines for preparing these plans unless he decides there are good and sufficient reasons for doing so. This decision can only be made with the consent of the special education needs organiser. There was concern this provision created a situation at school level where the professional judgment of a principal could be second guessed by another person. I appreciate the difficulties this could potentially cause.</P>
      <P>I propose to provide that the principal will require the consent of the council rather than the special education needs organiser for a departure from guidelines. To support more fully the principal's autonomy in this area, a new subsection (5) confers a right on him or her to appeal a refusal by the council to consent to a departure from the guidelines. The appeal will be made to the appeals board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment addresses three key issues regarding the content of education plans. The new subsection (7) to be inserted makes it clear that there is a statutory duty on the school to implement an education plan. This will encompass not merely the provision of education to children already enrolled in the school, but also the admission of children with special education needs to the school where that is determined by an education plan.</P>
      <P>This new subsection creates an entitlement on the part of schools to be provided with the necessary resources to implement the plan. This provision underpins my obligation as Minister under section 13 of the Bill to make financial resources available for the provision of appropriate education to children with special education needs.</P>
      <P>It will also serve to reinforce the duty on health boards under section 36. The role of the boards in respect of special education in schools arises in the context of providing access to therapies and health related services. It would be neither desirable nor efficient to create the situation where the education system sought to replicate the services now provided by the boards. One of the key objectives of the Bill is to bring clarity to the important support role which the boards have to play in the education of children and adults with special education needs.</P>
      <P>The new subsection (8) provides for a situation where an education plan has been prepared for a child and he or she is to change schools. The provision guarantees a system of consultation between the schools regarding the plan to ensure the new school is aware of the child's needs, has the capability to deliver the plan and that there is an opportunity to amend the plan where this is necessary having regard to the child's special educational needs and the new school's operation.</P>
      <P>These additions to the Bill's provisions will substantially strengthen the value, utility and effectiveness of education plans. Senators asked for this on Committee Stage and I told them it would be done on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>Concerns were expressed on Committee Stage about representation of the edu<Col N="1579" /> cation partners on the national council. A number of Senators spoke on this point. I listened carefully to what was said and reflected on contributions following the debate. Senators will be aware from my earlier statements that my objective for composition of the council is to ensure a small, focused group who have a grounding in special education issues. The risk of naming particular groups or bodies in the legislation is that it will generate demands for inclusion from a very wide spectrum of interests, many of which would have an equally arguable case for inclusion. Therefore, the approach I have adopted is to recognise the legitimate interest which the education partners have in this matter by providing for up to four nominees from the interests mentioned. At the same time, I propose to increase the number on the council to 13.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment is definitely an improvement. While the Minister is quite right to emphasise that one must try to keep the number of people on the council manageable, the new figure is not unmanageable. I am disappointed, however, that another matter which I raised during my Second Stage contribution has not been addressed, namely, the absence of a place on the council for persons with a disability. While I accept such persons are not specifically excluded, I had hoped the amendment would refer to them because many people with a disability would be the most useful people to have on such a council. Given that disabilities cover a wide spectrum, we must be careful not to confine ourselves to intellectual disability. When the Minister nominates the members of the council, I hope he will try to include as many people with a disability as possible because those disabled people who have experience of trying to receive an education are extraordinarily important.</P>
      <P>It is also very important to note that one is not necessarily born with a disability, that it can be acquired. Therefore, two groups need to be considered in this context, namely, those born with a disability and those who have acquired a disability and are in a position to describe what life was like before and after this often very chastening experience. Anyone who has experienced disability during his or her life will be aware of the degree to which life becomes more difficult if one cannot continue as before. I hope people with acquired disabilities are given priority when the Minister establishes the council.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister and the Government for moving this legislation forward. While there was considerable ill feeling on the initial stages, I am delighted the Minister has introduced amendments at the request of the Opposition and considered the Bill in a broad context. The Minister has recognised that outstanding issues remain. Nevertheless, it provides a statutory framework to reflect the needs and rights of people with disabilities to an education and introduces an education plan to facilitate this right. While it can be improved, the Bill will ensure that from now on there will be close co-operation with disability groups.</P>

However, I remain very critical of the way in which the Bill was introduced. I compliment the Minister on the way in which he listened to the Committee Stage debate in this House and the manner in which he has responded through these amendments. As I stated at the outset, the process of consultation is only half complete. I hope the Minister will follow the Taoiseach's advice by talking and listening to the various groups, many of them representing practitioners, which have expressed dissatisfaction with the Bill in very strong terms. Once this has been done and the Bill goes before the other House, I suspect it will be substantially amended. I do not know who will be in the Houses after the election, but I suspect that whoever the Minister is, he will probably experience a very full debate on the amended Bill. That said, there is no disagreement on the objectives the Minister seeks to achieve.</P>

      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions today and for the excellent debate the other night to which I have responded. It is important, as Senator Ormonde said, to try to complete the statutory framework. I have the chance to do that now and I would like to do so. I know there are those who want a constitutional framework and there is nothing to stop them pursuing that in a democracy. However, it is a long road and many issues will arise, such as the balance of rights, etc. I am making much progress on the administrative side and I hope to make more soon. This is a good, solid statutory framework. I will continue to do what we have started and to have further consultation about what is included in it. My officials are involved in that process. I thank my officials, led by Tom Boland who is with me today, for the work they have put into it. It genuinely supports people with special needs. If we put it on the Statute Book, it will make a huge difference in the future.</P>
      <P>Senator Manning said he does not know who will be in Government after the election. That is the nature of democracy. However, it is all the more reason to try to put it on the Statute Book. We have a good idea of what is involved and we have set up task forces and review committees. I am sorry it was not possible to bring the Bill before the House earlier. I thank Senators for their co-operation and excellent contributions. I also thank the staff of the House for dealing with it in an urgent manner.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend to the Seanad the Medical Practitioners (Amendment) Bill, 2002, which addresses important issues relating to the registration of medical practitioners. This Bill represents a first step in the ongoing <Col N="1583" /> programme to update and revise the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978.</P>
      <P>The public health service is dependent, above all else, on the people who provide the service. Without the health service staff who, week in week out, provide a high quality service it simply could not function. To ensure that the service had access to doctors of the highest quality, and that the interests of patients were treated as paramount, the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978, set out to regulate the practice of medicine in Ireland through the mechanism of the registration of medical practitioners. Under the Act the Medical Council was established as the statutory authority that oversees the registration and regulation of doctors and also evaluates the suitability of the medical education and training provided by any body within the State. The council's constitution and additional functions are set out in detail in the Act.</P>
      <P>It has been recognised for some time that the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978, no longer meets the needs of a modern health service but it is intended that a new amendment to that Bill, which is a substantial piece of legislation, will be brought forward in the autumn. New legislation which will provide for the regulation of nursing and midwifery is currently being prepared and the preparation of draft heads of a Bill to govern the regulation of the professions allied to medicine is at an advanced stage. When passed, these Bills, along with the Bill to update the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978, will provide a legislative framework for the regulation of the health professionals that will ensure the highest level of competence among those who provide our health services.</P>
      <P>In the national health strategy, Quality and Fairness &ndash; a Health System for You, a commitment was given to undertake an independent audit of functions and structures in the health system. The results of the audit of the Medical Council, Comhairle na nOspidéal and the Postgraduate Medical and Dental Board obviously will have to be taken into account in drafting the heads of the new Bill. Last month the Minister launched the national task force on medical staffing. The task force will examine the implementation of the medical manpower forum report and the Hanly report on the working hours of non-consultant hospital doctors. It will also examine the area of medical education and training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Medical Council has also brought forward a number of proposals for change. The council wants to improve its efficiency and delivery of services. It has also undertaken an exercise to set out a scheme for competence assurance for doctors. The proposed scheme will encompass continuous medical education, continuous professional development and clinical audit and peer review. The purpose of competence assurance is to ensure that doctors maintain the highest levels of competence and awareness of developments in their field of expertise. The Department of <Col N="1584" /> Health and Children will work closely with the Medical Council in further developing this scheme.</P>
    <P>The new Act will also address issues surrounding the area of fitness to practice procedures. The streamlining of procedures and the appropriateness of committee structures will be examined. The question of the council's accountability and timely provision of relevant information to the Minister, employers and the public will be provided for.</P>
    <P>There are, however, a number of priority issues that cannot wait until a new Act is passed and which must be addressed urgently to avoid any potential disruption to service delivery. It is for this reason that I present the Medical Practitioners (Amendment) Bill, 2002, to the House today. The most important amendment being proposed today is to section 27(2) of the current Act. Approximately 3,600 non-consultant hospital doctors are employed in the health service. Of this number approximately 1,600 are temporary registered doctors who come from outside the European Union. These doctors provide essential services in our hospitals and in some rural areas these doctors constitute over 60% of the NCHD cohort.</P>
    <P>As many of these doctors joined the Irish health service before the implementation of the temporary registration assessment scheme, they have not sat the TRAS exam. This has affected their ability to move from the temporary register to the permanent register. Under the 1978 Act, only qualifications and training can be taken into account when considering applications for the permanent register. The current legislation, while recognising the training element, does not permit the Medical Council to give due regard to the relevant experience gained while working in the public health service by doctors applying for full registration, despite the fact that some temporary registered doctors have spent up to seven years working in the Irish public health service. At the same time graduates of Irish medical schools who have completed just one year of postgraduate internship can apply for full registration.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that employers and regulatory bodies in other jurisdictions are only too happy to recruit and permanently register these doctors based on the experience they have gained while employed in the Irish health service. At a time when the Irish public hospital system is undertaking extensive recruitment initiatives to ensure that all medical posts are filled, we must ensure that every effort is made to retain the complement of doctors currently within our hospital service. Many of these temporary registered doctors are reaching the end of the period of temporary registration and may be lost to the Irish health service if we do not take action. In addition, changes in European Union law and a recent ruling of the European Court of Justice require us to take account of relevant experience gained within the EU when assessing applications from EU citizens for full registration.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1585" />The amending Bill also proposes a number of health care settings, such as community-based services and general practice, in which a doctor in training could and should gain very valuable experience and which, at present, are not approved for training purposes.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Martin, is concerned to ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place in certain areas of health care, such as cosmetic surgery for example, where doctors may be entering the jurisdiction for short periods to carry out such procedures. This is a matter of some concern to the Minister and it is our intention to deal with it in some detail in the comprehensive Bill to be brought forward later this year. It is accepted, however, that some urgent steps must be taken at this time and these are addressed in the amending Bill.</P>
    <P>The main proposal contained in the Medical Practitioners (Amendment) Bill, 2002, is to allow validated professional experience to be taken into account in the assessment of applications for full registration on the Register of Medical Practitioners. Under current legislation, only training and qualifications can be acknowledged when considering such applications. This Bill will enable the Medical Council to make rules regarding applications for full registration in which relevant, validated experience will be taken into account as well as, or instead of, prescribed courses of training.</P>
    <P>The amending Bill will allow doctors in training under intern registration and temporary registration to work in a variety of health care settings, to be specified by the Medical Council, whereas the current legislation confines these doctors to the acute hospital sector. The council will be enabled to make rules to regulate the type of health care setting where such training can be carried out. The Bill makes provision for any EU citizen who has obtained their primary medical degree within the EU to be granted internship registration in Ireland. At present, only graduates of Irish universities can undertake their internship registration in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes provision for the indefinite extension of temporary registration for a doctor who has made application for full registration. The period of temporary registration in this instance is extended until such time as a final decision is made with regard to the doctor's application for full registration. The Bill also makes provision for the Medical Council to make rules regarding temporary registration for doctors entering the jurisdiction to work for short periods. The council will also be enabled to make rules regarding those who employ or contract the services of such doctors.</P>
    <P>Staffing requirements of hospitals and the deployment of staff within hospitals are primarily a matter for local management having regard to the services which hospitals are expected to provide. Particular staffing difficulties have been faced by the health services in recent years across a wide range of areas, particularly in the medical, <Col N="1586" /> paramedical and nursing areas. The Department of Health and Children, in conjunction with the health service employers agency, assists at national level with the development of a policy framework that will enable employers to identify vacancies, to locate, recruit and train suitable candidates for the vacant posts and to retain the staff in whom they have invested significant time and resources.</P>
    <P>In the health strategy, under the action plan for people management, the Government set out its plan for the health service to become an employer of choice. In this regard the strategy commits the Government to investment in training and education for health sector staff; implementation of best practices in employment policies and procedures; building and enhancing the management function; improving the quality of working life for our health service staff; developing performance management; promoting improved industrial relations in the health sector; and developing the partnership approach further. Work on the action plan is already underway and is being undertaken in the context of partnership and consultation.</P>
    <P>This amendment to the Medical Practitioners Act represents yet another measure to improve the working arrangements for non-consultant hospital doctors. On a broader front, the issues relating to the medical staffing of hospitals were addressed by the medical manpower forum. With particular regard to non-consultant hospital doctors, the forum sought to redress the imbalance between career posts and training posts, the need to improve postgraduate medical training to keep more Irish medical graduates in the country and the need to look at the position of women in medicine in Ireland with a view to reducing the number who leave medicine.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the national task force on medical staffing was established by the Minister, Deputy Martin, to prepare and cost an implementation plan for a new approach to hospital services, based on appropriately trained doctors providing patients with the highest quality service. The task force will prepare detailed implementation programmes based on the two key reports already mentioned which were published last year &ndash; the Hanly report and the report of the medical manpower forum. The implementation programme will be addressed in the context of the new health strategy, Quality and Fairness &ndash; A Health System for You, which was published last November.</P>
    <P>Every analysis to date comes back to the same key point &ndash; we are overdependent on junior doctors who, while still in training, are required to provide 24 hour, seven day medical care under the formal supervision of individual consultants. A number of factors affect consultants' ability to be present on site at weekends, evenings and during the night. Patients in turn may have limited access to appropriate levels of senior clinical decision making, with implications for safety of diagnosis and treatment on the one hand and <Col N="1587" /> efficiency and cost-effectiveness on the other. As an independent entity, the task force is in a good position to develop a suitable cost-effective model which best meets patient safety and quality concerns, as well as contributing centrally to the two fundamental principles reflected in the title of the new health strategy, Quality and Fairness &ndash; A Health System for You. It also addresses some of the key national goals of the strategy, which relate to responsive and appropriate care and high performance.</P>
    <P>Public health systems, demographics and lifestyles, technology and expectations are exhibiting an international pattern of unprecedented change and challenge, which urgently demand new methods. In preparing the new strategy, it was necessary to look critically and constructively at service issues such as the length of the working day and how we provide cover over this longer period; the redrawing of professional boundaries; organising care and service delivery around the patient rather than <i>vice versa</i>; and a much more dynamic and committed approach to managing quality. The health service will continue to make the case for additional investment, provided we can work collaboratively in making the necessary reforms to yield improved results.</P>
    <P>The message from the medical profession expressing its willingness to be more flexible, while maintaining admirably high standards under pressure, is very much welcomed by the Government. Where there is a clear willingness to jointly reassess in a fundamental way some of the assumptions attached to the inadequate <i>status quo</i>, the Government's response can also be flexible. By adopting an open approach together to face change and modernisation, implementation of the strategy will ensure the best use of resources, the sharing of best practice across all disciplines and the provision of significant additional funding.</P>
    <P>In addition to the steps already outlined, the Department of Health and Children has been working closely with the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Foreign Affairs in exploring how the processing of visas and work permits can be streamlined to assist health service employers with their recruiting drives. In this regard the possibility of extending the working visa-work authorisation scheme, which already applies to nurses, to other health service staff has been examined by the departmental group. The scheme would provide a more flexible mechanism for regulating the entry of non-EU and non-EEA citizens into Ireland for the purpose of working in the health service. It is hoped to progress this initiative in the very short term.</P>
    <P>Health service providers and members of the public would like to have the best quality and range of services available. This is a worthy aspiration since service demands are triggered largely by issues such as demographic change &ndash; an increasing population that is living for longer and <Col N="1588" /> the continual and rapid developments in health technology. It is part of the role of the Minister for Health and Children to, in the first instance, measure the real need for additional services, taking account of public expectations as well as the expert view. A second and subsequent demand of that role is to bridge the gap between current provision and what is needed as speedily and efficiently as possible.</P>
    <P>There has been a dramatic and well-documented increase in the provision of funding to the health service over the life of the Government. Gross non-capital expenditure has risen by 129% from 1997 to 2002. The Government is committed to maintaining sufficient support to empower professionals to continually improve the services in our hospitals and in the community in general. On the capital side, the high level of investment by the Government will continue over the period of the national development plan, demonstrating a considerable increase in capital investment relative to any previous historic period. Again, examining the level of capital funding provided over the life of the Government, 2002 boasts a capital funding allocation to the health sector that equals a 260% increase on the 1997 figure.</P>
    <P>I am seeking the co-operation of the House in amending the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978, to allow for further revised registration arrangements for doctors. Whether originating in Ireland, Europe or beyond, there is no doubt that medical personnel are a major and key resource to the Irish health services, deserving of acknowledgement and support. This amending Bill, in conjunction with the main Bill later this year, will be key factors in ensuring that, in five years, there should no longer be shortages in those crucial disciplines which are currently holding back the development of much needed services.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. She has asked for our co-operation in passing this Bill and she will have it. In her speech, the Minister clearly outlined the need for this Bill. It is a very specific Bill that is precise in what it is proposed to do. Unlike speakers in the other House, I do not feel the need to wander over the entire spectrum of health issues in my short contribution.</P>
      <P>The availability of a supply of properly qualified personnel for our health service is close to the centre of the current problems in the health service. I do not use the word &ldquo;crisis&rdquo; because I do not believe there is a crisis in the health service. We need to ensure a steady supply of qualified people and there should be flexibility in that. I do not know the proportion of non-Irish staff in our hospitals, but it must be almost as great as those who are Irish and this proportion is likely to increase. Our dependence on this category of professional will become even greater in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1589" />I welcome the quality assurance schemes outlined by the Minister, which will be part of future legislation. Speaking for the universities, in the past we measured ourselves against the best Irish or British practice. Now we have to measure ourselves against best international practice. That is true of every area of professional activity now and medicine above all should operate within a framework of proper continuing quality assurance measurements. The next Minister, whoever that may be, will certainly get a warm welcome from all sides of the House when this legislation is introduced.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said, this is urgent legislation and it represents a holding operation in some ways. Nobody could disagree with the objectives outlined by the Minister. The steps to increase the powers of the Medical Council should ensure there is a supply of personnel and the problems outlined by the Minister can be addressed as a matter of urgency. I have nothing more to say about the Bill. I may raise some specific questions on Committee Stage, but having said that I welcome the Bill and we will assist in its speedy passage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I too welcome this Bill. It is important to keep the doctors in our employment and without this legislation, many doctors now working would complete their contracts and would have to leave. That would be a terrible blow to our health service because doctors represent a very precious commodity. It takes a long time for them to qualify and enter the health service, and we cannot afford to lose them.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provision in the Bill allowing doctors to keep abreast of new training and facilities. Every day we hear of new surveys and research into various aspects of people's health. There are specialised areas dealing with various problems. It is important for the consultants to have time to educate themselves and refresh their knowledge in new facilities and methods.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the fact that the capital funding provided during the life of the Government boasts a capital funding allocation to the health sector that equals an increase of 260% on the 1997 figure. This is refreshing for those of us who were on health boards when money was scarce and we had to pass tight budgets. Regardless of what Government was in power, in the North Western Health Board we lived within our budget. As I have said here before, in keeping within such a budget when we were in Opposition, I incurred the wrath of some within my party. However, I always believed it was wrong to play politics with the health service. The problems must be faced up to and we must make the best use of the money available to provide the best service. I am pleased to be able to boast that we always provided a good service in the north west and still do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When people complain now, it is not for more money. They want more facilities and equipment &ndash; the finance is there. A country without a good <Col N="1590" /> health service is lost. For those of us who are getting on in years it is important to know there is a medical service to look after us. I congratulate the Minister on the health strategy and the work he is doing in promoting a better health service. I congratulate him on bringing in this holding Bill, as Senator Manning called it, to ensure no doctors are lost from the service. I welcome the Bill and commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. She gave a really splendid speech, but I wish we had the main Bill before us now rather than having to wait until the autumn. When the Government came to office new medical practitioners legislation was promised and I am extremely disappointed there has been such a delay in introducing it. At least the explanatory memorandum is honest in saying this Bill has to be brought forward as a matter of urgency. While I agree it needs to be introduced as a matter of urgency, I pointed out to the House over three years ago that we would arrive at a point where we would be bereft of non-EU doctors who are the main service providers in our health service because the Medical Council had changed its training regulations.</P>
      <P>I know that the Medical Council has reservations about this Bill in regard to those getting permanent registration. More than three years ago the Medical Council decided that people with temporary registration could only be employed in approved training posts. When it examined the facilities for training in hospitals around the country, it decided some of them were inadequate for the proper training of doctors. In this Bill, we are ensuring that people can work in hospitals because they have permanent registration despite the fact that the Medical Council thinks those posts are not adequate for training and that some people in these posts require further training. So, we are giving permanent registration to people without proper training and not assessing their competence. This cannot be regarded as a good thing. Proper training is essential to have a proper health service and we know that many of the rural hospitals which are almost totally staffed by non-EU graduates, many of an excellent calibre, are not approved for training posts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two types of non-EU doctors here. First, there are those who have come here from abroad and are charged extremely high fees from our medical schools to qualify here. Until very recently, when they qualified they were treated very shabbily by the system. There is a shortage of intern posts so non-EU graduates frequently found they had to work in supernumerary posts without payment so that they could obtain full registration here despite the fact that we had taken considerable money from them over the years. One brave non-national recently took a case under the equality legislation and won. All those now employed in these posts must be paid, and rightly so. I hope all those employed in such posts in the past will get the money to which they <Col N="1591" /> are entitled for the time they held our health service together.</P>
    <P>The second group of non-EU doctors are those who qualified in their own countries. Many who come here are the brightest and the best. They come here for further training to perhaps get membership of the Royal College of Physicians and the Royal College of Surgeons and to study in the various fields so that they can return to their countries and make a contribution. The service they give this country in the meantime is unbelievable, yet they have been outrageously exploited. My profession has played an important role in this.</P>
    <P>The situation regarding temporary registration was very serious for them. For a certain number of years one could be registered temporarily here for only five years at a time when many training programmes were for six years. It meant they could not stay here long enough to fulfil the training programme on which they were trying to complete a postgraduate degree. A couple of years ago the period of years was extended to seven, which was an improvement. However, they were employed in the heaviest of the service jobs so that they frequently had insufficient time left to do the amount of study required to undertake their postgraduate degrees.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State said that 98% of all posts in the service area at non-consultant doctor level have been filled. While this may be the case it is worrying how little competition there is for these posts. Sometimes there is none. It means that the authorities are very grateful if they can get anybody to take them up. We must remember that quality is important. It is not merely a question of filling the post. Last year there was commotion when it was found that a consultant psychiatrist, Dr. John Harding Price, who had been suspended from the medical register in England, was working in a post in the South Eastern Health Board. He was entitled to do so and I am sure Senators will be pleased to note that he was totally exonerated of the complaint made against him by the Medical Council and has been reinstated. It is important to note that he was the only applicant for that job. We are in a desperate situation in terms of getting people to fill posts in some parts of the country. We must take cognisance of this, especially as we will have to compete more and more with other countries for these people.</P>
    <P>The Medical Council's efforts to improve training has been greatly hampered by the fact that there is such a shortage of consultants. At present we have one consultant for every 2,725 people. Sweden has one for every 607 while Norway has one for every 702. In this regard we are one of the worst countries in the EU. Given this, it is easy to see how difficult it is for people to get involved in properly training these trainees. In many hospitals no time is scheduled for consultants to give them proper training.</P>
    <P>The Bill has done everything possible to ensure <Col N="1592" /> we will not be bereft of these people from 1 July. It is amazing we have managed to stagger so far with having most posts filled. The number of years before a permanent registration can be given has been reduced from four to two, which is a big reduction. While it is good to give credit for training in other areas, such as general practice and public health, there is a need to ensure there is quality assurance in these areas regarding the available training schemes. Public health doctors are up in arms about this. Again, we must be careful we do not give credit for training where people do not consider themselves to be in a proper position to give training. Huge improvement is required in this area. The recent letter from the second secretary in the Department of Finance to the Secretary General of the Department of Health and Children pointing out that we are not necessarily working towards a consultant provided service was a nice blow in the face. Again, it will seriously affect the amount of proper training which can be given to trainees in these posts.</P>
    <P>I am not sure of the importance of the debate in the European Commission regarding the proposal for the simplification of rules to facilitate the free movement of qualified people, including doctors in the European Union. Apparently a directive is being worked on which would give automatic rights for doctors from all over Europe to work here. The Medical Council is concerned about this. As a self-regulating body, it has naturally been very proud of maintaining standards at the highest possible level. We want to be sure that consultation on the directive will involve not only the Minister but also the council.</P>
    <P>Section 9 allows for other non-EU doctors who have completed their studies in medical schools abroad to do their internship here. Is this part of, or separate from, the directive and will the United Kingdom reciprocate in this area? A problem arose a few years ago when I met the Medical Council in London. Up to approximately four or five years ago it used to allow Irish graduates undertake their internship in the United Kingdom. It then changed its position and we were on weak ground to argue against the change because, as the Minister of State pointed out, the 1978 Act made it obligatory for a person who did an internship here to be a graduate of one of our medical schools. Has the United Kingdom now decided to reciprocate? This is a very important matter from a logistics point of view. If we are to allow outside graduates to come here it is only fair that our graduates should be allowed to work abroad. It may also mean that we could have a sudden and severe drain of people electing to do their internships in Great Britain or Northern Ireland. If the provisions of this legislation are enacted it is important we again contact the Medical Council in the United Kingdom to ensure, if possible, that there is reciprocation.</P>
    <P>Non-EU graduates have been treated appallingly in this country. The head of the non-EU <Col N="1593" /> doctors committee of the Irish Medical Organisation recently wrote an article in which he stated:</P>
    <P>The training system is fragmented and apartheid ridden. There are different fast-track pathways for the chosen few but a long and arduous road for others, with a career block at the end if those doctors choose to stay in the system. It is an open secret that some of the training programmes being offered to non-EU doctors are not for the same duration of training and do not lead to the same certification as their EU counterparts.</P>
    <P>This is very serious because some of these training programmes, in which these people may now become involved because they are permanently registered, may not be suitable for certification under the Royal College of Physicians or the Royal College of Surgeons. This must be clearly pointed out before they join them. It means that although they may have permanent certification they may still be loath to take up these posts, which are holding our service together, because they will not have certification towards higher examination.</P>
    <P>I wish I could give the Bill a bigger welcome. We are doing this for ourselves rather than for non-EU doctors, who have had an appalling time. The Minister of State's speech gives me some hope for the autumn but I wish the legislation had not been so delayed because we face constant problems due to the need to update the 1978 Act. Perhaps the Minister of State will be promoted if her side of the House is returned to Government, in which case we may further debate the legislation. I hope its provisions will be implemented but it is unacceptable that we should have to bend over backwards to ensure that the health service can be maintained by keeping these people in the service, no matter how good or bad it may be to their training or their future.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Hanafin, to this House. For the reasons stated by the Minister, this Bill should be passed quickly. I congratulate her on a splendid Second Stage speech on a Bill which is not before us and I hope that Bill will be brought before this House in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned that some people will think that, having stuck their finger in the dyke with this Bill, no further action is required. Enormous pressure is building within the health service. At this stage in the life of Seanad Éireann, I do not wish to presume that any of us will retain our seats, but I look forward to a discussion on the major Bill in the autumn. Such legislation is badly needed but it cannot take place in isolation. The Departments of Finance and Agriculture, Food and Rural Development are heading towards a consultant-delivered service. We are moving towards a situation where the teaching and training aspect of medical training is becoming supernumerary. If the quality of supervision is to be <Col N="1594" /> sustained, enormous changes in the structure of the health service are required. Unless we arrive at a satisfactory resolution of this problem, it will be difficult to maintain smaller rural hospitals. At a time when training is seen to be a life-long process, validation and the maintenance of skills are important.</P>
    <P>I hope that when the Minister presents the wider Bill, more thought will be given to the role of other health care professionals, particularly nurses, who are shouldering much of the current strain on our health services. However, I commend this Bill and I encourage the Minister to follow up with the fuller legislation as quickly as possible.</P>

I accept that this Bill is a technical one but it should also be accepted that it gives due recognition to non-EU doctors who have been working in this State for a long time. Many of these doctors have not only given of their expertise, but they have also taken out Irish citizenship and still find that they are not permanently registered with the Medical Council. This Bill will facilitate the acceptance of such professionals whose contribution to the health service is acknowledged by all. We do not want to lose them.</P>
      <P>This legislation allows the Medical Council to set down the rules governing the recognition of medical qualifications. That is why it is necessary for us to pass this Bill now. The criteria for medical qualifications should not be established by any Government and the Medical Council can now set out its own rules in this area. It will be up to the council to ensure that doctors are suitable for full registration. Such a procedure will guarantee the competency of doctors. The ball is now in the Medical Council's court. Of course, the council was extensively consulted during the drafting of this Bill and I am satisfied that its views have been taken on board by my Department.</P>
      <P>I accept that Members are anxious that the main Bill be brought forward. It is extensive legislation and all the stakeholders must be consulted. The draft heads of the Bill are at an advanced stage, but there are issues which still need to be incorporated into it. I know that the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, is confident that this Bill will be brought before the Oireachtas in the autumn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Henry raised the issue of competition for medical posts. It is true that 98% of such posts have been filled, but the issue at hand is not so much the number of posts filled as the number of applicants for each of them. The national task force is working on making posts more attractive to doctors, particularly those that are vacant in the regional hospitals. We also need to explore ways in which we can make work practices more flexible. This will encourage greater numbers of women who qualify as doctors to remain in the <Col N="1595" /> profession. It is worth noting that, since 1997, there has been a 30% increase in the number of consultant posts. That is a real improvement, but there are challenges that remain to be addressed.</P>
    <P>In terms of EU recognition of medical qualifications, any action taken at EU level must be complied with by all member states, including the UK. This compliance also governs reciprocal arrangements.</P>
    <P>In my opening statement, I referred to the role of other health professionals. There are other Bills in the making which will legislate for the nursing profession and regulate other professions allied to medicine. Legislation for the latter is at an advanced stage. I hope we will all be back here in the autumn to address the issues which arise from those Bills.</P>
    <P>The most important aspect of this legislation is that it gives recognition to non-EU hospital doctors who are making a contribution to our hospital service. It also facilitates those EU doctors who need a speedier process of recognition. Irish medical students who have trained abroad will also be facilitated by this legislation. The technical detail of this Bill will ensure that the wider health service, particularly the patients, will benefit.</P>

Regarding the registration of other health professionals, for the past two years no chiropodists have been appointed because there are no people to register them in this country.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of all Members of the Seanad and on behalf of the Fianna Fáil group in the House, I would like to express our sympathy on the death of former Member, Stephen McGonagle, who passed away recently. Stephen will be best remembered for his dedication and hard work on behalf of the members of the National Union of Tailors and Garment Workers and later the Irish Transport and General Workers Union, of which he became north west regional officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1960, Stephen became an increasingly influential figure in trade union affairs and industrial <Col N="1598" /> relations in Northern Ireland. He was instrumental in the formation of the Northern Ireland committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. He later became its chairman and in 1972 he became president of congress. In 1974, he was appointed Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration and Commissioner for Complaints, a post we know today as Ombudsman. He was the first Catholic to hold such a post in Northern Ireland. He brought the same fairness and sense of natural justice and common sense to this role that had marked his earlier career. In 1977, he became chairman of the Northern Ireland Police Complaints Board, which he had helped establish.</P>
    <P>In 1983, he was nominated to the Seanad by then Taoiseach, Garrett FitzGerald, where he served until 1987, speaking on labour matters, social issues, health and housing and the reports of the Ombudsman. He was also a member of the New Ireland Forum.</P>
    <P>On behalf of all Members of the House, I offer our sincere sympathy to his daughter, Patricia, and his sons, Owen, Ryan, Kevin, Malachy and Declan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the Leader in this tribute and expression of sympathy to the family of the late Stephen McGonagle. I had the honour of serving with him on the New Ireland Forum, although not in this House. He had a number of striking characteristics. First, there was not a sectarian bone in his body. He managed to rise above the almost all-engulfing sectarianism that was Northern Ireland politics during much of that time. As such, he served as a role model for many other people.</P>
      <P>Second, he had great common sense. He grew up in the trade union movement. He spoke very plainly and without obfuscation and he brought enormous common sense to everything he said. His contributions to this House and, as I recall, the New Ireland Forum were characterised by that common sense. I got to know him best, as is often the case in these Houses, over the odd cup of tea or coffee, or occasionally something stronger later in the evening.</P>
      <P>He was a very sociable man who mixed very well with the rest of us and I think he loved those evenings of conversation, chats, jokes and yarns. He had a great sense of humour and many of us felt very warmly towards him. He certainly enriched this House and made a real and individual contribution. He was always his own man. I mourn his passing and would like to pass on to his family the sympathy of my party and those of this side of the House.</P>

      <P>I express my sympathy to the family of the late former Senator McGonagle. I did not have the opportunity of meeting him, but I knew of him by reputation, in particular through his work on the New Ireland Forum. I gather he was a very personable man and that his contributions to the House were always full of common sense, as Senator Manning pointed out. We have just <Col N="1599" /> had a health debate and I gather that area was one of his great interests while in the House.</P>
      <P>He also served as Northern Ireland Ombudsman and it is good that we have another former Ombudsman here in Senator Maurice Hayes. The contributions to the House of people like former Senator McGonagle and Senator Hayes show how useful it has been in the past 20 years or so to appoint people from Northern Ireland to the House. The All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution has concluded that it would be a good idea for the Taoiseach to appoint four people from Northern Ireland to the Seanad and I hope that recommendation is heeded. Such must be their good common sense that the committee decided we could do with more of it in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I also express sympathy to the family of former Senator McGonagle. As a sort of shop steward for retired Ombudsmen, I had much in common with him. I followed him into two posts, first serving as Northern Ireland Ombudsman some years after he had done so and I then had the great honour of also being the Taoiseach's appointee to the Seanad some years after him.</P>
      <P>Stephen McGonagle was a man I knew for many years. He made an enormous contribution to public life in Northern Ireland in very difficult times. He helped the trade union movement with his wise leadership in that difficult period. Senator Manning noted that he had not a sectarian or bigoted bone in his body. When he became Ombudsman, he was the first non-civil servant to assume the role and he brought common sense, tact and a gift for straight talking to the job. I think he would like to be remembered as an Ombudsman.</P>
      <P>The first Danish Ombudsman described his work as:</P>
      <P>helping to emphasise the governmental services' responsibility towards justice and efficient administration, large and small. It is the task of the Ombudsman to see to the best of his ability that all who hold authority retain a sense of responsibility towards the individual citizen.</P>
      <P>That was one thing that Stephen McGonagle did. He was a model Ombudsman and a very fine human being. I am honoured to be allowed to pay tribute to him.</P>

In subsequent years, I followed his career although I do not think our paths crossed at any time. It was interesting to hear Senator Hayes speaking about him. It was also interesting to hear Senator Henry's point that those who come to the House from Northern Ireland &ndash; very often <Col N="1600" /> as nominees of the Taoiseach &ndash; have played a valuable role. My memory of Stephen McGonagle, not just here but elsewhere throughout his life, was of someone who presented a down to earth and compassionate viewpoint. As a nation, we have gained a great deal from people like him. He certainly will be missed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill was passed by the Seanad on 22 October 1998 and since then it has been before Dáil Éireann. The relatively long period during which it was before the Dáil was due, unfortunately but necessarily, to the Government's considerable legislative programme over that period. Due to the importance of this Bill, however, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, was particularly anxious to secure time for it so that it would be passed during the current Dáil. This took place, I am glad to say, on 28 March and the Bill now comes before this House on Report Stage, having been the subject of extensive amendments in the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Bill was last considered by the Seanad, its main focus was on dealing with unacceptable advertising by solicitors. It also included miscellaneous provisions relating to disciplinary matters affecting solicitors. As amended by the Dáil, the Bill can be said to have three main elements. First, there are the provisions on advertising. Second, there are extensive and far reaching provisions which improve and make more effective the disciplinary regime for solicitors. Third, section 20 of the Bill as passed by the <Col N="1601" /> Dáil, facilitates the transposition into Irish law of the EC Lawyers Establishment Directive.</P>
    <P>I will now go through, by reference to the list supplied to Senators, the 42 amendments made by the Dáil. Amendments Nos. 1, 4, 5, 12, 13, 14, 16, 18, 19, 34 and 35 are purely technical and involve changes to how the Solicitors Acts are referred to. For example, the Solicitors Act, 1954, is now referred to as the Principal Act in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 2 inserts what is now section 2 of the Bill as passed by the Dáil. It deals with the situation in which the Law Society issues, subject to conditions, or refuses to issue a practising certificate to a solicitor. At present, section 49(1)(<i>q</i>) of the Principal Act allows the society to refuse to issue a certificate unconditionally where the solicitor has failed to satisfy the society that, having regard to all the circumstances, including the financial state of his or her practice, he or she should be issued with a certificate without conditions attached.</P>
    <P>Two additional circumstances are explicitly provided for by this amendment. These are situations where the Law Society is concerned about the number and nature of complaints against a solicitor during the previous two practice years and, second, the need adequately to protect the interests of clients. While a solicitor may be able to deal with each complaint satisfactorily when it is notified to him or her by the Law Society, the fact that there are a number of such complaints may be more than sufficient reason for not issuing a practising certificate or for issuing a certificate subject to conditions.</P>
    <P>There are circumstances in which the Law Society may need to investigate the manner in which solicitors maintain bank accounts for clients' moneys. The purpose of amendment No. 3 is to obviate the need for the society's authorised investigator to inform the solicitor of the reason for his or her attendance at the solicitor's office where the society reasonably considers that disclosure of the investigator's visit could prejudice the exercise of the society's regulatory functions.</P>
    <P>The purpose of amendments Nos. 6 and 9 is to take account of the increasing relevance of the Internet to solicitors' firms, in common with all areas of professional and business life. Amendment No. 6 provides that an advertisement may include, in addition to name, address, telephone number, etc, a reference to the location of information provided by the solicitor that is accessible electronically. In everyday language, this means a website address. Amendment No. 9 changes the definition of &ldquo;advertisement&rdquo; by including as examples any electronic address or any information provided by the solicitor that is accessible electronically &ndash; in other words, an e-mail address or website.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 7 changes the provision in section 1(5)(<i>c</i>) of the Bill as passed by the Seanad which empowers the Law Society to make regulations to provide that advertisements can include specified information in addition to the infor<Col N="1602" /> mation set out in section 1(3)(<i>a</i>) to (<i>d</i>). The amendment provides that this specified information must be of a similar nature to the matters listed in subsection (3)(<i>a</i>) to (<i>d</i>). The provision, as amended, sets out the policy the Law Society is to follow in making the regulations and makes clear that the society does not have an open-ended discretion as to the information it specifies.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 8 and 10 were made to overcome concerns that the phrase &ldquo;which publicises or otherwise promotes&rdquo; a solicitor in relation to his or her practice, in the definition of &ldquo;advertisement&rdquo; in section 1(10) of the Bill as passed by the Seanad, might give rise to a situation in which the definition could include a communication, such as an article in a newspaper giving information on the law, which, while not intended to be an advertisement in the normal sense of the word, could incidentally publicise the solicitor in relation to his or her practice. To deal with this concern, amendments Nos. 8 and 10 make two changes of substance. Amendment No. 8 inserts the words &ldquo;which is intended&rdquo; before the reference to publicising and promoting. In other words, the publicising and promotion in relation to the solicitor's practice must be intended and this is to be judged from the actions of the solicitor and all the surrounding circumstances. Amendment No. 10 provides for the exclusion from the definition of &ldquo;a communication which is primarily intended to give information on the law&rdquo;. The normal bona fide article discussing legal issues is excluded.</P>
    <P>Concerns were also expressed about the definition of &ldquo;inappropriate location&rdquo; in section 1(10) of the Bill as passed by this House. Senators will recall that the Bill prohibits the publication of an advertisement at an inappropriate location. The term &ldquo;inappropriate location&rdquo; was defined to include certain places but the list was deliberately not exhaustive. To provide greater certainty, amendment No. 11 replaces the word &ldquo;includes&rdquo; with the word &ldquo;means&rdquo; and adds the phrase &ldquo;other location of a similar character&rdquo; to the definition, the character in question being that these are places where one would be more likely than usual to encounter persons who might wish to bring claims.</P>
    <P>It should be noted also that &ldquo;crematorium&rdquo; is added to the list of specific places by this amendment. The amendment achieves the twin objectives of limiting what might be considered to be an inappropriate location to places of a particular kind, without at the same time tying it down to a specific list which might well prove to be inadequate in future circumstances.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 15 is consequential on amendment No. 40 which changes the commencement provision. Amendments Nos. 17 and 20 change the addition to the definition of &ldquo;misconduct&rdquo; provided for by section 4 of the Bill as passed by this House. Senators will recall that this section provided that it would be misconduct on the part of a solicitor to have any direct or indirect connection with any person whom the solicitor knows, or upon reasonable inquiry should have <Col N="1603" /> known, is acting or has acted in contravention of certain provisions of the Solicitors Acts. As passed by this House, it could have outlawed a normal solicitor-client relationship between a solicitor and such a person. Clearly this would be wrong and amendment No. 17 rectifies the position. Amendment No. 20, however, ensures that it will be misconduct on the solicitor's part if he or she accepts instructions from such a person, regardless of whether the person is a client, to provide legal services to another person. In other words, a solicitor should not accept the introduction of business from a person who has contravened the prohibition on unqualified persons acting as a solicitor or who has pretended to be a solicitor, or who has carried out activities reserved by law to solicitors, but a normal solicitor-client relationship with such a person is fully in order.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 21 renames the &ldquo;Disciplinary Tribunal&rdquo; the &ldquo;Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal&rdquo; to clearly indicate the profession coming within its remit. In addition, the amendment doubles the size of the tribunal to cater for an increasing workload and the speedier processing of cases. Members of the tribunal will be appointed for a term of five years, renewable once, in the same proportions as at present, that is, two thirds will be solicitor members appointed by the President of the High Court after consultation with the Law Society and one third will be lay persons who will be appointed by the President of the High Court on the nomination of the Minister. A further new element in this amendment is that it provides that at least 40% of the solicitor members and 40% of the lay members must be women and at least 40% of each category must be men. This reflects long-standing Government policy on gender balance.</P>
    <P>The new subsection (6), inserted by this amendment, authorises the Law Society to pay members of the tribunal reasonable travelling and subsistence expenses incurred in respect of their attendance at meetings of the tribunal or to pay members an annual sum in respect of those expenses.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 22 and some of the amendments which follow, notably Nos. 23, 26, 27, 30, 31 and 39, will add considerably to the effectiveness of the disciplinary regime for solicitors. Amendment No. 22 repeals and re-enacts section 7(2) and 7(3) of the Act of 1960, as substituted by the Act of 1994, with the following main changes: the disciplinary tribunal will be required to inform the Law Society as soon as practicable of the receipt of an application direct from a member of the public; the tribunal will be required to give the respondent solicitor an opportunity to submit observations before they decide whether there is a <i>prima facie</i> case. If, on receipt of the solicitor's observations, the tribunal finds there is no case for an inquiry, the parties are notified accordingly. If the tribunal finds that there is a <i>prima</i><i>facie </i>case for an inquiry, the <Col N="1604" /> respondent solicitor and the applicant are informed of the date of the inquiry; the tribunal will be required to make a separate finding in respect of each allegation of misconduct made against the solicitor concerned and to give reasons for each finding; and the tribunal must have regard to any previous finding of misconduct made in relation to the solicitor when making recommendations to the High Court regarding the sanction which that court should impose.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 23 changes two subsections of section 7 of the Act of 1960, as substituted by section 17 of the Act of 1994. The new subsection (6) imposes additional requirements on the disciplinary tribunal in cases where, following an inquiry, it finds that there has been no misconduct on the part of a solicitor. First, the tribunal must inform the society of its finding where the application was made direct to the tribunal by a member of the public. Second, it must give reasons to the society, the respondent solicitor and, where appropriate, a lay applicant for its finding of no misconduct. Section 7(9), after this amendment is made, will require the tribunal, in deciding on the sanction it will impose on a solicitor in respect of whom a finding of misconduct has been made, to take into account previous findings of misconduct. This amendment also provides for a change in the maximum amounts which the disciplinary tribunal may order a solicitor, in respect of whom there has been a finding of misconduct, to pay to the compensation fund or to an aggrieved party. These amounts are being changed from £5,000 to &euro;15,000 to reflect the rapid growth in incomes and not solely consumer price inflation since 1994.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (<i>c</i>) of section 5 of the Bill, as passed by this House, provided that an order of the tribunal imposing a sanction on a solicitor shall be served as soon as possible and not later than 21 days after it is made. The disciplinary tribunal indicated to my Department that this time period could prove inadequate. Accordingly, amendment No. 24 changes the time limit of 21 days to 28 days. Amendment No. 25 is purely technical.</P>
    <P>The purpose of amendment No. 26, which inserts two new subsections (12A) and (12B) into section 7 of the Solicitors (Amendment) Act, 1960, as substituted by section 17 of the Act of 1994, is to empower the Law Society or any person who has made an application to the disciplinary tribunal to appeal to the High Court against a finding by the tribunal that there is no<i> prima facie</i> case for an inquiry or there has been no misconduct on the part of the respondent solicitor. At present, while the respondent solicitor enjoys a right of appeal against a decision of the disciplinary tribunal to impose a sanction, the right of the society or the lay applicant to appeal is limited to the ground that the sanction imposed by the tribunal is inadequate or that the tribunal, in lieu of making its order, ought to have exercised its power to refer the matter to the High Court, which can impose a more severe sanction than the tribunal.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1605" />Section 5(<i>d</i>) of the Bill, as passed by this House, remedied that anomaly in part by affording the Society or the lay applicant a full right of appeal in cases where the tribunal has imposed a sanction itself. However, the new subsection (12A) will result in a situation where the complainant, whether a lay person or the society, will have a right of appeal on all aspects of the tribunal's work and not just the limited and unsatisfactory right of appeal that exists at present. Subsection (12B) stipulates that an appeal must be brought within a period of 21 days after receipt by the appellant of notification in writing of the tribunal's finding.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 27 repeals and re-enacts with certain additional requirements section 8(1)(<i>a</i>) and 8(1)(<i>c</i>) of the Act of 1960 as substituted by section 18 of the Act of 1994. The effect is to require the High Court, when imposing sanctions on a solicitor as a result of a finding of misconduct, to have regard to any previous finding of misconduct made in relation to that solicitor. The sanctions available to the High Court under section 8(1)(<i>a</i>) of the Act of 1960 include removal from the roll of solicitors, suspension from practice, restriction on the extent of practice, monetary penalties or censure. Having imposed a penalty, the High Court may, in addition, take a number of further measures under section 8(1)(<i>c</i>) of the Act of 1960. For example, it may direct that a solicitor make restitution to an aggrieved party.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 28 changes section 15 of the Solicitors (Amendment) Act, 1960, as substituted by section 25 of the 1994 Act. Section 15 deals with the powers of the disciplinary tribunal as to the taking of evidence in the course of an inquiry. The purpose of the subsections being inserted in section 15 by this amendment is to provide a mechanism to ensure that parties to an inquiry do not call witnesses whose evidence is not relevant or does not add materially to the other evidence available to the tribunal. In this way, I hope that witnesses are not put to unnecessary expense or that the work of the tribunal is not delayed. Under the new subsections, the parties to the inquiry can be required to furnish the tribunal with an outline of the evidence to be given by witnesses they propose to have summoned. If the evidence is irrelevant or does not add materially to the evidence to be given by other witnesses summoned to the inquiry, the tribunal can draw the attention of the party to its power under subsection (1C) to require the party to pay the expenses of the witness, up to a maximum of &euro;10,000.</P>
    <P>The purpose of amendment No. 29 is to amend the interpretation section of the 1994 Act to provide that the statutory powers which will be available to the Law Society when investigating a complaint from a member of the public will also be available to it when investigating a complaint by its registrar. The powers in question include the power to order a solicitor to produce documents, the power to apply to the High Court for an order <Col N="1606" /> compelling the solicitor to respond to correspondence and the power to compel a solicitor to make a contribution towards the cost of an investigation. The second and third of these powers are being provided by amendments Nos. 30 and 31. The amendments also provide that the number of complaints published annually in the gazette of the Law Society under section 22 of the 1994 Act will include complaints made by the registrar to the society. This amendment would be relevant in cases where the registrar becomes aware that an investigation would be warranted to protect the interests of clients though no complaint has been received from a client against the solicitor in question.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the new section 10A, inserted in the 1994 Act by amendment No. 30, is to introduce an immediate and effective mechanism for dealing with the problem caused by certain solicitors who impede the investigation of complaints by the Law Society. It empowers the society to make an application to the High Court in cases where the solicitor fails to respond appropriately, in a timely manner or at all to correspondence from the society or fails to attend a meeting called by the society to consider a complaint. The High Court may make an order compelling the solicitor to respond appropriately or attend a meeting within a specified time. The High Court order may also censure the solicitor and require the solicitor to pay a money penalty.</P>
    <P>The purpose of amendment No. 31 is to repeal and re-enact with amendments section 12 of the Solicitors (Amendment) Act, 1994, so as to empower the Law Society to impose sanctions on a solicitor who fails to co-operate in the investigation of a complaint and to require that solicitor to make a contribution towards the cost of the investigation. Subsection (1)(a)(i) repeals and re-enacts existing section 12(1) of the 1994 Act. It empowers the society to require payment from a solicitor of a sum not exceeding &euro;3,000, which has been increased from £1,000, by way of contribution towards the costs incurred by the society in investigating a complaint of inadequate services or excessive charges under sections 8 or 9 of the 1994 Act. This provision only applies if the society has made a determination or given a direction under sections 8 or 9 of the 1994 Act.</P>
    <P>In contrast, subsection (1)(a)(ii) is a new provision which applies where no such determination or direction of the society exists. This situation may arise where the society considers that the complaint is sufficiently serious to warrant referral to the disciplinary tribunal or where it has not been possible for the society to progress its investigation, and possibly make a determination or give a direction, due to non co-operation by the solicitor in question. The subsection provides that in such a case the Law Society may require a solicitor, who has been the subject of an investigation to pay a sum of up to &euro;3,000 where the society has determined that the solicitor failed to respond appropriately, in a timely manner or at all, to a written request. Subsection (1)(b) <Col N="1607" /> extends these provisions beyond complaints about inadequate services and excessive fees to cases of alleged misconduct. It is open to the society to make an application to the disciplinary tribunal if it considers that there has been misconduct. The subsection provides that, in such a case, and prior to any proposed referral to the disciplinary tribunal, the Law Society may require a solicitor, who has been the subject of an investigation, to pay a sum of up to &euro;3,000, where the society has determined that the solicitor failed to respond appropriately, in a timely manner or at all, to a written request.</P>
    <P>Subsection (1)(c) empowers the Law Society, in addition to requiring a solicitor to make a contribution towards the costs of an investigation, or in substitution therefor, to issue a reprimand to the solicitor in question and to inform the complainant. This provision applies where the society is of the opinion that the complaint is justified but not sufficiently serious to warrant referral to the disciplinary tribunal or where the solicitor has failed to respond properly to correspondence from the society in the course of its investigation and the society has incurred cost as a result of this.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 32 repeals and re-enacts with amendments section 14(1) and (2) of the Solicitors (Amendment) Act, 1994, so as to extend the circumstances in which the society has power to inspect documents at a solicitor's place of business and to obviate the need for the society's authorised investigator to disclose to the solicitor or any employee of the solicitor the purpose of his or her attendance at the place of business where the society reasonably considers that such disclosure could prejudice the investigation. Section 14(1) of the 1994 Act, as it stands, empowers a person authorised by the society to attend at a solicitor's place of business without notice and to inspect documents for the purposes of investigating alleged misconduct. Subsection (1) of the new provision is intended to remedy two perceived lacunae in this provision. First, there are doubts as to whether the section as currently framed contemplates the investigation of complaints under sections 8 or 9 of the 1994 Act &ndash; complaints concerning inadequate professional services or excessive charges falling short of misconduct. Subsection (1)(b) rectifies any problem there may be in this regard. Second, the section as currently framed does not contemplate a situation where the society is aware of a general malaise in a solicitor's practice even though no allegation of misconduct has been made. Subsection (1)(c) is intended to ensure that investigative powers are available to the society in such cases.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 33 will increase the maximum amount which the compensation fund may pay to a client who has been the victim of dishonesty on the part of his or her solicitor from £350,000 to &euro;700,000 and the minimum amount of assets in the fund from £1 million to &euro;2 million. The policy underlying these changes is that regard should be <Col N="1608" /> had to the rapid growth in incomes and property values since the enactment of the 1994 Act, and not just consumer price inflation, while taking account of the fact that grants from the fund have for the most part been well below the current maximum of £350,000.</P>
    <P>The purpose of amendment No. 36 is to insert a new section in the Bill to enable the disciplinary tribunal to consider an application brought by the Law Society alleging misconduct by an apprentice. Under statutory instrument, the education committee of the Law Society has powers to deal, not alone with the education and examination of apprentice solicitors, but also to inquire into alleged misconduct. The Law Society considers that, in the interests of the apprentice and the society, it is desirable that there is a statutory power to have allegations of misconduct by an apprentice dealt with by the disciplinary tribunal. It is envisaged that this provision would be used rarely and in serious cases. In such cases, it is important that the alleged misconduct is investigated by an independent body such as the tribunal, which can manifestly be seen to be free of any possibility of prior knowledge of the matters complained of. Senators will note that the tribunal's mode of proceeding in an inquiry into the conduct of an apprentice parallels, in general, that which applies in an inquiry into the conduct of a solicitor. At the conclusion of the inquiry and if there has been a finding of misconduct, the tribunal gives its opinion in its report to the High Court as to whether the apprentice is, by reason of the findings, a fit and proper person to be admitted as a solicitor at all or until such time as the Law Society or the President of the High Court is satisfied as to his or her fitness.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 37 inserts a new section dealing with the Lawyers Establishment Directive, 98/5/EC. This directive, passed by the European Parliament and Council in February 1998, entitles EU lawyers to practice law on a permanent basis in a self-employed or salaried capacity in any other member state under their home state professional title. Senators will note references in the definitions contained in the new section to the European Economic Area and to the Swiss Confederation Agreement. The latter agreement applies the directive as between the EU states and Switzerland and it is intended that the directive will be extended to the entire EEA in due course by a decision of the EEA Joint Committee.</P>
    <P>A provision in primary legislation, as distinct from relying on ministerial regulations alone, is needed to implement the directive in Ireland because article 6.3 of the directive gives a discretion to member states to require lawyers, in certain circumstances, to take out professional indemnity insurance or to become a member of a professional guarantee fund and, as this is a discretion and not a requirement, if we were to provide for it by regulations alone, it might not-enjoy the constitutional immunity provided by Article 29.4.7 of the Constitution for measures <Col N="1609" /> necessitated by EU law. In addition, subsection (2)(b) states that regulations under the European Communities Act may also provide that the disciplinary regime applicable to Irish lawyers shall also apply to EU lawyers availing of rights under the directive and to Irish lawyers who go to another member state to practise under the directive. Constitutional considerations do not underlie subsection (2)(b) but the Minister has included it at the request of the Law Society who consider it the safest course in the interests of ensuring completeness and certainty.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 38 inserts a new section in the Bill to provide that, for the removal of doubt, a report of a case by a solicitor shall have the same authority as if it had been made by a barrister, for example, if the report is to be cited in court. There is a view that the current common law position is that only reports of cases written by barristers can be cited in court. Section 115 of the UK Courts and Legal Services Act, 1990, contains a similar provision to that of amendment No. 38.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 39 inserts a new section which will increase the maximum fine for summary offences under the Solicitors Acts generally from £1,500 to &euro;3,000. This is the figure which the Attorney General advises is the appropriate maximum on summary conviction. The section increases the maximum fine where conviction is on indictment from £10,000 to &euro;30,000 in line with the general approach which includes raising amounts to reflect the growth in incomes since these amounts were last set in 1994. The existing commencement provision in section 8(2) of the Bill as passed by this House is to the effect that the Act shall come into operation three months after its passing or on such earlier day as may be fixed by ministerial order. However, the Bill is now much extended compared with when it was last before the House.</P>
    <P>As I have said, it has three main elements: firstly, the provisions on advertising which for the most part were in the Bill originally; secondly, many new measures designed to strengthen the disciplinary machinery which applies to solicitors and thirdly, the new section 20 to provide a basis in primary legislation for the full implementation of the EU lawyers establishment directive. The deadline for implementation of that directive was 14 March 2000 and section 20 needs to commence on the passing of the Bill. It is appropriate that the remainder of the Bill should be commenced as soon as possible by ministerial order and this will be the aim of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 40 provides for these new commencement arrangements. Amendment No. 41 is technical in nature, dealing with the collective construction of the Acts, and amendment No. 42 is a technical amendment to the Long Title to reflect the fact that with the making of amendment No. 37, the Bill will facilitate the implementation of the lawyers establishment directive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. The number of amendments brought back to the Seanad is considerable and indicative of the times in which we live. They are detailed amendments for checking and tightening up procedures in relation to discipline and how professionals operate. It is a reflection of the times that for a profession which has traditionally been considered highly honourable and where honour was a tenet of operation, we need to legislate to empower the Law Society to be more effective in regulating itself. One would have thought that in a profession such as this self-regulation would be adequate, the fundamental qualities of honour, high-mindedness and professionalism would prevail and there would be no need for legislation. It is a reflection of our times that we need legislation to ensure that professionals act with propriety and that the profession itself can ensure that justice is seen to be done.</P>
      <P>Solicitors hold a position of responsibility within society and the quality of the people who enter the profession is very important. There is a need for closer assessment of persons entering certain professions as the points system is not always the best at deciding who is admitted. There should be a character test. Anybody who applies to join the Garda Síochána must undergo a check on himself and his family and a test of his suitability to be a member of the force. That has always been the case and the same should be done in the legal profession. In some instances we have heard of in recent times this could have been useful.</P>
      <P>The Bill before us is, in general, very welcome. It disappoints me that it must come before us but it is welcome because it is important that the public, especially clients of solicitors, is protected. Solicitors, more so than barristers, are at the coal-face dealing with the public. It is vital that the public is protected, particularly given the fiduciary relationship between client and solicitor which should not be abused and the particular responsibilities of the profession in relation to property, finance and general advice in a variety of areas. The client needs to be protected and solicitors should be aware of this. No more than in the case of politicians, we are here because of a handful of misdemeanours committed by a very small percentage of the profession. Unfortunately, that is why this legislation is required.</P>
      <P>I will not repeat all that the Minister of State has said but some of the amendments are particularly commendable. I welcome the establishment of the solicitors' disciplinary tribunal and the gender balance involved but I am not sure that a proportion of two thirds from the profession is desirable. We might be better off with 50% so that it is not a question of people ruling themselves. I would prefer some balance in terms of the public at large. The provision about gender balance is particularly welcome and I look forward to seeing that in operation to see how effective it proves to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1611" />As a result of the variety of tribunals we have had over the past number of years, we have seen increasing evidence of misconduct of solicitors acting on behalf of clients, for example in dealing with property or assets. The enabling of representatives of the disciplinary tribunal to enter and search solicitors' offices in certain circumstances is important and welcome. Needless to say, this will not happen very often: it will be the exception rather than the rule. Nevertheless, the fact that the tribunal will have this power should be a disincentive for bad practice.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 22 concerns the rules introduced for the disciplinary tribunal and the way in which it is to conduct its business, which is welcome. The tribunal should do its business expeditiously, professionally and in the shortest time possible. If there is a <i>prima facie</i> case that requires an inquiry, the sooner the inquiry is out of the way and justice is seen to be done the better.</P>
    <P>Regarding amendment No. 26, the Minister of State said &ldquo;At present, while the respondent solicitor enjoys a right of appeal against a decision of the disciplinary tribunal to impose a sanction, the right of the society or the lay applicant to appeal is limited to the ground that the sanction imposed by the tribunal is inadequate&rdquo;. I am not sure what all that means and perhaps the Minister of State will elaborate on this in greater detail.</P>
    <P>The compelling powers dealt with in amendment No. 29 are important. These include the power to order a solicitor to produce documents and to apply to the High Court to compel him or her to respond to correspondence and to appear at and co-operate with the investigation. We have heard of situations where the Law Society has become involved and where members of the public and lay people in general have been dissatisfied with the response from the society. If this helps the Law Society to ensure that complaints against solicitors are dealt with in a much more professional way, it is extremely welcome.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 32 deals with the introduction of an immediate and effective mechanism for dealing with the problem caused by certain solicitors who impede the investigation of complaints by the Law Society and is very welcome. Any law professional is not a law unto himself. He is a law officer, in effect, of the State and he has an obligation to his clients and to the State to see that justice is done. For a solicitor to impede or hinder the course of justice is a very serious matter and should be seen as such. Appropriate sanctions should be taken against anybody who attempts to impede or obstruct an investigation. The extension of the circumstances under which the society has the power to inspect documents at a solicitor's place of business is also welcome as it fills gaps which are in the system at the moment.</P>
    <P>The increase in the compensation fund from £350,000 to &euro;700,000, and the doubling of the minimum assets in the fund from £1 million to &euro;2 million, is welcome. It seems like a lot of money <Col N="1612" /> but we hear of cases involving phenomenal amounts. Solicitors are setting up their own insurance bodies but are having difficulties meeting insurance claims. In the past the Law Society compensation fund was adequate but it now increases dramatically every year as a result of the number of negligence and other misdemeanour claims against solicitors.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 36 gives powers to the tribunal to investigate apprentices. We should be cautious because an apprentice is just learning the trade. It is strange that the Law Society believes there is a need to introduce statutory powers to deal with apprentices. They are not yet qualified practitioners and it is questionable that they should be referred to in the legislation. These are inexperienced people who could be scapegoated for a mishap in a practice. Does the Minister have information from the Law Society that could justify that course of action? It is unwelcome because it deals with those who are young and inexperienced.</P>
    <P>Directive 98/5/EC pertaining to amendment No. 44 is interesting. We are obliged to introduce it but how effective can it be and how can it operate? There are different legal systems across the EU. The British and Irish systems are similar but the French legal system is very different. This may not work except in areas of European law. Company and constitutional law differs across the European Union. It is not a practical proposition because of the differences across the EU.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 45 will insert a new section that provides for the removal of doubt &ndash; a report of a case by a solicitor should have the same authority as it would had it been made by a barrister. I have wanted to see this happen for a long time. Most solicitors and barristers have similar legal qualifications &ndash; they have a primary degree and receive similar training from two different agencies, although some solicitors may have more legal expertise. The division of powers between the two jurisdictions in Blackhall Place and the Kings Inns is needless.</P>
    <P>The Minister's amendments are welcome. I regret that we live in a society that demands such legislation but we have a responsibility to protect the public and the Law Society believes these statutory powers are necessary to enable it to regulate its practitioners.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. I am impressed with the range and scope of her talents &ndash; she can handle many different topics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to be able to say that things have improved in Irish law since we last saw this Bill in the Seanad in 1998. If anything, things are worse. Last week, I read a John Grisham novel called &ldquo;The Summons&rdquo;. It is an horrific story concerning what has happened in the United States in the legal world. It deals with ambulance chasers and the other terrible incidences that happen when things go wrong with the law. That is happening in Ireland and it makes this Bill wel<Col N="1613" /> come, because it takes some of the steps we hope will do something to protect the law.</P>
    <P>There is now an industry of cowboy solicitors who, in pursuit of personal profit, have wrought havoc on the legal system and created a situation which may be unsustainable. The level of personal injury claims that have been made, and the amounts being paid out in respect of those claims, are way out of line in comparison with the experience of other countries. Looking at the United States, however, it is possible to see the trend and where we are likely to end up.</P>
    <P>We could argue that this trend is caused by the envy created by economic success. It is a backlash from those who believe they have not shared in the wealth that has been created over the last ten years. When one looks deeply into the situation, however, it is a totally unprincipled act of profiteering by a cabal of solicitors who are exploiting the law to make a quick buck not for their clients, but for themselves. Businessmen are experiencing major problems obtaining insurance cover because of this.</P>
    <P>At the heart of the issue is the way solicitors are paid. For that reason I welcome amendment No. 7. The fact that the Minister found it necessary to insert the word &ldquo;crematorium&rdquo;&ndash; we did not even think of that four years ago when we looked at this Bill &ndash; is a reminder of the way things are changing.</P>
    <P>Senator Taylor-Quinn is right, there are not many of these solicitors but their numbers are growing and they are becoming more vocal. Most of them work on a no foal, no fee basis, so it costs the client nothing if the injury claim does not succeed. They have nothing to lose so they are chancing their arm but they have everything to gain if a settlement is made. We should consider if the practice of charging legal fees in this way should be banned. We have not done that here, although I would like to have seen such provision in the Bill. We must restore balance.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 17 covers misconduct, an area where the balance at present is all on one side. The people who benefit most are not the clients, but the solicitors. We must ensure we do nothing to inhibit the making of genuine claims as it is right that people who genuinely suffer personal injury are compensated appropriately. However, nobody now considering the position, which will get worse in the future, could possibly argue that all claims are justified.</P>
    <P>To be fair, the cowboy solicitors in question are exploiting circumstances which other people have made easy for them. In the past, the courts were much too lenient and trusting of dubious evidence in many personal injury claims. This in turn has led insurance companies into the fatal temptation of settling even when they do not believe their clients are in the wrong because they have justifiable fears that the verdict could go against them. I am not referring to just a few fat cats or big companies that can afford to pay or the faceless insurance companies about which nobody really worries.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1614" />The long-term result of this unsustainable position, a point which, I believe, we have reached, is that the community as a whole pays. If an unacceptable cost burden is placed on the community, somebody ultimately must pay and this is done through higher costs and lost competitiveness. As has been amply demonstrated by figures released in recent days, we are already struggling to keep our competitiveness. We play around with that at our peril.</P>
    <P>Given the large number of solicitors in the two Houses, it is not easy to say boo to the legal system. Sooner or later, however, our laws will have to face up to the fact that we have allowed a monster to grow in our midst. If we do not slay it when we have time, which is now, it will devour us. I welcome the changes introduced by the Bill and while I am disappointed it has taken four years to reach this stage, the delay has benefited the legislation. I congratulate the Minister for, I hope, enacting this Bill because it is one step, if a small one, in the right direction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their consideration of the Bill. Like them, I must remark on the timescale of its passage. I remember speaking on it as a backbencher in the Dáil in 1998 when I quoted extensively from the type of advertising featured in <i>The Golden Pages</i>. Now, four years later, we are addressing a completely different aspect of the same Bill from a different perspective. This shows the type of quality assurance people here are seeking in relation to everything, in particular, the professions. Having discussed the issue earlier as it applies to doctors, we are now considering it in relation to the legal profession.</P>
      <P>People place great store by and faith in their solicitor. As Senator Taylor-Quinn stated, people have most contact with solicitors, not barristers. Given their strong reliance on them, it is appropriate that there should be a statutory disciplinary regime in place which is regulated in a proper manner. While I am not implying that all solicitors need it, the regime is necessary not just for the rogue solicitors &ndash; cowboy solicitors as they have been described here &ndash; but for the good and protection of the profession generally as well as that of clients.</P>
      <P>In many different professions and areas of work, we and the professionals themselves tend to look towards self-regulation. The model employed here is the one used in other areas. Two thirds of the disciplinary tribunal will be drawn from the profession with the remaining third drawn from the lay professions. This gives due recognition to the expertise within the profession as well as the independence of the lay people who will be involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Taylor-Quinn asked about the right of appeal under amendment No. 26. The amendment extends the limited grounds on which a person making a complaint can appeal and, as such, gives him or her more rights in this regard. It <Col N="1615" /> enables people to appeal where there is no <i>prima facie</i> case or where it has been found that there has been no misconduct and thus redresses the current imbalance which is clearly in favour of the other side.</P>
    <P>Specific questions were also asked about apprentices. Earlier, I made it clear that this provision will be very rarely used. However, apprentices are given significant responsibility in solicitors' offices. Where there is misconduct, it will be judged in a way that ensures a person does not suffer by virtue of being inexperienced, not properly supervised or being asked to do more than that of which he or she is capable. While these factors will be taken into account, the Law Society was also anxious to ensure apprentices are included where very serious matters arise. Equally, however, it is noteworthy that instead of perhaps ruling that an apprentice can never become a member of the profession, a longer timescale may be imposed. The apprentice is, therefore, being offered protection.</P>
    <P>Mutual recognition within the European Union is another interesting issue. It is important that one must practise under the title acquired in one's home country, which makes it easy for other countries to check one's qualifications. This links in to the wider issue of mutual recognition of educational qualifications which we already have in the European Union. Bearing in mind that only two countries have the common law system, the question of how people from these jurisdictions would fare in other European countries is a matter of market demand. Nevertheless, it is important in the context of the recognition of qualifications and professions that it is included.</P>
    <P>As Senator Quinn pointed out, despite giving extensive consideration to advertising by solicitors when the Bill was first introduced, we felt it necessary to include an extra word which none of us considered at the time. This shows how quickly society is moving and how alert we need to be to protect people.</P>
    <P>Insurance and costs are issues for another day which need to be considered to protect clients and the profession. The Bill originally introduced in 1998 and finally making its passage through the Seanad in 2002 has been considerably improved and expanded in the intervening period. It is a very extensive Bill which will result in a better profession and better protection for clients. I thank Senators for their consideration.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Defence (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Leas-Chathaoirleach, for agreeing to take the Bill today.</P>
      <P>The main purposes of the Bill are to update the Civil Defence legislation generally and to provide for the establishment of the Civil Defence Board to co-ordinate the operations and future development of the Civil Defence and advise the Minister on policy issues. The creation of such a legislative framework was an important element in the Government's White Paper on Defence. I am happy that as the Minister with delegated responsibility for the Civil Defence I have honoured the policy commitment by bringing forward this Bill. The Bill provides for the establishment of a board of management to be known as An Bord Cosanta Sibhialta, or the Civil Defence Board, which will co-ordinate the operation and future development of the Civil Defence and advise the Minister on policy issues. Political accountability to the Oireachtas for the discharge of the board's functions will remain with me.</P>
      <P>The Civil Defence was originally set up in 1950 to undertake non-combatant activities and to afford defence against an attack or disaster on the State or otherwise arising from war-like weapons, radioactive fallout, biological or chemical warfare. The Civil Defence currently operates under the Air Raid Precautions Acts of 1939 and 1946 and various local government Acts and statutory instruments. The Civil Defence branch of the Department of Defence facilitates, through the local authorities, Civil Defence responses for emergency relief. Each local authority provides civil defence services that are administered by the Civil Defence officer who reports to the county or city manager. There are currently approximately 6,000 volunteer members in the organisation. They are recruited within their local areas and are offered training in various skills, such as first aid, rescue, fire fighting, emergency feeding, searching and radiation monitoring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Civil Defence members are dedicated and highly committed to the ideal of voluntary community service. The volunteer force is maintained at a modest cost and has maintained its voluntary ethos for more than 50 years. This trend will be continued and developed under the new legislation. Currently recruiting new members has proved difficult. There are a wide variety of alternative attractions available. Consequently, it is my intention that under this Bill the Civil Defence Board will devote a considerable portion <Col N="1617" /> of its energies to the recruitment of new members and to retaining the services of existing members.</P>
    <P>Section 7 of the Bill is a key provision as it brings the Civil Defence Board into existence on &ldquo;the establishment day&rdquo;. That day will be appointed by order of the Minister for Defence under section 4. Section 8(<i>h</i>) provides for the board to advise the Minister for Defence on policy matters relatingto civil defence or at the request of the Minister. The board will be comprised of individuals dedicated to the future development of the organisation and will carry out its functions in an independent manner and develop its own programmes as provided in section 8 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The board will have a function in promoting the role of the Civil Defence in providing services to the community and in developing programmes to enhance those services. While the Third Schedule sets out the type of community support programmes to be developed arising from section 8(3), it is not exhaustive and the board will be able to develop other community support services within the limits of its own resources.</P>
    <P>Section 8(<i>e</i>) provides for the board to develop plans and improve standards of civil defence education, training, knowledge, skill and equipment. Provision is made in section 8(<i>i</i>) for the board to conduct and commission research and foster and promote contacts with educational institutions and other bodies engaged in civil defence activities both at home and abroad. There is provision in section 8(<i>f</i>) of the Bill for the board to promote public awareness programmes in relation to civil defence and I expect the board will use this provision to enhance the profile of the organisation.</P>
    <P>However, I must recognise that in the post 11 September scenario the possibility of a deliberate or accidental disaster of major proportions affecting the nation could necessitate the Minister, with Government approval, having to recall the authority of the board for the duration of such an emergency. I have provided, therefore, for such a contingency in section 10, but I emphasise, however, that this provision could only be exercised in a major disaster situation and only with the full authority of the Government.</P>
    <P>Section 11 deals with the composition of the Civil Defence Board which will comprise 14 members, the composition of which will have regard to appropriate gender balance. I am convinced that any more than 14 could prove rather unwieldy. The director general shall be a full member of the board in order to have a full and meaningful participation in the decision-making processes. The City and County Managers Association will be represented. They have operational control of the Civil Defence at local level and should have an input into all decisions affecting the future development of the organisation. The Bill also provides for up to four persons with external expertise to be members of the board. I envisage these persons to be broadly representative of commercial, industrial and administrative interests countrywide. The Bill also provides for <Col N="1618" /> a representative from the Department of the Environment and Local Government with experience of emergency planning to be represented on the board. The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland will also be represented on the board. As Senators will be aware, the Civil Defence has a defined role under the radiological national plan. I am also inviting a representative of the Environmental Protection Agency to be a member of the board.</P>
    <P>It is important that whatever first-line service is charged with combating a particular threat can call on the resources of the Civil Defence to support it. The Civil Defence Officers Association is a national organisation representative of Civil Defence officers and assistant Civil Defence officers. I consider it appropriate, therefore, that this organisation should be represented on the board. The Civil Defence operates closely with the Garda Síochána and also has links with the Defence Forces. Consequently, I consider it prudent that both organisations be represented on the board. The most important member of any voluntary organisation is undoubtedly the volunteer. I consider it important that the voice of the volunteer be available on the management board and I have provided for this in section 11(<i>j</i>)(i). In line with partnership and best practice, it is important that a member of staff is appointed to the board of management.</P>
    <P>Section 11(4) provides for one member of the board to be designated as chairperson and section 12 contains related standard provisions regarding chairpersons. Section 14 provides for a permanent civil servant to be designated as the first director general of the board. It is important that the Civil Service expertise should continue in managing the Civil Defence of the future.</P>
    <P>Section 15 provides for the board, as appropriate, to engage outside expertise which will be an important provision for the development of strategic planning in the organisation. Funding will be of vital importance to the board and provision is made in section 20 for the Minister to provide that funding by way of grant-in-aid to the board from the Defence Vote. The grant-in-aid will also provide for funding the salary and related costs for the staff of the board. Sections 22 and 23 contain standard provisions for dealing with gifts and for the accounts of the board to be prepared as appropriate and to be submitted to the Comptroller and Auditor General and also for the audited accounts to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Provision is made at section 26 for the board to make an annual report and other reports to the Minister as he or she or the board might think fit. Section 27 provides for the Minister to give a direction to the board to use, provide or lend equipment as appropriate should the Minister consider it necessary to alleviate a particular situation. Section 28 provides for the board to establish committees of the board, particularly three named committees to carry out the work of the board. Section 30 provides for the board to <Col N="1619" /> submit a strategic plan to the Minister setting out its key objectives and strategies and reviewing the plan every three years. Section 31 provides for each local authority to submit a Civil Defence plan to the board and these plans are intended to form the basis for the board to submit its plan to the Minister under section 30. I am confident this process of strategic planning will permeate throughout the organisation from management down to the newest recruit, lead to a sense of ownership at all levels and give new focus to the overall development of the Civil Defence.</P>
    <P>The First Schedule provides for the definition of the Civil Defence to be identical to that already contained in the Geneva Conventions (Amendment) Act, 1998, and also allows sufficient scope for the board to develop the organisation into the future.</P>
    <P>I am happy to have had the opportunity to shape and advance the statutory framework for the future development of the Civil Defence. This Bill is a landmark development as it is the first Civil Defence legislation in more than 50 years. I look forward to hearing the views of Senators on the Bill and I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which is necessary. The Civil Defence has been left on the back burner. It has not received due recognition since its foundation in 1950, yet its officers throughout the country, who are appointed by the local authorities, do wonderful work and manage to instil a sense of service and public duty in the volunteers. As the Minister rightly said, it is becoming increasingly more difficult to recruit volunteers. Part of the reason for that is the manner in which the Civil Defence has been treated over the years. The funding and premises provided to the Civil Defence have been secondary if not tertiary. It is not an understatement to describe them as representing Third World standards. There needs to be more commitment and I am delighted that the Minister of State is in the House. It is interesting that the Minister for Defence does not take direct responsibility for the Civil Defence. It should be more closely involved with the Department and the Minister and there should be closer liaison with other agencies such as the FCA and the Army. A lot of the work done by the Civil Defence is similar to that done by other defence agencies, the only difference being that it is a non-combatant organisation.</P>
      <P>The responsibilities and powers of the Civil Defence are outlined in the Bill and I welcome the formation of the board. That will be important if it is properly utilised. I hope that it is not simply used as one more board where various people can be placated with appointments. I hope it is seen to be and will be a purposeful board, used to advance the Civil Defence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In our changing society and times, there will be an increased need for the Civil Defence. The work that it undertakes currently and the powers <Col N="1620" /> the Minister has outlined are very important. What we see of the Civil Defence is an organisation working locally under the jurisdiction of local authorities, assisting other organisations such as the ambulance and fire services and, in some cases, engaging with the FCA and the Army. Where there are large gatherings of people, it also works with the Garda authorities. The Civil Defence does this work very effectively and recruit training is ongoing in various centres around the country. Over 6,000 people, including 150 in County Clare, have proper Civil Defence training.</P>
    <P>There should be an increase in positive publicity and recruitment. The Minister should engage in an education process in schools, particularly for fifth years and those in transition year. Young people at that age should be encouraged to actively participate in the Civil Defence. If that was done, many young people who are currently engaging in other activities, who are becoming addicted to drugs for the want of something better to do and who have no sense of purpose in life could be usefully channelled in this direction. The Civil Defence and the FCA are on the ground in every county and could be more effective in enhancing our community and society and in curbing the increase in crime. I ask the Minister for Defence, in conjunction with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister for Education and Science, to look at that possibility. There is an opportunity to do something positive.</P>
    <P>The Civil Defence, like any organisation, cannot function effectively unless it has proper funding behind it and the national allocation for Civil Defence has been abysmal over the years. The equipment of the Civil Defence is substandard in most cases and that is not encouraging for those involved. They find it hard to keep their spirits up and the establishment of the board may be the vehicle that is required to instil that extra bit of vigour in the organisation. I ask the incoming Minister, when he appoints members to the board, to take into account that the board needs those with a real sense of public service and public duty. They should have a generosity of spirit and a vision of how the Civil Defence can be better utilised and how it can become more attractive to recruits. If that type of person is brought in to the board there will be a spin-off effect for the country.</P>
    <P>The section relating to consultants is unnecessary if the board which is appointed has the necessary expertise and commitment. Practical common sense is what is needed in relation to the Civil Defence, as well as a knowledge of community relations. It is nonsense to pay consultants enormous fees to put on paper what is basic common sense. Increasingly, boards and Ministers are abdicating their responsibilities to consultants and programme managers. The Minister should leave that section out of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that a member of the Defence Forces is to be included on the board. That is <Col N="1621" /> important because of the close liaison between the organisations and the similarity of what they both do. It is important that link is consolidated. I would go further than the Bill and believe that the Minister for Defence should take more direct responsibility rather than surrendering it to the Department of the Taoiseach. This area should be integral to the Department of Defence. The Minister has rightly said that the Civil Defence has statutory responsibility under the radiological protection legislation and it is important that a member of the Radiological Protection Institute is also on the board.</P>
    <P>In the past, the Civil Defence dealt with a limited range of duties but we never know what to expect in current times. As an island nation we can never be sure of our requirements, particularly at our ports and airports. The 11 September attacks changed the situation across the world and increases our level of responsibility, although I will not get into a debate on radiological protection and iodine tablets. I ask the Minister of State to elaborate on how the Civil Defence would operate and how it would be equipped in a major emergency situation. What is its role and function? How does the Minister of State see its operation in the community? The role of the Civil Defence should be better defined. Its members need clarity in relation to their role. We should be clear about this and try to expand what they do.</P>
    <P>Sections 16 and 17 are standard sections. In relation to funding, we have had no indication as to what grants the Minister may be in a position to pay. That will depend on the Minister for Finance and the strength of the case that the Minister for Defence makes. However, it would be nice to have some indication on this aspect because the effectiveness of the Civil Defence will depend on how well funded and equipped it is. Section 27 of the Bill states that, in relation to the directions of the Minister with regard to equipment, the Minister may, from time to time &ldquo;give a direction in writing to the board requiring it to use, provide or lend equipment specified in the direction for such purpose and on the terms and conditions that the Minister directs&rdquo;. I hope it will not be like the urban district council which did not even have pumps to pump water off the streets when flooding arose. That council had to hire equipment from a local contractor. Basic common sense equipment such as pumps to pump water off streets and houses when flooding occurs is the type of equipment which the Minister should consider providing to the Civil Defence. I do not think there is too much equipment in any Civil Defence stores around the country that is suitable for mending but perhaps the Minister of State has information that I do not have.</P>
    <P>Every local authority has a Civil Defence officer who is responsible for the drafting of a civil defence plan. In County Clare, Liam Griffin has been doing that job very effectively and very successfully. He does a remarkable job despite the meagre equipment and funding at his dis<Col N="1622" /> posal. He has imbued in the recruits a spirit of civic commitment and long may that last. I welcome the Bill and I hope the Minister will provide funding and equip the Civil Defence so that its members can carry out their duties in an effective manner rather than in a slipshod fashion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Minister for introducing this Bill. It is the first Civil Defence Bill in 50 years and as such breaks new ground. All Members will agree that the role played by the Civil Defence is very important. It is an important aid to the civil power. The Minister proposes to establish a board and this is a major step in giving the Civil Defence a degree of responsibility for its own affairs. The White Paper commits the Government to providing the necessary infrastructure and training to enable the Civil Defence to continue to develop its capacity to respond to emergencies as a high quality second line emergency service and to facilitate community support activities while preserving the voluntary nature and ethos of the organisation. The voluntary ethos of the organisation is extremely important but as the Minister of State and Senator Taylor-Quinn said, it is becoming increasingly difficult to attract recruits. I am pleased to see that the Minister is taking some measures to assist in that regard.</P>
      <P>The provision of services has a cost implication. The Government has responded with the provision of an additional £500,000 to the Civil Defence budget for 2000 and beyond. In addition to staffing the Department's civil defence branch, total expenditure by the Department in 2001 will be £3.2 million and this level of expenditure on civil defence is expected to be maintained over the period to 2004.</P>
      <P>Senators on the other side of the House made reference to the type of equipment provided to the Civil Defence. The graph for the period 1996 to 2000 shows that expenditure on equipment in 1996 was £619,000 and in 2000 was £1.046 million, almost a 90% increase.</P>
      <P>The Minister seeks to establish a board which will be dedicated to the Civil Defence. The stakeholders, including a representative of the City and County Managers' Association and a representative of the volunteers in the organisation, will be on the board. This will give <i>de facto</i> recognition to the great contribution made by the voluntary sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is committed to providing the necessary framework for the future development of the Civil Defence by modernising the legislation governing it. The Civil Defence organisation is administered on the basis of local authority areas rather than on a county or city basis. There are 32 local authority administrative areas and at present there are approximately 6,000 active volunteers in the organisation. There are 3,000 trained persons who are no longer active but are available in emergencies. On the basis of the most recent available figures, the gender balance within the organisation breaks down fairly <Col N="1623" /> evenly between male and female members. I am sure there are certain organisations who will welcome that situation because that level of gender balance is not always achieved in other organisations.</P>
    <P>Section 31 is particularly important. It provides that each local authority will submit a civil defence plan to the board. These plans are intended to form the basis for the board's submission to the Minister under this section. This is an operational plan which will allow the relevant Civil Defence organisation to make proposals in its plan to the board. It will allow the organisation to describe its objectives and suggest remedies to correct the shortcomings.</P>
    <P>The operational activities currently performed by the Department of Defence will be transferred to the board and the Minister will retain control of policy functions. I have been a member of a local authority for over 22 years and I wish to pay tribute to the Civil Defence organisation in my home county of Westmeath. I wish to pay tribute to the current Civil Defence officer, Brian Gillen, to the former Civil Defence officer of many years standing, Patsy Sheridan, who gave sterling service, and to Seán O'Riordan. I support this timely Bill and I commend the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Defence (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators Taylor-Quinn and Glynn for their comments. Senator Taylor-Quinn spoke about the board membership and the necessity to have people on the board who know what they are doing. I support that proposal. The Minister of the day will have four nominations out of a total of 14. The other ten will be nominated by the Garda, the Defence Forces and other nominated bodies. When making appointments I am sure the Minister will ensure that they are four eminent people. The point about education and transition year is well made and is a good idea. I will ask the new board to put in place some programme which allows them to target transition year students. The new board may be able to liaise with the Department of Education and Science and with the schools.</P>
      <P>Senator Taylor-Quinn also spoke about funding. Senator Glynn mentioned that funding in 1996 was £600,000, while funding this year amounts to &euro;4.1million. That gives them scope to buy new equipment, upgrade apparel, invest in a public recruitment programme and do the kinds of things they want to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The kind of Civil Defence described by Senator Taylor-Quinn is the image that many people have of it. That is why I want to put the new board in place. It will promulgate its own story and tell of its successes. The old image of not having the equipment and being described as some kind of &ldquo;Dad's Army&rdquo; is somewhat unfair and does not fit the modern Civil Defence. The Civil Defence today is modern, funded, spirited and increasingly has top class equipment. There is much more to do <Col N="1624" /> in that area and I want to set up the board so that it could have an overview and develop the organisation. Up to now the structure was such that a senior official in the Department of Defence was the director and much of the policy came from that source. That did not really permit all the partners in the Civil Defence to sit around the table and develop the future of the organisation. They can now do that and that will be exciting.</P>
    <P>I particularly asked them to look at recruitment and to tell of the work they do to attract more members. They do fantastic work. There are 6,000 volunteers who go out every week. They are involved in search and rescue, crowd control, aiding the civil power and first aid. It is becoming increasingly complex and they are there when they are needed.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to thank them for the fabulous work they did during the foot and mouth disease crisis last year. I know all Senators will agree with me on that. They manned the ports and other points of entry. They were in the front line of keeping that scourge under control and from our shores. When people ask what the Civil Defence does, we can now point to that, but that is not all. If it can do that, it can do much more.</P>
    <P>Senator Taylor-Quinn asked about consultants. The Bill contains an enabling provision in this respect. A consultant free world would be wonderful, but it is not realistic. Any modern board needs the facility to use such a service if it needs it. It would not be possible to ban it from reaching for that support if it wants it. Many people may share the Senator's view. Boards and Ministers should seek to solve problems themselves before reaching for consultants to give them the answer they want so they can then fight for it.</P>
    <P>There is excessive use of consultants often for the wrong reasons. Over the years, I have seen boards and Ministers from different parties know exactly what had to be done, but they did not have the confidence to do it without a big consultant's report containing hundreds of pages. This allowed them to tell their colleagues they were only doing what the consultant said. I share the view that is an abdication of responsibility. It is acceptable to use consultants for something that is complicated, but Ministers and boards should not use them as an excuse for doing something they should do themselves.</P>
    <P>The Civil Defence is nothing to do with the Department of the Taoiseach. Legally, I am the Minister of State at the Department of Defence also. The Civil Defence reports to the Department of Defence. I also happen to be in the Department of the Taoiseach.</P>

The fact that the Houses of the Oireachtas did not legislate for this organisation shows that we have neglected it. We are now making up for that by introducing a modern structure that will allow the Civil Defence to grow into the next century. It is incumbent on us all to give it our full support because we never know when we will need it. I thank it for all the work it does.</P>

      <P>I raised this point already and the Minister more or less concurred with what I said. For an organisation such as the Civil Defence, there is no need for this section. The board should be made up of the experts and should not need consultants or advisers to be hired to make decisions on matters relating to the Civil Defence. There will be representatives of the Garda Síochána, the Defence Forces and the Radiological Protection Institute. In deciding on the four nominees from his Department, I hope the Minister will select people with the necessary expertise, skill and vision. Given that in most cases civil defence is a practical, straightforward and operational matter, the idea of appointing consultants is a nonsense and the provision should be withdrawn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Notwithstanding what I have said, I have much sympathy with the Senator's views. By and large, I agree with her. From a legal point of view there would be difficulty in deleting the section. It provides that the board &ldquo;may, from time to time, engage any consultants or advisers <Col N="1627" /> that the Board or the Minister, as the case may be, consider necessary for the performance by the Board of its functions.&rdquo;  If this was not provided for it would mean the board probably could not engage consultants. That would make this the first legislation to ban a board from engaging outside advisers or seeking outside advice, which could mean a legal challenge going as far as the Supreme Court. It might be unreasonable to tie the hands of the board by preventing it from acting in this area. The provision does not mean the board must engage consultants and in this regard it should take account of this debate and the wish of us all that it would not lightly take such a course of action.</P>
      <P>The consultants envisaged may not necessarily be of the business type. They could be technical or specialist. For example, in the nuclear area the board may wish to engage a consultant or adviser because it may not have the required expertise. In view of this it should be allowed the option to engage consultants. The provision refers to &ldquo;may, from time to time&rdquo;. It would be impossible to make it weaker in intent.</P>

      <P>This is an unusual section. I am interested in the powers vested in the board regarding gifts it may accept. Section 22(4) states: &ldquo;Any funds of the Board that are a gift or the proceeds of a gift to it may, subject to any terms or conditions of the gift, be invested by the Board in any manner in which a trustee is empowered by law to invest trust funds.&rdquo;  Will the Minister elaborate on what is meant by this?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a standard section and it applies where a board or statutory body is being established. The legislation must provide for the body to be able to receive gifts. When people pass away they often leave funds to different organisations. If this provision was not included the board would not be able to accept them. The purpose of subsection (4) is to make it clear that the board is not allowed to engage in any activities or invest any funds in areas that would not be legal. If it has received funds by way of a gift or the proceeds of a gift, depending on the terms of the gift, which could, for example, be laid down in the will of the donor, it could only be invested by the board in a legal manner. The trustees would have to be allowed by law to invest it in an item before the board could invest money in it. The provision seeks to copperfasten what the board would have to do in any event.</P>

It has been an honour and a privilege to have served on the legislation committee under the stewardship of the Minister. He has streamlined the passage of many Bills through the Oireachtas.

He has played a significant role in the survival of the Government, the longest serving one since the Second World War.</P>
      <P>The Minister has assisted this House in the initiation of 61 Bills over the past five years.

      <P>It was unusual to hear the Leader make the type of speech he just made. It was astonishing. At the concluding Stage of any Bill, one usually refers to the contents of that Bill, rather than engaging in a state of the nation address. The Leader took his opportunity to address an issue that was of no relevance to what the Minister brought before the House today. Nevertheless, I join Senator Cassidy in complimenting the Minister on the Bill. I hope that it proves to be very successful and that it enhances the role of the Civil Defence. I hope that the board proves to be a vibrant and committed one. I thank the Minister for his courtesy and for his responses to the questions raised here today.</P>

I thank the Minister for his courteous, efficient and prompt response to my question. It suggests that there is a level of good feeling towards the Civil Defence from former members. The fact that people leave small amounts of money to that organisation makes it all the more effective. They are obviously ordinary people who enjoyed their involvement with the Civil Defence so much that they left the organisation some money in their wills.</P>
      <P>I too compliment the Minister. He is a remarkable politician. He sat there, scarcely twitching with a smile, while the most outrageous compliments were heaped on him by Senator Cassidy. The only disagreement I have with Senator Taylor-Quinn's remarks is her use of the word &ldquo;astonishing&rdquo;. It was not astonishing at all &ndash; it was absolutely par for the course for Senator Cassidy. In fact, we have already had it once this morning on the Order of Business.

If the people of Westmeath are half as clever as I think they are, they will certainly elect him to the Dáil.

I thank the Senators for their co-operation in seeing 400 Bills through their various Stages, with or without amendment. I thank all the Senators for their kind comments.</P>
      <P>My colleagues and I in the Dáil have put a lot of work into Dáil reform in the last 12 months. We reconsidered the procedures of the House, which culminated in electronic voting, a new leaders' question time, reform of the committees, a new way of questioning Ministers and new time limits, and it has made a big difference. We have been able to process legislation in a much more effective way. The House is much more responsive now than it was a few years ago.</P>
      <P>Gone are the days when the whole country was discussing a particular issue but the Dáil was not. The Dáil now discusses the issues of the day, if not within minutes, certainly within hours of the rest of the country. That is a direct result of the parties getting together and deciding that the Dáil would not just do its job but be seen to do its job, and in so far as I can pass on that experience to the Seanad, I do so, and I recommend that the next Seanad gives the issue some consideration.

    <Title>Adjournment Matter. - School Refurbishment.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a fairly standard matter to raise on the Adjournment. On at least one occasion last week both matters on the Adjournment concerned national schools and the need to invest money in them, so I am following a tradition of the House. I raise this matter for a number of reasons. I lived in Greystones for five or six years and I know Kilcoole, a very attractive part of the country, quite well. More importantly, the chairperson of the board of management, Reverend Hurley, wrote to me about conditions in the school.</P>
      <P>I very much hope the Minister will be able to indicate that something can be done because the school was already given a promise which was reneged upon. It is very unfortunate that people's hopes should be raised in this manner and then dashed. I know that money is always tight in Government Departments and that things have to be prioritised. However, I hope that because this school was given the impression that repairs would be done that the commitment will be honoured.</P>
      <P>I have an engineer's report which indicates that if this report is not acted upon, the situation will deteriorate to the point where it will become much more expensive to conduct repairs in the future. So from the Government's point of view, it is wise housekeeping to intervene now and do the kind of repairs that will save it having to make a much greater investment further down the road. The engineer's report indicates it could deteriorate to the point where the building will be absolutely unusable. At the moment, it is not an appropriate environment for young people to be taught in.</P>
      <P>The school was opened in 1983, and despite it having a very good caretaker, the building requires immediate professional remedial work. When Reverend Hurley wrote to me on 22 March, he referred to downpours in previous weeks and indicated that things were so bad that teachers had to place dustbins and buckets to catch the rainwater. He also indicated that they were given to understand these works would be carried out during the summer break of 2002. However, the primary building section of the Department of Education and Science is now advising them that their case is not a priority and that there is no plan for the work to proceed in the foreseeable future. That is an extraordinary turnaround.</P>
      <P>A report on the school in the <i>Bray People</i> of Thursday, 28 December 2001 indicates that tiles are missing from the roof, windows are leaking and classroom ceilings are in a state of partial collapse. The report is accompanied by a couple of photographs showing water damage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1633" />The engineer's report was produced by JP Byrne &amp; Partners Limited of Arklow, County Wicklow. It indicates that the roofs have been identified as a source of water ingress for some time, the roof complex consists of a series of pitched roofs over the classroom blocks with flat roofs over the corridors and a high level flat roof over the GP hall. There are a series of coxdome roof lights over the corridors. The slated sides of the GP hall above corridor level contains 11 Georgian wire glazed units, which allow natural light into the hall. Many of these units are damaged and need to be replaced. There are defects in the slating throughout the roof structure and remedial works are required. Much of the external damage to roof finishes and glazing has been caused by vandalism. This is a real problem, and it is shocking that schools are attacked in this way, but unfortunately this is the climate in which we now live.  In addition to vandalism, there is the problem periodically caused by flat roofs, of which I have experience. I owned a building in Temple Bar at one point which we were using for charitable purposes of various kinds and it had a flat roof. It was continuously developing leaks and it had the same type of Plexiglas domes, which were a problem.</P>
    <P>The school also has problems in relation to cracks in the asphalt, and the fascias and soffits need to be painted. It appears that although there is a caretaker in the school who is spoken of highly by the manager, running repairs were not done sufficiently and the state of the place has deteriorated considerably.</P>
    <P>To sum up, many of the 31 roof lights have been badly damaged by vandalism and need to be replaced. The Georgian wire glazed units in the GP hall have been badly damaged by vandalism and the neoprene seals are no longer functioning in these units. There are cracks and blisters in the asphalt roof over the GP hall, cracks in the asphalt roof over the east-west corridor and the south side of the GP hall is a cause of water in the classroom below, so rain is actually entering the classrooms. There is damage to slating, which is evident in a number of classroom blocks, and in some areas the broken slates and defective flashing are allowing rain water to penetrate the interior. The fascias and soffits have deteriorated to the extent that replacement is required over approximately 50% of the roof perimeter. The purlins in the pitched roof need to be supported on the inner leaf. The down pipes are damaged throughout the entire roof perimeter and must be replaced in a number of areas. The deflection on a section of the internal roof is caused by excessive storage in that area, and I assume the manager will take steps to remove this material, which could cause a problem. There is damp penetration in quite a number of the classrooms due to vandalism and the decay of the materials, and it needs serious attention. The opening sashes of the windows are causing severe problems for staff. Some of the windows cannot be opened at all, and we all know how unpleasant <Col N="1634" /> it is to have to work in an environment where you cannot open the windows. Even in this gracious hall we find it necessary to open the windows &ndash; one of the windows is open today, and how pleasant it is to let the spring breeze in.</P>
    <P>The engineer's report concludes that the top priority should be to ensure that the building is weather proofed to prevent further deterioration and thus reduce future expenditure on maintenance works. I will not itemise the cost estimate as I am sure the Minister will have this in his possession. However, the total estimate comes to £132,300, with £16,537 in VAT. The Minister can discount the VAT as that goes straight back to the Government. The actual cost to the Government is about £140,000 when you add in contingencies, and it will really be a saving in the long run because if the building is maintained, it will not deteriorate to a situation where much greater expense will be incurred. It would be very nice to end this part of our parliamentary session on a positive note, and be able to indicate to the people in Kilcoole that some advance will be made.</P>
    <P>There is a serious problem of deterioration. They approached the Department and were given an undertaking that the work would be done this summer, but now they have been told there is no prospect of it being done at all. The photographs I have show up to 25 millimetres of water lodging on the roof. It is really not acceptable and I hope the Minister will have some good news for me.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Norris for raising this matter. As a former Minister for Education, I am only too aware of these kinds of problems. I am also aware of the commitment the Senator has made to the world of education over many years. I am glad he has given me the opportunity of outlining to the House the current position of the Department of Education and Science regarding an application for improved accommodation at St. Anthony's national school, Kilcoole, County Wicklow.</P>
      <P>At present, the school has a staffing level of principal, seven mainstream class teachers, one remedial teacher, one resource teacher and one temporary resource teacher for Travellers. The enrolment as of 30 September 2001 was 199. The school's facilities consist of eight classrooms, two learning support-resource teacher rooms and some limited ancillary accommodation.</P>
      <P>The allocation for primary buildings in 2002 is &euro;153.6 million, which is a record level of funding and demonstrates the Government's commitment to improving accommodation in primary schools, such as St. Anthony's national school, under the expanded schools building programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Due to the greatly increased level of activity in the primary school buildings area since the Government came into office, there has been a substantial increase in the number of major and minor building projects under construction. This has given rise to a record level of building and <Col N="1635" /> refurbishment activity. The Department of Education and Science expects to be in a position during this year to give detailed consideration to the application for improved accommodation at St. Anthony's national school, Kilcoole, as part of the expanded building programme. I assure the Senator that the Department is fully committed to the provision of improved accommodation at St. Anthony's national school. I thank the Senator once more for raising this issue.</P>
