      <P>I have received notice from Senator Cassidy that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources to outline the steps, if any, he will take to prevent the culling of all fish, including trout, killed in nets of Lough Sheelin; and if he will consider extending the pike fishing season to all year round as Lough Sheelin is the only lake in Ireland that has a total closed season.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Glynn of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to expedite the construction of the new gaelscoil at Ashe Road, Mullingar.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Taylor-Quinn of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to provide additional funding for the National Roads Authority in order that work on the Ennis bypass can commence this year.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Cassidy and Glynn as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. I regret that I have had to rule out of order the matter raised by Senator Taylor-Quinn as the Minister has no official responsibility in the matter.</P>

      <P>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business. The opportunity has arisen for the Taoiseach to come to the House to explain a number of issues and account for what is going on in Government. The first issue relates to the aquadome under construction in Abbotstown. The Taoiseach must explain to the House and the people how the Government contracted with a shelf company worth £4 sterling&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>

      <P>It is not in order to question my decision in relation to the matter the Senator submitted for the Adjournment debate.

      <P>I wish to express my concern also. This issue was aired on the radio yesterday when the spokesperson for Rohcon said he was not there to answer questions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not allow this matter to be discussed on the Order of Business, to which Senator Taylor-Quinn has proposed an amendment which Senator Norris has seconded. If the amendment is carried, I assume the Taoiseach will come to the House and these matters can then be raised with him. The Senator cannot pre-empt any discussion that might take place later today. I will not allow any further discussion on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>When will the promised debate on the situation in West Papua be held? I would be happy to have this matter taken in the context of a general discussion on foreign affairs. The Leader said last week that he was not sure there would be time for a debate on foreign affairs, but since it is one of the most important activities of this House, it would be appropriate to have such a discussion.</P>
      <P>The situation in the Middle East is extremely worrying. Ireland has a seat on the Security Council and we must ensure we do everything we can to convince Mr. Sharon to pull back from the appalling road down which he is propelling his own people and the people of Palestine.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Norris in his request for a debate on West Papua and the appalling situation developing in the Middle East. I congratulate the Government and the Leader of the House on agreeing to take motion No. 18 without amendment. It will be interesting to see Government members trooping through the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; lobby and condemning the Government in relation to its role in the education system over the last five years.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Taoiseach and Senators Fitzpatrick and Kett will be interested to see that the constituency of Dublin Central has voted &ldquo;No&rdquo;, by a margin of 60% to 40%, in the referendum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I simply want to follow my remark with a question. We raised this issue on the Order of Business a number of times and requested that the referendum not be put to the people. We called for the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health and Children to come to the House to explain the reason this divisive, meaningless referendum was being put.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the invitation made by Senator Taylor-Quinn to the Taoiseach to come to the House to explain the matters surrounding the national aquatic centre. If the Taoiseach is not available, the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation should come to the House as he has the special report on the matter. There are serious issues to be addressed. This is the time to have a full discussion on the entire development in Abbotstown.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I have two questions. The ASTI dispute has been exacerbated in recent days and we have heard nothing from the Minister for Education and Science in regard to a resolution. I gather that nothing will happen until next September and I urge the Minister to come to the House to explain why he has not tried to resolve the dispute. I will ask the Taoiseach when he comes to the House this afternoon why he has not chosen to intervene in the dispute to make sure students have the supports they need to do their examinations and the security of knowing their teachers will undertake supervision and substitution duties between now and June.</P>
      <P>A number of weeks ago I raised the issue of the granting of radio station licences, particularly in the Limerick area where there is only one station, and the Leader gave me his support. I call on the Minister for Public Enterprise to come to the House to outline her strategy to ensure more licences can be issued to those who wish to have alternative&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Independent Radio and Television Commission has decided there will be an open discussion on that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will be very much aware of who is on the board of the Independent Radio and Television Commission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should outline her strategy to award licences to cater for members of the public whose needs are not met by national radio stations or, in the case of Limerick, one local station. That is extraordinary when one considers the population of the city, county and the mid-west in general.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Government to address a major dent in the confidence of women regarding the legal system's response to the issue of violence against women, particularly in cases of rape and sexual assault, in light of the suspended sentence handed down in a rape case earlier this week and the trial involving the individual in the X case, who was found guilty of another sexual assault against a teenager, and the extent to which these decisions have undermined the confidence of women in how the <Col N="682" /> issue of violence against women is being handled? We have debated this issue on more than one occasion but it is extremely important and I call on the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come forward with a response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call by Opposition Members for a debate on the Middle East conflict. I ask the Leader to convey our gratitude to the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the fantastic work he has been doing to try to bring people together in the region. He made a significant statement yesterday when he supported the call for a summit meeting between Mr. Arafat and Mr. Sharon. Given that 60 people have been killed and hundreds injured over the past number of days, it is pointless to pretend this conflict will not impact on all of us. We must praise the Minister and ask him to maintain his efforts by monitoring the situation as closely as he has been doing. I congratulate the officials in our embassy in Tel Aviv&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I call on the Minister to continue the great work he has been doing because it is appreciated. I hope other EU member states and the UN Security Council will take on board what he has been saying.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader convey to the Minister for Health and Children the great need for a radiotherapy unit in the south east? There is a severe situation because there is no radiotherapy unit and people must&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call by Senator Taylor-Quinn to invite the Taoiseach or the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation to the House to thrash out the issues surrounding the aquatic centre. I particularly want to raise the issue of sentencing policy regarding the perpetrators of rape that has already been mentioned by other Senators. This is an extraordinarily serious issue particularly for young women. When talking about issues related to the referendum and also about assault cases against young women, somebody said to me recently&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Keogh, we cannot have a debate on the matter. I take it the Senator is supporting the request to the Leader that the Taoiseach or the Minister come to the House to debate the matter in detail.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. However, young women must report assaults. Unfortunately, the message and the type of language used in the recent notorious case do not help encourage women to do that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>Someone thinks this is a speech, but it is one of the most serious issues that should be addressed. The sincerely held views of people should be taken into account.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is an appropriate place to raise the issue and I thank you for that, a Chathaoirligh. We should spend time discussing with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform the kind of sentences that are imposed on perpetrators of very serious crimes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It has shocked the nation so it is a matter of urgency that he comes to the House. I ask the Leader for a debate on an issue very dear to his heart, funding for the BMW region which does not seem to be trickling down to the western region. On a number of occasions I have asked for a debate on the funding that was provided for the Objective One and BMW regions and this should be arranged as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I call on the Leader of the House to ask the Minister for Finance to come to the House to debate a suggestion which is beginning to gain ground in the banking and financial worlds that the two major banks, Allied Irish <Col N="684" /> Banks and Bank of Ireland, should merge. This is urgent because it is currently gaining much ground not just since last Sunday when, in an interview in <i>The Sunday Times, </i>the boss of one of the two big banks suggested it. It was also promoted last night during a major speech by the same person. I will not make a judgment on this, but if that developed, it would have serious consequences for consumers in Ireland. It should be nipped in the bud very quickly before it is allowed to develop. It would be good if the Minister, who is known to have views on this, came into the House at an early date to outline them.</P>

      <P>I call on the Leader of the House to arrange a debate on the insurance industry. We all know that many small firms are not able to function due to the cost of insurance and insurance claims. We need to carry out a root and branch examination of the industry, including the levels of compensation and premiums. We must have a debate as a matter of urgency.  </P>

      <P>I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on the fishing industry before the end of the session. I appreciate the fact that the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Fahey, has attempted to limit some of the regulations he intends to impose on the length of nets and the amount of tonnage required for inshore fishermen. This serious and major issue should be debated in the Houses of the Oireachtas as it is one example of where Europe is not working for the country. Small inshore fishermen will be wiped out.</P>
      <P>I also support Senator Burke's call for a debate on the BMW region. Last week I received a letter from the Commission for the West which contained a shopping list for counties Roscommon, Sligo and Mayo. I thought County Donegal was part of the north west and, therefore, part of the BMW region. There seems to be division within the group. It is important to address the issue.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Ross, as I always do, on the banking issue.</P>

I raised in the House with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Carriage Office the fact that the man convicted in the X case was driving a taxi long before the current victim was assaulted. I wonder what value such a debate would have.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I might provoke him into returning to his normal position. I would like such a debate to be extended to include the report by the European Commission on the collusion <Col N="685" /> between the banks which imposed excessively high charges on Irish consumers during the period from 1999 to 2002 when they ripped us off to compensate themselves for the introduction of the single currency. The fact they were able to do so when they were not merged is a good example of what they would do if they merged. The report deserves to be discussed, either as part of that debate or in a similar one.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader about No. 1 which we will refer to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights without debate, to which I do not have any objection. However, it is an important issue. If it comes back to the House, having been debated by the committee, and we pass it without debate, we will not meet our responsibilities. The motion is about a framework decision to combat trafficking in human beings. It is an issue of such fundamental importance that it would be wrong not to debate it. Can the Leader assure me that when it comes back from the committee we will have an opportunity to debate it? It is not a minor technical matter.</P>
      <P>It was distasteful that some Members opposite found it appropriate to heckle Senator Keogh. Violence against women is not just a woman's issue, but an issue for society. Society, particularly men, have an important contribution to make. I accept the issue should be debated.</P>
      <P>It is urgently necessary for this and the other House to debate the situation in the Middle East. It is becoming distastefully brutal to the extent where it seems to be a competition between the two sides to demonstrate which can be more brutal than the other. There is not just one guilty party in this instance; there are two such parties which seem to have resorted to levels of brutality we did not think were conscionable before now. I ask the Leader to try to make time available for statements on this issue if a full debate cannot be arranged.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Chathaoirligh. The principal amendments concern the introduction of a grant scheme for remediation works for houses with an unacceptably high level of radon and the deletion of certain provisions concerning chiropractors. I will mention very briefly each of the amendments that have been made dealing first with the radon grant scheme and then the position of chiropractors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Long Title, as revised, reflects the expansion of the contents of the Bill to include the grant scheme. The interpretation provision, section 1, has been modified to define a number of terms used in the Bill in relation to the proposed grant scheme. The framework for the establishment of a grant scheme for certain remediation works to houses that are used as residences is provided for in the new section 5. That section authorises the Minister to allocate money to the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland to administer a grant scheme for the carrying out of remediation works to a residence in respect of which measurements of radon gas taken inside that residence exceed 200 becquerels per cubic metre and to allocate money to the institute to cover the costs of administering the scheme. A reference level of 200 becquerels per cubic metre <Col N="691" /> for radon in dwellings has been adopted by most European countries.</P>
    <P>In section 5, provision is also made to authorise the institute to appoint inspectors to inspect remediation works where a person has applied for a grant and to require the institute to provide information to the Minister when requested and maintain records for a period to be prescribed by regulations.</P>
    <P>Inspections are provided for in section 6 and are limited to houses and remediation works which are the subject matter of an application under the scheme. In section 6(2) provision is made to exclude the Minister and the RPII from liability for any damages that an applicant may allege have been caused as a result of any other works undertaken for the purposes of carrying out remediation works. The incorporation of this immunity provision as well as that contained in section 10 is on the express advice of the Attorney General's office.</P>
    <P>Section 10 addresses the issue of the immunity of the Minister and the institute from suits in cases where damages are claimed by an applicant in relation to any injury to person or property alleged to have been caused by a failure to carry out any function conferred or imposed under this Act or alleged to have been caused by a contractor carrying out remediation works. I emphasise that these provisions do not in any way deprive applicants of any remedies that they may have against negligent contractors.</P>
    <P>The new section 7 deals with the payment of the grant. The grant covers 50% of the costs of remediation works up to a maximum level of &euro;1,000. It is payable only on completion of the remediation works and compliance with the provisions of the Act and regulations made under section 8. I am advised that estimates for the cost of radon remediation measures vary from about &euro;1,000 to &euro;2,000. A grant of 50% is reasonable given the estimates.</P>
    <P>Section 8 empowers the Minister to make regulations for the administration of the scheme by the institute and sets out the detail of the operation of the scheme. It contains a non-exhaustive list of the areas that may be covered by the regulations such as the duration of the scheme, requirements for applicants and houses, types of remediation works, inspections and requirements for contractors. Provision is also made requiring the Minister to lay such regulations before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Section 9 deals with accounts and audits and contains a standard provision imposing an obligation on the RPII to keep accounts of all moneys received and expended by it under the grant scheme. The accounts for the grant scheme will be contained in the institute's annual report and laid before the Oireachtas in the usual way. In addition, the institute is required to furnish a copy of the accounts for the grant scheme to the Comptroller and Auditor General for audit. The institute must provide the Minister with a copy of <Col N="692" /> the audit report and the Minister is obliged to lay that report before the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the immunity provision in section 10 when I discussed section 6. However, I wish to reiterate the point that these provisions do not in any way affect any remedies an applicant may have against a negligent contractor.</P>
    <P>Section 11 is concerned with offences and penalties. This section creates three summary offences. They concern obstructing inspectors and the provision of false and misleading information. The penalty on conviction is a fine of up to &euro;1,904 and-or imprisonment for a period not exceeding six months. The new section 12(3) modifies the commencement provisions so that the Minister may bring different parts of the Act into operation at different times.</P>
    <P>In so far as chiropractors are concerned, section 2(<i>b</i>) of the Bill contained an amendment to section 30 of the Radiological Protection Act, 1991, to the effect that only practitioners meeting criteria set down by the Department of Health and Children, primarily doctors and dentists, would be licensed by the RPII to use x-ray apparatus for medical diagnostic purposes. The text was incorporated into the Bill in an effort to deal with an apparent anomaly in legislation administered by my Department and the Department of Health and Children concerning the position of chiropractors and the use of x-ray equipment. That provision tried to deal with one aspect of much broader and important policy issues concerning public health, safety and the regulation of persons who offer various forms of therapeutic treatment but who are not medical practitioners. Unfortunately, the attempt to resolve the issue in this way caused considerable delay to the introduction of the main provisions of this Bill. Accordingly, and having been advised that the Minister for Health and Children will shortly be in a position to effect the transposition, by means of regulations, of the Medical Exposures Directive, I sought and obtained agreement on Committee Stage to the deletion of the provision that was significantly delaying the passage of this important legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, to the House to conclude the final Stages of this important legislation. I am glad he clarified that it is three years since this Bill was introduced here because I was wondering where I was when the Bill came before the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>So were we all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnieCaffrey" hpid="Mr. Caffrey Mr. Caffrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I was in America or elsewhere. I am glad that it has come back again. At this juncture I will not contribute anything which will substantially change the legislation. As the Minister of State said, it has done the rounds of the House and considerable debate has taken place in the Lower House on all the amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the provision of grant aid for remediation of radon gas for dwellings located in areas <Col N="693" /> where this is a particular menace. If there was anything missing from this Bill &ndash; perhaps it is included; I have not had time to read the entire Bill &ndash; it is that geographical areas where radon gas is predominant should be identified. If they were, perhaps planning authorities might take it into consideration when issuing planning permission because there seem to be definite geographical locations where the incidence of this particular gas is much higher than others. People buying property, especially second hand houses, in rural and urban areas should be advised to do a preliminary test for radon gas. It is a simple test and the equipment is very easily obtained and easy to use. It is a question of installing it for a while to get a reading.</P>
    <P>The amendments are worthwhile. If I had any reservations about them, it would be the fact that the grant level is possibly too low in many instances given that the costs of remedial work to any kind of property are soaring and price inflation in the building industry is extremely high. Nevertheless, I welcome the grant and commend the Minister of State for accepting that amendment in the other House. Many people will benefit and it will raise public awareness of this problem. Very few were even aware that there was such a problem. Fewer still believed that it posed a threat to our health. The Bill has created an awareness of the potential dangers and hazards of radon gas.</P>
    <P>I welcome all the amendments to which I certainly cannot add at this juncture, except to say that emphasis could be put on certain geographical areas where there are high radon gas levels in order that people would be more conscious of them when selecting and building houses. As I said, it is only in recent years that this has been identified as a problem. Like all new problems, they tend to be ignored for a long time until the scientific evidence is irrefutable that there is a specific danger to health. That evidence has now been well established by the scientific community and it is up to the public to respond and take cognisance of all the implications that radon gas has for house building and house purchasing in general.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, congratulate the Minister of State on having brought forward this Bill. For a very long time we totally underestimated the problem posed by radon gas and the effect it has on human health. The Minister of State should encourage the development of baselines in various areas to signify the approximate extent of the problem in those areas. It would be worthwhile doing this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister of State was in the House discussing Sellafield I pointed out that if there is an influence on human health here, we are in a rather weak position to point it out because we do not have baselines regarding the problems caused by unlicensed dumps which may contain hazardous material due to the high levels of nitrates in ground water. We need to try to estab<Col N="694" /> lish baselines in order that we can see the current levels, to determine if they are increasing or decreasing, and what effect they have on human health. Certainly, the importance of radon, even among the medical profession, has been recognised only in the past two decades. I congratulate the Minister of State very much on taking action in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State back to the House to deal with this Bill. Like Senator Caffrey, I was not present when it went through its early Stages in the House. As we know, it amends the 1991 and 1995 Acts. It is very important that we welcome the developments brought forward in it because, in the light of the wide use of radioactive substances, it is vital that the functions, licensing and regulatory roles of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland are constantly reviewed and upgraded. Present colleagues would be more aware than I that there is an increasing use of radioactive substances in laboratories, hospitals, dental surgeries and other such places. It is vital that their use and movement are properly regulated. In the light of this, it is all the more necessary that the role and functions of the institute, particularly its regulatory and licensing functions, are reviewed on a constant basis and, if necessary, they should be expanded or extended to cover ongoing developments.</P>
      <P>I commend the work of the institute which has a wide range of functions. It monitors and provides professional expertise of the highest level for the Government in respect of the nuclear industry and its proliferation. We are all only too painfully aware &ndash; I did not have the opportunity to comment on this last week &ndash; of the huge risks to life and the environment both in Ireland and the United Kingdom posed by Sellafield. Considerable work has been done by the Minister, backed up by the professionals in the institute. I commend the commitment, zeal and professionalism they bring to bear on their work.</P>
      <P>The recent commissioning of the MOX plant was a blatant and abominable affront by BNFL and the British Government to a friendly neighbour. I know the Minister of State is drawing very heavily on the expertise available to him in the institute and that he will build on the rights established as a result of an interim judgment by the tribunal on the law of the sea before Christmas. Clearly defined rights have been laid down, the corollary to which is that duties have been clearly laid down which the British Government must honour. I know the expertise will be and is available to build on these rights in any actions, some of which have already been initiated and are in progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As somebody who taught in schools for a number of years before coming to the Houses, I certainly was not aware of the existence of radon or the threat it posed to health. It is very encouraging to find that the institute is doing quite extensive work throughout the country and has <Col N="695" /> mapped areas, although not to the extent that Senator Caffrey has called for. I ask that the proposals he has made be followed up as a matter of priority. However, there is extensive work being done. As far as I am aware, the national survey is near completion, if not completed.</P>
    <P>Since the risk posed has come to public attention in recent times there is no doubt that every effort should be made, as a matter of priority, to ensure the areas of highest risk are designated as such and that appropriate remedial action is taken. In this context, I welcome the decision by the Minister to introduce a grant of 50%. Senator Caffrey expressed the opinion that this might not be adequate. I am not competent to express support for, or refute, such an opinion. However, in view of what has been put to him by the Senator, the Minister of State might look at the matter again. There is no doubt that, because of the now known risk to health caused by the presence of radon gas, we should ensure there is every encouragement and incentive in order that the owners of domestic and public dwellings can eliminate this risk as early as possible and take adequate and full remedial action.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister of State on bringing back the Bill for completion and commend the institute for the wonderful work it is doing. It is very encouraging to find that such refreshing, informative and transparent work is being done by it to inform the public and allay its fears in respect of radiological safety where possible. Once again, I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Ní thógfaidh mé mórán ama ach amháin é seo a rá. I agree that the RPII does a wonderful job, but it is worth pointing out that it was a late convert to the view long held by the public in Ireland that Sellafield posed a major risk to our health and safety. For quite a while it was inclined to play down the risks associated with it. It is a long-standing view of mine that we should never rely too much on experts. Speaking as one who would probably be described as an expert in certain areas, technologically speaking, the public should never rely on experts. Experts are advisers and rarely have to take ultimate responsibility for the consequences of their advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The RPII was led by public opinion rather than informing it on the issue of Sellafield. It is worth remembering this about other agencies, including the Health and Safety Authority and the Environmental Protection Agency. They have an important role to play, but the public should never allow itself to be persuaded that these expert bodies can hand down authoritative judgments which last forever. The RPII's attitude to Sellafield is a good example. I have been critical of the Government on the issue of Sellafield, but the Minister of State's current view is much more radical than that held by the RPII 15 years ago. We have all learnt. If we had listened to the experts we would probably not have come to the <Col N="696" /> view we now, as a united community, have about Sellafield.</P>
    <P>I welcome the amendments because they are a necessary part of any attempt to protect people from background radiation. The Minister of State said the standard of 200 becquerels per cubic metre applies in most European countries. Does this mean that some countries have a more rigorous or a less rigorous standard? I would be interested to know which is the case. I hope we are enforcing standards which are the most strict in Europe. I am not in a position to know this and I hope the Minister of State can tell me.</P>
    <P>My second question refers to the amount of funding which is available. It is one thing to make a grant scheme possible but an entirely separate thing to make enough funds available to deal with a large number of applications. Do we have any idea how many applications can be expected in the first 12 months, the scale of funding and how many applications will be funded? Members of local authorities will know better than I do that there are many grant schemes, for example, for the conservation of listed buildings and so on, for which funding applications must be submitted by the beginning of the financial year. Applications submitted later than that will probably have to wait a full year. Although owners of listed properties are constrained by planning laws, the grants to help them maintain their properties usually run out within a month or two.</P>
    <P>I am concerned by the immunities from litigation granted by the legislation. When we debated the Disability Bill we had a long discussion about the attempt to make the obligation to provide services to people with disabilities non-enforceable in court. I would not like everybody to be able to sue the RPII or the Minister for everything they did not do and I accept that the Minister of State says that negligent contractors are still capable of being sued. However, it is also conceivable that the RPII might be negligent. Expert bodies are not perfect and neither is the Minister of State, although he is not far off it.</P>
    <P>The public should not be precluded from taking the same action against a negligent Minister, Department or State agency as they might take against a private individual. That is what republican democracy is about. I am happy to talk about restrictions which would prevent limitless open-ended cases, but gross negligence on the part of the RPII should be capable of being redressed. The scale of negligence that appears to have been shown by the Irish Blood Transfusion Service in the past concerns me and the idea that such a level of negligence would be excluded from civil action for damages also concerns me. I do not suggest that this would happen. However, our experience has been that bodies which have high levels of responsibility for human safety have not done their job very well. Otherwise we would not have the hepatitis C and other scandals. Bodies which should have known better did not do their jobs properly.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="697" />Are we saying that if the RPII fails to do its job properly in the area of the grants scheme, fails to give good advice or is negligent in dealing with the advice it gives, it can not be sued? This would eliminate accountability and that is not right. I am not in a position to vote against this amendment. I accept that the contractors are open to being sued, but no State agency should be given a blanket exemption from responsibility for its own negligence.</P>
    <P>Are chiropractors who want to use x-ray equipment regulated in some way? The idea that they might not be is something which would make most of us very nervous. X-ray equipment is potentially dangerous and some level of regulation is necessary, even if it is not currently applicable here. In principle, I welcome the introduction of the grant scheme. It is long overdue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions and for their broad welcome for this grant scheme. It is an excellent thing. The exhortations of Senator Caffrey and other colleagues that public awareness be raised will be realised by the announcement of this new scheme. There will be an amount of advertising by the RPII and by the Department and this will raise public awareness, which is necessary if we are to deal with what Senator Caffrey calls this menace. We are at one with Senator on that point.</P>
      <P>Senator Liam Fitzgerald lauded the RPII for the work it has done and I share his sentiments. The entire country has been surveyed and the findings are more or less as Senator Caffrey indicated. The areas which have been established as high radon areas are in counties Carlow, Galway, Louth, Mayo, Sligo, Waterford, Wexford and Wicklow and the cities of Cork and Galway. Not all houses in high radon areas are affected. This is why it is important that the test which is available at the institute is availed of and the levels of radon in individual homes established. The important work of surveying schools has been done and remediation works are well advanced. I am grateful to the Minister for Education and Science for footing the bill for that important work. Our children spend a great deal of time in school. In some schools, certain rooms were found to be safe while others had high levels and required remediation work.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Fitzgerald's sentiments regarding the RPII. I took careful note of Senator Henry's remarks on other issues with regard to baselines and they make good sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The survey that has been carried out nationwide has established where we have difficulty with radon. Radon has been with us from time immemorial. Perhaps the State and successive Governments ought to have been more aware of it before but, <i>Deo gratias</i>, we are doing something about it now. The problem areas have been identified and the problem in houses, schools and parts of schools has been or is in the course of <Col N="698" /> being identified. This is probably the penultimate leg in dealing with it and, by putting this grant in place, we are encouraging people to do the final part themselves.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan raised the question of immunities. As far as this Bill is concerned, the immunities reflect the fact that the carrying out of remediation works is a matter of contract between the house owner and the contractor. Neither the Minister of the day nor the RPII is responsible for carrying out the works. Inspections on behalf of the RPII are to verify that the works are required in the first instance and that they have been carried out to the required standard. It is appropriate, indeed prudent, to have that immunity factor included in the legislation.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan also raised the issue of chiropractors. That is largely related to the Department of Health of Children but it is the issue that delayed the finalisation of this legislation for many years. That is a good thing in a way. We have the radon grant and the important thing was to secure the funding. That is not easy and one has to push for it. However, we got the funding. I would like to have announced it a couple of years ago but we have it now. Thereafter, we had to put the scheme and its structure together. At the eleventh hour, however, it became apparent, from directions given by the Office of the Attorney General, that the RPII, which we had intended to administer the scheme, was not legally empowered to do so. We are using this legislation to empower the RPII to administer the scheme. I am happy, therefore, that this legislation was available to deal with that aspect of the issue.</P>
    <P>The competence and qualifications of persons entitled to use X-ray equipment are matters for the Minister for Health and Children. My responsibility, through the RPII, relates to the calibration of equipment and the use of certain dangerous substances. That control is provided by the institute but the competence and qualifications of the persons entitled to use that equipment is a matter for the other Department.</P>
    <P>A question was raised about the 200 becquerels per cubic metre and where Ireland lay on the scale in the European context. The International Commission on Radiological Protection, the ICRP, published a report, publication 65, on protection against radon at home and at work. It recommended intervention where radon gas levels in dwellings were within a certain range. Our national reference standard of 200 becquerels per cubic metre corresponds to the lower end of that range. My own inquiries indicate that it is, in the main, the standard adopted by other European countries.</P>
    <P>I hope I have not omitted any other issues raised by Senators. I am grateful to the Senators for their contributions today and for their support for the legislation. I take the points made with regard to the scale of the grant but I believe it will do the job we want. It will encourage people to take the necessary remediation action and I am glad the funding to do it is in place. I thank my officials for their excellent work. A great deal of <Col N="699" /> the work on this legislation was done behind the scenes. I also thank the RPII and my colleagues in the Houses for their help and support with this important and welcome legislation.</P>

    <P>Amendment No. 3 not moved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 11, between lines 9 and 10, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(i) taken in circumstances which gives rise to a failure to meet the fundamental rights of the child, in particular where such failure gives rise to an urgent need,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This was discussed on Committee Stage last week and we went through it in detail then. I was disappointed that the Minister did not accept the views that were expressed on this side of the House at the time. In the intervening time, I have not changed my mind on the amendment. It not only enhances the Bill, but the case can be made that it is required in the context of the need to protect the rights of the child. The insertion of this amendment in section 8, which is the section relating to complaints against public bodies, schools and voluntary hospitals, would considerably broaden the scope of the powers and functions of the ombudsman. The Minister of State will say that is the reason she is not in favour of it.</P>
      <P>When one looks at the context in which we are working it is clear to any of us operating in the public domain and those who read the newspapers that there is a need to take more action to protect the fundamental rights of children. While it is clearly a stated obligation of the health boards to act on behalf of children &ndash; I am sure the Minister of State will remind me of this &ndash; it is obvious from our experience as public representatives and legislators that there have been too many cases where the fundamental rights of children have not been totally protected. There is no need to rehearse instances because the Minister of State knows those to which I am referring.</P>
      <P>The objective of the amendment is to broaden and strengthen the role of the ombudsman in relation to the fundamental rights of children, particularly where the failure to meet the fundamental rights of children gives rise to an urgent need. I appeal to the Minister of State to accept our views and recognise the reason we have tabled the amendment. We are not trying to be obstructive or negative, but to strengthen the Bill which is fine legislation that we all support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment. We spent time on Committee Stage debating the need to promote and protect the rights of children. I stated we felt strongly about protecting the rights of children. The Minister of State talked about putting too much responsibility on the ombudsman. However, we must be assured that children will be protected, particularly in health boards, and that there will not be any flaws in the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="701" />
      <Col N="702" />The amendment would not subvert the functions of the health boards, the courts or any other statutory body. It highlights the reason the Bill was introduced. We want the Bill to protect the rights of the most vulnerable children in our society who are detained in prison cells because there is not any place to put them. It will only be half a Bill if we accept the need to promote the rights of children, but do not protect their rights. It would not be an undue burden on the ombudsman because it is part of his job. Mr. Justice Kelly seems to be protecting the rights of children at present. I know the Minister of State is concerned about the lives of children. I am surprised at the level of resistance to protecting the rights of children when the system does not do so. I urge the Minister of State to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>There are people throughout the country who protect the rights of children on a daily basis, whether it is their statutory responsibility, including voluntary groups and bodies. The amendment seeks to encourage the Ombudsman for Children to investigate a complaint if it gives rise to an urgent need and affects the child's fundamental rights. The Ombudsman for Children can investigate complaints, such as those which fall under that category. He can examine such instances on his own authority. He does not have to wait for a complaint to be referred to his office. As has already been said, he can also address such issues through his promotional role of the welfare of children. He has a promotional and an investigative role. If there is an urgent need for an issue to be addressed, the Ombudsman for Children can undertake an examination and issue recommendations. Some of the issues referred to today and discussed last week, such as children who are inappropriately held, would be investigated by the ombudsman. I cannot accept the amendment because the ombudsman can already do what is suggested in it. The last day we discussed the Bill we said definitions of urgent need, etc. would cause many problems.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 14, between lines 21 and 22, to insert the following: </P>
      <P>&ldquo;Notwithstanding the terms of <i>section 11(1)(a)</i>, the Ombudsman may apply to intervene in any court proceedings involving the welfare of a child as an <i>amicus curiae</i>, and may furthermore initiate such proceedings as it considers necessary for the exercise of his or her functions.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment attempts to insert in the legislation the right of the ombudsman to intervene in or initiate proceedings, particularly court proceedings involving the welfare of a child as an <i>amicus curiae</i>, and to initiate such proceedings as it considers necessary for the exercise of his or her functions. The amendment is similar to the <Col N="703" /> one we have just discussed, but more specific in terms of court proceedings and the right of the ombudsman to intervene in or initiate such proceedings. However, it is based on the same fundamental principle I have already outlined.</P>
    <P>I refer to a submission made by the Children's Rights Alliance following our debate on Committee Stage last week. It pointed out that the power of the court to intervene to protect the rights and welfare of children has been limited in recent court decisions. It stated: </P>
    <P>The recent Supreme Court decision of <i>T.D. (a minor suing by his mother and next friend M.D.) v. The Minister for Education, Ireland and The Attorney General, The Eastern Health Board and by order The Minister for Health and Children </i>[unreported, Supreme Court, 17 December, 2001] has placed clear limitations on the Courts power to intervene to protect the rights and welfare of children. Murray J., expressing the majority view of the Supreme Court, alluded to the exceptional circumstances that must be present before the Court can order the executive to fulfil a legal obligation.</P>
    <P>The decision in <i>F.N. v. Minister for Education </i>[1995] .&nbsp;. must now be appraised in the light of the <i>T.D. </i>decision in so far as it impacts on the ability of the Courts to make orders against the administrative branch of Government where there is a default of its constitutional obligation. [In <i>F.N. v. Minister for Education </i>.&nbsp;. the High Court declared that the State was under a constitutional obligation to establish suitable arrangements for children in need of high support care].</P>
    <P>In the light of the submission we have received, the question now arises as to whom should the function for the protection of the rights of children fall if not to the Ombudsman for Children. I discussed the legislation with a group of school children from the convent in Nenagh who were in the House last week. I was in the school on Monday and we discussed the amendments, particularly the need to have a champion for children. We should go as far as possible to meet the needs and expectations of the wider community, particularly of children, in terms of protecting their fundamental rights. The right to intervene in or initiate proceedings, particularly in the light of the submission we have received from the Children's Rights Alliance, should be taken on board.</P>

      <P>I second the amendment. I agree with Senator O'Meara that the ombudsman should not only intervene, but have the right to refer cases to the courts and act as an <i>amicus curiae. </i>Cases are regularly referred not only to domestic courts but also to their international counterparts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State appears to be resisting the extension of powers to the ombudsman. I see she is nodding her head. I do not believe the ombudsman would be fearful about intervening <Col N="704" /> because the basic rights of children will be at issue. Many of these cases end up either in a domestic or an international court. In that context, it would be even more appropriate that the ombudsman be given power to act as <i>amicus curiae</i>. I do not know why the Minister of State's interpretation of what should be the ombudsman's duties is so limited, particularly as we are concerned with extremely vulnerable children who must have access to the ombudsman.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to outline what the ombudsman will and will not do. The ombudsman cannot replace the various groups that work for and on behalf of children. The person appointed cannot subsume all of the responsibilities of these different groups. The ombudsman's office will, compared to other similar offices throughout the world, have a very broad remit in so far as it will be designated with two particular roles, the first of which involves the promotion and welfare of children while the second will centre on the investigation of complaints. To broaden the remit any further would lead to a cross-over into many other areas of work.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Meara quoted the T.D. case which, in fact, dealt with the separation of powers and is not really relevant in this instance. There is no doubt that everyone believes children need to be protected in the courts. That is why the system of guardian <i>ad litem</i> exists. As stated on Committee Stage, this system needs to be reviewed. The children's office, as a co-ordinating body working between the different Departments, is working on this matter at present. I accept that the system needs to be reviewed, properly funded, etc. However, I do not believe we should leave the system to one side and try to confer all the responsibility on to the Ombudsman for Children.</P>
      <P>If the ombudsman is to be successful in his work, in either a promotional or investigative way, it will be important that he will be able to obtain the co-operation of the different bodies with which he will be obliged to deal. Such co-operation might not be forthcoming if the ombudsman had the added role of being able to refer matters to the courts. I am not sure that conferring an additional role on the Ombudsman for Children would in any way benefit the office. In my opinion, it would change completely the focus of the office. Those who are responsible for children and for looking after their needs, in society and in the courts, need to play their role and uphold their own responsibilities and not seek to pass them on to someone else.</P>
      <P>I am not willing to accept the amendment. However, I will give consideration to the guardian <i>ad litem</i> service to see how it can be improved.</P>

      <P>While I welcome the Minister of State's comments in respect of the review of the guardian<i> ad litem</i> system, I do not believe what she said was sufficient. This Administration is approaching the end of its term of office and a <Col N="705" /> review will, in effect, merely place the matter on the long finger. While I would not question the Minister of State's commitment to bringing forward proposals on this matter, the fact is that they have not been presented, we do not know when they will be produced or what they will contain.</P>
      <P>We are concerned here with considering the issue of the protection of the rights of children. I do not accept the Minister of State's argument about what other countries do. Frankly, I do not care what other countries do. They are obliged to legislate for their societies, while we are concerned with legislating for circumstances in Ireland. We are concerned, through the medium of this Bill, with legislating for the Irish situation and, in particular, for Irish children, a number of whom are in need of greater protection than they are already receiving and others who are in need of someone to state on their behalf that the health boards and other agencies which have statutory responsibility for them are not, for many reasons, protecting their rights.</P>
      <P>I cannot accept the Minister of State's arguments, even though I accept her bona fides in relation to the review of the <i>ad litem</i> system. As she stated, however, that system is not satisfactory at present. In that context, this amendment is necessary and it is being actively sought by the Children's Rights Alliance which, as the Minister of State knows, is an umbrella body that represents a range of organisations and individuals who have considerable knowledge, expertise and experience in this area. In that regard alone, I ask her to reconsider the position.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 15, to delete lines 12 and 13.</P>
      <P>I had hoped that the Government would have introduced an amendment in respect of this matter because I was of the opinion that I had made some progress on Committee Stage in terms of encouraging the Department to deal with the exclusion of the children of refugees, asylum seekers, immigrants and children in prison from having access to the ombudsman. I am disappointed about that. The section states that &ldquo;if the action is one taken in the administration of the law relating to asylum, immigration, naturalisation or citizenship&rdquo;, a definition which is so broad that, in my opinion, it excludes everything. The children of immigrants or asylum seekers should have equal access to the Ombudsman for Children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State appeared to indicate in her reply on Committee Stage that I might have been interpreting section 11(1)(<i>e</i>)(i) as referring to the processing of an application. I am not suggesting that and I am not saying that the ombudsman will act as a court of appeal with regard to the issue of an applicant's asylum or refugee status. Is the Minister of State in a position to convince me that there is not an exclusion of complaints about decisions regarding refugees, <Col N="706" /> regardless of whether this would relate to any area of direct provision involving the treatment of asylum seeking children? In my opinion, the children of asylum seekers will be totally excluded from seeking the assistance of the ombudsman.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage, there appeared to be resistance on the part of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to allowing the Ombudsman for Children to stray into its area of responsibility. I would like the Minister of State to address this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment. There is nothing to add to what Senator Jackman stated, with the exception of saying that this is an extremely important amendment. This matter was discussed at length on Committee Stage and it is quite fundamental not only in terms this legislation but also in respect of the increasingly thorny question of how we should deal with asylum seekers and their children. Senator Jackman is not suggesting that the ombudsman act as a court of appeal in respect of the question of an application for asylum or refugee status. I would think it is quite clear that this is not the case and that the ombudsman would be constrained from investigating complaints regarding the treatment of asylum seeking children in direct provision under this particular exclusion.</P>
      <P>The principle at the heart of the amendment is extremely important. I support the amendment and I urge the Minister of State to take on board the points that have been raised.</P>

      <P>I also support Senator Jackman's amendment, not because I believe the ombudsman should investigate asylum seeking, refugee or citizenship issues but because the Bill appears to exclude the children of asylum seekers, refugees and immigrants from being able to make complaints about how they are treated by various Departments, voluntary hospitals, etc.</P>

      <P>As promised on Committee Stage, further extensive discussions took place with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in relation to obtaining clarification with regard to what the Ombudsman for Children could investigate in this area. The current position with regard to immigration and citizenship issues, on foot of the exemption in the Ombudsman's Act, is that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform responds to queries from the Ombudsman's office concerning customer service issues &ndash; which would include those matters raised by the Senator &ndash; but not in relation to the decision-making processes used in individual cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to persons in the asylum process, there are comprehensive legislative provisions in place to deal with the processing of asylum applications by the Refugee Applications Commission, which deals with applications of first instance, and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, which considers <Col N="707" /> appeals as a quasi-judicial body. Both bodies are independent, by statute, in the exercise of their functions, thus the exact role of the ombudsman's office in relation to them is a matter for clarification between the offices concerned.</P>
    <P>I know that Senators are not concerned about the decision making processes <i>per se</i>. However, I am informed that the offices would respond in a proactive manner to any inquiry from the ombudsman's office and the Ombudsman for Children, having due regard to their independence and the importance of protecting the identities of asylum applicants who have very clear remedies in relation to any concerns about the decision making process and any perceived incorrect application of procedures. They have the right to raise the matter with solicitors, legal representatives, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, in judicial review proceedings, etc. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is satisfied that, whereas the decision making process is excluded, all other matters &ndash; what it refers to as the customer service issue &ndash; would be responded to by the Ombudsman for Children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not take from what the Bill states: &ldquo;.&nbsp;. if the action is one taken in the administration of the law&rdquo;. In that context, who is to know what customer services or difficulties the children of asylum seekers or refugees may have would be addressed? It is a very dramatic and specific statement which, on my reading, specifies &ldquo;the administration of the law&rdquo;.  While I appreciate what the Minister of State said and accept that the application process would not be interfered with &ndash; as the ombudsman would have no right to do &ndash; the provision certainly excludes the children of asylum seekers and refugees.</P>
      <P>The intention of my amendment, on Committee Stage, was to make it clear there was an inclusiveness in relation to whatever the many requirements of such children might be. On my reading of the Bill, they are excluded. I would have hoped for a rephrasing to show that there is a certain access available, which is not inherent in the present wording. I am extremely concerned in that regard. While we are dealing with the interpretation today, somebody else, further down the line, may read this and say it has nothing to do with them, the ombudsman cannot intervene and is prohibited from doing so because, if the action is one taken in the administration of the law, it is excluded. That is my simple reading of it and I believe that is how any other person or organisation, including the ombudsman, is likely to interpret it. Really and truly, therefore, those children would be second-class citizens.</P>
      <P>The following statement by Children's Rights Alliance may be helpful to the Minister of State: </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The exclusion fails to incorporate the principles that underpin the statement of good practice produced by the Separated Children in Europe Programme. This states that separated <Col N="708" /> children are entitled to the same treatment and rights as national or resident children. They must be treated as children, first and foremost. All consideration of their immigration status must be secondary.</P>
    <P>That statement is very clear, but, unfortunately, it may not be referred to by somebody seeking to define the rights of children in terms of access to the ombudsman.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned and hope the Minister of State will give an assurance that, when the Bill goes to the Dáil, there may be a rephrasing of the wording in question. This issue also relates to amendment No. 3. Will the Minister of State give an assurance that it will be redrafted to avoid excluding any complaint? It is implicit in the present wording that there are exclusions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator has put her finger on the issue in referring to &ldquo;the administration of the law&rdquo;. It is the administration of the law with which we are concerned in this instance, not the provision of services. In the particular case of separated children, unaccompanied minors, for example, are under the care of the health boards, which are specifically included. As the Bill refers to the administration of the law, that is what defines that it is the decision making process which is involved, as opposed to the provision of services for the people concerned.</P>

      <P>In page 15, to delete lines 18 to 22.</P>
      <P>Perhaps there is not much hope of this amendment being accepted as it follows in the same vein as the previous one. That is unfortunate because we spent some time on this. I urge the Minister of State to have the existing phrase redrafted. It states: &ldquo;.&nbsp;. if the action is one taken in the administration of the prisons or other places for the custody or detention of children committed to custody or detention by the courts.&rdquo; The reference clearly is to institutions other than reformatories or industrial schools &ndash; we are specifically speaking of children in prison who are among the vulnerable groups mentioned by Mr. Justice Kelly. They are the young people who have to resort to prison cells and are legitimately in places such as St. Patrick's Institution. They are excluded by virtue of being offenders. I am not referring to those who are in prison because they have no other place to go to &ndash; the Minister of State made it clear they would be in a separate category. Such minors are the very children at risk who should have access to the ombudsman. I find this extraordinary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child provides for the protection of the rights of young people in the criminal justice sys<Col N="709" /> tem. How does the Irish system compare to the UN convention, Article 37 of which refers to the dignity of the child charged with an offence and guarantees detention as a measure of last resort for the shortest appropriate period of time? That is very protective, supportive and sympathetic towards children in prison, yet in Ireland the ombudsman will not be available to deal with issues which affect those children more seriously than an adult population. I hope the Minister of State will look again at the wording of this provision.</P>
    <P>I also submit the following quotation: &ldquo;The Ombudsman for Children should be allowed to conduct investigations into actions by the public bodies most relevant to the lives of these children, including prisons or other places for the custody and detention of children.&rdquo;  The reference is to a situation in New Zealand, where there is a children's commission authority and children in prisons appear to be included for access. Why is our system different? It is clear that such children would be in dire need of somebody outside of the prison system and that the ombudsman should be available to deal with their issues, however minor they may appear to be.</P>
    <P>Why are they excluded? I suggest it is because the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform selfishly &ndash; I would use a stronger word if I could find one &ndash; does not wish any other Department to have any intervention or interface between the responsibility of the Minister of State and that of the Department. I am putting it quite strongly as I am sure the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform had an input in this matter. This should have afforded the Minister of State the latitude to take this issue on board. Can she give a commitment to reconsider the language used in this regard? This is extremely important.</P>

      <P>I second Senator Jackman's amendment and endorse what she said in relation to it and the wording of the Bill. There are, surely, no more vulnerable children requiring the ombudsman's intervention than those in prison. In many cases, they are without the support of their parents or adults who could ensure their rights are protected. The Bill is considerably lacking in this regard, with particular reference to the broad terms of the language used, as Senator Jackman has stated. I had hoped the Minister of State would come back with some revised wording, having reviewed the situation following the debate in the House on the issue last week.</P>

Senator Jackman's description of how the Department works is a charitable one. It is unfortunate it should look as if it is running a type of gulag archipelago in which there can be no rights for the children within it. It does it no credit that <Col N="710" /> it appears to have a desire to run such a closed set of institutions. It is a great pity that the Minister of State has not been able to get it to agree to the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">

      <P>This and the previous amendment are very different in approach. I did not accept the previous amendment on the basis that we are satisfied that the Bill is as inclusive as the Senators want to make it, while I accept that this one would represent a very definite exclusion. Following very extensive discussions with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, it pointed out that prisoners already have recourse to the remedy of complaints. It includes independent visiting committees which publish reports. Complaints can be made to them by prisoners who can request that their complaints be made in private. The committees have a duty to report any abuses observed or found by them in prisons. An inspector of prisons has been nominated and will take up his appointment in April this year. Mr. Justice Kinlen will take up the appointment on his retirement from the High Court. The European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment can inspect and report to the Government on the treatment of prisoners. A prisoner also has recourse to the courts and the European Court of Human Rights. The available options in terms of complaints far exceed what is envisaged by giving a role to the Ombudsman for Children who will investigate complaints of maladministration.</P>
      <P>One of the other issues raised was the fact that in some of the institutions concerned, such as St. Patrick's Institution, there are people under the age of 18 years who would have recourse to an additional outside body while those over 18 would not, causing a difference for the same group within the unit. The penal system is undergoing a process of modernisation. The procedures and systems in place to protect prisoners are under review with one possible outcome being the establishment of an ombudsman for prisoners who would deal with the complaints of such young people, which would be a welcome development. Because the other elements are available for all those in such institutions the general consensus in the Department is that there is recourse to the remedy of complaint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I look forward to the appointment of an ombudsman for prisoners and accept the positive elements of what the Minister of State said in regard to what is in place for dealing with the complaints of prisoners. In this instance she is dealing with the Ombudsman for Children Bill. The future of the young people concerned depends on whether they will be able to be rehabilitated into society afterwards. Any child in prison &ndash; I call them children in the sense of being under age &ndash; is invariably very vulnerable. The ombudsman who will be appointed by the President will need to be someone who will have <Col N="711" /> tremendous rapport with children. It will be a positive step for children in prison to have the facility to deal directly with such a person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps an ombudsman for prisoners would be adequate in dealing with the children concerned, but it would not be the same as what I am asking for in this instance. It behoves us to put pressure on the Minister of State in the face of a negative response from the Department on the issue. This element of the proposed legislation should be struck down and the Minister of State should <Col N="712" /> accept the amendment or come forward in the Dáil with her own. This issue will not go away when the Bill passes through the Dáil. We are all supportive of the Bill passing before the Government falls and conscious that if these amendments are not taken now, there may not be sufficient time in the other House. This is the most important amendment on the list today and I urge the Minister of State to accept it.</P>

      <P>In page 16, line 19, after &ldquo;State)&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;unless the Ombudsman for Children determines that to investigate or to continue to investigate an action would be in the best interest of the child.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We discussed this in great detail on Committee Stage. I reiterate that I hope the office of Ombudsman for Children will be an independent one. I feel that this Bill gives Ministers unlimited authority to stop investigations. If the best interests of the child are to be the most important aspect of the Bill, the ombudsman must be independent of the Government and report directly to the Oireachtas. Section 11 gives many Ministers an effective veto over actions taken by public bodies. The Ombudsman for Children should have the power to ensure that any investigations undertaken be allowed to continue when this represents the best interests of the child.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>We have considered this matter and the office of the Ombudsman was quite certain that this legislation offered a safeguard to it as well as to the Minister in terms of his accountability to the Dáil. I understand that any future legislation dealing with the Ombudsman will retain this exact provision. In the prelude of the Ombudsman Act, 1980 (No. 26), the report of the All-Party Informal Committee on Administrative Justice considered this very issue. The committee stated that certain decisions by Ministers where they were required or allowed to make value judgments should be excluded from the Ombudsman's remit. Nothing unforeseen has arisen since then.</P>
      <P>This part of the Bill is intended to afford protection to the Minister and to the Ombudsman for Children and I have to admit that it had to be explained to me. The Ombudsman's office was of the opinion that it offered good protection for both sides and feels that it is vital that the provision remain without any additional amendment. Obviously, there is full disclosure, openness and accountability in relation to it. I remind the House that it only refers to decisions for which the Minister is accountable to the Dáil and not to the other issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I still think the Minister is saying that the Minister of any Department would be best equipped to have the final word on any issue, regardless of the problem. I am saying that <Col N="714" /> the ombudsman should be allowed to act on an issue where there is a need to protect a child, regardless of which Department he or she is dealing with. We are back again to the whole point of protection. Surely the Ombudsman for Children would be in the best position to ascertain whether or not a child needs further intervention. This Bill gives a Minister quite a lot of power. I am not saying that this is interfering with their responsibilities as such, but I do feel that this legislation elevates Ministers to the point where they are deemed to know everything about everything. The Ombudsman for Children, specifically appointed to the task of looking after the interests of children, would be better placed to make decisions. He would be best placed to decide on whether further investigation of any case is required because he would know the exact details of the issue at hand. I do not think this would constitute an intrusion on the Minister's powers. If Ministers could solve every problem they were faced with, there would be no need for an ombudsman. That is the whole point of having them &ndash; they can go beyond the remit of a Minister and take up issues on which they are extremely knowledgeable.</P>

      <P>I am certainly not trying to imply that a Minister should know everything about everything. Equally, I am anxious not to place the burden on the ombudsman to do everything about everything. Having taken advice on the provision, which has never been used, I am satisfied it is a safeguard for both sides in relation to accountability and the operation of their work. It would not benefit from the qualification proposed by Senator Jackman. It is best to leave it as it is, particularly as it will be covered in other legislation as well.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The battle against tobacco is one of the most important public health challenges facing us in the new millennium and is one of the main priorities of the Minister for Health and Children. The Government at its meeting on 27 February 2001 approved the drafting of the Public Health (Tobacco) Bill, 2001, and agreed to give the Bill priority in the Government's legislative programme. The text of the Bill was approved for publication by Government on 31 July 2001 and published on 1 August 2001. This Bill is the most comprehensive anti-tobacco legislation ever published in this country and confirms the Government's commitment to the battle against the tobacco epidemic.</P>
      <P>This Bill will bring together a number of legal instruments and will replace two existing Acts, the Tobacco Products (Control of Advertising, Sponsorship and Sales Promotion) Act, 1978, and the Tobacco (Health Promotion and Protection) Act, 1988, and incorporate certain provisions of the Government's policy, Towards a Tobacco Free Society. Strong legislative measures are an important public health instrument in countering the tobacco threat.</P>
      <P>Public attitudes to tobacco use and, in particular, cigarette smoking remain the leading cause of preventable illness in the country. A survey I commissioned by the Office of Tobacco Control on attitudes to smoking and smoking prohibitions has shown there is considerable support among the public for measures to control tobacco consumption, to make smoking less attractive to young people and to help current smokers stop smoking. This support is broadly based, coming from non-smokers and smokers alike. The public mostly welcome restrictions on tobacco retailing and promotion of tobacco products.</P>
      <P>Most smokers recognise the dangers of smoking, the increasing social unacceptability of smoking and wish to break their smoking addiction. The survey shows that the public generally and smokers specifically are looking to Government to take further action on smoking on all fronts.</P>
      <P>We also need to provide greater protection for people against inhalation of toxic environmental tobacco smoke. Studies in the USA have shown that restricting smoking in public settings increases the likelihood that smokers in these settings smoke less or quit smoking entirely. The introduction of smoke free areas supports those who wish to quit and protects non-smokers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the early years of the last century when tobacco use, largely through smoking cigarettes, was <Col N="717" /> becoming widespread the product was seen as benign and recreational. Today, tobacco smoking represents the most extensively documented cause of disease ever investigated in the history of biomedical research. In the early 1950s major scientific studies first began to associate ill health and disease with the use of tobacco products. In 1964 the US surgeon general released a report, Smoking and Health, which concluded that cigarette smoking is causally related to lung cancer in men and to a lesser extent in women.</P>
    <P>The dangers of smoking and its detrimental effect on human health have been clearly established in numerous scientific studies carried out by reputable medical and scientific bodies, including the World Health Organisation, particularly over the last 30 years. Evidence has accumulated year on year of the enormous worldwide threat to human health from consumption of tobacco products. Studies carried out internationally in recent years have also confirmed that there is a significant risk to the health of the non-smoker from inhaling environmental tobacco smoke referred to as passive smoking.</P>
    <P>The adverse impact of tobacco consumption on public health is enormous. Smoking related illnesses account for about 7,000 deaths each year in Ireland and 500,000 deaths each year in the European Union. Tobacco can kill in many ways, including lung cancer and other forms of cancer, heart disease, strokes, emphysema, chronic bronchitis and other respiratory diseases. Smoking tobacco products is one of the most unhealthy things a human can do.</P>
    <P>Life expectancy is lower in Ireland than the EU average and the diseases which contribute primarily to this are heart disease and cancer. Tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of these diseases. Smoking is a major causative factor in about 90% of the 2,000 deaths from lung cancer each year and increases the risk of other cancers such as of the mouth and throat. Smoking is also a primary cause of cardiovascular disease, the greatest single cause of mortality in Ireland. Tobacco is a significant burden to individuals, families and society through death, illness and medical costs. Reduction in tobacco use will increase life expectancy in Ireland and result in happier, healthier and better quality lives for many Irish people.</P>
    <P>About 30% of the adult population are severely addicted to nicotine in tobacco products and the vast majority of smokers become addicted in their childhood and teenage years. Smokers who begin smoking in adolescence and continue to smoke regularly have a 50% chance of dying from a tobacco related illness. The death rate among smokers in middle age is three times that of non-smokers. These are appalling statistics.</P>
    <P>The increasing levels of smoking among children and access by under age persons to cigarettes are a cause for concern. Children are easier to addict to tobacco products than adults and damage to children's health can be genetic and lifelong. Advertising of tobacco products and sponsorship of events by tobacco companies play <Col N="718" /> a significant role in inducing young persons to smoke and continue smoking. Children smoke the most heavily advertised brands of cigarettes.</P>
    <P>The smoking of tobacco products also poses a real and significant threat to the health of the non-smoker. Almost 70% of the adult population are non-smokers, yet many are unwillingly exposed on a daily basis to toxic environmental tobacco smoke. Environmental tobacco smoke is causally associated with acute and chronic diseases in non-smokers. Being able to breathe clean air, free from harmful irritating tobacco smoke, is a serious issue for everyone.</P>
    <P>Many public areas and facilities and some workplaces are subject to prohibitions and restrictions on smoking and there is a growing demand for increased protection from tobacco smoke. Optimal protection for non-smokers and smokers is best provided by smoke free areas. The Minister will use enabling powers under section 46 of the Bill to extend environmental controls on smoking to a range of public areas and facilities not already covered by existing legislation and regulation, including the workplace and pubs. An amendment was made to the Bill on Report Stage to include specific reference to licensed premises and the workplace.</P>
    <P>Children are particularly at risk from passive smoking. As children grow, exposure to environmental tobacco smoke significantly reduces their lung capacity and exercise tolerance. Involuntary exposure of children to tobacco smoke has been identified as a cause of respiratory disease, middle ear disease and asthma attacks, and is a significant factor in sudden infant death syndrome, SIDS. Children are powerless to control their exposure to tobacco smoke, yet, because of their age, are most adversely affected by exposure to this toxic combination. We must ensure the children and young people of today, whether through being induced to smoke tobacco products or exposure to and inhalation of environmental tobacco smoke, do not become future victims of the tobacco industry.</P>
    <P>The global tobacco industry, through its own extensive scientific research, knew for many decades of the dangerous and addictive nature of the product it manufactures, promotes and sells, yet it denied for decades that nicotine is addictive, that smoking and second-hand smoke cause disease and that tobacco advertising recruits children and keeps adults smoking. The tobacco industry used a wall of words to protect itself at the expense of public health. The public was not informed by the industry of the real facts about the dangers to health from tobacco consumption. It is only in recent years that public health authorities have come to fully understand the dreadful nature of nicotine addiction and the powerful marketing skills of the tobacco industry to induce people, particularly young persons, to smoke. Once young people become hooked the industry works hard to maintain that addiction.</P>
    <P>Much information has come to light in the last decade about the unscrupulous behaviour of tob<Col N="719" /> acco companies with regard to targeting young people with their products. Documentation disclosed from within the tobacco industry during litigation proceedings in the United States shows an industry doing everything it can to encourage smoking and establish and maintain tobacco brand loyalties, particularly with young smokers. The industry continued to market its products worldwide without regard to their harmful effect on human health. This same industry, while claiming publicly to want to work constructively with Governments in introducing tighter regulation of tobacco, has consistently striven to frustrate and undermine all such efforts. It seeks to thwart, not only national efforts to effectively address the tobacco problem, but also those pursued at regional and global level.</P>
    <P>The cynical attitude of the tobacco industry to human life was revealed in an economic report on healthcare costs and smoking commissioned by Philip Morris in the Czech Republic and published in June 2001. The report concluded that as smokers die prematurely, this is beneficial by saving the state substantial amounts of money that would otherwise have been spent on healthcare and pensions. This spurious economic argument shows a complete disregard for basic human values. It is reprehensible that premature death, human suffering and ill health caused by smoking tobacco products should be discounted against long-term economic gains.</P>
    <P>The Irish tobacco industry, with thousands of its Irish customers dying each year from consumption of its products, is reliant on recruiting new consumers to remain a viable industry. Young people are sensitive to perceived signals that smoking is the norm. These signals include visible public smoking, the availability of cigarettes to minors and widespread promotion and advertising of tobacco products. Logically, the industry needs access to young people to gain new smokers. We must deny it that access. The aims of the industry are contrary to public health policy.</P>
    <P>Tobacco advertising and sponsorship are a powerful means of increasing tobacco consumption and attracting young smokers. Ireland was one of the first countries to introduce restrictions on tobacco advertising and sponsorship by the tobacco industry. Both the World Health Organisation and the World Bank recommend that countries prohibit all forms of tobacco advertising and sponsorship. A number of very positive steps have already been taken in this area.</P>
    <P>Tobacco companies were spending up to £10 million annually in Ireland on advertising and sponsorship. The tobacco industry consistently used sponsorship of events to promote a harmful and socially destructive product. In July 2000, this expenditure was terminated by the Minister despite fierce opposition by the industry and we make absolutely no apologies for this. Banning advertising leads to a reduction in tobacco consumption and prevents new smokers from start<Col N="720" /> ing. Bans on advertising have an impact on youth attitudes to smoking and directly further the Government's commitment to prevent young persons from taking up smoking.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the Minister approved the replacement of tobacco sponsorship of the Irish Masters snooker tournament with health sponsorship. This assured the continuance of this popular international event and replaced tobacco promotion with a healthy anti-smoking message. International research has shown that anti-smoking sponsorship of sports events is effective in sending a particular message to the public. The Minister will continue to ensure a clear, sustained, positive health message is sent to the population, particularly our young people.</P>
    <P>The Minister has already taken a number of anti-tobacco initiatives in the area of health promotion using broad based public awareness campaigns with a special focus on young people. The following are some specific examples. The Break the Habit for Good campaign was launched in association with the Irish Cancer Society and the health boards. This campaign emphasises the positive effects which quitting smoking can have on the individual. The campaign, which involves national and local initiatives, offers support for those wishing to give up smoking. An advice kit was developed as a support for those who wanted to quit.</P>
    <P>NICO was developed last year to target the growing number of young teenage girls who are smoking or starting to smoke. This anti-smoking campaign emphasises the negative effects smoking can have on physical appearance, that is, stained teeth and wrinkled skin. The storyline is there is nothing sexy about smoking. The media used are television, radio, outdoor and newspaper advertising. Television is a proven useful resource in accessing young people. Strategically located outdoor sites such as those adjacent to schools and colleges complement television and radio advertisements.</P>
    <P>The best prospect for reducing the number of people, especially young people, smoking or preventing them from starting is a targeted approach. In this regard, initiatives such as the social, personal and health education programme are particularly important. Since September 2000 a SPHE programme has been offered at junior cycle level to post-primary schools nationwide through a partnership between my Department, regional health boards and the Department of Education and Science. The Minister is committed to ensuring this process is a success.</P>
    <P>The out-of-school setting for delivering health messages to young people is important. The Department of Health and Children has also teamed with the Department of Education and Science and the National Youth Council of Ireland to provide a wide range of health promotion training for the youth sector, which will ensure the message is received by young people and that the message is the same as that mirrored elsewhere.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="721" />Most smokers wish to break their addiction to nicotine based tobacco products. Additional help has also been made available to smokers to help them quit. Since 1 April 2001 the full range of nicotine replacement therapies, including patches, gum, sprays and tablets, is available free of charge to medical card holders on prescription by their general practitioner.</P>
    <P>The tobacco epidemic can only be beaten with the commitment of society as a whole. Concerted and sustained effort is necessary to make progress. The Bill provides for strong legislative measures to tackle the tobacco epidemic on a number of fronts.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive ban on tobacco advertising, including in-store advertising and displays, and all forms of sponsorship by the tobacco industry is provided for. Tobacco advertising is intended to increase consumption as well as brand share and has a powerful effect on young people. Advertising and related activities are major influences on children taking up smoking. The industry has known of this for many years and exploited rather than compensated for this childhood vulnerability.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, the Bill proposes further restrictions on tobacco advertising, many of which are already in place under a statutory instrument with effect from 14 July 2000. However, the existing controls do not prohibit in-store or retail advertising, which will be prohibited under the Bill. This rebalancing of the rights of the public and the tobacco industry is necessary because the <i>status quo</i> ensures children will continue to take up smoking in increasing numbers and become addicted before reaching adulthood. The evidence is that the total prohibition of advertising is very effective, but that partial prohibitions do not give a <i>pro rata</i> return. The Bill will prohibit practices which we have witnessed since July 2000 whereby advertising of tobacco products was done in a manner to try to get around these statutory instruments rather than complying with them.</P>
    <P>Registration of tobacco retailers and tougher penalties for those convicted of under age sales is provided for in the Bill. The approach to enforcement has been piecemeal. Compliance with existing laws, especially in respect of sales to minors, has been poor. Surveys have shown that many under age young people can purchase tobacco products over the counter from retailers without being asked for evidence of age. The evidence from other campaigns, for example, the drink driving campaign, is that strong enforcement combined with positive public messages is necessary to effect real change in public behaviour.</P>
    <P>The Bill will provide for comprehensive powers of enforcement and introduce a range of penalties commensurate with the offences. The age limit for the sale of tobacco products to young persons was raised from 16 years to 18 years last year and the maximum fine for persons convicted of selling tobacco products to under age persons has been raised substantially on foot of the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2001. These measures are incorporated into the Bill and will <Col N="722" /> act as a further deterrent to retailers. The Bill also provides for the use of age cards, as defined under the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988, by purchasers of tobacco products to better enable retailers to establish the bona fides of purchasers.</P>
    <P>The Department has already begun the process of increasing the number of health board environmental health officers who will enforce the tougher tobacco controls. An additional &euro;1 million has been made available to health boards for this purpose. The Bill requires retail outlets that sell tobacco products to be registered. Such registration is recommended in the Government's policy document, Towards a Tobacco Free Society, and justified on public health grounds as it will facilitate inspection and compliance, as provided for in the proposed Bill.</P>
    <P>There is provision for a ban on retail sales of packs of cigarettes of less than 20. Price is the single most effective means of protecting children against experimenting with cigarettes and becoming addicted. Increasing the minimum pack size that may be sold raises the price barrier for children. It is proposed to ban the sale of packets of cigarettes containing less than 20.</P>
    <P>There will be tighter controls on the sale of tobacco products from vending machines, many of which are located in areas of licensed premises, often out of sight of staff, where there is no form of supervision, giving unrestricted access to cigarettes to under age persons. The Bill provides for much tighter control on all aspects of tobacco retailing, including vending machines. They will have to be located beside, on or behind the bar counter under the direct supervision of staff. Regulations will provide that the machine, which will have a locking device, will be activated for sale by a unique coin or token available only from staff on the premises. The need for much tighter controls on these machines has been made clear to the cigarette machine operators.</P>
    <P>Provision is made for a ban on the sale of confectioneries, normally intended for children, which resemble a tobacco product. The sale of this type of confectionery is a particularly odious practice and helps builds an unhealthy relationship and familiarity between children and tobacco products. Children who use candy cigarettes are more likely to become smokers. This type of candy will be prohibited, as well as similar types of confectionery products.</P>
    <P>Public disclosure of all aspects of tobacco, including toxicity and addiction, is provided for in the Bill. The Bill provides the proposed Tobacco Control Agency with powers to obtain information from manufacturers relating to the composition or properties of tobacco products and to test tobacco products. The agency may, subject to certain requirements, publish this information. Tobacco contains many chemicals which are cancer causing and gases such as carbon monoxide which cause heart disease. As and from now, there will be public disclosure on all aspects of tobacco.</P>
    <P>Improved protection against passive smoking is provided for in the Bill. Tobacco smoke is the <Col N="723" /> biggest single source of indoor air pollution. As I stated, it is a real and substantial health hazard to infants, children and persons with heart or lung disease. Tobacco smoke contains as many as 4,000 chemicals, many of which are harmful to health and at least 60 of which cause cancer in humans.</P>
    <P>It is well known that there is a risk to health from exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. We know this from the WHO air quality guidelines for Europe. Over the past two decades we have acquired sufficient international scientific evidence to show that this is the case. As I stated, the Minister will use his enabling powers to extend environmental controls on smoking to a range of public areas and facilities.</P>
    <P>The Bill allows for the establishment of the Office of Tobacco Control which will monitor, co-ordinate and, in certain circumstances, enforce and report on the new tobacco policy initiative. The office will drive the implementation of many of the Bill's provisions and also co-operate with all relevant agencies in working towards a tobacco free society. The office has already been established on an administrative basis and is located on a temporary basis in Clane, County Kildare. Its work will be complemented by the Tobacco Free Council, to be serviced by the office, which will have a much broader representation than the board of the office and representatives will be drawn from a wide range of necessary disciplines.</P>
    <P>Public health authorities in many countries have grappled with the problem of how to prevent people from taking up smoking and how to get smokers to break their addiction once established. There is no single solution to dealing with the tobacco epidemic. In the early 1970s the incidence of smoking here was about 43%. Successive Administrations, by a combination of measures, including legislation, regulation and health promotion, were able to reduce this to today's level of just over 30%. Our success in improving the health status of the nation is linked to reducing further the level of tobacco usage and, in particular, preventing young persons from starting to smoke. If the incidence of tobacco use by young persons can be reduced, we can make considerable progress towards a tobacco free society.</P>
    <P>Legislation alone, no matter how comprehensive, cannot create and sustain the environment necessary to prevent people from starting to smoke and assist those who have already started to stop. Our anti-tobacco strategy will be multifaceted, containing strong legislative controls, effective enforcement powers and resources. However, it will also have a well-resourced health promotion dimension, a fiscal element and the supports required by smokers to kick the habit. The implementation of this comprehensive strategy will, in time, effect the necessary attitudinal changes in society to tobacco consumption and, then, the necessary behavioural changes. We owe it to ourselves, the younger and future generations to <Col N="724" /> ensure the war against tobacco is won. It gives me great pleasure to commend the Public Health (Tobacco) Bill, 2001, to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann condemns the present Fianna Fáil/Progressive Democrats coalition Government for its failure to address the needs of the Irish education system and for leaving a fine educational system in crisis after 5 years of neglect and mismanagement;</P>
      <P>&ndash;&nbsp;further condemns the Government for undermining the professional status of teachers;</P>
      <P>&ndash;&nbsp;further condemns the Government for its failure to fund capital building and refurbishment projects, and its failure to maintain health and safety standards in schools and educational institutions;</P>
      <P>&ndash;&nbsp;further condemns the Government for its failure to resource schools, staff and students in disadvantaged areas; and</P>
      <P>&ndash;&nbsp;finally, condemns the Department of Education and Science for its failure to work with local communities to improve the learning and living environment of children and young people.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I commend the work he has done in relation to adult education. However, I do not commend the work of the Minister for Education and Science. He has mismanaged and neglected critical areas of the education system and I have sought to encapsulate these areas of mismanagement in the motion I tabled.</P>
      <P>The education system is in considerable crisis. Every day we read adverse comment and criticism in the newspapers. Demoralisation is a key characteristic of the system at present and this is a dangerous development. In 1991 an OECD report on Irish education described the teacher's role as &ldquo;instructional, custodial, inspirational and disciplinary&rdquo;. That is a tough list of functions which teachers are obliged to fulfil. The report states:</P>
      <P>Teachers also have a role in dealing with the physical, moral and spiritual development of their pupils as well as playing an active role in their emotional and mental health and their general social welfare. And, of course, society, parents and pupils expect teachers to be involved in extra-curricular work of one kind or another. All in all, society expects very complex interactions from teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report showed that the Irish education system performed a wide variety of functions which were strictly educational, disciplinary, instructional and moral. It dealt with the mental, <Col N="725" /> emotional and physical welfare of the whole person. This was society's expectation of the system and teachers delivered on that expectation.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that recent developments show no acknowledgement of that complex role. One would have expected the Minister to provide tea and sympathy for teachers and due recognition for the multitude of tasks they perform in our fine educational system, which is being trumpeted by the Government throughout the world as one of the reasons for the success of the Celtic tiger. Instead, the Minister has chosen to have a stand-off, as though he were at the OK Corral, and has not engaged with the teaching profession.</P>
    <P>Education depends on engagement and on commitment by teachers. One would expect the Minister to aid and support this engagement in every way possible, but he has not done so. He has done the opposite. He has constantly been at odds with the teachers and has seen benchmarking as a stick with which to beat them. The ultimate insult to teachers was the suggestion that benchmarking is a pay-as-you-teach system which, like an ATM, will pay teachers on the basis of performance. The Minister appears to have gone along with that idea. However, benchmarking has delivered nothing to teachers and it will not deliver anything until after June, when the benchmarking process will take place.</P>
    <P>The Minister has gone further. He mishandled the situation very badly when he used confidential information to reduce teachers' salaries and was found to have been in breach of data protection legislation. In doing that he soured relations with the teachers just before they were about to have their case heard by the Labour Relations Commission. As a result, the LRC hearing was totally non-productive. The Minister has now compounded the matter by providing greater remuneration to unqualified people who are supervising in schools than he is prepared to provide for part-time teachers who have professional qualifications. Surely this is another anomaly.</P>
    <P>The Minister must know that the whole school community needs to be harmonised and that teachers are the people to do this. Teachers have traditionally fulfilled this role and the 1991 OECD report confirmed that this was happening in Irish schools. The Minister should act on the McGuinness report, which indicated an immediate need for 1,200 new teachers, and aim for the 15:1 pupil-teacher ratio which was operational until the early 1970s. If the Minister had acted on the recommendations of the McGuinness report, he would have softened the barriers he has created.</P>
    <P>The Minister has received 850 applications for funding for major capital projects, all costing more than &euro;250,000. The Minister has &euro;1 billion worth of work on his desk. Some time ago he promised to publish the list of applications in the order of their priority but he has failed to do so, despite many calls for him to do it. Schools do not know when they might expect to hear whether their applications are successful. It now <Col N="726" /> appears that the Minister will use this money as a slush fund and will announce major projects here and there prior to the general election. This is not good enough. Schools, parents and pupils need to know when a building or refurbishment project will proceed, but applications appear to have fallen into a black hole in the Department of Education and Science. Nobody knows except the Minister. He is doing it so there will be a huge rash of announcements, to suit him, between now and the general election.</P>
    <P>Mention should be made of schools in disadvantaged areas. I can give the House one example from my constituency, which is also the Taoiseach's constituency &ndash; St. Joseph's primary school in East Wall. It just failed to be included in the Breaking the Cycle programme in the year it was announced by Niamh Bhreathnach. It was also not included in the programme, Giving Children a Fair Break, under the then Minister, Deputy Martin. As a result, the school is turning away pupils it had promised to take at Christmas because the classes are too large. The pupil-teacher ratio is out of kilter with local schools in the area and, naturally, parents are voting with their feet and going elsewhere. A community, therefore, is being damaged by the failure to provide an adequate educational resource in a disadvantaged area. That is no way to deal with education in this context.</P>
    <P>My final point relates to local communities. The Department of Education and Science has failed to grasp that it needs to engage with local communities when they are attempting to improve the learning and living environment of pupils in disadvantaged areas. The Department has not sent any representatives to drugs task forces, partnerships or other such local bodies which have been established to promote local communities. This is a serious failure to delegate people with responsibility to deal with these areas.</P>
    <P>We find ourselves in a sorry state after five years of unprecedented wealth and prosperity. The teaching profession is demoralised, schools building projects are not being dealt with in a coherent fashion other than at the whim of the Minister, pupils, parents and staff in disadvantaged areas are dissatisfied with the service being provided by the Department and there is a complete lack of engagement with local communities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion. I want to draw a picture of what this country could have had. It could have had a situation where primary school parents' committees did not have to spend frenetic amounts of time raising money to provide what people would regard as the essentials for education, where every school had clean, functional toilets of a number appropriate to health and safety and where school buildings were provided that were not health and fire risks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We could have had a situation where teachers and support services were available in the necessary numbers and not as token gestures for a good political headline or in pilot schemes. We <Col N="727" /> could have had teachers who felt valued as they do in other countries and simple things, such as a decision five years ago that a programme would begin to eliminate primary school buildings that were an insult to the teachers who worked in them, the children being educated in them and the parents who sent their children to them. The problem, however, is that the way to do that is to be honest. It means identifying the schools, declaring that they are below standard and promising to provide the money to deal with them. It means saying that every school has a right to be of a certain standard.</P>
    <P>The problem with rights is that it ends the supplication. People who have rights do not believe they have to genuflect before the local Fianna Fáil Deputy or Minister and beg them to provide a school. The problem with rights is that parents do not feel they must defer to the local Fianna Fáil henchman and ask him to talk to the Minister about their school. There is no longer this god on high, who is the Fianna Fáil Minister and who dispenses munificence provided one behaves oneself or one asks in an appropriately supplicatory fashion. That is the fundamental problem. The second problem is the conservative ideology of this Government, but I will come to that later.</P>
    <P>The first problem is the fact that we cannot secure the basic principle of a right to a basic standard. It is not difficult. The Higher Education Authority, for example, has a standard which must be met in buildings. If a new building is due to be built, that standard must be met. The Government could have been doing that for primary education over the last five years. It had the money but it decided not to do it. Now it has decided to hold off on all such work until the election is closer. We are back again to the supplication and to giving the impression that the funding will come from the Minister's back pocket. Why is that? It is because the ethos which dominates the Department of Education and Science, through this Government, does not believe in rights. It believes in supplication. That suits it better because it gives the impression of munificence on a grand scale whereas it should be giving people their rights.</P>
    <P>That is a political and, perhaps, sociological point. However, its fundamental effect is to chip away at the single thing which, more than anything else, has been a contributor to our prosperity. In hard times in the 1980s, particularly the period between 1983 and 1987, a Government that was under enormous financial pressure decided that education was worthwhile. Education was thus protected from the dreadfully hard times of the 1980s. That happened at enormous cost and was barely achieved. The Government continued providing, for example, the possibility of third level education for a significant proportion of our population. Extremely dedicated teachers, essentially operating on shoestring budgets and with virtually no equipment, kept a good education system alive in hard times.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="728" />We then experienced the beginning of a turn around. A responsible Government from 1992 to 1997 had to ensure that the public finances were in good shape, so only limited work could be done. Then there were five glorious years when the Exchequer had more funds than it could spend. However, there was a Government, and a Minister for Finance in particular, who did not believe that public expenditure was a good thing. They looked for every possible way of avoiding having money available to do the type of things we are discussing now.</P>
    <P>We do not dispute that many things were done. It would have been impossible, given the unthinkable prosperity of the last five years and the unimaginable surpluses, that many things would not have been done. Given the political clout of the trade union movement and teachers' unions, it would have been impossible not to do things. However, the standard by which this Government should be judged on this issue is not some type of <i>tabula rasa</i> in which nothing could have been done but against the possibilities of what could have been done. The possibility was that we could have had a European standard of education in our schools and colleges by now. However, it would have required decisions which this Government refused to make about building, equipment, teacher numbers, support staff and so forth. In each case, it ducked and would not give rights.</P>
    <P>I will outline the extraordinary things this Government did. It is extraordinary that the Minister for Education and Science broke the law on data protection. It was waved away as if it did not matter. There is hardly anything worse in society than Government Ministers ignoring the law. It was obvious to everybody but the Minister for Education and Science that abusing secret, private data to deduct salaries from teachers was a gross breach of the law. I knew it and everybody I know knew it, but the Minister apparently did not.</P>
    <P>One of the many aspects of the Government's performance that has fascinated me is the five building projects awaiting approval in the institution where I work, Cork Institute of Technology. One project was approved by the former Minister for Education, Niamh Bhreathnach, in 1997 while four were approved by the Minister, Deputy Martin, in the first year and a half of the Government. Not one has gone to tender yet. What Department allows a large institute of technology to expand its student numbers on the presumption that new buildings will be constructed and then sits on its hands for five years and does nothing? Do not give me the details about what was done, which was the best that could be extracted out of a Government that was hostile to the principle of public expenditure. A Government that could see that public expenditure is central to a good education system is needed. This Government believes in privatising everything and would prefer to privatise the education system, but instead it gave the system a reluctant <Col N="729" /> nod in terms of limited funds and left us with problems that will take at least another Government to rectify.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the debate as it gives me an opportunity to put on record the major achievements the Government has brought about since its term of office commenced.</P>
      <P>Education has been a key foundation in the unparalleled economic and social progress we have witnessed in recent years. It has contributed greatly to meeting the skills needs of a dynamic new economy, to providing high quality sustainable employment for our young people and, crucially, to placing Ireland at the forefront of the global information society. In the area of social policy, our educational policies play a key role in combating disadvantage, reducing inequities and enhancing the quality of life for all our citizens. There is no doubt we have reaped enormous dividends from the substantial investment which successive Administrations have prudently made in education over the years.</P>
      <P>We remember the hard times of the 1980s when we were faced with high unemployment, emigration of many of our talented young people, cutbacks in public services and rising national debt. While no one could have foreseen the extraordinary transformation that was to take place in social and economic life, we did at least have the foresight then to maintain education high on the priority list in so far as public policy and resource allocation were concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="730" />The Government has continued the tradition of placing education and training at the top of the agenda as a policy priority. Since coming into office in 1997, State funding for education has increased by more than 70%, with a total allocation for 2001 alone of &euro;4.7 billion. There will be a further 14% increase in funding for education in 2002, with a total budget of &euro;5.4 billion approved by the Government for this year.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn to the question of school funding and resources. Contrary to what the Opposition appears to believe, the Government has introduced major improvements in the funding and resourcing of schools since coming to office. At primary level, we have progressively increased capitation grants by some 80% in the period since 1997 to &euro;102 per pupil for the school year 2001-02. This means that a school with 500 pupils will receive &euro;50,790 in capitation grants in the current year compared to &euro;28,570 in 1997-98. Following the transfer of community employment moneys from FÁS, grant assistance for secretarial and caretaker services at primary level is being doubled during the current school year from &euro;51 to &euro;102 per pupil. As a result, the minimum grant to be paid to schools with 500 pupils or more will increase from &euro;25,395 to &euro;50,790 per annum.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Government has introduced a grant scheme for minor works. Approximately 1,000 grant approvals costing in the region of &euro;33 million were given to primary schools in 2001 in respect of minor projects and purchases of furniture. An annual capital grant of &euro;3,809 per school plus &euro;12.70 per pupil is also paid to all primary schools at a total cost in excess of &euro;17.7 million. The expenditure of this money is totally at the discretion of the school management authorities. At post-primary level, there has been an increase in the <i>per capita</i> grant from &euro;225 in the school year 1997-98 to &euro;257 for the school year 2001-02. Thus, a school with 500 pupils will receive &euro;128,244 in the current year, an increase of almost &euro;16,000 on 1997-98.</P>
    <P>In addition, under the support services fund, second level schools will also receive an increase in their support grant from &euro;25 per pupil to &euro;99 per pupil over this school year and the next. There will also be a corresponding increase in the annual minimum grant for smaller schools from &euro;5,079 to &euro;19,808. This funding will provide further support to the school development planning process. While provision for secretarial and caretaker services is a particular focus of this fund, schools will have discretion in line with that available in regard to <i>per capita</i> grants as to how this additional funding is best utilised in the interest of their pupils.</P>
    <P>As a country, we have always placed a high value on the quality of teaching in our schools and there is no doubting the great commitment, dedication and professionalism of our teachers. The Government has taken decisive action to reduce class sizes and ensure a supply of qualified teachers. Since we took office, we have dramatically improved the number of teachers at <Col N="731" /> both primary and post-primary levels. To date we have appointed more than 3,000 extra teachers and this will shortly increase to more than 4,000. At primary level, an extra 1,855 teachers have been provided and this will be increased by a further 550 with the full implementation of the PPF. At post-primary level, an extra 1,225 teachers have been provided and this number will be increased by a further 400 under the PPF.</P>
    <P>We have also substantially increased the number of teacher training places to facilitate the supply of qualified teachers going forward. We have made a special effort to provide additional teaching resources to schools with a significant proportion of children from disadvantaged backgrounds. For example, under a major new initiative introduced at primary level, Giving Children an Even Break, we will allocate more than 200 new teaching posts to enable them to provide extra support for children who are at risk of educational disadvantage and early school leaving.</P>
    <P>The creation of additional teaching posts, together with a decline in enrolments, has resulted in a significant reduction in the overall pupil-teacher ratio in our schools in recent years and this will continue to fall over the coming years. At primary level, the average pupil-teacher ratio is less than 20:1. At post-primary level, the average pupil-teacher ratio, taking account of part-time posts, now stands at about 15:1. We are also providing additional career guidance posts to post-primary schools, with particular focus on addressing the needs of at risk pupils and potential early school leavers. Some schools are experiencing difficulties in obtaining fully qualified teachers to fill vacancies for substitute and temporary posts and my Department is taking every measure to deal with any shortages that arise. The action we have taken on teacher supply is making a real difference. There is more to be done and we will not be found wanting in this regard.</P>
    <P>Teachers have a crucial professional role in educating our children and the Government acknowledges the immense contribution teachers, at all levels, have made, and continue to make, to the education system in Ireland. We have negotiated with teachers in accordance with the procedure that we have agreed with the teacher unions and we fully support the view that teachers have contributed hugely to education. We have used the arbitration process of the conciliation and arbitration scheme and also gone to the Labour Court in an attempt to resolve the ASTI dispute. It is of utmost importance that we look towards building for the future. The PPF has already delivered a cumulative increase of 16.9% to all teachers with another 4% to follow and a 1% lump sum payable from 1 April. The benchmarking process, in which the INTO and the TUI are participating, is well advanced.</P>
    <P>On the issue of supervision and substitution, we consider that teachers are the best people to <Col N="732" /> carry out that work. We have made a fair and generous offer of &euro;34 per hour, on top of normal pay, for these duties. This compares favourably to the highest overtime rates payable in the public service. The offer would provide &euro;50 million extra each year on top of the PPF. It was only when teachers refused to carry out this work that we had to take other steps to ensure that schools stayed open. The Minister reiterated that the processes were there to resolve this matter on 28 February. The Government is seeking ways in which we can move forward together rather than face further disruption of our education system. I am convinced that we can build a partnership approach to solving our problems and that we can again devote our collective energies and attention to what we do best &ndash; the provision of quality education to all our young people to equip them for tomorrow's world.</P>
    <P>The teaching profession in Ireland has traditionally attracted personnel of a consistently high calibre and we all have an interest in seeing this continue in the future. In recent years, the Department has provided extensive programmes of professional development for teachers. The Government recognises the importance of enhancing the status of teaching in order to ensure that consistently high calibre personnel continue to be attracted to the profession.</P>
    <P>The Teaching Council Act, enacted last year, recognises the professional status of teaching and provides for the establishment of a professional body charged with maintaining and developing standards and promoting best practice in the teaching profession. This is an important development for education in Ireland. It means that, in the future, responsibility for the qualifications for new entrants, the accreditation of teacher training courses, the promotion of further in-career development for teachers and addressing disciplinary problems within the profession will now largely lie with the teaching profession itself, working through the Teaching Council.</P>
    <P>The Teaching Council will be central to the development of the teaching profession and will provide for the future quality assurance of the profession. Planning for the implementation of the Act is currently under way in my Department.</P>
    <P>The rapid pace of technological change and the advent of the information age have brought many new challenges to education in recent years. Now more than ever it is vital that students are provided with the opportunity to develop computer skills. Under the schools IT2000 initiative, the Government invested more than &euro;50 million in providing ICT facilities for schools with a view to ensuring that pupils in every school have the opportunity to achieve computer and Internet skills and to equip themselves for participation in the information society.</P>
    <P>As a result there are now more than 56,000 computers in first and second level schools. The pupil to computer ratios have been substantially improved. Every school now has a connection to the Internet. Over 34,000 teachers have received <Col N="733" /> training ranging from basic ICT skills through more specialised use of technology. This is testament to the progress we have made in this area.</P>
    <P>A recent study by the EU Commission shows that Ireland compares favourably to the EU average across a range of benchmarks including pupil to computer ratio, basic Internet access for schools and pupils, proportion of teachers receiving ICT training and teacher use of computers and the Internet with pupils. To build further on the foundations we have laid, the Government is making a further and unprecedented investment of &euro;108 million to enhance significantly ICTs in all first and second level schools.</P>
    <P>In relation to school building and refurbishment, a major investment programme is currently under way to upgrade primary and post-primary school buildings with some &euro;1 billion allocated under the national development plan for this purpose. As a result of past under investment over the course of decades, the reality is that some schools are in a poor state of repair and require substantial funding for upgrading to meet modern requirements.</P>
    <P>Contrary to what we have heard, it is not possible to wipe out in the lifetime of one Government the cumulative deficit of generations and also to deal with emerging needs at the same time. However, it is only in the lifetime of this Government that there has been an increase in the level of investment, which is capable of making a real difference.</P>
    <P>The facts clearly demonstrate our sustained commitment to rectifying the deficit and to providing for new building needs. The previous Government when leaving office planned to spend &euro;91.6 million on educational infrastructure. By contrast, every single year since this Government took office we have poured massive sums of money into modernising educational infrastructure.</P>
    <P>In 1998, we spent &euro;133 million, an increase of 45% relative to 1997. The following year we again increased spending, to &euro;194 million. In 2000, spending at first and second level was again increased, this time to &euro;258 million. Last year, we increased spending yet again, to &euro;318 million. In the current year, we propose spending &euro;337 million, that is almost four times more than that allocated by the Opposition on leaving Government just five years ago. In effect, from 1998 to the end of the current year, we will have spent more than &euro;1.2 billion on educational infrastructure.</P>
    <P>In addition to our programme of development we have already taken the initiative in introducing public private partnerships to supplement our unprecedented schools building programme. These groundbreaking PPP projects will provide a state of the art quality design and management framework, which will serve as a model for further greenfield projects in the education sector.</P>
    <P>The education landscape does not stand still. The building programme must change and adapt to meet emerging curricular and other needs. <Col N="734" /> Over the past five years, we have extended and dramatically improved the specifications for school buildings and ancillary accommodation to meet lower pupil to teacher ratios, the needs of children with disabilities, new and refurbished science laboratories and PE halls, new ICT equipment and the expanded choice of subjects. Ensuring schools meet the latest safety and technical standards is also essential. The removal of asbestos and the reduction of radon gas levels has also been a priority.</P>
    <P>We all know that education plays a key role in the promotion of a more inclusive society and tackling educational disadvantage has been a major priority of this Government's education policy. Under the national development plan, the Government is providing over &euro;500 million to fund a range of programmes aimed at ensuring that young people from disadvantaged backgrounds are given every opportunity to reach their full potential.</P>
    <P>Some of the existing measures include the following: early education interventions at pre-school level, such as the Early Start programme; a targeted support package for disadvantaged children in primary school, which is costing &euro;33 million over the next three years; expansion of the early school leavers and stay in school initiatives and the establishment of a new statutory authority, the National Educational Welfare Board, to promote regular school attendance and prevent early school leaving; significant extension of the home school community liaison service; improvements in support grants for third level students and provision of a third level access fund of &euro;120 million aimed at tackling under representation by students from disadvantaged backgrounds; extension of youth reach and youth work programmes; programmes to combat substance abuse; and a range of measures to improve literacy and numeracy attainment in school and out of school.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the Educational Welfare Board is an important development, which also deserves special mention. For the first time ever, we will now have a single national authority with a wide-ranging remit to monitor school attendance, to assist children at risk and those who experience difficulties in or out of school and to provide a range of supports to reduce absenteeism and early school leaving. Planning for the phased rollout of the new educational welfare service is well advanced and the new service will be operational for the next school year.</P>
    <P>Despite these advances, tackling poverty and social exclusion remains one of the major challenges facing Irish society. The Government is committed to building on what has been achieved to date in this area and has recently launched a new anti-poverty strategy. Recognising the cross-cutting nature of poverty and exclusion, the Government has set a number of important targets in the areas of education, health and housing policy. In relation to education, the objective is to ensure that all young people leave the system <Col N="735" /> with an adequate education and related qualifications to support their full participation in the economy, in employment and in society.</P>
    <P>We have also made important advances in the area of lifelong learning. It is clear that learning commences at a very early stage. In fact, research has clearly shown that high quality early education eases the transition to formal schooling and greatly improves the life chances of young people. The Government aims to secure lasting benefits for children during their early years and to place a particular focus on those children who, through disadvantage or disability, face various obstacles in deriving due benefit from education. We have recently established a new Centre for Early Childhood Education. The key aims of the centre will be to develop a quality framework covering all aspects of early education and introduce targeted supports for disadvantaged children up to six years of age and children with special needs.</P>
    <P>At the other end of the educational spectrum, the Government has made much progress in relation to adult education. The White Paper on Adult Education sets out a range of recommendations to promote and expand access to adult education in the context of providing a continuum of educational opportunities on a lifelong basis. The recommendations in the White Paper are being implemented on a phased basis with a number of initiatives already under way. These include the significant expansion of the back to education initiative; the continued development of the national adult literacy strategy; the provision of the first ever adult educational guidance service; the establishment of a National Adult Learning Council; and the establishment of a network of community education facilitators.</P>
    <P>The area of special education has attracted a great deal of attention in recent years. The Government has been accused of being hard-hearted and uncaring in its response to the educational needs of children with disabilities. However, the reverse is the truth. This Government has made more progress than any previous Administration in the development of special education services and has committed unprecedented levels of resources to the area.</P>
    <P>When this Government came into office, children with disabilities had no automatic entitlement to special education services. Such services were only provided if and when resources were available. All this changed in October 1998 when the Government decided that all children in the primary system should have an automatic entitlement to a response to their needs. The major impact of this decision is reflected in the fact that the number of resource teachers supporting children with special needs has grown from 104 to over 1,000, while the number of special needs assistants supporting special needs children has grown from less than 300 to approximately 2,500.</P>
    <P>When this Government took office, the State did not even recognise the distinct educational <Col N="736" /> needs of children with autism. Such children are now being catered for in special dedicated classes, each of which caters for a maximum of six children and has a teacher and two special needs assistants. The Minister has also announced proposals for the introduction of a nationwide pre-school service for children with autism and funding is being made available to support this development. In addition, the Government has approved a further package of measures to enhance the provision of special education. These developments are not the action of an uncaring Government. They are concrete manifestations of the Government's commitment to people with special needs.</P>
    <P>The Government is acutely aware of the need to enhance and co-ordinate educational support services at local level. We are making major advances in this area and a number of important services are being rolled out on a regionalised basis, including the National Educational Psychological Service and the Educational Welfare Service. In addition, a major restructuring programme is currently under way within the Department with a view to devolving the administration of key support services to regional level so that support services at local level are enhanced and co-ordinated through a planned network of regional offices.</P>
    <P>I am proud to be able to come into this House and stand over the record of the Government in education. During our term investment in education has increased by more than 70%. We have appointed 3,500 extra teachers and greatly improved pupil-teacher ratios. There has been a fourfold funding increase for upgrading and modernising our schools and more than &euro;500 million has been made available to provide substantial extra resources and supports for students in disadvantage. We have provided an unprecedented increase in supports and funding for children with a disability, including a tenfold increase in special needs assistants. There has been a dramatic increase in capitation and funding for primary and second level schools. We have taken real steps to enhance the status of the teaching profession and we have made major advancements in providing computers and Internet access to both primary and post-primary schools. We have also undertaken a major legislative programme to underpin and promote quality, accessible and inclusive education. We are pushing out the boundaries of lifelong learning with major new initiatives in adult and further education and early childhood education.</P>
    <P>Looking ahead, there is still much work to be done and we must continue to give priority to tackling literacy, special needs and disadvantage, to meeting the challenges of lifelong learning and to promoting quality in education at all levels. However, the achievements over the past five years provide an excellent foundation for further progress and I look forward to a new Fianna Fail/Progressive Democrats Administration carrying on this important work.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Minister of State on his wonderful ability to present figures and statistics in a positive way for the Government. However, the reality is different. I was taken by his comment that these developments &ldquo;are not the action of an uncaring Government. They are concrete manifestations of the Government's commitment to people with special needs.&rdquo;  That is untrue. The Government has been brought roaring and shouting through the courts to recognise and give special attention to people with special needs and difficulties in education. We have had repeated cases over the past five years of the Minister for Education and Science being brought to the courts and forced to give children their constitutional rights under the educational system. It is a misrepresentation of the reality over the past five years to claim this is a caring Government in terms of children with special needs.</P>
      <P>I was also impressed by the Minister of State's statement that it has been the Government's priority to ensure schools meet the latest safety and technical standards. He also said that the removal of asbestos and the reduction of radon gas levels has been a priority. The Minister recently announced funding for a major new programme to provide specialised dust extraction drums in special schools. However, the Government and the Minister did that because the parents' associations and teachers in the respective schools raised the issue and there was a public outcry. As a result, the Department was forced into taking action and providing in some cases new schools where there were high levels of asbestos and radon gas. It did not have a choice, in the interests of health and safety. The Government was not fully committed to it or concerned about it. It was forced to do it by the actions of the parents and teachers.</P>
      <P>The Government should not paint a rosy picture. The Department was forced over the past five years into various actions. It did not have the decency to take the initiative. Its hand was forced and it reacted under pressure rather than out of genuine concern.</P>
      <P>We have experienced unprecedented financial success over the past five years. We have a buoyant economy as a result of responsible actions taken by Governments and Opposition over the previous ten years. However, the manner in which the money has been expended is unfortunate. We have not had clear evidence of money being spent in a positive way in education. Senators Ryan and Costello clearly stated that money has been spent in a haphazard way. It has not been focused on the difficulties and deficits in certain areas. Priority has not been given to these areas and action has not been taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="738" />The Minister of State put a strong case this evening, but unfortunately the reality is different. While it seems that enormous amounts of money have been spent, the evidence is not clear. Various national and international reports show that our education system leaves a lot to be desired in many areas. There is a high level of both child and adult illiteracy, which EU and OECD reports have highlighted. That needs to be urgently tackled. Despite investment and attention having been given, the downward trend does not seem to have been altered. That matter must be tackled urgently.</P>
    <P>One would hope that all children leaving primary school would be competent in reading, arithmetic and writing. It is essential that every child should be able to read, write, add and subtract if they are to survive. Unfortunately, many children leave school without being able to do that. Throwing money at the problem is not necessarily the wisest way to address it. We must provide skilled people. There is a shortage of people with relevant skills. Our education policy must address that fundamental issue.</P>
    <P>The Minister claims the pupil-teacher ratio is now 1:20. That is not evident in many schools. I know teachers who have up to 35 pupils in their classroom. That is unacceptable. The Minister may have come up with that figure by dividing the overall number of pupils by the overall number of teachers. However, the teacher-pupil ratio is not working effectively in those schools where there are up to 35 pupils in classes.</P>
    <P>There are difficulties in terms of people completing second level education. Some children do not sit the junior certificate examination, while a high percentage do not sit the leaving certificate examination. That is not commendable. In addition, there is a problem with school accommodation. While I agree that much funding appears to have been provided for capital programmes, the reality for many schools is unchanged. There is congestion in many second level schools and they do not meet the required health and safety standards. There is overcrowding and a lack of free mobility in classrooms and corridors. That matter has not been seriously addressed.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education and Science recently agreed to build an extension to Tulla school in my constituency of Clare. However, it intends to put 700 children on a two-acre site which does not have any recreational facilities or space for a PE hall. I raised this matter on the Adjournment last week with the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Moffatt, who spoke on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science. I am delighted that the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, is present this evening because, as the crow flies, he does not live that far from Tulla and he might be in a position to clarify the position.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="739" />It appears that the Department intends to proceed with an extension to Tulla school, the plans for which do not make provision for a PE hall on-site. I understand that a PE hall will be provided if a suitable site can be found, regardless of its distance from the school. Does the Minister of State believe this will give the children of Tulla a fair opportunity to avail of proper recreational and PE facilities? I do not believe it will do so. I hope he will give a commitment to the people and children of Tulla that, in line with their wishes, the Department will provide a new school on a greenfield site.</P>

      <P>I could also refer to the need for a greenfield site, rather than an extension, to be provided at Kilmihil. In doing so, however, I would only be touching upon the needs of my county. If we multiply the problems in Clare by 26, Members will see that the overall picture is quite sad. While figures are wonderful, the reality is not.</P>
      <P>There is a real difficulty in encouraging people to consider entering teacher training, whether for primary or second level. In addition, there are real problems in attracting people to train as teachers in the areas of science such as chemistry, physics, etc., and this has resulted in a shortage of qualified personnel.</P>
      <P>Education policy should be aimed at addressing this issue because if our population is well educated and well equipped, our economy will be vibrant. This is illustrated by what happened in recent years when we were able to exploit the vibrancy in the world economy because of the level of education among the populace. It is important that we ensure the various strands in the education sector will be ready to exploit future opportunities.</P>

      <P>&mdash;the achievements of the Government in the area of education.</P>
      <P>One of the points raised by the Opposition during this debate relates to the undermining of the professional status of teachers. I accept that morale is low among teachers&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;and I believe this is down to a minority within one union. I am a member of the teaching profession and, like Senator Costello, I know where we stand in relation to the current dispute. The Government has done everything in its power to try to bring about a satisfactory resolution to the dispute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">

      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>It has gone to arbitration and the Labour Court and, under the PPF, it has provided teachers with huge salary increases. In addition, the benchmarking system has been introduced. It is a pity that morale is so low and that this matter is receiving bad press. Everyone knows that teachers are dedicated to their profession and that, without them, we would not have an education system. The Government has recognised that and will continue to work with the unions to find a satisfactory resolution to the current impasse.</P>
      <P>I wish to highlight a number of matters which indicate the Government's commitment to education. The Teaching Council was established by the Government. This body was sought by teachers to underline the status and professionalism of teachers. Senator Costello did not say a great deal about the Teaching Council, the establishment of which has made it easy to accredit the professional status of teachers and made them feel they are in a position to promote best practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will turn now to the matter of funding and resources for schools. We have put in place the Early Start programme which has given children an even break. There is also the stay in school initiative. The latter is a great development, aimed as it is at trying to retain in school those who might otherwise be at large in the community and involved in anti-social behaviour and other activities. We introduced the well overdue Education (Welfare) Act to deal with absenteeism and detention but, again, Opposition speakers failed to mention this. The Act has led to huge improvements in how we deal with disadvantaged areas and how we track down those who become <Col N="741" /> lost in the system. I worked in the system to which I refer and I know it is about to get up and running.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not being provocative. In the past, principals of schools indicated that they needed grants in order to pay for caretaking and secretarial services. I worked in a school for many years and the authorities there were crying out for such services to be provided. However, there was no money available to pay for the services of caretakers or secretarial staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It still has not been provided.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Such funding has now been put in place and it is welcome. A new advisory committee has been established to deal with educational disadvantage and advise on strategy and the co-ordination of programmes. The Taoiseach also recently established the anti-poverty strategy project, which targets those who need to benefit most from education.</P>
      <P>We must consider the services that are available locally. Let us look, for example, at the psychological service. I agree that progress in this area has not been fast enough. There are approximately 100 psychologists employed in the service at present, but there is a need to speed up recruitment. I welcome the Government's initiative to provide grants to any schools running into difficulties in relation to private psychological assessments. A recruitment drive has been put in place, but it is not that easy to find people suitably qualified to carry out assessments. In my opinion, one person could carry out three such assessments in one day. If we consider disadvantaged areas, how many psychologists would be required to cope with the number of assessments required? I agree with Senator Costello that there is a need to speed up recruitment. However, the Government has put in place a recruitment drive and this will, in time, be successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A special education Bill is being drafted at present which will lead to the formation of a new council on special education. In addition, the Department of Education and Science is to undergo a process of regionalisation under which <Col N="742" /> sections will be dispersed into local communities. That will be a major development and one which is urgently required because we do not want our education system to be overly centralised.</P>

      <P>There is a certain joy in relation to Private Members' motions which begin with the words: &ldquo;That Seanad Éireann condemns the Government..&rdquo;, and then set out, in 11 lines or so, why the Government should be condemned. An amendment then follows, as happened this afternoon: &ldquo;To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following: &ldquo;notes <Col N="743" /> with approval..&rdquo;  What a joy to have the freedom of an Independent, not compelled to vote one way or the other.</P>
      <P>Successive Governments and successive Ministers, as far back as I can remember, have come into office determined to focus on doing the right thing. Whether they have succeeded is evidenced by the success of our economy. Senator Taylor-Quinn spoke earlier of our successful and vibrant economy. I have listened to people from around the world who envy Ireland. In the Forum for Europe today, at which Senator Ormonde was also present, some documentation contained forecasts that Ireland would be the second wealthiest nation &ndash; I am sure that is what it meant &ndash;<i>per capita</i>, within a number of years if our success continues. Our success was due to a mixture of things and Professor Joe Lee spoke about that today.</P>
      <P>Education is clearly a major factor. The investment in education by successive Governments over many years &ndash; indeed, decades &ndash; has shown that it pays, but it will never be adequately funded. There will always be an Opposition to say the Government is not taking the right approach. We must at least consider whether we can do better and whether we can manage with the limited resources available.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to five areas in particular. The decision was made, perhaps six or seven years ago, to have free higher level education. I suggest we question that again. Is that the best use of resources? Is it right that those who can afford to pay for third level education should get it free and those who cannot afford to pay for it still get the education free but there are so many other costs that they cannot afford to go to college? I suggest the next Minister for Education should address that issue in the coming years.</P>
      <P>Also in the context of resources, I am concerned that teachers are not being allowed to teach. They are not being given enough ability to teach. I was horrified by a figure quoted on a radio programme recently &ndash; and I hope I have got it correctly &ndash; in relation to a school in the west with 550 pupils and 50 teachers, or an average of 11 pupils per teacher. Maybe that is normal, but I am not aware of classes with anything approaching a ratio of 11 pupils per teacher. I can only assume that teachers are doing some other duties and I fear there is an element of bureaucracy involved. Perhaps those more closely involved in the teaching profession will say this is necessary and that, because they have so many other things to do, they need such extra support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In hospitals, it was my impression that the amount of time which consultants allocated to seeing patients was limited because of other work they undertook, such as research, paperwork or whatever. I am concerned by the bureaucracy which seems to occur in every profession. We must make sure that doctors are there to treat patients and teachers are there to teach, rather than getting involved in paperwork. There is a <Col N="744" /> danger that scarce resources may be allocated in the wrong way. The same applies in the Garda, with many gardaí doing paperwork when they should be out on the beat.</P>
    <P>It is vital that the Government seeks value for money in relation to teachers. The Government is right to negotiate and not give way too easily to demands. It is easy to be sympathetic to teachers because we all admire their work, just as is it is easy to give in to the demands of nurses. It is right that the Government should question a situation where a person returns after a three month holiday and is not willing to work in the evening to attend parent-teacher meetings. It is disgraceful that teachers refuse to give up one evening to meet parents and insist that parents come to meet them during the daytime. Before the Government makes any settlement, that kind of attitude should be recognised as unacceptable. It is equally unacceptable that others return from holidays and immediately take a day off, whether for union affairs or mass or whatever. That is an annual practice which has gone on for many years.</P>
    <P>The customer in education is the student. If we are to take a customer-minded view, as I suggest we do, we have to consider what is right for the student, not just what is right for the provider of education. Both must be taken into account but a balanced approach demands value for money and agreement to work together. Every teacher I know is anxious to do well and to put his or her heart and soul into good education. However, we really have to get the balance right in that regard.</P>
    <P>Pre-school education is another area which has not received sufficient attention. All the evidence is to the effect that the minds of children under five years old can be stretched, creating confidence and assuredness as well as intellectual ability so that they have the ability to be socially more aware and to learn much more readily when they enter the educational system. To the best of my knowledge, we have not even scratched the surface in relation to pre-school education.</P>
    <P>The confidence building aspect from a young age comes very much to the fore in the sector of education where I have some experience &ndash; the applied leaving certificate. That was a marvellous innovation by the then Minister for Education, Ms Niamh Bhreathnach, some years ago. She got excellent support from people in the Department who were just straining at the leash to take that kind of initiative. If one has the ideas, the commitment and a clear idea of what one wants to do, there is excellent support and teamwork available in the Department to make progress. I was delighted to have an involvement in the applied leaving certificate. It enabled those at the back of the class who were regarded as failures to gain confidence. It required changes on the part of the teachers who seized the opportunity and put their hearts and souls into making a success of it.</P>
    <P>Continuous assessment is one of the great advantages of the applied leaving cert and other areas of education. It gets away from the idea of <Col N="745" /> waiting two years to do the leaving certificate, sitting a three hour exam and then being told one has failed or done well, solely on the basis of that examination. Unfortunately, the continuous assessment was not carried out by the teachers themselves. Irish teachers seem to be alone in Europe in saying they do not want to be involved in assessing their own pupils. In other countries, teachers demand to be involved in that assessment process. Why is that not acceptable in Ireland? That should be questioned by the Minister and the Department of Education and Science to establish what has got into our psyche to prevent what seems to be normal practice elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Finally, I wish to deal with the subject of science. Are we sure we are getting science back into primary education? If not, can we make sure that we do, because we recognise a future that is in need of support by more education in science and in languages? Let us begin teaching science and modern languages, as well as Irish, earlier in the curriculum. It does not start early enough here compared to other parts of the world, especially in Europe, where they start in primary school and pupils are much more articulate in different languages at a very early age. I would love to see French, German and Spanish being taught at a much earlier age because we are so backward in that area. The focus on the future of Europe gives us the opportunity to do so.</P>
    <P>I support the Government tonight because I believe it is doing its best, which is not to suggest that it cannot do better. On this basis I am supporting the previous Government as well, some members of which are the proposers of tonight's motion. The efforts of previous Ministers for Education and Science are being built on by the Ministers in this Government, both Deputy Martin and Deputy Woods. I wish the Government well in its efforts and believe it is deserving of support.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy O'Dea. I support the amendment outlined by my colleague, Senator Ormonde. It is a pity the Labour Party did not use its opportunity tonight to put down a realistic motion, one we could all have debated in a mature and sensible way, teasing out the various dilemmas &ndash; and there are a few &ndash; that still exist in the education system. Instead it has taken the opportunity to try to score party political points at a time it feels it could put the Government behind the eight ball. The Labour Party has failed miserably in its aim so far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is undeniable that the education system is in far better shape today than it was five years ago. To appreciate that fact, one only needs to look at the amount of funding that was outlined by the Minister of State and by my colleague, Senator Ormonde. In addition, there has been an unprecedented level of legislation put through the Seanad, not the least being the Teaching Council <Col N="746" /> Act, 2001. Our education system is our most precious commodity and it has made a major contribution to the development of the economy. We should respond in such a way as to give the system the necessary tools required to develop further the leading role of the educational structure.</P>
    <P>I read the Labour motion a couple of times and it would make one think we were still operating out of hedge schools, while the reality is that we are considered one of the best educated nations in the world. We are facing some problems and there is still much work to be done, a fact that nobody denies, least of all the Minister of State who referred to this in his speech. There is nothing wrong with rejoicing in the fact that we have made a major contribution over the past five years to the education system. Instead of playing politics in the House with this sensitive issue, we should tease out what should be done in terms of dealing with the challenging times ahead.</P>
    <P>Teachers have played a pivotal role, not least at primary level where the seeds are sown for the future involvement of the individual in society. We need to support and encourage teachers in the way forward. The proposal in the Labour motion suggests that the Government has failed to fund the capital programme. That has been refuted by both the Minister of State and Senator Ormonde. Since it came to power the Government has increased spending on school buildings. Many of our schools were built in the 1970s and 1980s and they are all coming on stream for repair and, in some cases, replacement. It is unrealistic to suggest that this can happen overnight. I listened to Senator Taylor-Quinn outlining the needs in the County Clare area, but a realistic timescale for this work must be established. One does not need to have an old school to have a rat-infested one, as someone suggested.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="TonyKett" hpid="Mr. Kett Mr. Kett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kett</NameTxt>
      <P>I know new schools that are rat-infested for environmental reasons that have nothing to do with the state of the building. Senator Ormonde put her finger on it when she said that there is no hiding place from facts and she went on to outline some figures in regard to infrastructural funding over the past five years. She suggested that £91.6 million was provided in the accounts in 1997 by the outgoing Government, yet in the past five years £1.2 billion has been put into infrastructural development in the education sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Funding has been provided for 350 primary school teachers and 200 additional second level teachers at a cost of £14 million in a given year. An additional £10 million has been provided for a range of measures to assist pupils with disability. I include people with disability in the area of disadvantage and believe it is untrue to say that this area is not being addressed by the Government. In 1996 a school with which I am familiar had 113 <Col N="747" /> pupils, 12 teachers, three special assistants and no bus escorts. In 1999 the same school had 106 pupils, 17 teachers, ten special assistants and seven bus escorts. In 2001 with 98 pupils it had 19 teachers, 18 special assistants and 15 bus escorts. There is no foundation for the suggestion in the motion that the Government has ignored the disadvantaged or people with special needs. I can cite other examples to support this point if Senator Costello wishes me to.</P>
    <P>Measures for young people in the inner city are greater now than ever before, in terms of education, training, job opportunities and the general quality of their lives. The various additions to the curriculum, particularly anti-drug programmes and child abuse guidelines, as well as codes of discipline, have all played a major role in helping to develop inner cities and disadvantaged schools. The adult literacy budget has increased from less than £1 million to almost £11 million. The first ever national initiative to improve reading standards is another step taken by the Government which is being brought to fruition.</P>
    <P>The motion goes on to state &ndash; and I did not hear those who proposed the motion addressing this area &ndash; that the Government is undermining the professional status of teachers. The President of the ASTI, Catherine Fitzpatrick, acknowledged in this morning's paper that the strategies adopted by the ASTI have failed to deliver and she suggested it should step back from the situation and devise a strategy that has the potential to be successful. She went on to say that some people in her own union were working to undermine the efforts of the main body of union representatives. The President of the ASTI has declared that her own teachers are undermining themselves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and the motion. It gives us the opportunity to have a healthy debate about all the <Col N="748" /> issues in education. It is a very broad motion and provides great latitude to anyone who wants to speak on it.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Quinn regarding some of the matters he raised and particularly about the maintenance grant. I am sorry the Minister for Education and Science has left. In any town where there is a third level college, whether it is an institute of technology or a university, a majority of students work in bars and the like. Senator Quinn mentioned that some do not need to avail of the grant, but it is not adequate for the majority who have to find employment.</P>
      <P>It is a pity the Minister is not here as I would like to raise the schools which he said will be the subject of public private partnership projects in Ballincollig, Clones, Dunmanway and Shannon, among others. I would like to know how a public private partnership agreement will work for them. It has not been spelt out properly to us, but I hope it works. This is an area in which that approach can succeed. The Minister said that when this comes on stream, some principals will be free of the burden of building maintenance, allowing them to concentrate on their core educational functions. That means that when new schools are provided, the responsibility will be taken away from them. Under the old system, sadly, the principal of a school had to ring Tullamore if he needed a hammer, a nail or a pane of glass. The majority of these things could have been centralised and there was no need for the principal to be involved. The job could have been done by caretakers or small, local contractors. In fairness to the Department, there has been some streamlining, but I would like the Minister to spell out how public private partnerships will operate in relation to the provision of second level schools.</P>
      <P>The Minister made reference to the previous Government, saying that it provided little in relation to capital grants for education. I remind the Minister that the Government that was in office prior to 1993 and its Minister for Finance, the current Taoiseach, presided over the highest interest rate levels in the history of the State. They went as high as 20% and in some cases to over 30%. That hampered the economy. The 1997 Government provided £91 million in capital grants when the economy was only just beginning to take off and it should have been given some credit for that by previous speakers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister stated that when this Government took office, children with disabilities had no automatic entitlements to special education services. Such services were only provided if and when resources were available. We are told that all changed in October 1998 when the Government decided that all children in the primary system should be automatically entitled to a response to their needs. In reality, the parents of those people had to go to court to establish their rights as we saw in the Sinnott case, the O'Donoghue case and, this week, in the McNabb case in Galway. The parents of those children had to <Col N="749" /> force the Government into court to have their needs met.</P>
    <P>Much capital funding is pointed to in the Minister's speech. I come from the BMW region where we have Objective One status, which is for poorer regions. I have a list of schools in County Mayo which need to be upgraded and in some cases require capital grants for replacements. In my own town of Curnanool a new school is needed and the school at Snugboro needs to be extended. Other schools in need of attention include Carrowkennedy outside Westport, St. Patrick's national school in Castlebar, Scoil Raifteirí in Castlebar, which needs an extension, and a little school outside Castlebar, Errew national school, which needs to be upgraded. These are only a few examples. While I appreciate that much has been done over the years, much remains to be done. Errew national school is a small rural school which needs an extension. In cases such as that, in schools with less than five teachers, the Government should do away with the local contribution. A school like Errew has to collect £25,000, but there are only about 60 families sending pupils to it. How will they collect that local contribution? I urge the Minister to look closely at abolishing it.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Department of Education and Science. In some respects it has streamlined its building programme and, as of now, could spend £100 million more this year, but the Minister will not give the go ahead. In some cases it should cut out the middle man by allowing boards of management, the Minister or the Department to go straight to building contractors to ask them to build extensions to primary schools. There are some cases in which a small extension to a national school or second level school is required and the Department could cut out much red tape.</P>
    <P>Much has to be done in the area of special needs and it is only right that every one is entitled to an education. I reiterate my request to the Minister to look again at the grant for third level students.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. When I read the motion before us, I, like my colleagues on this side of the House, was baffled that a much more constructive debate was not being promoted. As speakers on the other side have said, it is very wide-ranging. It is a catch-all motion; one could home in on any aspect of it and make a long contribution. So many spectacular and phenomenal developments have taken place in education in recent years that one item alone would be worthy of a major debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion is so misleading, misinformed and contrary to the facts relating to developments in education that it strikes me as mischievous, if not one which has been carelessly thrown together. I hope I will have the opportunity to illustrate this by taking some examples of landmark developments in educational provision and policy that have taken place under the Minister for Edu<Col N="750" /> cation and Science, Deputy Woods, and his predecessor, Deputy Martin.</P>
    <P>One of the cornerstones of the Government's commitment to the welfare of the people is undoubtedly its record of investment in education. Last week, the revised Estimates for 2002 showed that educational expenditure will increase by 14% to over &euro;5.4 billion, compared to expenditure in 2001. Over a five year period, the aggregate increase in educational provision is of the order of 70-75%; expenditure has almost doubled during the lifetime of the Government. If proof is needed to discount the spurious assertions in the motion, this unprecedented level of funding is testament to the Government's commitment to education.</P>
    <P>A brief sketch of the principal achievements of the Government shows that the education system has developed spectacularly in a short period. Young people are being afforded opportunities in education and in the economy which were never available to their parents. This shows that positive developments in education are a key element of the PPF. It is equally true that the current level of success experienced by our economy and society is due in no small part to the quality of our education system and the commitment, dedication and professionalism of teachers at all levels.</P>
    <P>I want to address the false assertion in the motion that the professional status of teachers has been undermined. Of course there is a degree of demoralisation owing to a minority of teachers taking a certain line.</P>
    <P>I want to focus on some of the major achievements of the Government in the area of educational development and the establishment of structures. These did not come about by accident. They were the result of wide-ranging partnerships and consultation. The Education Act, 1998, the Educational Welfare Service and the Teaching Council are three developments that highlight the consensus approach the Government has taken. The contribution of all the parties involved continues to be extremely positive and progressive.</P>
    <P>It can be stated without fear of contradiction that, in recent times, we have seen the most significant advances ever in primary education. The programmes and modules that are central to these advancements, such as the revised curriculum for primary schools, are being implemented as we speak. The introduction of information and communication technology in the Irish education system was achieved faster than in any other European country. The OECD confirms Ireland's status in this regard. This did not happen by accident, it was a result of the full and meaningful participation by teachers as equal partners in the process. Teachers have been well equipped and resourced to take on the new and additional responsibilities that are attendant on these developments. Hundreds of millions of euro are being invested in this programme.</P>
    <P>To my recollection, teachers' unions and teachers generally have been extremely positive <Col N="751" /> in their response to the level of resources provided. They have responded in a similar manner to the many other initiatives and innovations introduced by the Government at first and second level. This is a clear indication of the quality of consultation that has taken place among all of the partners involved and runs contrary to the suggestion that the status of teachers has been diminished.</P>

I know it is not nice for Senator Costello to hear this, particularly when a motion to the contrary has been tabled and when the lid has been blown on the spurious assertion.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that educational disadvantage and learning difficulties are a source of inequality wherever and whenever they surface in the education system. No matter how hard we work in this area, we will never achieve enough. This has been acknowledged by the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, and his predecessor. Let us look at what has been achieved in this area in an objective and realistic way. At the end of its first year in office, the Government provided an unprecedented £57 million as a two-year funding initiative to tackle educational disadvantage at all levels. The measures included the hiring of 450 new teachers for remedial and other disadvantaged areas. There was a major improvement in adult literacy during this time, and I hope I get an opportunity to talk about that&mdash;</P>

      <P>If we were to check the record on the Order of Business over the last two years, I am sure we would see regular request for the Minister for Education and Science's presence in this House.</P>
      <P>The motion's reference to the undermining of the professional status of teachers is correct. I have not worked as a teacher for a few years now, but I can say that, having met teachers when I visit the school where I used to work, morale is at the lowest level I have ever come across. I have noticed a deep anger among teachers which will erupt sooner rather than later. They have literally been ignored in relation to the resolution of their pay demand. This situation has been further exacerbated by the supervision and substitution issue. There is no doubt that this will not come to an end even if the situation is resolved tomorrow morning. It will affect the high quality of our education system. Sadly, we will find that the dedication, commitment and sense of enthusiasm that were the hallmarks of teaching will be gone. That is a fact of life and I am very conscious of it in talking to teachers.</P>
      <P>We will find it very difficult to recruit more teachers at second level because the press that teachers have received in recent years has been abysmal. The Minister has failed to address the issues and to meet the union halfway. Some may argue that the ASTI has been intransigent. As a member of the ASTI I do not accept this. We would do far better if we did not have Senator O'Toole intervening negatively. As a teacher I am amazed at his lack of constructiveness. He is meddling in the affairs of another union, something which has never happened before. It has been a major negative factor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one matter people may not have considered regarding the supervision and substitution issue. Students have told me they now realise, <Col N="753" /> when they do not have teachers supervising, that a bond does exist between pupil and teacher. I know from supervision and substitution periods that there is a security level where students do talk to one out of the classroom, and they see us teachers as a support mechanism. We might get the negatives but by and large they want security, they want that rapport when it comes to issues that may not be educational or curricular but personal. That is lost to them between now and their exams. The Government will let the situation deteriorate right through May and the election period. We will be dealing with a worse situation in September.</P>
    <P>Where is the facilitator promised by the Minister some time ago? I am positive the facilitator was supposed to have been appointed last year. The appointment of a facilitator in relation to trade union disputes is the only way forward. In the event of the Minister not having sufficient appetite or interest to resolve the dispute, I have already in press releases and letters appealed to the Taoiseach, as the supremo when it comes to resolving difficult disputes, to intervene. I agree this is difficult but I am amazed he has not intervened, seeing that his Minister has completely abdicated his responsibility to come to grips with a very problematic situation.</P>
    <P>I was looking through the Official Report of Dáil debates, and in Adjournment motion after Adjournment motion, several issues &ndash; schools refurbishment, schools building projects, school staffing, youth services, transport &ndash; have cropped up repeatedly. Would that be the case if there was not a problem, which according to this amendment there is not?</P>
    <P>In Limerick, and I am sorry the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, is not here, schools are in an awful situation as regards their refurbishment, and Bilboa school is still awaiting funding for an extension promised during the by-election. I will hope the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, will do something for that school under the CLÁR programme because it is no longer the subject of any interest or support from the Department of Education and Science. It seems we will have to look to another Minister to do something for a school which is the only lifeline for that area because of population decline.</P>
    <P>I listened on my way to Dublin this morning to a parent saying that but for money from the Society of St. Vincent de Paul she would not have had her child psychologically assessed. That is shocking. Her expenses in euro were spelt out in terms of meals, transport&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>The principal spoke, and the principal of any primary school would know exactly how to access funding, but he was not able to do so. The whole school had benefited from funding from the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, which is wonderful, but surely if we were to believe everything in this amendment &ndash; wonderful this, wonderful that &ndash; then that poor lady <Col N="754" /> would not have been reliant on charity to get the money for assessment.</P>
      <P>I have a final point in relation to the primary schools in Limerick city and county. Not alone are children not being treated for their special needs but they have not even been assessed. I have had so many presentations from principals that this amendment is clearly utopian, Alice in Wonderland stuff. The reality is far different and is adequately described in the motion advanced by Senator Costello.</P>
      <P>I have not even got to staffing, disadvantaged areas or links with the community, or even to discuss an issue which upsets me enormously, which is interventions for ADHD sufferers. I could go on at length about Jamie Sinnott and those with severe problems who still have to go to the courts to obtain their rights. What are their rights as citizens?</P>

      <P>The Senator is generous with his remarks in the public arena but is not here to argue the toss with his peers in this House.</P>
      <P>I was fascinated by the omissions by the Minister in reading his brief. For some reason he failed to refer to the lamented and deceased Donogh O'Malley, who made a great contribution to education. He also declined to mention our great current Taoiseach; there was a reference in his brief but he decided for some reason to omit it from his remarks. He also decided to omit any reference to public private partnerships and the number of schools, outlined on page 13 I think, which were supposed to be developed. Does this mean we will not have a 675-pupil school in Tubbercurry, a 100-pupil school in Ballincollig, a 500-pupil school in Clones, a 750-pupil school in Dunmanway and a 600-pupil school in Shannon? Does it mean Minister O'Dea does not agree with the public private partnerships strategy? Perhaps we might get some elaboration on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we had from the Opposition and from the Minister was a plethora of figures and statistics, as though figures and statistics in a burgeoning economy added up to an education system. What I had originally quoted from the OECD report was &ldquo;a wonderful education system&rdquo; prior to when this Government came into existence, and I outlined the complex and very valuable role played by the teachers and the degree to which it has been undermined by the actions of the Minister and this Government. It is a fact that teachers are demoralised, angry and frustrated. They do not feel cherished, they do <Col N="755" /> not feel recognised. They have been insulted by bringing people into the classrooms who have no qualifications but are paid more money than qualified teachers. It is an insult to the profession. Who but this Goverment would do it? No wonder they are demoralised.</P>

      <P>I referred to the 850 major capital projects which the Minister refuses to list and prioritise and on which he refuses to give any information. As I have stated previously, this is a slush fund for the Minister and the Government in the run up to the general election. That is the manner in which the Minister is dealing with this. I have seen a couple of the announcements already. They involve Fianna Fáil Deputies in their local bailiwick asking the question at the appropriate time and the Minister giving it.</P>

    <Title>Public Health (Tobacco) Bill, 2001: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources to the House, although the absence of the Minister for Health and Children is unfortunate. As a member of the Joint Committee on Health and Children, I am familiar with the two reports produced by it. The two rapporteurs were Deputies Shatter and Gay Mitchell. A tremendous amount of research was undertaken by the joint committee and many presentations and submissions were heard and read. Dr. Fenton Howell from Action on Smoking and Health made a very interesting presentation and his recommendations were welcomed both by the Minister and the Opposition.</P>
      <P>Although this matter has been debated continually in the two years since those reports were produced, I welcome this opportunity of highlighting, once again, the serious issues associated with tobacco. The statistics are still shocking. Has there been a decrease in the number of people smoking, particularly young people, in the year since the Minister introduced his Bill in the Dáil? Has the 50p increase in excise duty on a packet of cigarettes caused a reduction in smoking? The joint commitee was convinced that increasing the price of cigarettes would be a deterrent and I would welcome ongoing research and evaluation of this measure.</P>
      <P>One wonders whether people are immune to statistics. Tobacco kills between 6,500 and 7,000 people every year. I have been told that the figure for deaths from tobacco in 2001 was 5,700, which represents a small reduction, but nonetheless a huge number of people. It is estimated that 31% of the population smoke and that a huge percentage of children are smoking before they reach the age of 18 years.</P>
      <P>The joint committee heard an interesting presentation last week from a witness from California regarding the banning of smoking in public houses. He suggested that if smoking was banned in public houses, the 70% of people who do not smoke would come back to public houses. The banning of smoking in bars in California has had no negative effect on their turnover. Some might argue that public houses in this country are very different from bars in California. I do not believe that is so because there are now Irish pubs throughout the world. Many concerned about environmental tobacco smoke or who do not like to have their clothes reeking of tobacco have returned to bars in California where the measure has had no negative effect. I am sure the same would be true here. The Minister could have banned smoking totally in public houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="757" />
      <Col N="758" />We are all concerned at the large number of deaths from lung cancer, emphysema and chronic bronchitis. I am concerned at the large number of young women who smoke, particularly in the lower socio-economic groups. As a teacher, I was concerned by the number of first year pupils already addicted to tobacco at the age of 12 years. Many parents dismissed concerns by saying they would prefer their daughters to be smoking tobacco than taking drugs. This attitude underlies much parental thinking with regard to smoking among young girls.</P>
    <P>I do not understand the reason stark statistics have not persuaded more people to give up smoking, but I am sure it is easier said than done. I am a non-smoker and do not like to dictate to others, but in my experience it is amost impossible to persuade people to give up cigarettes, which highlights the fact that tobacco is certainly addictive.</P>
    <P>I had hoped the identity card would be introduced. There are many ways for young people to acquire cigarettes, despite the abolition of the packet of ten cigarettes.</P>
    <P>By 2030 there will be 10 million deaths from smoking worldwide per year and smoking will cause one in every six deaths. There are now 1.1 billion smokers worldwide and by 2025 that figure is expected to have risen to 1.6 billion. There is definite evidence that nicotine is more addictive than heroin or cocaine. The joint committee was also told that most smokers do not continue to smoke out of choice, but because they are addicted to nicotine.  </P>
    <P>Dr. Luke Clancy, consultant respiratory physician in St. James's Hospital, spoke at a recent conference about the effects of environmental tobacco smoke. It was the danger of ETS which persuaded Californians to ban smoking in all public places. Those exposed to ETS have a 20% to 30% increased risk of contracting lung cancer, a huge percentage. I am simply giving the facts as enunciated at the conference by Dr. Clancy. He said the same substances are present, even if in lower dosages, when second-hand smokers inhale. It is shocking that one is a victim of smokers when one is in an environment where there is tobacco smoke.</P>
    <P>It is well documented that smoking in pregnancy has an adverse effect in terms of low birth weights, perinatal deaths and suddent infant deaths. It is extraordinary to see so many young women smoking during pregnancy, despite the negative indicators. Some of them who give up smoking during the nine months cannot wait to smoke again. I am aware of one girl whose baby was barely born when she went out to have a cigarette. She had the gumption and strength of character to give up smoking for the nine months, but it shows the latent addiction that the cigarette was the first thing she sought. In the United States no gynaecologist will take a pregnant woman who smokes or drinks as his or her patient. That is a fact of life. His or her concern is litigation, but I wonder how strongly gynaecologists and general practitioners speak to pregnant <Col N="759" /> women about giving up cigarettes during the nine months.</P>
    <P>The effects are not only seen during pregnancy, but also in later stages in childhood. When I was teaching I noticed a tremendous increase in the incidence of asthma among young girls. The incidence of asthma, middle ear infection disease and other respiratory illnesses increases in children of smoking parents. When one thinks of the difficulties parents experience dealing with these diseases it is astounding that young women continue to smoke. The lure of the cigarette despite the negative effects is striking.</P>
    <P>The concerns regarding health are extraordinarily important. This relates not only to the money that must be spent eliminating disease, but also to the quality of life and the lower life expectancy of those who smoke. It is extraordinary that despite all the interventions to help smokers the addiction is so strong they continue to smoke. One point that disturbed me enormously was contained in a letter from a representative of the company, John Player and Sons. He stated the company would have been happy to have been involved in discussions with those who were drafting the policy on tobacco control. He went on to say the company welcomed new legislation, but that some provisions were disproportionate and unbalanced. He continued: &ldquo;Unfortunately, no invitation to attend the Joint Committee on Health and Children to discuss the Bill was received by John Player and Sons, which would have allowed us to communicate our views on this proposal, both positive and negative, to the members of the committee.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>However, on 1 June 2001, the same company wrote that it had to decline the sub-committee's request to attend the joint committee. These are double standards. The company stated it had been advised that the objectives of the joint committee were in excess of jurisdiction and, therefore, unlawful. This was primarily because the intention of the joint committee was to assist litigation against tobacco companies in Ireland. In what world are they living? The company wanted an input to the Bill in order to control what the Minister was trying to do and allow more smoking. These were two contradictory letters.</P>
    <P>The tobacco companies also took the joint committee members for amadáns when we raised the issue of addiction to which Dr. Howell referred in his presentation. It was stated smoking was as addictive as surfing the Internet. Whatever about addiction to chocolate, which leads one to become overweight but has not killed anybody, the comparison with addiction to surfing the Internet was trite and dismissive in relation to what the committee was trying to do. That says it all with regard to where the tobacco companies stand. They could not care less other than to increase the number of young children who smoke.</P>
    <P>John Player and Sons, the letter states, &ldquo;neither wants nor encourages children to smoke.&rdquo;  I won<Col N="760" /> der who believes that. It continued: &ldquo;We believe that the risks associated with smoking are well known and that adults should be allowed to choose whether or not to smoke.&rdquo;  The company went on to question the fact that the Bill would remove any possibility for manufacturers operating in the Irish market to communicate to their existing adult consumers about certain aspects of their products &ldquo;or to successfully introduce new products onto the market.&rdquo;  The company stated it could not do its business because the Bill excluded it from doing so. It stated this is disproportionate and &ldquo;likely to infringe constitutional protections, including intellectual property rights and certain competition rules and other EU internal market principles.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Another point should be raised. We seldom get an opportunity to consider the tobacco companies' stance on this issue. They state they share the Government's goals of combating under age smoking and ensuring a regulatory environment is established that is workable, fair and proportionate. I do not believe that. We have been told that molasses and sweeteners are among the ingredients of cigarettes because they hook young people on smoking. We also believe that in their aggressive marketing they are seeking to replace the smokers they lose. Their targets are young people.</P>
    <P>The one way the tobacco companies will be beaten &ndash; this point was emphasised at the conference &ndash; is to tell young people they are the targets, that they will be dictated to by the sophisticated and subtle pressure on them to be smokers and that they should not allow any tobacco company to dictate their lifestyle, especially when their health will be so badly affected if they smoke. I see nothing positive in how the tobacco companies believe they will address the issue of young people and the effects of smoking on their health.</P>
    <P>What were the joint committee's recommendations? They ran to several pages. I am trying to be positive towards the Bill, but I am extremely concerned about the Office of Tobacco Control. It will have powers of enforcement, but I am concerned about the resources that will be given to it to ensure it will be effective. I received a letter from the voluntary group concerned with tobacco control. It has branches in 12 counties and asked me to stress the point that resources must be provided to implement the Bill. One can have good legislation, but it must be enforced, monitored and eventually evaluated. This will have to take place on a daily basis given the tremendously negative impact of smoking on everybody. That is the most important point in relation to the Bill.</P>
    <P>The joint committee recommended that at least £20 million per annum be spent on a comprehensive anti-smoking strategy. In all the presentations it received, the most interesting point made was that instead of giving moneys to various groups, it would be better to channel all funding to a specific group to address the issues involved. Otherwise there is duplication and it <Col N="761" /> will take longer to evaluate the effects of implementing the legislation and whether we are getting value for money as regards enforcement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, on her speech in which she outlined the many important points in the Bill. The Public Health (Tobacco) Bill is one of the most important brought before the Oireachtas while the battle against tobacco is one of the most important health challenges facing the country. It is and must remain a health priority. The Bill is the most comprehensive anti-tobacco legislation ever introduced and confirms the Government's commitment to the fight against the tobacco epidemic.</P>
      <P>Tobacco use and, in particular, cigarette smoking remains the leading cause of preventable illness in Ireland. Smoking-related illnesses account for 7,000 deaths annually in Ireland and a total of 500,000 deaths throughout the European Union. Tobacco can kill in many ways, including lung and other forms of cancer, heart disease, strokes and other respiratory diseases. The Minister of State outlined the difficulties we face in this area. The total of 7,000 deaths each year is frightening and must bring a message home to everybody. Most smokers recognise the dangers and the increasing social unacceptability of smoking and wish to break their addictions. People must also be protected against the dangers of toxic environmental tobacco smoke. There are no smoking areas in bars and restaurants and these improvements are welcome. While it is recognised that there have been improvements, we have a long way to go.</P>
      <P>Life expectancy in Ireland is lower than the EU average and the diseases which contribute primarily to this are heart disease and cancer. Tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of these diseases. Smoking is a major factor in approximately 90% of deaths from lung cancer annually and increases the risk of other cancers, such as mouth and throat cancer. Smoking is also a primary cause of cardiovascular disease and is the greatest cause of mortality in Ireland. People can cite the number of people who die who never smoked, but a significant number die as a result of smoking-related illnesses.</P>
      <P>The Bill includes strong measures to tackle the tobacco epidemic on a number of fronts. It provides for a comprehensive ban on tobacco advertising, including in-store advertising and displays, and on all forms of sponsorship by the tobacco industry. Tobacco advertising is intended to increase consumption as well as brand share and has a powerful effect on young people. The legislation also provides for registration of tobacco retailers and tougher penalties for those convicted of underage sales. Compliance with existing laws, especially in regard to sales to minors, has been poor. Surveys have highlighted that many under age people can purchase tobacco products over the counter from retailers without being asked to produce any evidence of their age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="762" />The legislation will provide for comprehensive powers of enforcement and will introduce a range of penalties commensurate with the offences. The age limit for the sale of tobacco products to young persons was raised from 16 to 18 years, which was welcome, and a maximum fine for persons convicted of selling tobacco products to under age persons was increased substantially on foot of the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2001. These measures are enhanced in the legislation and will act as a further deterrent to retailers.</P>
    <P>A ban on retail sales of packs of cigarettes of less than 20 is welcome. Price is the most effective means of protecting children against experimenting with cigarettes and becoming addicted. Increasing the maximum pack size that may be sold raises the price barrier for children. Some people believe this also affects elderly people who have smoked all their lives and who will have difficulty paying for larger packs. However, this provision must be examined from the perspective of preventing young people taking up smoking. Small packs and cheaper prices are significant contributory factors to the number of young people who take up smoking.</P>
    <P>There will be tighter controls on the sale of products from vending machines. Many cigarette vending machines located in licensed premises and elsewhere are often out of the sight of staff and there is no supervision, which gives unrestricted access to cigarettes to under age people. That has been a major problem for a long time. The Bill provides for much tighter control on all aspects of tobacco retailing, including vending machines. Machines will have to be located beside or behind bar counters and under the direct supervision of staff and that is welcome. I compliment the Minister and his officials on inserting that provision. Co-operation is needed between health officials and owners of premises regarding the location of such machines. This issue was widely discussed by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children, but the location is negotiable and there is room to facilitate all concerned.</P>
    <P>The legislation provides for a ban on the sale of confectionery normally intended for children which resemble tobacco products. That is a worthwhile provision. The Minister of State said the sale of confectionery to children in the form of tobacco products helps build an unhealthy relationship between children and such products. Some of the candy cigarette packets on sale in shops are difficult to distinguish from packets of cigarettes.</P>
    <P>With regard to public disclosure of all aspects of tobacco, including toxicity and addiction, the Bill provides the proposed tobacco control agency with powers to obtain information from manufacturers relating to consumption and the properties of tobacco products and to test such products. In addition, health warnings and batch numbering will be mandatory on all packs. The industry will have to meet a high threshold of dis<Col N="763" /> closure about the toxicity and addictiveness of its products and the public will be truthfully and fully informed about these products. The case was made at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children that it was very difficult for manufacturers to do so but, no matter how difficult it is, the Department is correct to ensure health warnings are printed on packs and consumers can read about what is in the packs.</P>
    <P>Tobacco smoke is the greatest source of indoor air pollution. Environmental tobacco smoke is a real and substantial health hazard, especially to infants, children and persons with heart and lung diseases. It is reasonable that the public should not be involuntarily exposed to tobacco smoke. I support the extension of the environmental controls on smoking to a range of public areas and facilities not already covered by existing legislation and regulations. There is an onus on property owners to provide proper ventilation and departmental officials must examine premises to ensure that is the case. In many premises ventilation is very poor and must be improved. The Tobacco Control Agency will monitor, co-ordinate and, in certain circumstances, enforce and report on new tobacco policy initiatives. It will drive the implementation of many of the Bill's provisions and also co-operate with all relevant agencies in working towards a tobacco free society.</P>
    <P>Advertising is mentioned in the Bill, but we can only act locally. However, we can see tobacco advertising and sponsorship at many sports events shown on television. Sponsorship by tobacco companies has disappeared and I would not be sorry if sponsorship by alcohol companies also went. There is an onus on Government do this and the quicker it happens the better.</P>
    <P>As a member of a health board who visits many hospitals and other institutions, I see a large number of elderly people barely able to draw breath as a result of smoking cigarettes for much of their lives. Many of them give up cigarettes when it is too late and makes no difference.</P>
    <P>The Bill is important at this time. I congratulate the Minister and his officials on bringing it through the Dáil and now the Seanad in order that it may be enacted before the general election. It will result in a better environment in which our young people can live. We talk about young people smoking which certainly has a serious effect on those who get involved in sports and sports organisations. One has only to look at the difference in fitness and sporting performance between young people who do and do not smoke.</P>
    <P>There is one small point that affects some elderly people who have been smoking all their lives and will never give up cigarettes. The extra cost involved in the change from having boxes of ten to only having boxes of 20 will cause some problems for them. The Bill makes changes affecting vending machines and where cigarettes may be stored in shops and pubs. We must be prepared to co-operate with those involved in those busi<Col N="764" /> nesses in order that they can meet the requirements of the Bill without excessive cost to them. I wish the Minister and his officials well with this most welcome Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Senator Quinn. I very much welcome the Bill of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin. It is interesting that the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, was sent here to bring it before the House. It is ironic that he is normally sent here when we are discussing fears regarding Sellafield and we are considering a potential danger. In this instance we are dealing with a real danger and a real cause of human mortality, yet the Minister of State's responsibility for nuclear issues receives so much more time than this absolute danger and cause of mortality.</P>
      <P>I warmly congratulate the Minister for Health and Children on introducing the Bill. I also congratulate those involved in pressurising the Department to bring it forward. I particularly congratulate Dr. Fenton Howell of ASH, the Action on Smoking and Health group which has tried for so many years to get us to make efforts on this issue. I am delighted he is present in the Visitors Gallery of the House.</P>
      <P>I would like to start by quoting from his Doolin lecture in 2001 entitled, Towards a Tobacco Free Society: Should We Care? Of course, we should care. He carefully outlined how long people have known that tobacco was harmful. King James I introduced a tobacco tax in 1601, not to raise revenue but because he hated the smell of smoke so much. For 400 years we have known it is unpleasant, but since 1950 when Doll and Hill described the relationship between cigarette smoking and lung cancer, we have known how really serious this issue is for people's health.</P>
      <P>As Senators Jackman and Moylan have outlined the various problems brought on our health by smoking, I will not go through them again. With the exception of a really serious diabetic, I have never known a person to lose a leg apart from a smoker. We think of mortality, but not of the morbidity associated with the smoking of cigarettes, cigars and other forms of tobacco. In women there is a higher incidence of cervical cancer among those who smoke than those who do not because nicotine affects the cell division of the DNA within the cells of our bodies. It is a most serious issue and it is sad that it has taken until now to get to grips with it. The problems of passive smoking are sometimes minimised in the press. However, the problems of passive smoking for small children are really quite dreadful. I warmly welcome the Bill and I am sure it will pass through the House as quickly as possible. I will not table any amendments because the Bill has been very well dealt with in the other House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting that the Minister is urged to do something about anthrax and smallpox in case we have such epidemics here, but the likelihood of either of these is pretty remote. However, I do not see the same kind of public adulation for him <Col N="765" /> because he is trying to do something about tobacco regulation for which he is to be warmly applauded.</P>
    <P>The environmental health officers have done an enormous amount to implement existing legislation and I hope this Bill will give them even more help. There are two things I would like to point out, but I will not table amendments because to do so would delay the Bill. I wish only those over 18 years of age were allowed to sell cigarettes. It is a pity that this is not included because young people may be pressurised by their friends to sell cigarettes to them. I presume the Bill will help the Garda which has to enforce the law governing the sale of smuggled cigarettes. I sometimes work on the north side of Dublin city in which there are areas where one might believe it was quite legal to sell cigarettes on the street. The trade in smuggled cigarettes needs to be tackled with a sense of urgency.</P>
    <P>Sometimes environmental health officers must have children purchase cigarettes in front of them in order that they can take cases against retailers. It is important the court process does not cause too much trouble for these volunteer children. This is not really part of the Bill &ndash; it is part of the court process &ndash; but I ask the Minister to bear it in mind. If something needs to be done in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Minister concerned should do it. It is important to protect these young people, particularly if they need to give evidence through video cameras.</P>
    <P>I hope the Bill supports all the various methods in the new treatment of tobacco use and dependence. I have a copy of the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i> of 14 February this year and it is amazing what is included in it in terms of the strategies and evidence which can be brought forward through interventions to try to reduce the amount of smoking which takes place here. It is not all doom and gloom. Some 30 years ago 45% of the population smoked; it is now 30%. However, we must have different strategies for different groups. Young women who feel they will get fat if they do not smoke must be considered in a different manner from people in their 60s with chronic obstructive airway disease. I hope that happens. I warmly welcome the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Henry for agreeing to share her time with me. I must declare two interests. The first is that I am a non-smoker, although I am beginning to realise that is not the proper way to describe it. I am not an active smoker but, like everyone else and through no choice of my own, I am a passive smoker. The dangers of passive smoking are only now beginning to receive full attention. That issue will continue to drive the continuing campaigns of successive Ministers against smoking in public places. The argument against smoking has moved on from considering what damage smokers do to themselves to what damage they do to others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="766" />The second interest I must declare is that I sell cigarettes. I do not have any choice in that matter because as long as it remains legal to sell cigarettes in this country, it would be commercial suicide for someone in a company such as mine to refuse to sell a product which a large proportion of customers wish to buy. We have always taken a view that the customers, not the company, decide who buys what in our shops. As I make money from selling cigarettes, anything I say in support of the Bill may appear hypocritical. I must plead guilty on that count, but I will not lose much sleep over it because I am not the only one who is hypocritical. The Government is also hypocritical because it makes much money from tax on cigarettes.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about making the Bill work. Senator Henry said that the number of people smoking has been reduced from 45% to 30% in 30 years. I would like smoking eliminated, but how can we do that? In 1919 the American Government decided to do away with alcohol and it introduced Prohibition. However, 13 years later, in 1932, it reintroduced alcohol because it realised that something it tried to do did not work. Like the Wilson Government in 1919, which had the worthy objective of banning alcohol, we must ensure the Bill, with its worthy objective, works. I support any steps we must take to ensure that happens.</P>
    <P>Is the Bill landmark legislation? Landmark legislation banned advertising on television and billboards. The Bill is not landmark legislation and perhaps the Minister is right not to make it so. If it ended up the same way as America did with Prohibition, it would not work. He must strike a balance because he does not want to go too far if it means he does not succeed. Britain, for example, has the most expensive cigarettes in Europe, but approximately 33% of all cigarettes are sold under the counter and the Government does not get tax on them. Legitimate taxpayers are not involved. Some £6 billion worth of cigarettes are sold in illegal cigarette trading. We must ensure we take the necessary steps.</P>
    <P>That may be the reason the Minister has decided not to ban cigarette smoking in pubs and restaurants. I know he said this is enabling legislation which means a future Minister could decide to do that. This may be the reason he has decided to give way to the publican lobby. We have always recognised the publican lobby. However, I do not understand the policy about vending machines. Under the legislation, if one goes into a shop, there must not be any sign of cigarettes or the container which holds cigarettes. It must be hidden under the counter. However, if one goes into a pub, a hotel or a licensed premises, the vending machine is visible. I know there are restrictions and perhaps the Minister, when he is making the regulations, will take into account the difficulties faced by people who cannot read and, therefore, do not know that they must use a vending machine or who are not allowed to see the name of the cigarettes. I do not understand how <Col N="767" /> the Minister can make one law for the country and exclude those who sell cigarettes in public houses, hotels and licensed premises. It does not make sense. I assume the Minister has the power in the legislation to do something about that.</P>
    <P>Section 37(7) seems to suggest the Minister is not holding on to any power. I am concerned about the power being given to the office of tobacco control. I do not understand how it will work. There is a danger of a constitutional challenge to the legislation. Since I am anxious to ensure that we restrict the sale of cigarettes, I want to ensure the legislation works. However, we seem to have taken from the Judiciary and given to an office the right to take away the livelihood of someone who sells cigarettes for three or 12 months and to do so without recall. It does not seem that the office has any choice. It must remove the licence of someone who is found guilty of a breach of the law in this area. I challenge whether that is the right way to proceed.</P>
    <P>I will give the example of what happened in the legislation dealing with the sale of alcohol to young people. Anyone who was found guilty of selling alcohol to young people could lose their licence. However, that was not done in spite of the many cases where alcohol was sold to under age people. Different legislation was introduced 15 months ago &ndash; the sin bin legislation. For years practically no one was sent off the field in rugby football for a grievous offence because it would ruin the game. Then the sin bin was introduced which meant the game was not ruined because someone was just sent off for ten minutes. That is similar to the alcohol legislation. If one is found guilty of selling alcohol to young people, the judge can decide to remove the licence for a short period of time, such as a week, a day or an hour. I understand from the Garda that many judges around the country use it because it does not deprive a publican and his or her employees of a livelihood. It is sin bin legislation which means someone can be punished, but it will not take away his or her livelihood. I would love to see something similar introduced in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I fear the legislation will not work because it is too draconian. When someone is found guilty of selling cigarettes to a young person &ndash; let us assume unintentionally &ndash; and those charged with the duty of making a decision inform him or her that they will lose their licence and will not be allowed to sell cigarettes for three or six months, depending on the offence, we will be faced with the same situation that arose in respect of the sale of alcohol to young people.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister of State to take into account the fact that everyone wants this legislation to work. We recognise that many people depend on the sale of cigarettes for their livelihoods and, as a society, we do not want to deprive them of that source of income immediately. Let us ensure that there is a balance in the legislation by encouraging the Minister of State to take account of the <Col N="768" /> points I have raised on Committee and Report Stages. Let us ensure that it achieves its objective, namely, improving the situation and reducing the number of cigarettes smoked.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EddieBohan" hpid="Mr. Bohan Mr. Bohan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bohan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support many of the Minister of State's endeavours to reduce the number of young people who smoke. In my opinion, however, the Bill contains a number of panic measures which are draconian in nature.</P>
      <P>Smoking affects different people in different ways. As a young man I did everything in my power to become addicted to cigarettes. I smoked 60 Afton Major a day for a long period. These cigarettes did not come with filters in those days but I still did not become addicted. Subsequently, I tried smoking cigars and a pipe, but to no avail. As already stated, smoking affects different people in different ways. Even Winston Churchill, who smoked strong cigars for most of his life, lived to be over 90 years of age so, obviously, smoking did not do him much harm.</P>
      <P>Statements have been made about this matter which are not factual. I wish to provide an example relating to the licensed trade to support my argument. At a conference organised by the Office of the Director of Tobacco Control, an American professor claimed that 150 Irish bar workers risk dying each year from passive smoking. This assertion is seriously at variance with the factual experience of workers in the Dublin licensed trade. A scheme for bar employees was established in 1974. At present, there are 900 active participants and 280 pensioners attached to this scheme. Since 1995, 71 pensioners, 69 of whom were barmen, involved with the scheme have died. This means that an average of a little less than ten per year have died. An analysis of these pensioners' ages, as recorded on their death certificates, has been carried out and the following are the results: three or 4.3% died between the ages of 55 to 60; five or 7.2% died between 61 and 65; 14 or 20.3% died between 66 and 70; 20 or 29% died between 71 and 75; 17 or 24.7% died between 75 and 80; nine or 13.1% died between 81 and 85; and one or 1.4% died at over 86 years of age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the basis of this analysis, the average age at death of a Dublin barman is 73.4 years. This is in line with the life expectancy of the average Irish male. Eight of the barmen died when under the age of 65 and might be considered premature. However, none of the relevant death certificates recorded lung cancer, for example, as the primary cause of mortality. In addition to the pensioner deaths, three members of the scheme died in service over the past five years. None of these was attributed to lung cancer. In all 72 cases examined, it would be reasonable to assume that, in line with the general adult population, at least one third of the deceased were smokers. In all cases, their entire working lives were spent in the Dublin licensed trade. It appears to the Licensed Vintners' Association, which carried out the analysis, that frequently exaggerated arguments <Col N="769" /> can be introduced into the debate on smoking in licensed premises. All the evidence to which I refer is verifiable and, hopefully, it may help inject some balance into the debate.</P>
    <P>The new technology being installed in a number of pubs in Dublin will allow for a complete change of air in any establishment every three minutes. In my opinion, one would be much safer in such a pub than one would be walking down our streets where buses are constantly pumping out carbon monoxide. Many people state that part of a licensed premises should be set aside for non-smokers. I agree with this concept, but it would not be possible to do so in small city and country pubs with only one bar.</P>
    <P>In the past, cigarette vending machines were placed in any location that was deemed suitable, which often meant that they were out of the view of publicans and their staff. In such circumstances, anyone could enter a premises, put money in the machine and obtain cigarettes. I must give credit to cigarette vending machine operators who, at great expense, have introduced a scheme whereby people can only use tokens in such machines and these can only be purchased across the counter from bar staff. This will eliminate the problem of placing vending machines in places where they cannot be seen.</P>
    <P>I am not speaking on behalf of vending machine operators but it seems that the measures in the Bill which apply to them are draconian, particularly in so far as tobacco control officers will be able to enter a premises owned by one of these people and if it is discovered that an underage person has been served, he or she will lose their licence for four months and will have no recourse to the courts. The same will apply to the owners of public houses if they serve someone who is underage. However, the courts will be responsible for taking away a publican's licence and if good evidence of innocence is provided, he or she may not be punished in this way. Many tobacco agents and vending machine operators work out of their own homes, however, and tobacco control officers will be able to confiscate their cigarettes and machines and they will have no recourse to the courts. I ask the Minister to reconsider the situation which obtains in this regard because I do not believe that any cigarette vending machine operators would knowingly be involved in selling cigarettes to people who are underage.</P>
    <P>While the Bill is laudable, I do not agree with the measures it takes in respect of many areas. There are approximately 100 small companies involved in the cigarette vending machine industry and these will all be forced out of business if the Bill, as it stands, is passed. These people must be given some protection, be it in the form of being allowed to launch an appeal or to have recourse to the courts. If cigarettes can only be purchased from such machines by using tokens, problems in this area will be eliminated.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="770" />I appreciate what is being attempted in the Bill. It is unfortunate that so many young people are smoking at present. On our streets, one can see children of 12 and 13 years of age smoking. This is a major problem and I congratulate the Minister of State on trying to deal with it as best she can.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not really intended to speak on the Bill so late in the evening, but it is an interesting and useful debate. I compliment the Government on introducing this measure. It has not always been popular or easy to take on the tobacco industry, which is extremely powerful. Previous Ministers have encountered arguments from the Department of Finance, in terms of tax revenue. However, it is now quite clear that any revenue lost due to a decline in tobacco sales is more than matched by savings in the health service. The Minister of State referred to the astonishing fact that there are 7,000 preventable deaths every year directly attributable to tobacco smoking.</P>
      <P>People may regard my comments as somewhat hypocritical because I am a habitual smoker. The Minister of State said that, in the early years of the last century when tobacco use, largely through smoking cigarettes, was becoming widespread the product was seen as benign and recreational. That makes me feel a lot older than I am. I was not around in the early years of the last century, but it was so regarded when I was a kid. Every good gangster movie had the silhouetted figure of a man in a trilby hat, lighting up a cigarette &ndash; such as<i> The Third Man </i>and other wonderful films. Advertisements for the Marlboro cigarette company featured a wonderful macho man, but we subsequently discovered that at least two of the male models held up as the essence of virility died of lung cancer as a result of the consumption of Marlboro products. I well remember when, not only was it fashionable, it was regarded as mature, sexy and, even, healthy to take up cigarette smoking to reduce nervous tension. It was even suggested it was good for asthmatics on that account. That is not all that long ago &ndash; I was not born at the beginning of the last century.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I disagree with the 1964 report of the US surgeon on smoking and health, quoted by the Minister of State, which concluded that cigarette smoking was causally related to lung cancer in men and to a lesser extent in women. I suggest the reason it appeared to occur to a lesser extent in women was that women did not consider smoking fashionable at the time. However, they have since been targeted in the most unscrupulous way by all the cigarette companies, both in this country and America, with specially designed slimline cigarettes in a heavy advertising campaign. The tobacco industry was absolutely unscrupulous and cynical in that regard, especially in the United States of America. I am glad the Minister of State <Col N="771" /> referred to the report, in June 2001, for the Philip Morris company in Czechoslovakia. I recall commenting in this House at the time that, since the report stated smokers die early, it was financially beneficial to the State because it saved money on the health service. One might as well say that if the populations of Dún Laoghaire, Sallynoggin and Ballybrack were gassed, there would be a saving on transport. That was a rather ruthless attitude.</P>
    <P>We cannot be expected, however, to tolerate any double-think on the part of the cigarette companies. We know they deliberately added chemicals they knew to be addictive. Though it is a powerful drug, nicotine was not considered by the tobacco industry to be sufficiently addictive. Therefore, they increased the addiction by deliberately and cynically adding chemicals which added nothing to the health or enjoyment of the smoker but simply got people addicted more heavily and more rapidly. That was an appalling approach, especially when the health risks were well known. When the American tobacco companies encountered difficulties in their own country, they dumped their cigarettes on Third World countries where unfortunate people, already mugged by global capitalism, were driven to further suffering by the operations of the companies in question.</P>
    <P>There has been some discussion on the introduction of ID cards which should be looked at. While I was in my local newsagent's shop recently, I was delighted to see her run a kid of about 14 years out of the shop. I am not sure how many tobacconists do likewise &ndash; I hope most of them would do so. I complimented her on her splendid action and promised to mention it in this debate if I got the opportunity. However, there may be a problem in determining the age of young people on the borderline of the age limit, unless they are required to produce an ID card.</P>
    <P>I have been informed by a representative of ASH &ndash; Action on Smoking and Health &ndash; that it can be construed as a legitimate defence, under the law, if the tobacconist has asked for an ID card and a card of some kind has been flashed. I received a letter from a decent gentleman in County Clare who asked how a shopkeeper is to determine the ages of teenagers without a proof of age card. He pointed out that a shopkeeper could lose his licence for four months due to what could be an error. Did RTE know that Nadine in the &ldquo;Popstars&rdquo; programme was only 16? That is a fair comparison. Our national broadcasting station was unable to determine that young woman's age and it seems unfair to expect a newsagent in a country town to do so.</P>
    <P>My correspondent went on to refer to what he described as a draconian measure to ban the display of products. He suggested a compromise of a somewhat technical nature, referring to a maximum display of not more than 1.2 metres by <Col N="772" /> 0.6 metres, or 4 feet by 2 feet, from floor level. The current average display unit is 1.8 metres by 1.2 metres, up to 3.6 metres by 2.4 metres. Pointing out that tobacco is still a legal product, he asked the reason decent, salt of the earth, family shop owners should be criminalised. I suggest he has made a reasonable point.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn described the measure as draconian, but I do not agree &ndash; the right balance has been struck. If an overly draconian approach is taken, the trade will be driven underground, as in the case of Prohibition in the United States. There is already a serious problem, which I hope will be addressed, in terms of the widespread sale on the streets of Dublin of contraband or smuggled cigarettes. Much of the very substantial proceeds of this trade goes to subversive organisations and criminal gangs. This really needs to be tackled.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to smoking areas and I confess my guilt &ndash; I am a smoker and have travelled a good deal. One ought to have care for the health of smokers as well as non-smokers &ndash; we are still members of the human race. In the USA, particularly airports, one sees little glass boxes with virtually no provision for fan extraction of the nicotine laden smoke. They look like boxes of cotton wool and it is absolutely impossible to breathe inside one of them &ndash; they are virtual gas chambers. I suggest there should be regulations in respect of such enclosures for smokers. It is not really good enough to put people into this appalling situation, without any facility for smoke extraction. Like myself, most people had become addicted before the dangers of smoking were widely advertised.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister of State's criticism of sponsorship and advertising. It is a most extraordinary irony that manufacturers of such lethal products as cigarettes should advertise in the context of sporting activities which are supposed to be about health and greatly attractive to young people. This displays the cynicism of the tobacco manufacturing companies.</P>
    <P>My final point is slightly sentimental. In Dublin there are a number of old-fashioned shops such as Fox's and Kapp &amp; Peterson's. Everybody of a certain age remembers the Kapp &amp; Peterson advertisement with the pipe and so on. They are such nice people in the shop and they sell all the old tobacco accoutrements, not just cigarettes but all kinds of lighters, cigars, cigar cutters and so on. It has a very nice gentlemanly, old-fashioned atmosphere and I understand that there may be some degree of exemption for these traditional family businesses. Without wishing to spread my own addiction throughout the nation, I am glad the Minister has seen fit to make some provision in this regard. I compliment the Minister on the introduction of the Bill, which is a wise and balanced measure, and I wish it well.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chuir roimh an tAire go dtí an teach. At the outset I wish to confess that I am a former smoker who smoked anything up to 80 cigarettes a day. If I was playing cards I would certainly break open a fourth large packet in the day. Thank God, I managed to kick the habit, but I assure Members that it was not without great difficulty. I agree with most of the points that have been made in the course of this debate. The legislation is very important. There may be areas in which I am not in total agreement, but, like many Bills, it is a package.</P>
      <P>The health implications of addiction to tobacco are very serious, as is the expenditure on health. We are not just dealing with general medical services such as hospital services, community care services and outpatient clinics. There are also social implications arising from this addiction. Starting to smoke has much to do with peer pressure and when I was growing up, I craved the odd butt from my peers. Their response was &ldquo;a mhic, do not ever smoke, I would love to give them up but I cannot&rdquo;. This clearly indicates that smoking can be equally as addictive as some of the harder drugs. I worked in the health services for a long number of years and psychiatric services is an area where tobacco smoking is very prominent for obvious reasons. Psychiatric patients are very given to tobacco whether it be cigarettes, the pipe or snuff. People with serious respiratory or cardiac problems, or other conditions associated with the consumption of tobacco, still continue to smoke even when death is staring them in the face, such is the extent of their addiction. The addictive nature of tobacco is a proven fact.</P>
      <P>Much has been said about environmental tobacco smoke. Tobacco is a legal product and as such its sale and consumption should be governed by strict legislation, which I believe the Minister is trying to achieve in this Bill. With the benefit of the collective wisdom of all in this House, as well as retail newsagents, vending machine operators, vintners and all other concerned bodies, we can ensure that the legislation that emanates from the Oireachtas is reasonable, balanced and effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Advertising is something that I get very peeved about in regard to tobacco. Some years ago I was at a wedding in England and saw a television advertisement which portrayed a man in a trench coat, with a face as long as a wet Sunday, walking along a lonely strand. He turned his back, a puff of smoke became visible and a voice said that one is never alone with a certain product, the name of which was mentioned. More recently there was an advertisement that said, happiness is a cigar called a particular name which we all know. This is totally misleading information. It is amusing in some way but to young ingenuous individuals, it can make an impression and acts as the kind of enticement we have heard of in the course of the debate so far. Advertising seeks to glamorise the smoking of tobacco. The consumption of tobacco <Col N="774" /> is socially acceptable but if I smoke, why should everyone around me smoke? We have to deal with the concept of environmental tobacco smoke. I am sure everybody in the House appreciates the measures being taken by the Vintners' Federation of Ireland. It is making a fair stab at doing something about the problem.</P>
    <P>I got a letter from our good friend in County Clare, Dr. Fenton Howell, who made a valuable point in the context of a person's age. Publicans have the same problem and I believe the slogan behind many bars should be equally displayed for the benefit of potential underage tobacco purchasers. The onus of proving that one is over 18 years should be on them. Identity cards are very important because at the last local elections I knocked on a door and asked a young lady if I could speak to her parents. She asked me if I did not want her vote, which made me look at her again. I believed her to be about 14 years of age but she was in her 20s. Last year I was at her wedding as she was the fiancée of a very good friend of mine. That is an indication as to how a retailer can be fooled. There must be some protection for vendors. This is all about fair play and the Constitution states that we cherish all the children of the nation equally. Therefore, we must make it reasonable that if I am a vendor of tobacco products and I refuse somebody, there must be some basis for refusing him or her.</P>
    <P>Under age smoking is a huge problem, especially among young women. We are the best country in the world at enacting legislation but we do not enforce it. I welcome this Bill and believe it has great merit. It is deserving of support. I agree with colleagues on both sides of the House who made the point that certain areas still remain to be dealt with and hopefully that will be done as we proceed through the various Stages. As Senator Bohan and Senator Norris said, it is much better that, if tobacco is a legal product, tobacco products are sold by reputable retailers, whether they are vending machine operators or newsagents. I do not want to see them being sold on the streets. There should be a mandatory fine for anyone caught selling them there. They should not be doing it.</P>
    <P>The nature of tobacco has been established and we have all heard the opinions of Dr. Fenton Howell and many of his ilk. If we are serious about the control of tobacco, we must enshrine that control in legislation and, having enacted law, we have to enforce it. I thank the Minister of State for attending and wish her well on the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. Like other speakers, I did not intend to speak on this issue, but find it very interesting and can see it from both sides as I smoked extensively for many years. I smoked anything up to 60 or 70 cigarettes a day. For the last ten or 12 years I have put them aside and can vouch for the fact <Col N="775" /> that giving them up is not the easiest thing in the world to do. Cigarettes, as everybody knows, are very addictive and it is a very difficult task to quit. I welcome some aspects of the Bill, but there are others with which I do not fully agree.</P>
      <P>As the law stands, the health boards are the enforcing authorities with regard to smoking in prohibited areas. Under the Bill, enforcement officers will be employed by the tobacco council, rather than by the health boards. We have the ludicrous state of affairs whereby a small restaurant of 30 seats must reserve half of them for non-smokers, while a public house can serve food with no restrictions. The Bill should provide incentives to stop smoking. There should be a lower VAT rate in a totally non-smoking pub or restaurant. People would make up their own minds about going to a smoking or a non-smoking premises and there would not be the great ambiguity in the law which the Bill is not addressing. While restaurants of all sizes must provide half their space for non-smokers, public houses, big and small, are not so restricted and there is no incentive for anyone to go to any particular place. The Government has missed a great opportunity in the Bill to put incentives in place for the person to choose if he or she wants to patronise a non-smoking establishment. The Government is putting laws in place to drive people's smoking addiction under the carpet. It seeks to have cigarettes hidden under counters, have people prosecuted for selling to under age smokers and for advertising that they have them. In most European countries, tobacco can only be sold under licence. We should also have a licensing system.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides for the establishment of a commission with 11 members and a chairman which will, in turn, establish a tobacco free council made up of a further 24 members, of whom the Minister will appoint 12. That is a merry-go-round allowing the Government to make appointments to boards in the run-up to a general election.</P>
      <P>RGDATA has sent a circular to every Senator &ndash; and I presume to every Deputy &ndash; setting out its recommendations for how businesses should operate when the Bill is passed. One would have to have some sympathy for the businesses concerned. It is ludicrous for the Minister to make the staff of shops bend down under a counter to get cigarettes to sell to old age pensioners or those on crutches. That is the reality of what the Bill proposes.</P>
      <P>The Minister has made a grave mistake in not offering incentives to any member of the public to quit smoking. It is a hard-line Bill which is being driven from the wrong end. The Minister is trying to prohibit the sale of tobacco, rather than encourage people to give it up.</P>

      <P>I would not be able to match the achievement of Senator Bohan in <Col N="776" /> smoking 60 Sweet Afton every day, but confess that at the age of ten I invested my life savings of one penny in two Woodbines. I can still remember furtively smoking them down the gas house lane in Cashel and it cured me for all time. Apart from being violently sick after smoking the two Woodbines, I also had a guilt complex and had to try to get rid of the smell from my fingers before I went home.</P>
      <P>This is an important Bill. I do not accept Senator Quinn's statement that it is not landmark legislation. Any Bill which deals with specifics and provides for penalties where 30% of the population are severely addicted to tobacco products is landmark legislation. It is very difficult legislation in its own right. Success for it means reducing the number of smokers, not lowering the number of cigarettes being sold in specific circumstances. We have to look at the matter in that context. I suggest that what is important is to be able to wed it to our vision of eliminating smoking entirely.</P>
      <P>At its very best, smoking is anti-social and, at its very worst, lethal. There is no longer any question of this given the medical evidence and nobody would argue against it anymore. It is important when we debate the matter here that we realise the difficulties of those addicted to tobacco products. Those addicted to tobacco products have, and will have in the future, an increasingly hostile response to their habit. However, we must start by saying that there but for the grace of God go I or, in my case, but for the grace of the two Woodbines. It is true that anybody who is addicted certainly feels they are being insulated, that they are being helped and that there is sympathy for their situation.</P>
      <P>Young people have a particular regard for the body culture that prevails today. Everything that is sold seems to be directed at young people, telling them how they can lose weight, have a better hair style, and how cosmetics will help them. We have to ask ourselves why, in spite of this body culture, young people, particularly young women, are still prepared to smoke. I have often made a point of counting the number of young people who smoke in any group that I see in public. Invariably, there are as many as three young girls smoking and this is in spite of the body culture. Perhaps we need to undertake a supplementary examination to ask why this happens in spite of the health hazards, indeed in spite of the aesthetic aspect of smoking. People are aware that it ruins their complexion, their teeth and will give them bad breath.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These may seem like small things, but we must ask why young people are still prepared to smoke. There are a number of obvious reasons, but one that I think particularly important is the use of the cigarette as a crutch in social situations. In old times, many film actors did not know what to do with their hands and invariably the cigarette was the answer. I believe that there is an element <Col N="777" /> of that psychology among young people today, arising from difficulty in communicating and shyness; I have watched their body language when they are smoking. This aspect of smoking among young people should be considered. Peer pressure is an obvious cause, but I do not believe that the pressure of advertising is a strong force any more. Restrictions on advertising have meant that the Marlboro image has died a death, as has the suggestion that you must smoke in order to be more masculine or feminine. However, new reasons for young people to take up smoking have come into existence and I think that it behoves us all to find out what the reasons are. Perhaps the Department of Health and Children has already done this. If we can identify these reasons, can we not also provide help? </P>
    <P>The letter from Tom Burke in Corofin, on behalf of the Federation of Retail Newsagents, has been referred to by many Members during this debate. Mr. Burke made it clear that the federation supports the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, in his endeavours to reduce the incidence of smoking, or to eliminate it altogether. The difficulty is that, while it is legal to smoke and 30% of the adult population continue to do so, endeavours to restrict smoking will be met with hostility.</P>
    <P>Ten or 12 years ago, before Irish people had a hostile attitude to smoking, I was on a bus in America with a friend who took out a packet of cigarettes and asked the woman sitting behind him if she objected to him smoking. She said that she did object, and asked him to put his cigarettes away. Such an assertive attitude has reduced by 13% over the past few years the number of Irish adults who smoke. However, I do not believe that the assertive attitude of non-smokers like myself will have the same rate of success with the remaining 30% of adult smokers.</P>
    <P>The voluntary groups who are attempting to control smoking should have their efforts acknowledged and be provided with adequate resources to achieve their aims. They have an important role to play in eliminating smoking. We have already mentioned areas such as the sponsorship of events by tobacco companies and I believe such sponsorship should be removed entirely. However, the Government must help. Those bodies who depend on sponsorship should be rewarded for displaying an anti-smoking slogan, making it clear that sport and health are linked. Like the retailers, sporting bodies should be given breathing space. It is vital that we work in partnership with them to eliminate smoking. If we do not do this, there is the possibility that smoking and the sale of cigarettes will eventually go underground.</P>
    <P>No one can make an argument in favour of smoking. We can empathise with those people who find themselves in that position. Anybody who has pushed cigarettes on young people has done them a terrible injustice; they have not <Col N="778" /> given them the opportunity to develop and make up their own minds. Similarly, we have a lot to answer for regarding alcohol and the way in which we have been jocose about it and its effects. We have tried to justify it and make light of it. There is no fun in watching a young wino lying on the street with their life destroyed by alcohol. Nor is there any fun in watching an elderly person lying in a hospital bed, no longer able to breathe, or hard-earned money being spent on alcohol and cigarettes when it is needed by families.</P>
    <P>We need to have a partnership between the legislation and our desire to help people who are addicted to tobacco products. The next phase of this legislation must allow for an interaction between us all, be it the retailers or those who are involved in anti-smoking organisations, to eliminate smoking from all aspects of life. At its best, smoking is anti-social, at its worst, it is lethal. Let us help everybody to get the best results.</P>

      <P>An example of what can be done when people make an effort was evident last Monday, 4 March, with the restrictions on the use of plastic bags. I am involved in a business that supplied plastic bags to customers and no plastic bag has been given out since last Monday. The initiative to restrict the use of such bags is working. I congratulate those involved in this initiative on its success. People are readily admitting that they can quite easily get by without the bags, and that they understand the harm that plastic causes to the environment. The public promotions of this initiative worked well and it proves that we can change things.</P>
      <P>I never smoked cigarettes, but I love a cigar. I am a person who loves going to public houses, even though I never drank &ndash; I cannot be a Pioneer, because I have sold alcohol. I was in the pub business and I can understand that cigarettes constitute big business for publicans. Smoking is part of our culture, whether we like it or not. How do we eliminate it?</P>
      <P>I have been to many other countries where one cannot obtain cigarettes wherever one likes. One must go to certain places to get them. I recall being on holidays once and getting an urge for a cigar. I had to walk about two miles to get it and by the time I got there I had lost the urge.</P>
      <P>I smoke an occasional cigar and can understand the attraction of smoking. I know of people who are long gone because of cigarettes. While the Bill tackles the problem it does not really get on top of it. We do not want a situation where people are going down back lanes to get cigarettes. We must ensure that if people are to obtain them they are well legislated for. In other countries cigarettes can be obtained only in tobacco shops. All types of tobacco are sold in these shops but nothing else. Cigarettes cannot be obtained in supermarkets, newsagents or pubs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="779" />Small business is vital to this country, and we do not want to create a &ldquo;them and us&rdquo; situation. RGDATA has made proposals with which I have to agree. There is no reason the Minister of the relevant Department should not speak with RGDATA to seek compromise and see if certain places in certain areas can be licensed to sell cigarettes. We should make no apologies for telling people that if they want cigarettes they have to go to these designated places.</P>
    <P>In America smoking is a sin. A friend of mine has lived in San Francisco for the past 40 years and cannot come home because he has a bad chest. He loves his cigarette but has to go outside his factory workplace to smoke it. Employees inside that factory can be on drugs or anything else but he has to leave to have a cigarette. It is as serious as that. I could not believe it.</P>
    <P>I can see now in my own country, however, people feeling chesty when they sit down in a pub. Air conditioning in pubs is very important, but we should be careful we do not kill the character of our pub culture. Pubs are big business and are very important to this economy. Tourism is our second biggest industry and it is vital we do not lose that. I am not making a case for cigarettes, but if people smoke in particular pubs we should give incentives to non-smoking pubs. Credit should be given back to people whereby they can go to certain places and it does not cost them as much. It would cost the State but there would be savings in terms of hospital beds.</P>
    <P>It has to be one way or the other, and as legislators we should take the lead on this issue. We have done so on plastic bags, and this has proven itself already. This policy is really working and will work to our benefit as a people. We should do the very same with cigarettes and smoking generally.</P>
    <P>I was in the Glen Hall in Cork last Sunday night, sitting in a group of 13 or 14 people. Seven of them, elderly men and women, were smoking whether I liked it or not and I was smoking my cigar. I make no bones about it and will not make any excuses. There were four ashtrays. My wife has a bad chest and does not like people smoking, which I understand. We should be able to get around this situation. The Glen Hall should be able to provide incentives so that there would be an extra cost for smoking areas. It is like charging people more instead of putting them into prison.</P>
    <P>The Minister should have more discussions with RGDATA. We do not want to knock small businesses which are the backbone of our society. Let us not give the impression that they are disowned because they are selling cigarettes. They should be asked if they want a licence and then be made responsible.</P>
    <P>Every incentive possible should be given to young people. It is a shame to drive through any town, as Senator Ó Murchú said, and see young girls, in particular, with cigarettes because they <Col N="780" /> want to look good. Under no circumstances should they be able to obtain cigarettes so easily.</P>
    <P>Every promotion possible should be undertaken. We will save on health costs. In the long term it is a massive investment for the good of our country. We should show on television the dangers of smoking. Just look at the drink driving campaign and the advertisement in which a young man gets into his car after two or three pints and kills a child in a garden. This strategy works. I turn to another channel when I see this image now, such is its impact. Lots of people have learnt from it, and we should do the same with cigarettes. We should show what they do to the heart, to the valves, to the lungs and so on. We should get our consultants involved in promotions to make young people aware.</P>
    <P>Young people are very bright and do listen. They are the best in Europe. We should tell them we do not want them smoking and give the reasons why. It is the same with drink, as Senator Ó Murchú again said. I am very disturbed, as a former publican, with the drink culture today. Drink and cigarettes go together. There is a macho ethic. The way some publicans are giving out drink is something else. They are licensees and have responsibilities.</P>
    <P>We have a duty to our young people to get the best people involved. Small shopkeepers in towns, streets and villages are our watchdogs, just like our post offices. Give them a licence and leave it to them. If they fail then they should have their licences removed. I would not include in the Bill the provision that there should be no recommendations to the courts. The Bill is not providing for courts or judges. That is a little bit tough. Perhaps after a certain period, the first three years, there should be courts. I would have no problem with that, but let us not be too strict. On trying to get something moving we should have small businesses with us rather than against us. Everybody who can help should be asked, organised and given incentives. Give an incentive to people and they will respond.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened attentively to many excellent contributions from Senators with vast experience in dealing with the problem before us. I welcome the Minister to the House. The Bill is an effort to ensure that something is done about tobacco smoking.</P>
      <P>I regularly frequent public places and we all have the experience of very poor ventilation in smaller pubs in particular. The health boards should have a watchdog role. There should be a minimum standard of extraction in all places where alcohol is consumed. The character of socialising in Ireland should not be interfered with, but at the same time, smoke should be extracted to the extent that one cannot smell it from clothes after being in a premises for five minutes. One can imagine the damage such smoke does to the innocent third party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I happen to know some colleagues in a cancer laboratory in New York, one of the most <Col N="781" /> advanced in the world. They tell me of the potential impact of showing images of the effects of smoking in our schools or on our television screens, of showing, for example, the contrasting images of the lung of a smoker with that of a non-smoker. A personal friend of mine, Eddie Shaw, was responsible for that commercial mentioned by Senator Cregan where as a result of the man having one or two drinks too many the young boy was killed by the car coming through the hedge. It horrified most motorists. It really made us ask whether we need to pass out cars and drive at such speed. As an advertisement, it worked extremely well. At the end of the day it all comes down to education, the field from which the Minister of State, who is held in the highest esteem and greatly respected, comes. She will go far and I wish her well.</P>
    <P>This is mould breaking legislation. We were always taught &ndash; Senator Moylan would know this having been involved with many all-Ireland winning teams &ndash; that the greatest gift one can give one's body is to keep it fit. Certainly, it defies logic to harm it, whether through drink or smoking to excess. As someone who was often extremely fit for many years and then finished up in intensive care and down to nine stone because of excessive smoking many years ago, I can certainly tell the House how smoking affects one's quality of life. I went from being one of the fittest for my age to not being able to walk up stairs and the contrast in my quality of life was stark.</P>
    <P>Having come through those difficulties, I acknowledge the efforts being made. I appreciate the great care and attention put into bringing the Bill to the House for our consideration. I welcome the part of it which provides for much tighter control on all aspects of tobacco retailing, including vending machines which will have to be located beside, on or behind the bar counter under the direct supervision of staff. Regulations will provide that they which will have a locking device and be activated for sale by a unique coin or token available only from staff on the premises. The need for much tighter controls has been made clear to the cigarette machine operators. This is a step in the right direction which is putting the responsibility for the running and supervision of vending machines on the person in charge of the premises. It is also assisting them to control the sale of tobacco.</P>
    <P>There are many points I wanted to make which were made by other speakers. I fully support any measure which will help young people, discourage them from smoking and encourage them to lead a sporting lifestyle which leads to a quality of life in total contrast with that of smokers.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a gabháil leis the Seanadóirí as ucht an méid a dúirt siad anseo anocht. There seems to be a general acceptance that we need to be tough <Col N="782" /> on tobacco in the interests of the health of our society, both young and old.</P>
      <P>I particularly commend the many Senators who confessed to being smokers, either in their early youth or even today. Unfortunately, I am not in a position to grant absolution, but hope the introduction of the measures in the Bill will lead us to a tobacco free society which obviously has to be done in a wider context. It is not just a matter of legislation. What we are proposing takes on board many of the best reports from the Joint Committee on Health and Children, the cardiovascular health strategy and the Government's policy in recent months.</P>
      <P>I accept what Senators said, that it will also take a change of attitude and more than legislation to have this implemented. However, the elements set out in the Bill are crucially important. There is an element of the carrot and stick approach in all our work. On the one hand, we must encourage and, on the other, make sure that penalties are in place for those abusing the situation with our young people, where they are trying to get them addicted.</P>
      <P>The Minister has been strongly promoting the Bill since he introduced it. It marks a major step forward. When I spoke at the WHO conference on tobacco in Warsaw a couple of weeks ago I found that they were hugely impressed with the measures we were trying to introduce here. We can show the way to the rest of the world, not only on smoking but also on passive smoking, which will be of benefit to everybody.</P>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a gabháil leis the Seanadóirí as ucht an méid a dúirt siad. From the points raised, I know there will be amendments of interest to Senators which I will be happy to discuss with the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for giving me the opportunity to place on the record of the Seanad the great concern of the people of counties Cavan, Westmeath, Meath and Longford where Lough Sheelin has played a pivotal role for generations. As one of their Oireachtas representatives, I wish to raise the great concern of the people of this area in the House tonight. I thank the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources for coming to listen to the concerns which I will highlight for him and for the opportunity to listen attentively to his reply. I hope he <Col N="783" /> will present a long-term plan for Lough Sheelin under the auspices of the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board.</P>
      <P>Lough Sheelin has been one of the great assets in our area for many years. The first objective for the people in the area of the lough is to stop the culling of all fish, including trout, which are also killed in nets as this interferes with the natural ecological balance of the fishery. Our second objective is to extend the pike fishing season to the whole year as Lough Sheelin is the only lake in Ireland which has a totally closed season, making it viable for tourists for only seven months in the year as opposed to 12 months on Lough Corrib, Lough Mask, Lough Owel and Lough Ennel, the other designated trout fishing lakes. This would better serve the local business community and bring much needed revenue to Lough Sheelin.</P>
      <P>Anyone who knows Lough Sheelin can only sympathise with those who invested hard-earned savings in building guest houses only to find that the season is so short. The Sheelin Shamrock, a hotel on the shore of the lake, had to close because of the deterioration in the lake over the years, mainly due to pollution from outside sources. The Minister's predecessor, former Deputy John Wilson, made great attempts to remove the dreaded pollution which had been created by third parties, whose identities were widely known in the area. The closure of five guest houses in the area has been attributed to the lack of fish stocks in the lake. I call on the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board to reassure the people of the entire midlands and the fishing community throughout Europe, who have visited our area for many years.</P>
      <P>We are led to believe that the Inny system is to be made a licensed fishery. This would further discourage tourists from coming to the area and would mean that Finea and the parish of Castlepollard, where I reside, would be the only areas of Ireland with no free fishing at all. This would stop local tourists and day trippers from coming to our area for the pleasant sport of fishing. The Minister's constituency colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, has visited our area, which is included in the CLÁR programme as one of three or four areas with the greatest decline in population. Four townlands adjacent to the village of Finea have endured population declines of almost 100%.</P>
      <P>These are the concerns I bring to the House and I look forward to the Minister's response. As one who seeks a Dáil seat in County Westmeath, I speak on behalf of the deprived area in the north of that county. The people of the area do not receive their fair share and I speak for them because, in the words of Patrick Farrell, &ldquo;Where is the one who does not love the land where he was born?&rdquo;  It is for that reason that I highlight their problems in the House and I hope, with their support, to continue to do so in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Cassidy for giving me the opportunity to respond to this very important question.</P>
      <P>A number of large lakes situated in the north west, west, south west and midland areas constitute a unique ecological resource. They are the only lakes of their kind in the world, with the exception of Lough Leven in Scotland, which have an indigenous fish fauna dominated by the salmonoid species brown tout and, in some cases, shared with Atlantic salmon.</P>
      <P>A large number of scientific studies carried out by the Central Fisheries Board staff and other independent scientists have shown that the board's policy of culling pike, a non-indigenous piscivore, to optimise production of our native fish is fully justified. The maintenance of large native stocks of trout as a consequence, apart from being an integral part of Ireland's natural history, has provided high quality salmonoid angling for anglers and led to the development of a major tourist angling industry based around these waters. The fisheries boards have actively promoted measures to foster growth of wild brown trout stocks. These have included, for example, water quality programmes, baseline riverine surveys, river and stream development and enhancement, stock management and education and consultation.</P>
      <P>The Shannon Regional Fisheries Board informs me that it owns the fishing rights on Lough Sheelin. Both pike and trout angling are allowed during the open season between 1 March and 12 October each year. It is the board's policy not to allow fishing during the closed season from 13 October to 28 February. The board states that this measure is necessary to ensure the survival of wild brown trout stocks in the fishery. I also take the opportunity to point out that section 18 of the Fisheries Act, 1980, empowers the Shannon board to take appropriate measures in relation to the improvement of fisheries within its remit.</P>
      <P>Lough Sheelin is one of the few wild brown trout fisheries still remaining in Ireland and it is the Shannon board's policy to ensure that all possible measures are taken to ensure that the lake remains as such. For over 20 years the board has fought against pollution on the lake and, unfortunately, this issue has not yet been resolved. The board, however, has managed to maintain a substantial stock of wild fish in the fishery during this period. In recent years, under the tourism angling measure, the board has spent over £500,000 &ndash;&euro;634,869 &ndash; rehabilitating the streams of Lough Sheelin to ensure that they can produce the optimum number of brown trout. Along with its activities to reduce pollution and maintain a healthy stock of juvenile fish in the streams, the board also undertakes other management practices on the scientific advice of the Central Fisheries Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These practices include the culling of pike which prey heavily on juvenile trout stocks. The <Col N="785" /> polluted conditions in the lake have resulted in an imbalance which requires large numbers of pike to be removed from the lake to enable the trout to survive. The removal of pike is traditionally undertaken using gill nets. However, in recent years, the board has introduced a new practice of electrofishing which allows the fish to be taken alive from the water and transferred to other suitable fisheries.</P>
    <P>The board has also introduced a policy of removing as many pike alive as possible from the gill nets and, at present, is moving alive to other waters between 30% and 40% of all pike caught. The board informs me that, in 2001, only 20 to 30 trout were caught in nets. The board is satisfied with the scientific advice received on this issue and on a yearly basis commissions the Central Fisheries Board to undertake stock assessments to review the progress of trout stocks and management practices.</P>
    <P>The board regards the maintenance of Lough Sheelin as a wild brown trout fishery as vitally important. The Shannon region has over a thousand waters and only on five is predator control practised in order to develop and protect brown trout. In most other fisheries pike stocks are present and good fishing is available. I am satisfied that the measures adopted by the board will ensure that our wild brown trout stocks in Lough Sheelin will continue to be enjoyed by future generations.</P>

Is fíor a rá go bhfuil athbheochain na teanga á cur chun cinn sna scoileanna seo. Tá an scéal amhlaidh i Muileann Cearr agus tá súil agam go mbeidh an t-Aire agus an Roinn Oideachais agus Eolaíochta ábalta teacht i gcabhair ar Ghaelscoil an Mhuilinn. Tá sár-obair ar siúl ann agus táimíd go léir an-mhóralach as.</P>
      <P>Gaelscoil an Mhuilinn, Mullingar was established in 1994 with just 24 pupils. It was housed in a shop which had living accommodation. Eight years later there are 232 pupils and 11 teachers, but the accommodation has not grown. The number of pupils has increased almost tenfold, but there is no playing field, hall, storage areas, principal's or secretary's office or remedial room. The schoolyard is small and pupils have to be let out to play in relays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also a huge problem with parking. Gaelscoil an Mhuilinn is located on the Ballymahon road, which continues from Ballymahon to Roscommon and Athlone. It is a busy road, even <Col N="786" /> if it is just a regional road. The school is located between two housing estates, Oaklawns and Woodlands. Given the lack of facilities in the school, especially with regard to playing facilities, this is causing difficulty for local residents.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to have been involved in the decision by Westmeath County Council to dispose of a plot of land for the construction of a school at Ashe Road, Mullingar. There is full planning permission for Gaelscoil an Mhuilinn on this site. It is waiting to go to tender if the necessary finance is made available. I would be grateful if the Minister would, through his good offices, ask the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, to provide it.</P>
    <P>I mentioned athbheochán na teanga. There is a renaissance in the language, thank goodness. It is our native tongue. I am proud, as a Westmeath man and somebody with an abiding interest in the promotion of the teanga dúchais, that Gaelscoil an Mhuilinn has grown. Unfortunately, however, the accommodation and facilities have not grown in tandem with the number of pupils.</P>
    <P>It is imperative that the construction of the school is expedited in the near future. Perhaps the Minister will convey my concern and that of the people whose children are attending the school that this project is given the go ahead as soon as possible.</P>

Mullingar is the town where Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann was founded over 50 years ago. There is a marvellous revival of the language in the area, in regard to which we are seeking the full support of the Government. It was one of the main principles of the Fianna Fáil Party at its foundation in 1926.</P>
      <P>A special case can be made for the gaelscoil in Mullingar. I lend my support, as Leader of Seanad Éireann, to Senator Glynn's request that this development take place. It is only 12 months before the number of pupils in the area for this school could possibly double.</P>
