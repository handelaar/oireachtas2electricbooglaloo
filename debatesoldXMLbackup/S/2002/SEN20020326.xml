      <P>The Order of Business is No. <i>a</i>1, on the Supplementary Order Paper, motion regarding the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse, to be taken without debate; No. 1, Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 2002 &ndash; Committee and Remaining Stages; No. 2, earlier signature motion on the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 2002, to be taken without debate at the conclusion of No. 1; No. 3, Road Traffic Bill, 2001 &ndash; Second Stage, with contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes, all other Senators not to exceed eight minutes and Senators may share time; No. 4, Communications Regulations Bill, 2002 &ndash; Committee and Remaining Stages, not before 2 p.m; No. 5, Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Bill, 2002 &ndash; all Stages, with contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes, all other Senators not to exceed eight minutes and Senators may share time; No. 6, earlier signature motion on the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Bill, 2002, to be taken without debate at the conclusion of No. 5: and No. 7, Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill, 2002 &ndash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage, with contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes, all other Senators not to exceed eight minutes and Senators may share time.</P>

      <P>We live in the real world and know that this is the last, or second last, week in the life of the Seanad. The Government clearly wants to clear the decks. The business for the next two days is heavy and six Bills are scheduled to go through all Stages. That is not the way to do business and we are falling down on the job if we allow that to happen. Last week there was a report on the future of the Seanad. If we become a rubber stamp for Government Bills, we will do great harm to our standing with the public. Will the Leader consider rescheduling some of the business for later in the week? If that means we must sit next week, so be it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1106" />I am concerned about one particular aspect of today's business, No. 7, Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill, 2002. All I know about the Bill is the Long Title which is on the Order Paper. The Bill will be welcomed by everybody in the House but it went into the pigeon holes only at 10.25 a.m. today. Normally, I would like the opportunity to discuss the Bill with the various disability organisations to get their expert view on it. Managing that today and coming to Second Stage this evening puts a constraint on all of us in getting a balanced and measured view of the Bill. I do not expect the Leader will change the Order of Business today, but it is important that we have as long a gap as possible between Second Stage and Committee Stage so that people can get their homework done on the Bill, which is an important Seanad Bill. Will the Leader consider that suggestion?</P>
    <P>Regarding No. <i>a</i>1, it is clear that an extension of the time remit available to this commission is being sought. The commission is two years in existence and it is tackling an important issue. The issue is even more important since the television programme last week and it would be helpful if we got some indication of what work has been done, the problems involved and why extra time is needed. It is asking a lot to have the terms of reference extended from two years, which have now passed, to five years without some case being made for it. I do not doubt the judge's bona fides or the importance of the work of the tribunal but as one of the Houses that established the tribunal, we should be given an interim report on why the time period needs to be extended in addition to a report on the work of the tribunal to date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with much that was said by Senator Manning. It is a typical end of term difficulty that we have run into congestion in some of these areas. I am not saying anything other than that I recognise there are difficulties.</P>
      <P>The House will recall that I wrote to every Member on the other side a year ago asking that we deal with No. 7. I am glad that it has been published as a Seanad Bill. However, I am not happy that we received it at 10.30 a.m. this morning and that it is to be discussed today. This issue is of huge significance and Members of the House will be expected to make cogent and important contributions to the debate. It was the subject of major discussion in the media and the last thing I want is a debate that is uninformed. It is difficult for Members to speak with comprehension on this difficult and complex legislation at such short notice. Some of us have been involved with the issue and can understand it, but it is asking a huge amount of Members. I would prefer if we dealt with these matters on a long-term basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remind the Leader of commitments he made last week on two issues. He said there would be a discussion on the proposal from the all-party constitutional group from which the Independent Senators were excluded. We would like to have <Col N="1107" />some input into that, if possible. As the only people in the Oireachtas who represent emigrant voters or voters who live abroad, we note with regret and resent the fact that there is a proposal, which was not discussed with us, not to include emigrant votes or an emigrant constituency in the Seanad elections despite the fact that this has been discussed before in the House. This is an example of why we need to discuss this matter. We have not had any input into it and although we may agree with many of the recommendations individually, that is one about which Members on this side of the House have reservations.</P>
    <P>I asked last week that as soon as the report from the Attorney General on Campus Stadium Ireland is available, it should be discussed in the House. Whatever the pressure of business, the Seanad must be seen to be relevant and to discuss matters that are of relevance to the issues of the day. I ask that the Leader make time available for this debate.</P>
    <P>I do not know why but whenever the political focus turns to operations that are run by Kerry people like Hugh O'Flaherty or Paddy Teahon, the tenets of natural justice seem to go out the window and people rush to judgment on them. I would like a discussion where we can debate the issues and if someone from Kerry is at fault, let them pay the price. However, it is appalling that their reputations are being scalped in the media without clear allegations being made or conclusions reached. I will not go into the issues involved, but I and other Members would like to go on record&mdash;</P>

      <P>This matter is on the Order Paper under No. 11.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I know. It is important that the Leader meets the commitment he made last week and that we have an opportunity to discuss this matter and put forward our views on it because it is of huge national importance. It is not without relevance that No. 7 on the Order Paper, which relates to education for people with disabilities, also refers to the question of people with disabilities participating fully in the light of the proposal to host the Special Olympics in Ireland next year. I intend to use today's Order Paper to make reference to some of these issues. I ask the Leader to take those matters on board and to respond to the request to have a discussion on Campus Stadium Ireland and the Attorney General's report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Leader of the House could let us know when we will deal with No. 11 &ndash; statements on Campus Ireland. We might add an amendment to the Order of Business to examine any possible discrimination against Kerry people. As previous speakers indicated, today's Order Paper is certainly overloaded. We are dealing with five substantial items, four of which involve all Stages and the fifth which involves <Col N="1108" />Second Stage. I am not sure what the Leader intends for tomorrow but we will probably be taking the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill. That represents a very short space of time in which to have an opportunity to reflect upon the legislation.</P>
      <P>I am delighted that, for the first time in legislation, the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill contains a formal assertion of rights. People with disabilities have been seeking legislation that would reflect the same right&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The content of the Bill can be discussed on Second Stage. It is not in order to do so on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;to benefit from education as their peers. I welcome the fact that we will soon have a Bill of that nature before us. We need a greater opportunity to examine it in detail, however, and to consult on it. I do not know if we will have an opportunity to discuss the stories in today's media concerning the report on higher education that was conducted by Professor Patrick Clancy. This academic has done sterling work over a number of years in producing regular reports on third level access. Will the Leader provide such a debate? Perhaps he could get the Minister for Education and Science to agree that when we take the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill there will be an opportunity to hear statements on third level access.</P>
      <P>It is disgraceful to have such inequality of access to third level education. For example, in Foxrock, there is a 77.1% rate of access to third level education, whereas in the inner city area I represent the corresponding rate is only 8.9%. The rate of access for County Dublin is the second lowest of all 26 counties. Those inequalities demonstrate that there is a two-tier society when it comes to educational access, yet it is claimed that Ireland is one of the best educated countries in Europe. Young people here do not have equal opportunities.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator has made the case for a debate on that report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>We should not go to the teachers' conferences, and the Houses of the Oireachtas should not go into recess, without first discussing this scandal. The Leader should either arrange such a debate or get the Minister to agree that when taking the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill there is an opportunity for statements on access to education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to add my voice to the concerns expressed by Senators O'Toole, Manning and Costello regarding the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill. Traditionally, this House has always ensured that vocational interests are represented and that various groups representing the disabled can seek nominations for the Seanad. That concern should be reflected in such <Col N="1109" />a manner that would allow full discussion of this issue. The Government has already done a U-turn on the Disability Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>My concern is that the time between Second Stage and Committee Stage should be extended. The Opposition has offered the Leader an opportunity to discuss this matter by sitting next week, if he so wishes. It is vital that the matter receive full and frank discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader indicate whether he will be able to provide some time for a discussion on foreign affairs? This is one of the most important aspects of the work of the House and Members may wish to raise many issues in this regard. One issue in particular that should be raised urgently is our relationship with Uganda in light of the murder of Fr. Declan O'Toole. One of his colleagues in the same order said on radio today the two people directly involved in the murder should not be held responsible, but rather the Ugandan army. We are aware of massive corruption in Uganda, the pillaging of the Democratic Republic of Congo and the involvement in corruption of members of the family of President Museveni.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot have a debate on foreign affairs on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Announcements were made this week about overseas development aid. We know that massive amounts of that money are being subverted into corruption. I would like an opportunity to discuss whether we are helping to finance corrupt regimes involved in this type of activity, the murder of priests, the violation of neighbouring countries and the exploitation of their natural resources.</P>
      <P>I join my colleagues in expressing concern about the way the business of the House is being managed. I do not blame the Leader entirely, but all parties should get together to try to negotiate with the Civil Service in the different Departments to try to find out the reason this perpetually happens. It is not good for the democratic passage of legislation through the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>When we hear a vast amount of money is being spent by this country on overseas development aid and that this will corrupt governments we must address this problem because it is not one of Ireland Aid sending money to corrupt governments. The agency is doing an excellent job and the review group report will be delivered tomorrow. Anyone, such as Senator Norris, who has travelled to the priority countries will know that we are not sending money to corrupt governments. We are trying <Col N="1110" />to aid and assist the poorest of the poor in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The money should go to non-governmental organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>They are doing a good job. Ireland Aid, Ireland's review group and those involved in the countries in question are doing an excellent job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The government and civil servants in Uganda are corrupt. There will be evidence to that effect in the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; this morning and heard the priest to whom Senator Norris referred. When it came to the sports slot, we had a blast of egoism from Des Cahill. The sporting public would prefer to hear sports news instead of what shares that man has in Manchester United. Perhaps a debate on sports coverage by RTÉ and the organisation in general would be appropriate, although I suppose it would be impossible to hold it at this stage. Early June might be appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators Manning, O'Toole and Coogan expressed their views on No. 7, Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill, 2002, which is long awaited legislation. I am pleased it is being initiated in the Seanad. Of the more than 400 Bills processed by the Seanad and the 61 initiated here in the past five years, this is one of the most important. I know from the great concern of Senators over the five years that it has been long awaited. I am pleased it will come before the House before the general election.</P>
      <P>I thank the leaders of the groups in the House, Senators Manning, O'Toole and Costello, and the Deputy Leader, Senator Dardis, for their co-operation and understanding in the great amount of business before the House this week. It is the end of term and we have a Whips' meeting scheduled for 11 a.m. tomorrow to assess progress and see how we will schedule the remainder of business. If needs be, I do not have any difficulty with sitting next week.</P>
      <P>On No. <i>a</i>1, I agree with Senator Manning that a short report should be published on the extension of time sought on this matter. Senator O'Toole called for a debate on the report of the all-party review committee on the Constitution, which was published last week. I do not recall anybody other than myself mentioning this on the Order of Business last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not hear the Senator on that occasion. I will have no difficulty in having this matter discussed. Perhaps it would be a fitting way for the Seanad to conclude its business before the general election by allowing an opportunity for Senators to express their opinions on the matter, on which I also hold very strong <Col N="1111" />opinions. This would be particularly appropriate following a very productive session of the Seanad which has really excelled itself in processing legislation.</P>
      <P>Senators O'Toole and Costello called for an allocation of time to discuss the Campus and Stadium Ireland report and that of the Attorney General which is due to be discussed by the Cabinet today, particularly in view of the timeframe regarding the requirements for the Special Olympics. I gave a commitment last week on the Order of Business that I will forgo Fianna Fáil Private Members' time tomorrow night to provide time for a debate on the matter. In a radio interview which I heard this morning there was much food for thought in many of the points dealt with. I am convinced the taxpayer is getting value for money in what is being proposed.</P>
      <P>Senators Norris and Lanigan called for a debate on foreign affairs. We were all appalled by the murder of Fr. Declan O'Toole of the Mill Hill Missionaries in Uganda last week. This is not the first time we have experienced such tragedies, including my very good friend, the late Fr. Larry Timmons from Delvin. There are far too many such incidents. I will see if time can be provided for a debate, even if it is only 45 or 50 minutes. I will discuss this at my meeting with the party leaders in the House tomorrow morning.</P>

      <P>I know the Minister does. I am sure I was most adequately represented. This is real end of term stuff.</P>
      <P>I am aware, as I am sure the Minister is, of the latest report showing the gap between rich and poor in Ireland to be the largest in Europe. &ldquo;Inclusion&rdquo; is a word now often bandied about. I do not know who is being included, but I certainly know who has been excluded as most of them are my constituents.</P>
      <P>This morning we were talking about access to third level institutions and the lack of educational attainment. Clondalkin and Ballymun are the two places with the least number of young people going on to further education. During discussion of the amendments today we can refer to the reason that may be the case. With regard to the people I represent, it would be unfair not to admit that there has been an increase, but as recently as six years ago the number of people in my area in third level education out of a large estate of 3,600 houses was three. Happily the position has improved, but there is a visible lack of inclusion that hits one on entering secondary schools in the area. Although there is a new feeling of hope, many, unfortunately, have dropped out along the way. We should be wary about using the word &ldquo;inclusion&rdquo; because it has not seemed to work in my area. For that reason I want to press my amendment.</P>

      <P>We have come from a position where we were below the EU average in regard to income adequacy to one where we are now ahead of it. In regard to relative income or pov<Col N="1113" />erty generally, I have often quoted the figure that 400,000 people who were on social welfare are now working. There has, therefore, been a dramatic change in the circumstances of these people and their families.</P>
      <P>If one looks at the agreed figures, one will see that consistent poverty has fallen dramatically over the last number of years, from 10% in 1997 to 6% in 2000, and is dropping further by all accounts. Similarly, consistent poverty among children fell from 17% in 1997 to somewhere in the region of 8% in 2000 and is falling even further. In the ambitious commitments made by the Government regarding the revised national anti-poverty strategy, we say we will achieve a rate of &euro;150 per week, in 2002 terms, in the lowest social welfare rates, to be met by 2007. We have made dramatic commitments in relation to the equivalent level of basic child income.</P>
      <P>Our record over the lifetime of the Government is there for all to see. The dramatic increases in social welfare have been the greatest in the history of the State in each year that I have been Minister and that is acknowledged by everybody. In all the propaganda put out by Senator Ridge's party in recent weeks, the issue of social welfare is not mentioned and that is a very telling point. Even the Senator will admit that the level of increases in social welfare over the past five years has taken the Opposition's breath away. It has a very difficult job in criticising the record of the Government in this respect.</P>

      <P>Senator Ridge will be aware that the increases in child benefit are threefold, from £30 to &euro;117.60 in the lower rate and from £39 to &euro;147.30 in the higher rate. She will also be aware that the increases have been brought forward by a further two months this year to April, which will cost the Exchequer &euro;70 million extra. As the Minister indicated, the first pay day in May is the earliest day on which it is possible for the Department to pay the increased rates. The extra cost, in 2002 terms, of making the increases effective from the same dates as the social welfare increases would be &euro;103.5 million and the proposal would also cause serious administrative difficulties for the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1114" />The book-based payments system is the chosen payment option for the majority of pensioners and other long-term beneficiaries and also for the majority of families receiving child benefit. Almost 1 million recipients are paid by this method. It is less flexible than other payment methods and it requires longer lead times to implement the increases as changes cannot be made to order books while they are in the hands of recipients. The Minister is anxious to point out the renewal schedule for production of the different order books. The family income supplement &ndash; 11,500 books to be printed from 3 December to 14 December &ndash; was payable on 3 January. There were 280,000 books to be printed from 14 December to 15 January for lone parents and widows payments, payable on 14 February. There were 260,000 old-age pensions books to be printed from 25 January to 15 March and those benefits will be payable from 3 April. Child benefit books were to be printed between 15 March and 13 May and those payments will be made on 14 June, except this year.</P>
    <P>This is the fully crowded schedule into which the production of the single vouchers for the arrears in budget increases had to be squeezed and that was only possible, with significant overtime by departmental staff, on the following basis: pensions arrears from early January to 23 February, payable in mid-February &ndash; 260,000 single vouchers; and child benefit arrears from early March to 26 April, payable on 7 May &ndash; 380,000 single vouchers. Arrears for lone parents and widows were included in their new books from mid-February.</P>
    <P>An examination of how best to meet the shorter timeframes for all customers is being undertaken. This will involve working closely with the payment suppliers and security printers and examining how we can move forward quickly with regard to electronic payments. A number of issues need to be addressed in that regard.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 6, before section 3, to insert the following new section:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1115" />&ldquo;3.&ndash;The Minister shall as soon as may be after the passing of this Act prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the need to extend the free telephone allowance to elderly persons living in nursing homes, either for a fixed line or a mobile phone, particularly in cases where the allowance was previously obtained.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I feel strongly about this amendment. Elderly people and others who are obliged to live in nursing homes receive physical comfort and care but, to an extent, lose their identity as the people they were before they entered the nursing home. The person is now one of many rather than being their own boss in their own home. There can also be a lack of communication, especially for people from rural areas who are moved some distance from their families. Many of the elderly are not visited regularly even when they have family nearby. The amendment proposes a sensible and inexpensive way for these people to maintain contact with others. It is also a way of having the person's uniqueness confirmed rather than simply being one of a large group of residents.</P>
    <P>We all face this prospect. Although we would prefer to stay in our homes, some of us will probably have to go to nursing homes and I would like to think that the concept of cherishing all the children of the nation equally will still apply when we are at an advanced age. This is a humane, sensible and simple proposal which should be taken on board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>The telephone allowance is generally available to people living in the State aged 66 years or over who are in receipt of a social welfare payment or who meet the conditions of a means test. It is available to carers and people with disabilities under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain welfare payments. Widows and widowers aged from 60 to 65 years whose late spouses had been in receipt of a telephone allowance retain that entitlement to ensure their households do not suffer. In May 2001, the free schemes, including the telephone allowance, were extended to all persons over 70 years regardless of their income and household composition. There are currently 240,000 people in receipt of the telephone allowance.</P>
      <P>The original objective of the allowance was to provide an element of protection and security for older people and people with disabilities who were either living alone or with people who would be unable to summon help in an emergency. The secondary objective was to encourage social contact and to assist in the prevention of social isolation. While people in nursing homes and other residential institutions may meet the age requirement, they are not isolated to the same extent. They have daily support and contact with other residents and nursing staff. A number of them may also get other State support through the public health system or a nursing home subvention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1116" />In this context, the proposal to extend the telephone allowance to pensioners resident in a nursing home does not fit easily within the objectives of the scheme, which are to provide an element of personal security and to assist in the prevention of isolation for those living alone.</P>

      <P>In page 6, before section 3, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;3.&ndash;The Minister shall as soon as may be after the passing of this Act prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report in relation to increasing the weekly allowance to those seeking asylum in this country.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am most interested in the Minister of State's response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>The income maintenance needs of asylum seekers are met for the most part by the health boards through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, the main objective of which is to make up the difference between a person's means, whether in cash or in kind, and his or her needs. Where a person has access to some resources in kind or in cash through the social welfare system or otherwise, the relevant legislation requires that this be taken into account in determining entitlement to supplementary welfare allowance. This occurs in the case of asylum seekers who arrived since 10 April 2000. They are provided with full board accommodation, including all their meals and other services, under the system of direct provision operated by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. In such cases the recommended weekly allowance is &euro;19.10 per adult and &euro;9.60 per child to provide personal requisites. Furthermore, where there are other reasonable expenses, exceptional needs payments are made by the health boards.</P>
      <P>A small number of asylum seekers are in receipt of other social welfare payments such as one parent family payments, pensions and disability allowance. In addition, any asylum seeker with children is entitled to child benefit. The current monthly rates are &euro;85.71 for each of the first two children and &euro;109.20 for the third and subsequent children, which, as we have just discussed, will be increasing to &euro;117.60 and &euro;147.30 respectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The allowances and payments to asylum seekers in direct provision have not increased since the direct provision system was introduced in April 2000. The maximum personal rate of sup<Col N="1117" />plementary welfare allowance in April 2000 was £72 per week &ndash;&euro;91.42 &ndash; while the current maximum personal rate is &euro;118.80, a 30% increase.</P>
    <P>The Minister established a working group in April 2000 to examine the issues relating to assessment of need for supplementary welfare allowance purposes. Among the issues examined by the group are the existing arrangements for the payment of basic weekly supplementary welfare allowance to those who have means other than cash to partly meet their basic needs and the payment rate appropriate to asylum seekers in direct provision. To give a broad spread of expertise, the group comprises representatives from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and the Departments of Finance, Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Environment and Local Government as well as a representative appointed by the chief executive officers of the health boards.</P>
    <P>I understand the working group will finalise its report very shortly, following which the Minister will be in a position to consider its findings and recommendations and decide if it is appropriate to make changes in either the rates of payment to asylum seekers in direct provision or the manner in which these payments are made.</P>

      <P>(<i>b</i>)&nbsp;increased support for pensioners under the living alone allowance.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is an annual request. Despite the fact that the Minister has described the increases in social welfare payments in glowing terms and they are to be praised, one can never be entirely satisfied with them. There is always somebody somewhere losing out. It is from that point of view we are asking for a specific report.</P>
      <P>There are a large number of senior citizens who are entitled to more than one payment. We are particularly asking that consideration be given to those solely dependent on contributory or non-contributory pension and that there be increased support for pensioners under the living alone allowance. I hope these are very supportable requests. I am looking forward to a positive response in the matter.</P>

      <P>Before the last general election Fianna Fáil gave a commitment that it would <Col N="1118" />increase the old age pension to £100 per week. We surpassed even our own expectations in achieving that goal, as well as the expectations of the public and old age pensioners. If any report is needed, the reaction of the old age pensioners will bring itself to bear on it.</P>
      <P>It is not even necessary to compare what was done prior to 1997 to what has been done since then because we are surpassing our own expectations. In general, old age pensioners very much appreciate what has been done. As I said, the payments and increases have more than matched inflation in recent years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senator Leonard said, we have surpassed our own targets. The target rate was &euro;126.97, which was reached a year ahead of schedule. The contributory old age pension is now &euro;147.30 per week and the old age non-contributory pension is &euro;134 per week. These represent increases of 37% and 49%. Senator Ridge will know, like any Dáil candidate, that pensioners appreciate this and are getting what they deserve. Many other improvements have been made also.</P>
      <P>The Minister is of the view that increasing the pension rates rather than the allowances is the most effective way of improving the position of all pensioners. Apart from increasing the rates, the Government's approach has been to increase the numbers qualifying for the contributory payments and to reduce the need for means testing. The introduction of a pension supplement along the lines being suggested by Senator Ridge would involve additional means testing, which is not in keeping with the Government's approach.</P>

    <P>I know the Minister will give me a detailed and complex response to this amendment. The problem with all the allowances is that, somewhere along the line, we all lost the plot. I am not blaming any Minister but, over the years, we have developed a system of individual and different payments for different sections of the community. When I look at the very good information issued by the Minister's Department, I realise it is complex. It is so complex that I am in genuine awe of people in the Department who can work out these things. Other amazing people I know, who are totally capable of driving a coach and four through all the different levels, have never worked but still know every aspect of the social welfare system. We are talking particularly about the child dependant allowance, the purpose of which is to assist low income families. I do not know who could be against that so I will press the amendment.</P>

      <P>I will not repeat what I said because the rates are quite different. The Minister did recognise that special increases were needed for contributory widow's pension. That is the reason special increases, over and above general social welfare increases, were awarded in the last two budgets. As a result, widows and deserted wives aged 66 years and over in receipt of contributory pension have seen their weekly payment increase from &euro;90.28 to &euro;144.80, an increase of 60%. This is unprecedented and well ahead of price inflation, as I am sure the Senator will recognise.</P>

    <P>I have had concerns expressed to me about price inflation, particularly by elderly people. I ask the Minister to provide for a report on the effects of price inflation. This is not a great deal to ask and something we should have because the rate of inflation will rise. With great respect &ndash; we have a very able Minister of State present &ndash; nobody has all the answers. The dismissal of amendments which would benefit the wider community is disappointing.

      <P>The consumer price index is published on a monthly basis by the Central Statistics Office. It sets out the rate of inflation for the month in question in a clear and concise fashion. As this high quality publication is available to the public at large, the Minister sees no reason for a separate statement on the matter.

      <P>&ldquo;3.&ndash;The Minister shall as soon as may be after the passing of this Act prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on improving the income limit for the back to work allowance scheme to account for family size of applicants so that secondary benefits would remain intact for the three years duration of the scheme.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We are into the classic situation that has pertained for so long, whereby we take two steps forward and sometimes four back. While nobody would complain about the ethos of the back-to-work allowance scheme, it does seem to impede many families. I am not suggesting we forever support families by way of allowances and so on. Happily, most of those who participate in back-to-work schemes go on to find full employment. However, there are some families who find that they are penalised by the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of one case where a cohabiting couple with two children lost their supplementary allowances as soon as they got married. The man in question was participating in a back-to-work scheme and the couple were paying rent in the private sector. Because they got married, the health board would no longer pay them rent allowance. As a consequence, they are now homeless. In a society where we all claim to support the family it is ironic that a couple such as <Col N="1121" />this should find themselves homeless and in debt because they have stabilised their union by getting married. They were discriminated against because the husband was participating in the back-to-work allowance scheme, which is related to the supplementary rent allowance scheme.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that this whole area is something of a minefield, but something has to be done to improve the lot of people such as these. There is no agency which can help this couple. If they can get onto the housing list, they will eventually be able to find somewhere to live, but the fact remains that their destitution is a consequence of the back-to-work allowance scheme. Unfortunately, this case is not an anomaly. Somebody who is trying to provide a stable home life for his or her children should be recognised for his or her efforts. We must make allowances for situations that cannot be foreseen when legislation is being drafted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator has talked about an individual case, something all politicians can do. There are many issues that need to be addressed in this legislation.</P>
      <P>Long-term unemployed persons who avail of the back-to-work allowance scheme may retain their secondary benefits provided their income does not go above &euro;317 per week. Those who participate in the scheme also retain their medical card. In budget 2000 the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs provided for two key improvements in this area. Provision was made to disregard back-to-work allowance payments and FIS when calculating the weekly gross household income limit. In addition, the monthly maximum rent supplement limit was abolished in favour of a tapered withdrawal of support over a four year period. These measures ensured families with children, such as the one described by the Senator, were in receipt of increased supports during the critical early years of transition from unemployment to employment. The income limit does not vary according to size of family, but at least the existence of dependants is taken into account. The question of further enhancing the income limit is, therefore, a matter for consideration in a budgetary context, in the light of available resources, competing priorities and co-ordination between different groups and agencies.</P>

      <P>This issue was addressed by the Partnership 2000 working group on women's access to labour market opportunities which is chaired by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and reported on 13 April 2000. One of its key recommendations was that access to labour market programmes should be extended to the qualified adult dependants of persons eligible to participate in labour market programmes. This recommendation has been implemented.</P>
      <P>Since July 1999, eligibility for community employment has been extended to additional categories of disadvantaged persons, including qualified spouses of long-term unemployed persons. The back-to-work and back-to-education allowances also fall into this category. The Minister also made provision to implement further recommendations of the working group to benefit qualified spouses of social welfare recipients. Access to the back-to-education allowance will also be extended to adult dependants of social welfare recipients who have an existing entitlement to the allowance, on the same basis as the social welfare claimant. Implicit in this is the payment of the full personal rate of the qualifying payment to the qualified adult. In practice, both the social welfare claimant and his or her qualified adult could receive the full personal rate of the allowance. The review of progress in implementing the recommendations is being conducted.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Senator will be interested to note that, as part of the consultation process for the Government's new national plan for women, the role of women on the live register is receiving much consideration.</P>

      <P>To qualify for old age contributory pension a person must satisfy several basic conditions, one of which is that he or she must have a yearly average of ten contributions paid or credited from 1953 up to the date of entry to social insurance. The qualifying conditions have eased considerably in recent years, enabling those with reduced or interrupted records to receive pensions. A person may receive a payment with a yearly average of as few as ten contributions. Persons insured in other EU countries, or in countries with which Ireland has reciprocal arrangements, may also receive <i>pro rata</i> pensions which reflect the proportion of insured employment in this country. Such persons will combine their Irish pension with one based on insurance paid in another country.</P>
      <P>The special pension introduced by the Minister in May 2000, based on pre-1953 insurance, is also one of note. Payment is at 50% of the maximum personal rate, with additions paid for spouses and dependent children. To date, in excess in 18,000 have benefited from it, including 8,500 persons who were already in receipt of <i>pro rata</i> pensions at less than 50% of the maximum rate. Many of those in receipt of pensions are emigrants who left this country in the early 1950s.</P>
      <P>In general, eligibility for a pension is based on a standard set of qualifying conditions which apply to all applicants. Many of those receiving pensions are emigrants who left the country in the early 1950s.

However, the Government is committed to extending contributory pensions to as many people as possible. In pursuit of this objective, it has made significant changes which make it easier for people to qualify. People who spent time abroad and who may not have a complete insurance record in this country are benefiting from these measures.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;3.&ndash;The Minister shall as soon as may be <Col N="1124" />after the passing of this Act prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the effects of different stamp contributions, in respect of obtaining treatment benefits, for those under 25 years of age and for those over 25 years of age.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This relates to the different stamp contributions in respect of obtaining treatment benefits for those under 25 years age and those over 25 years of age. We have had a bad history in regard to different payment levels for what was referred to as &ldquo;the stamp&rdquo; or employee contribution. I appreciate there may have been a need for different approaches for people on different levels of payment. However, we are seeking a report in respect of obtaining treatment benefit for those under 25 years of age and those over 25 years age because these anomalies are apparent and should be addressed. I await the Minister of State's response on the matter.</P>

      <P>The treatment benefit scheme provides a range of benefits in the areas of dental, optical and aural treatment for qualified PRSI contributors and their dependent spouses. The PRSI contributions which are reckonable for treatment benefit are classes A, E, H and P. The contribution conditions relating to entitlement to these benefits vary depending on the age of the insured person.</P>
      <P>Persons aged under 21 years must have at least 39 weeks PRSI paid since first starting work in order to qualify, while persons aged 21 to 24 years must have at least 39 weeks PRSI paid since first starting work and 39 weeks PRSI paid or credited in the relevant tax year. In the case of persons aged from 25 to 65 years, the requirement is that they have at least 260 weeks PRSI paid since first starting work and 39 weeks paid or credited in the relevant tax year.</P>
      <P>Of the total of 724,000 claims for both dental and optical benefits received in 2000, 89% qualified for benefit. Some 11% did not qualify because of an insufficient insurance record or some other reason. There are times when people do not have the minimum number of contributions required. In 1999, some 5,000 people aged 25 to 30 years failed to qualify because of the 260 paid contributions rule. It was partly in recognition of this problem that the age limit was extended from 23 to 25 years.</P>
      <P>The Minister has no specific proposals at present for changing the qualifying conditions under the scheme. However, the operation is subject to ongoing monitoring by the Department and the question of further improvements will be a matter for consideration within the constraints of budgetary policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the means test associated with the one-parent family payment, a recipient is entitled to earn up to &euro;146.50 without affecting his or her payment. Earnings between &euro;146.50 and &euro;293 per week are assessed at 50% and the rate of one-parent family payment is reduced accordingly. Payment ceases when earnings exceed &euro;293 per week. However, there are conditional arrangements in place where a recipient of the one-parent family payment who exceeds the upper income limit may retain 50% of his or her entitlement for a further 12 months.</P>
      <P>The review of the one-parent family payment published in 2000 found that 60% of one-parent family payment recipients had some level of earnings. Of these approximately 75% had earnings below the &euro;146.50 per week threshold. The review did not recommend any adjustment in the level of the disregards as it was felt that, as they stood, they were adequate to support the level and nature of employment, much of which appears to be part-time, being undertaken by lone parents. The Department will continue to monitor the operation of the disregards and earnings of these recipients.</P>
      <P>Overall, the numbers and earnings has continued to show improvement with increases in numbers across all the income range covered by the disregards. The number who use the entitlement because of increases in earnings remains relatively low. It appears there is no need to increase the level of disregards at this point, but obviously it will continue to be monitored.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;5.&ndash;The Minister shall as soon as may be after the passing of this Act prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the implications of bringing together the widowed parent grant and the bereavement grant for the purposes of the one application for widows/widowers.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This relates to the widowed parent grant and the bereavement grant for the purposes of one application for widows and widowers. I appreciate the <Col N="1126" />widower's grant payment is relatively new. The amendment seeks co-ordination and cohesion and a report on the implications of bringing them together. Perhaps the Minister of State will give me ten very good reasons that she cannot agree to this proposal. As I believe it would be a fairly straightforward action to take, I am interested in her response.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give the Senator one good reason. Once any death is notified to the Department, the bereavement grant is payable subject to satisfying insurance-based conditions. The widowed parent grant, on the other hand, is payable only to a defined subset of these cases, specifically widows and widowers with dependent children. Less than 7% of all bereavement grants awarded annually are to widows and widowers with dependent children.</P>
      <P>If the bereavement grant and the widowed parent grant were to be amalgamated, it would mean that before a bereavement grant could issue all applications would have to be checked to establish whether the person claiming the bereavement grant is a widow or widower and, further, whether he or she has dependent children. This would delay the whole issue of the grants and would be unnecessary duplication. Therefore, it is more practical to issue the widowed parent grant automatically in cases where the widow or widower has qualified children without the need to make a formal application.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;5.&ndash;The Minister shall as soon as may be after the passing of this Act prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the increases granted to social welfare recipients having regard to the failure on the part of health boards to increase income thresholds for the purposes of obtaining a medical card by the same amount and the need for improved co-ordination of policy between all relevant departments where social welfare improvements occur.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is familiar territory to me because it is a case of two steps forward and four steps back. It is not that anyone wishes that to happen, but the fact that one Department does not know what another Department is doing is causing difficulty. I cannot see the sense in receiving an increase from one Department while the value of health care is taken away by the loss of the medical card because one has exceeded the income threshold. If people are entitled to social welfare benefit, it is acknowledged that they need the payments to assist them to live. I do not think it entitles the State to decide they should not have what is probably a life saver for these people and one of the <Col N="1127" />most important aspects in their lives, that is, access to free medical care.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator will be aware that to allay such concerns the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, confirmed on 20 February last that the recent increases in social welfare payments would not lead to medical card holders losing their medical cards. The Department of Health and Children has advised the chief executive officers of the health boards that medical card holders will not lose their cards on account of the record increases in social welfare rates announced in the budget.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Health and Children has already reiterated the Government's commitment to extending medical card coverage under the health strategy. There are also new initiatives to clarify and expand the arrangements for eligibility for health services. These include providing more up to date information and health boards have been asked to ensure that medical card holders and applicants are made aware that recent increases in social welfare payments will not disadvantage them when applying to hold or retain a medical card.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;5.&ndash;The Minister shall as soon as may be after the passing of this Act prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the implications of introducing a new infancy payment to cover the considerable capital and other costs associated with the birth of a child.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said before, social welfare covers from the cradle to the grave and from the womb to the tomb. We move rapidly through all these stages. <Col N="1128" />This amendment deals with babies and the implications of introducing a new infancy payment to cover the considerable capital and other costs associated with the birth of a child.</P>
    <P>Sometimes I am glad that I am entering a more mature phase of life because of the costs involved in having a child and rearing him or her to independence, which, in Ireland, happens to be at an ever increasing age because so many are in third level education. Although the age of marriage is now in the early 30s, fertility rates are higher than in the rest of Europe. We know the cost of hospital care and the cost of preparing for a new baby, particularly a first child. The Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, is unsurpassed in taking care of people's needs. I hope he will now acknowledge the need for extra help on the birth of a child.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 19 is concerned with the implications of rationalising the existing different rates of child dependant allowance as a means of assisting low income families. There is ongoing debate about who should or should not get child benefit. The theme and ethos of the Department is inclusion which concerns assisting low income families so I hope the Minister will agree with me on this matter.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 21 concerns the implications of extending the child dependant allowance to children up to 22 years of age who are in full-time education. That may sound extravagant but I know from experience that when the children's allowance was withdrawn at 16, or 18 years of age if proof was provided that the child was in full-time education, it was missed. The withdrawal of benefit came at a time when expenditure on education and a child's future was at its highest. We welcome the increases in child benefit allowance. The rates have gone up considerably but for the benefit to be cut off suddenly when a child is in full-time education is a huge loss. Many of our young people will be in full-time education until they are aged 23 or older. That is a burden on families with low incomes who want to help their child to a better future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of issues were raised by Senator Ridge. The grant of &euro;635 is paid to parents of multiple births at birth and when the children reach four and 12 years of age. Senator Ridge proposes such a payment for all parents to offset costs which arise at birth. The Minister feels that provision of a one-off payment at birth would not represent the best use of resources for child income support. The best approach is to enhance child benefit rates so that support for child-rearing costs is provided on an ongoing basis rather than just at the time of birth. That is why he has invested in child benefit and tripled the rates. The introduction of a separate infancy payment would be costly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator also spoke about rationalising the child dependant allowance. At present there are three different rates of &euro;16.80, &euro;19.30 and &euro;21.60. To bring them all to the higher level would <Col N="1129" />involve a cost of &euro;62.22 million. At one time there were 36 different rates which were rationalised in light of a recommendation made by the commission on social welfare. Substantial investment has been made in the scheme since then and by 2003 Government investment in it will have increased threefold.</P>
    <P>On the issue of child dependant allowance up to the age of 22 years, in the case of long-term payments where a dependent child remains in full-time education, the payment continues to age 22 or up to the end of the academic year after the 22nd birthday. These arrangements do not apply to short-term payments such as disability benefit, unemployment benefit, short-term unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance. In the case of short-term payments, the child dependant allowance is lost when the young person reaches 18 years. The Bill provides for the extension until the end of the academic year in which the young person becomes 18. This measure is a first step towards increasing the age limit to 22 as promised in the PPF. The estimated cost of implementing that commitment will be &euro;1.4 million in a full year.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;5.&ndash;The Minister shall as soon as may be after the passing of this Act prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the implications of introducing paternity benefit.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Over the past number of years, the role of the father has been acknowledged and, far from being a distant authoritarian figure, he is a &ldquo;new man&rdquo;. I suspect there always was a number of &ldquo;new men&rdquo; in existence. The term is a description of the involvement of men at a more domestic level within the family. There is greater involvement of men with their wives or partners when children are expected in addition to the practice of fathers being present at the birth. This represents a total involvement as opposed to the distinctive and separate roles played by mother and father.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1130" />We already referred to the cost of having a child and it is acknowledged by way of maternity benefits and grants. In an inclusive society, the role of the father should not be diminished. It is a &ldquo;family thing&rdquo;, as they say in America, and we should allow for the payment of paternity benefit. I am interested in Senator Leonard's comments on this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnLeonard" hpid="Ms Leonard Ms Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Ms Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Where will we stop if we start paying men to be fathers? We are veering towards the ridiculous. Rather than spending money on reports on whether paternity support should be considered, we would spend it more wisely by continuing along the path we have chosen and increasing child benefit. Child benefit is paid to the primary carer. Whether that is the mother or the father, the resources are wisely distributed to the primary carer. To start on another track and begin paying men to be fathers is ridiculous.</P>

The question of payment for such leave, whether by employers or through social welfare payments, is being looked at as part of that review. That addresses one part of the point Senator Ridge made.

      <P>The weekly social insurance benefits are in general paid on a flat rate basis and comprise a personal allowance together with additions for qualified adults and children. The maternity benefit scheme differs from other weekly social welfare payments in that it is an earnings related payment subject to minimum and maximum levels of payment. The purpose of the payment is to provide women with an adequate income during their maternity leave period. The level of maternity benefit is set at 70% of the woman's earnings in the relevant income tax year, subject to a payment of &euro;135.60 per week and a maximum payment of &euro;232.40 per week. For claims made during 2002, the relevant income tax year is April 2000 to April 2001. It should be noted that, unlike other social welfare payments, maternity benefit is not taxable. In addition, if the employer does not pay any wages for the maternity leave period, the woman generally will be entitled to an income tax refund for that period. When these factors are taken together, the rate of maternity benefit in many cases equates to approximately 100% of the woman's net earnings subject to an upper ceiling.</P>
      <P>Where a woman is entitled to be paid by her employer during maternity leave, the combination of maternity benefit and reduced wages will generally bring her weekly income up to the level of her pre-maternity leave net earnings. If social insurance payments such as maternity benefit were to be made fully earnings related, it would involve a substantial increase in expenditure on these schemes. This would require a significant increase in the current levels of PRSI to fund the benefits and it is not proposed to do that.</P>

      <P>Section 12 of the Bill defines the elements of the identity which will include, <i>inter alia</i>, the person's name, date of birth, sex, nationality and his or her PPS number. It also provides that this list can be expanded by way of regulation. As Senators will be aware, the Minister introduced an amendment on Committee Stage in the other House which provides that any such regulation would require a positive resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas before becoming law. The amendment tabled by Senator Ridge seeks the removal of this regulatory power to add to the list of data items. It is prudent when including lists of information in primary legislation to allow for those lists to be extended by regulation as the necessity for change could arise at a time when it would not be feasible to bring a Bill before the House.</P>
      <P>In 1998 similar regulatory power was taken in relation to the lists of specified bodies for the purposes of which data may be shared. Senators will be aware that far from abusing the power, to date, no such regulations have been made. While the list of specified bodies has been added to, the Minister brought those changes forward in the context of subsequent Social Welfare Bills, notwithstanding the fact that regulations could have been made. On Committee Stage in the Dáil, Deputies asked for an example of the type of data that could be added to the list in the future. For the information of Senator Ridge, an example in the context of accessing services electronically is biometric data such as voice, eye-pattern, signatures and fingerprints. Developments in this area have provided for technology which can simply read biometric data and validate identities with regard to those characteristics. It is not envisaged that biometric options will be employed as part of services provided by the public services broker for at least another 12 months and the most likely option will be voice-based.</P>

I am aware that the council has also been in contact with the Minister and us concerning previous legislation. In dealing with issues such as national records the advice of the council has been very helpful. We have also been contacted by the secretary to the Law Reform Commission. In the consultation process we should take into consideration advice given by such august bodies with good track records on practical matters. We are not discussing a matter of principle, but one of practice. As amendments Nos. 24 to 28, inclusive, all deal with the same issue, I propose to speak to them as a group.</P>
      <P>The net effect of the proposed amendments would be to require that, as well as the information referred to in the Schedule, death certificates should include additional information. Amendment No. 25 reads:</P>
      <P>to search any legible or non-legible register book of births, deaths or marriages, as the case may be, that, by statutory instrument the Minister for Health and Children has declared any legible open to public searching. In this section, non-legible includes reproduction of the certified copies of the entries in the registers by means of microfilm, microfiche, magnetic tape, diskette, compact disc or any other legible form (by electronic means or otherwise) which is capable of reproducing the registers in a permanent form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What would be provided for by the amendments is the possibility of including in death certificates the date and place of birth, rather than just the <Col N="1134" />age and maiden name of a married, widowed or divorced woman.</P>
    <P>In its representations to us the Irish Genealogical Research Society has shown us a copy of a Northern Ireland death certificate in order to compare it with one from the Republic. I know the Minister has also seen this material. The sample death certificate in Northern Ireland refers to the death of a woman on 12 January 1999, giving her married name as Ina Gibson. It goes on to state her maiden name was Coleman and that she was born in Monaghan. That is useful information, as anyone who has had to conduct searches in dusty archives will know. I contrast this with the information contained in a death certificate issued in the Republic, with which many of us will be familiar. It simply provides the person's name, their marital status, age and cause of death, but does not give a woman's maiden name. That makes research very difficult.</P>
    <P>There are two issues at stake. The first is that in dealing with such matters information may be found in other places. Second, pension regulations and other matters require the production of original death certificates. The format of death certificates is creating a variety of problems. For example, it is creating difficulties for those trying to trace their ancestors or who need to produce certification for private or personal purposes.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission has indicated that this matter has a particular relevance in family law. The Minister should examine the issue. Certificates of birth, death and marriage can be essential documents in establishing title to property and succession rights. Difficulties are arising because the form of the death certificate does not always contain enough detail to identify the deceased as the same person mentioned on the birth certificate which may clearly state, for example, that a Mary Murphy was born in Cork in 1910. It is clear because her address and the names of her parents are included. However, it could be a major problem to establish that she was the Mary O'Reilly who died in Dundalk in 2002. This means that ordinary people must pay huge amounts of money to solicitors and researchers to collect all the necessary documentation in order to prove that the person called Mary Murphy born in Cork in 1910 was the Mrs. Mary O'Reilly who died in Dundalk in 2002. A practical approach should be taken to the matter.</P>
    <P>I agreed with the point made in the last amendment that the Minister should have the authority to make regulations for public service numbers. I understand, however, that while the PPS number will be included in all death registrations in future &ndash; that may go some way towards solving the problem &ndash; it will not solve all the difficulties. For instance, it will not be necessary in dealings with the State but will be necessary in dealing with other groups for other purposes. In addition, it will not be available to those born before the date of application of the new public service number.</P>
    <P>The date and place of birth of the deceased should also be included in the death certificate, <Col N="1135" />as well as his or her original surname if different, for whatever reason, to that used at the time of death. This information is even more important in cases where people establish themselves in different relationships. People could very well use a number of different names during the course of their lives.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State will accept that my argument does not create an issue of principle; it is a practical problem in the courts, including the family law courts, to establish issues such as succession and family rights. It is also crucially important to the work being undertaken by the Irish Genealogical Research Society, much of which is commercial and focused at tourists and others whose ancestors may have emigrated many years ago. The Minister of State should consider seriously the proposals I have outlined and accept the amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to support the proposed amendments because I have always believed women's identities can be lost in national records. I agree with Senator O'Toole about the multi-faceted arrangements that people now have, and how difficult it can be if one cannot discover a person's date and place of birth, as well as his or her original name. It seems ridiculous not to include such information in a death certificate. Perhaps the Minister of State will respond to the claim by the Council of Irish Genealogical Organisations that heritage centres, which we have supported with State money, might be in breach of the law if it is not changed. Nowadays, when we have access to information at every level, I cannot see the reason a person's maiden name, or one changed by deed poll, should be completely wiped out. It makes it unnecessarily difficult for those who, for legitimate reasons, want to have the correct information.</P>
      <P>The legislation would also cause difficulties for genealogical groups, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, which has vast records, and heritage centres in that it would place them in a dubious legal position because it would be unclear whether they would contravene statute by continuing to allow access to their records. Why create a problem where there is none?</P>
      <P>The amendments request that a person's name at the time of his or her birth and his or her place of birth should be acknowledged on his or her death certificate. For this reason I heartily endorse them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I was contacted this morning by a member of the public who is concerned about this issue, especially the apparent removal of birth, marriage and death registration from public records. It would make it very difficult to gain access to this material. She also made the reasonable request that the name of the doctor certifying the death ought to appear on the certificate. I will not rehearse all the arguments in this area <Col N="1136" />because we have been briefed by similar groups. I asked my colleague, Senator O'Toole, if he had raised certain cases and gather that he has. I will not put them in detail because the argument has been made by him.</P>
      <P>Even though the personal public service number will be included in a death certificate, it does not take into account the fact that such certificates must be produced regularly by citizens making applications for State services. Ease of access is important. The Council of Irish Genealogical Organisations has made a clear case which parallels that referred to by Senator O'Toole. The cardinal point is the comparative ease of access for a citizen in the North of Ireland to this type of information as against that for someone living in the South. We ought to bring this type of legislation up to the standards of the other part of the island rather than creating a disparity in terms of ease of access.</P>
      <P>Regarding the issue of direct public access to civil registers, the Council of Irish Genealogical Organisations strongly believes the Government is mistaken in apparently ending this facility, even though the material that is to be electronically scanned to provide the computerised record is the quarterly returns pertaining to Dublin, not the actual civil registers held by the 32 superintendent registrars of births, deaths and Roman Catholic marriages and the 29 registrars of non-Catholic marriages. These transcriptions prepared by registrars each quarter of the year and which are sent to Dublin are the events recorded by them. It does not take much imagination to realise that these copies are full of unfortunate errors and omissions which do not appear in the original, locally held registers. Locally held registers are the ones to which people want access for genealogical purposes. There is a considerable financial benefit to the State in encouraging people to come here to research their ancestry. We should do everything we can to make this as easy and customer friendly as possible.</P>
      <P>There is the question of the legal status of the Mormons, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, which maintains extensive genealogical records, in making its information available to members of the public on a quest to discover details of their ancestors. This is a harmless and even valuable pursuit for the church in question in that it provides a service for the public which may even be better than that provided by the State. It is concerned about the legal status of this type of operation. The same is also true for county based heritage centres which maintain such registers for information purposes. They would be interested in finding out their legal status. For these reasons, I am happy to support the amendments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senators have grouped amendments Nos. 24 to 28, inclusive, together for ease of discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On amendments Nos. 24 and 25, in the case of searches of the registers held in each superintend<Col N="1137" />ent registrar's office, the indices are an integral part of the register into which they are bound. They give access to the register, but because they are primary records of events, they must be protected. Searches are only allowed under the supervision of the superintendent or his or her staff and the need to provide privacy for persons registering events means that, in practical terms, access to the registers has to be limited. Only one national index is printed on paper which means only one person at any one time may access specific years for an event.</P>
    <P>The ongoing computerisation of the national index dating back to 1845 for marriages and 1864 for births and deaths will provide simultaneous access to a number of parties, including genealogists, and will also ensure an accurate and up-to-date index of events is available. It will still be essential to protect the primary paper records after the electronic capture has been completed and to have them available for the investigation of any query relating to the electronic record. They must obviously be stored in a suitable environment.</P>
    <P>While the same issues do not arise in the case of electronic records, others arise such as system capacity and volume of network traffic for unrestricted searches. A genealogical search facility has been developed to allow electronic searches of the indices and identification of records required. This will mean copies of the records held electronically will be more accessible and easier to produce than at present. If 100 entries were identified which someone wanted to read, they could be electronically identified and produced by a member of staff. The electronic database of vital events will, therefore, provide a much improved level of service which would not be possible under a paper based system. The Minister is obviously conscious of what the genealogical organisations have stated and will ensure their requirements are kept under review.</P>
    <P>Of greater interest to Senators are the other three amendments which call for the capture of the date and place of birth of a deceased person and the surname at birth of a married, widowed or divorced woman. The primary purpose of the registration of a death is to record accurately the facts pertaining to a death and provide evidence by means of certified copies of entries in the register of deaths that a death has occurred. The format of a death entry includes the information to identify the deceased and cause of death. Death certificates are used for accessing State services and also for commercial and legal services. There is no evidence of difficulty in the acceptance of certificates for these purposes. It is important to note that, in Northern Ireland, the reason the maiden name is on the death certificate is because it is needed for social welfare purposes there because they do not have a PPS number equivalent. It is not necessary for our purposes here.</P>
    <P>Amendments to death entries here are permitted under the Acts, but the number of requests <Col N="1138" />for such amendments is quite small. The inclusion of the deceased person's PPS number will ultimately ensure that, from a prospective date, all life events can be linked. This will provide assistance in future for checking that people are free to marry and that a dead person's identity cannot be abused. It would not be practical at this stage to capture the date and place of birth and surname at birth of a married, widowed or divorced woman. However, it is important to note that, following the computerisation of the system, the records of life events relating to a person registered will be linked to each other and accessible without disclosing the PPS number.</P>
    <P>The inclusion of a spouse's full name and occupation is not necessary from the point of view of registration and could cause difficulty, for example, in the case of a person married and separated or in a second relationship or where the information is not available. For these reasons, the Minister is not disposed to accept the amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry the Minister does not see fit to accept the amendments. This is an important issue. It is a bureaucratic argument to state the primary purpose of a death certificate. It is like saying the purpose of a motor car is to get from A to B. It is used for many other purposes. There may be a primary purpose, but during the years it has been used for other purposes. We have been trying to develop an interest in this area. A line in the Bill would cause very little extra work or difficulties for anybody else but would make life a lot easier for people and save them money on going to the family law courts. It is our responsibility to do anything which saves people money in the courts and that is the approach we should take.</P>
      <P>I have heard comments from people who have come to this country to find their roots, to trace their relatives and their ancestors but have been unable make the necessary links. The public service number is helpful in some cases but I believe this amendment should be accepted. I intend to push the later amendments in relation to names and date and place of birth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator O'Toole's comments. The position outlined by the Minister of State is rather minimalist. She said it is not necessary to include this information. While it may not be essential, it would certainly be very helpful in the context to which Senator O'Toole referred, such as genealogical research, tourism and so on. It would also be useful if the doctor's name could be included. For example, in relation to writing biographies, this information is extremely important. Somebody researching a literary or historical figure might well want to query the cause of death, in the light of subsequent medical developments. To have somebody of the standing of a medical doctor would be extremely useful. In terms of literary biographies of people such as Bram Stoker, W.B. Yeats and James Joyce, these <Col N="1139" />are very interesting matters. While they are not considered necessary from the point of view of Civil Service administration, they confer incidental advantages and I urge the Minister of State to take this matter on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding is that, where there are links, the information will be provided to genealogists in the course of their searches. That will be made much easier in future as a result of computerisation, which will facilitate the relevant links. I share Senator Norris's view that it would be nice have more information on one's family history. Unfortunately, that information was very scanty previously but that situation will improve from now on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Without wishing to intervene again, I wish to put a few sentences on record in relation to facilitating people who come to Ireland seeking help in this regard. One comment in a petition to the Minister for Health and Children from the Council of Irish Genealogical Organisations is as follows:</P>
      <P>In general terms, I have been very frustrated in trying to research my Irish ancestry. Compared to genealogical research involving other countries, Irish research has proven to be the most difficult. A wider distribution of the records might help many of us reclaim our lost heritage.</P>
      <P>Another comment is as follows:</P>
      <P>The area in the GRO is too small for the number of people using it. One is unable to make good use of the available time. Other research sites are relaxing compared to the frantic frenzy of the GRO.</P>
      <P>Those problems are well known. I will cite another of the comments:</P>
      <P>During the summer of 1999, I used both the GRO &ndash; the General Register Office &ndash; and the National Library of Ireland. At the National Library, I found that I could sit comfortably at a microfilm reader.. The service was very swift and the surroundings pleasant, airy and clean. However, what an awful shock I got when I visited the GRO. There were too many people in such a small space. The research room was grubby and the furniture and other fittings were well beyond the point at which they should have been thrown out.</P>
      <P>The petitioner goes on to say the staff were as helpful as possible but were restricted by the number of references which had to be checked. The comment continues:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had intended to search for the birth of my great grandfather, James O'Neill, who was born about 1870. However, when I saw just how many possible references there were to be <Col N="1140" />checked, I did not bother. The limit of eight photocopies and their cost, set at £1.50 each, made the whole idea a non-starter. I was very disappointed with the service I received, though the staff themselves were very helpful, just over-worked and under-resourced like many others in the public sector. A second copy of the GRO microfilms should definitely be made available in the National Library.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State need not say those references are not precisely relevant to the issue before us. By not taking this on board, another layer of frustration is being added. We have received advice from the Law Reform Society, from which we sought advice in this regard, yet the Minister of State and her Department have chosen to ignore it. We have had advice from the Council of Irish Genealogical Organisations, an organisation of stature and that, too, is being ignored. When we consult, we should either listen or simply tell the people concerned their advice is not worthy of being heard. We have not been able to refute their advice, we have just chosen to ignore it.</P>
    <P>As a legislator, I regret that such a mistake is being made and I ask the Minister of State to reconsider her position on these two amendments, even at the eleventh hour.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Toole has amplified a comment I made earlier. I mentioned the tourism aspect, which adds a significant element to the debate. I wish to cite one short piece from the submission by the Council of Irish Genealogical Organisations. It relates to correspondence from Ms Patricia Keeney Geyh &ndash; a rather unusual name &ndash; who commented as follows:</P>
      <P>As Director of the Irish emigration library in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, I often have occasion to explain to people that looking at vital records in Ireland involves sitting for hours waiting for service. As an American, I have always felt hesitant to criticise systems management in Ireland but I know that I would be much more comfortable recommending research trips to Ireland if this particular set of records were transferred to the archives of the National Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>The points made by the Senators are the reasons the whole system is being computerised. The examples of people trying to trace their ancestry are perfectly valid as anybody who has gone through that experience can verify. Because it is all paper based, there is only one record and that is the issue we are trying to address. Computerisation will make for easier access, indeed multiple access, for people wishing to use the files. The electronic system will greatly facilitate making the links to which reference has been made by Senators and that is precisely what we are setting out to do in this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to be in the Seanad today for Second Stage of the Road Traffic Bill, 2001. This Bill has already been considered by the Dáil and was examined in some detail by the Select Committee on the Environment and Local Government. During its passage through the other House, Deputies from all sides participated in a constructive debate. Arising from those deliberations, the Bill has been amended and extended in certain respects and, as a result, is improved legislation. I look forward to equally positive and constructive debate in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary purpose of road traffic legislation is to establish standards for motorists and other road users for the safe and effective use of public roads. Since the passing of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, a number of legislative advances have been <Col N="1144" />made. These have concentrated primarily on the areas of drink driving, speed limits, the development of streamlined arrangements for making traffic and parking regulations and the devolution of a range of important functions to local authorities. In 1984, the current structures applying to the financial penalties associated with traffic offences were reviewed. As is the case in many aspects of our lives, road traffic seems to be in a permanent state of evolution. Improvements in road infrastructure and vehicle design and capabilities, allied to settlement experience, require that the laws governing road traffic should be the subject of review on a regular basis in order to respond better to change.</P>
    <P>Recent years have seen a significant increase in the profile of road safety and a growth in demand for significant improvement in our overall record based on the number of road accidents. The Government's road safety strategy gives a particular focus to this debate. The Road to Safety strategy, launched in 1998, covers the five year period up to 2002. The primary focus of the strategy is the achievement over its lifetime of a reduction of 20% in the number of deaths and serious injuries resulting from road accidents.</P>
    <P>There are those, including Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas, who claim that the Government has done nothing to apply and implement the strategy. This Government is the first in Ireland to have adopted a road safety strategy. We have made ourselves more accountable for road safety than any previous Government. The House should consider just some of what has been achieved since 1998 under the auspices of the strategy. Detections for drink driving in 2001 were 53% higher than in 1998; on-the-spot fine notices for the non-wearing of seat belts, introduced in 1999, were issued in respect of 59,000 people in 2000 and 64,000 in 2001; on-the-spot fine notices for speeding offences issued in 2001 are 165% higher than in 1998; mobile and static cameras are now in far greater use and this year will see the culmination of a major study on the use of speed cameras which is being carried out by a team of experts from the state of Victoria, Australia; the driver theory test has been introduced for first time applicants for provisional licences; significant improvements have been made in waiting times for driving tests &ndash; now averaging 12 weeks, with the larger centres at or below ten weeks; special educational programmes have been launched for both primary and secondary schools, and major publicity campaigns targeting drink driving, seat belt wearing and speeding have been produced.</P>
    <P>Over the lifetime of the strategy so far, these and other initiatives have delivered real progress. Between 1997, the base year for comparisons within the strategy, and 2001 the level of road deaths fell by 13%. The number of serious injuries in 2000 fell by almost 25% relative to the reduction target of 20%. This significant improvement follows a trend in most developed countries <Col N="1145" />and has been achieved in the face of increasing traffic volumes and road travel.</P>
    <P>The Bill has, as its central background, the further promotion of road safety. It is aimed in particular at the introduction of a more relevant and responsive structure of penalties and associated deterrents aimed at those who breach traffic laws. The most immediate manifestation of the approach being adopted in the Bill is the introduction of a system of penalty points. However, the theme of enhanced enforcement deterrent is also supported by a comprehensive review of the financial penalties that can be imposed for all traffic offences and the introduction of a new scheme of fixed charges, which will replace the current on-the-spot fine system.</P>
    <P>There is also a major extension to the range of offences in respect of which cameras can be used to establish a constituent of an offence and the provision of a framework for the implementation of the EU-sponsored European convention on driving disqualifications. This permits the imposition by member states of driving disqualifications for offences committed in another state. Finally, the Bill sees the extension to provisional licence holders of the requirement to have their licences with them when driving, as in the case of fully licensed drivers.</P>
    <P>While the law relating to drink driving was comprehensively reviewed through the Road Traffic Act, 1994, this new Bill provides for a further enhancement of that code by the extension of the powers available to the Garda to utilise preliminary breath testing. The Bill also streamlines the process of the procurement by the Minister of certain services under the Road Traffic Acts through the use of service providers drawn from the private sector; permits the control and management of traffic by local authorities for reasons of environmental protection and assigns responsibility for the control of taxi stands and bus stops from the Garda Commissioner to local authorities.</P>
    <P>The principal purpose of the Bill is to provide for the introduction of penalty points. The design of the system has been the subject of careful consideration in consultation with the Attorney General in view of the exclusive constitutional role of the courts in the administration of justice. That position differs somewhat from that in other countries in which penalty point systems operate and, accordingly, the system promoted in the Bill differs from other systems in a number of fundamental ways. However, the success of penalty point systems in other jurisdictions has been well documented and they are regarded as having provided a positive contribution to the achievement of a reduction in road casualties. It is our aim that penalty points will prove as positive here as has been the case in those other states.</P>
    <P>It must be recalled that penalty points of themselves will not address all the elements that negatively influence road safety. In many of the more advanced states in the EU, penalty points systems do not apply. The success of their road safety pro<Col N="1146" />grammes has been based on a multifaceted approach that features various related initiatives. The approach in this Bill promotes a variety of initiatives that will support and add value to the penalty points system and will lead to an improvement in the overall environment for the enforcement of traffic laws and, consequently, in road safety.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes a radical review of the maximum financial penalties associated with traffic offences, the introduction of a new system of fixed charges and the extension of the circumstances where cameras and other equipment can be used in the detection of traffic offences and the introduction of a requirement that provisional licence holders must carry their licences. The main financial penalties provided for in the Road Traffic Acts have been in place since 1984. This Bill provides for across the board increases to the maximum penalties applying to traffic offences. The general penalties which apply to the majority of the minor offences under the Road Traffic Acts are being raised from its present value of £150 to &euro;800 in respect of first offences and from £350 to &euro;1500 for a second or subsequent offence. The many specifically designated maximum penalties in road traffic legislation are also being considerably increased.</P>
    <P>The legislation relating to administrative penalties has remained essentially unchanged since 1961. This Bill promotes a major review of that. The new system of fixed charges involves a redesign and refinement of the present on-the-spot fine system. The new system will underpin the penalty points system and will bring greater certainties to the operation of administrative penalties generally. It will feature the introduction of a two tiered payment that will see the level of the charge increased by 50% where payment of the original amount is not made within 28 days of the issue of the original notice.</P>
    <P>The range of offences to which the penalty points system will apply creates the impetus for a major extension of the scope of the offences to which fixed charges will apply. In addition, the significant increases in the maximum fines for offences being promoted through this Bill will allow for the introduction of significant increases in the levels of fixed charges when compared to the current on-the-spot fines. Regulations to give effect to those changes will be pursued following the passing of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The advent of the penalty points system allied to the approach adopted in relation to that system, the significant upward review of the maximum financial penalties that the courts can impose on conviction for a traffic offence and the revamped system of administrative penalties promoted through the fixed charge system will, it is hoped, result in improved driver behaviour through the promotion of a more precautionary approach to driving. It will also promote the transfer of most of the enforcement of traffic offences from the courts to an administrative process.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1147" />Senators will share my frustration over the fact that heretofore it has not been possible to give full effect to disqualifications imposed on drivers from other jurisdictions. The European Union-sponsored European Convention on Driving Disqualifications is aimed at addressing this anomaly. This Bill will result in this important initiative forming part of our overall traffic laws.</P>
    <P>Section 25 of the Road Traffic Act, 1994, provided for the replacement of section 40 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, and introduced the requirement through which a driving licence had to be produced immediately on the demand of a member of the Garda. This in effect required that the holders of full driving licences had to carry their licences when driving. While that section of the 1994 Act has not been commenced as yet, its application is now essential to facilitate and support the operation of the penalty points system. As penalty points will apply equally to provisional licence holders and full licence holders, section 18 of the Bill provides that the requirements established through section 25 of the 1994 Act will extend to provisional licence holders. The revised section will be commenced subsequent to the passage of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the implementation of the commitment given in the road safety strategy to extend the circumstances through which a preliminary breath test can be taken in order to establish if a driver has consumed alcohol.</P>
    <P>While the central focus of the Bill is on the enhancement of enforcement, it also contains a number of other initiatives which will add value to the overall legislative code relating to traffic and the role of local authorities in implementing traffic related initiatives. It provides for a streamlining of the basis for agreements between the Minister and other parties for the carrying out of certain functions under the Road Traffic Acts. The Bill also introduces for the first time a provision through which restrictions may be imposed on traffic for the exclusive purpose of the protection of the environment and further streamlines responsibility for the application of controls relating to traffic and public service vehicles by the enhancement of local authority control.</P>
    <P>Sections 2 to 7, inclusive, and the First Schedule provide for the introduction of penalty points. The primary focus of this system is to improve driver behaviour and thus contribute to road safety and should be seen in particular as an effective addition to the current measures applying to the overall enforcement of traffic laws. The most serious offences created under the Road Traffic Acts automatically lead, on conviction, to the imposition of a consequential disqualification. In many instances the disqualification applies only on conviction for a second or subsequent offence. The penalty points system will apply to certain of those particular offences in circumstances where a consequential disqualification order would not apply and extend to a range of other offences that have a direct impact on road <Col N="1148" />safety. It would not be appropriate to further extend the system to address offences that are focused more on traffic and parking management issues.</P>
    <P>It is a central feature of the system that in the case of the majority of offences, there will always be a distinct choice presented to a person who receives a notice of the commission of a penalty point offence. Where a person chooses to pay the fixed charge he or she will incur a low level of points. If on the other hand the matter is allowed to proceed to court, on conviction the level of penalty points is increased significantly. A key feature of the system proposed here is the element of certainty that it will apply. In every case, the person will be fully aware of the number of penalty points that will apply where a fixed charge is paid or where a conviction is imposed by a court. This is not the situation in other states in which penalty points systems apply.</P>
    <P>Senators will note that in the case of certain offences, the option of the payment of a fixed charge is not being made available. These represent the most serious of the offences referred to in the First Schedule, including careless driving, using a vehicle without insurance and driving a dangerously defective vehicle. In the case of those offences a second or subsequent conviction attracts a consequential disqualification.</P>
    <P>Penalty points will be recorded for three years and where a total of 12 is reached the person will be automatically disqualified from driving for six months. This is the first occasion where a disqualification will be applied without the direct intervention of a court. Indeed it is important to note that the courts will have no direct involvement in decisions relating to the endorsement of penalty points. Where a person is convicted of a penalty points offence, the endorsement will follow automatically. To reach the threshold for a disqualification, a person must have been involved in a number of separate incidents involving offences that attract penalty points. In many incidents the penalty points will have accrued from the payment of fixed charges, which will result in the person avoiding the matter proceeding to court. The current arrangements through which a disqualification following a conviction for the commission of a single serious offence is imposed by a court will continue.</P>
    <P>The operation of the penalty points system will be supported by information technology developments in a number of areas. The business specification for the addition of penalty point functionality to the national driver file has been developed and the necessary software amendments to record the points have been made. Necessary amendments to IT facilities administered by both the Courts Service and the Garda are being progressed.</P>
    <P>Section 22 provides that in certain circumstances where a person is to be tried in court for an offence that attracts either penalty points or a consequential disqualification, he or she may be required to present his or her licence to the <Col N="1149" />Courts Service for recording purposes. This provides direct support to the operation of both penalty points and consequential disqualifications.</P>
    <P>Section 9 facilitates the entry into force of a framework for bilateral co-operation with other EU member states in applying driving disqualifications. This is based on and gives effect to the European Convention on Driving Disqualification adopted at EU level and signed by Ireland in 1998. The focus of the convention is to ensure that a person who commits a serious traffic offence in one country cannot escape the full effects of a disqualification imposed by that country by the simple expedience of going to another state. This also creates the certainty that where disqualifications are imposed, all recipients suffer the full consequences and effects of the disqualification, irrespective of whether they are citizens of that state. Senators will appreciate that this is a significant advance in terms of adding value to national systems of disqualifications.</P>
    <P>The Bill promotes a more advanced system for recording disqualifications generally. With the advent of penalty points, the concept of the courts applying endorsements to licences is not being continued. In addition the method for the recording of penalty points, which is based on the details being recorded in the national driver file, will also apply to all disqualifications imposed by the courts. This is facilitated by amendments to section 37 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, being introduced through section 8 of the Bill. In addition to improving the overall administration of disqualification orders generally, this new approach reflects the fact that developments in the design of driving licences will mean that the current arrangements through which disqualifications are endorsed on licences can not be continued in the medium to long term.</P>
    <P>Section 10 extends the grounds on which a member of the Garda Síochána may require a driver to provide a preliminary breath specimen. The section provides that where a driver is involved in a road accident or where a garda considers that a road traffic offence has been committed, he or she may require that the driver provide a specimen. This is in addition to the present grounds where the garda has formed an opinion that a driver has consumed alcohol.</P>
    <P>The use of alcohol by drivers is still a major cause of accidents. International research indicates that alcohol is a factor in up to 40% of road accidents. Estimates in Ireland suggest that alcohol is a factor in 33% of fatal accidents. Despite the ongoing and long-term campaign of promotion and enforcement and the availability of serious deterrents, drink driving remains a major contributory factor in accidents in this country. Therefore, there is a clear case for directing this proposed enhancement of the enforcement of drink driving legislation at drivers involved in accidents. A similar argument can be made in respect of incidents where motorists breach traffic laws. This particular issue was considered at great length in the debate in the other House. <Col N="1150" />In light of that debate, the argument that breath testing, on the more selective basis provided for in the Bill, represents a significant improvement on current arrangements while promoting the efficient use of resources remains compelling. It also brings us into line with practice in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Sections 11 and 12 provide for the replacement of the current on-the-spot fine system with the new system of fixed charges. The new system will offer a greater degree of certainty to the enforcement agencies and will offer the accused person a clear and unambiguous choice. The ramifications of each of the alternatives available to him or her will be clearly identified. This will be of particular importance in the context of penalty point offences.</P>
    <P>In association with the development of the fixed charge system a number of significant improvements over existing arrangements are proposed to give greater support and clarity to the enforcement agencies. This will be the case particularly where a detection of an alleged offence does not involve the direct intervention of a member of the Garda or a traffic warden. In addition, the sections place a greater level of responsibility on the registered owners of vehicles in relation to their use. The sections specifically provide that, in the absence of the naming of another driver, responsibility for the alleged commission of an offence will lie with the registered owner.</P>
    <P>Section 13 introduces, for the first time, a legislative basis for the adoption of controls on traffic and vehicles for the express purpose of the protection of the environment. Regulations under this section may be made in respect of a very broad range of activities which in most instances are the subject of existing regulation from a safety or traffic management perspective. One particular area where regulations can be specifically applied under this section allows restrictions to be applied to the use of specified fuels in vehicles.</P>
    <P>Section 14 of the Bill provides for the streamlining of the statutory basis for agreements between the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and other persons for the more efficient performance by these people of functions under the Road Traffic Acts, other than functions involving the making or approval of statutory instruments. The section allows the Minister to enter into an agreement with a person or company for that person to provide specific services under the Acts. Agreements may provide for any fees or payments to be made and for the disposal of those moneys. Examples of agreements of this nature already entered into are those relating to the national car test and the theory test.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for a further advancement of the policy, promoted to such good effect through the Road Traffic Act, 1994, to provide for a far greater empowerment of local authorities in respect of the determination of key traffic controls. Sections 15 and 16 introduce further <Col N="1151" />changes to traffic law that are being promoted in line with the same overall theme that underpinned the developments in 1994.</P>
    <P>These sections will introduce a more defined structure to the legislative provisions that related to the operation of buses and taxis. Section 15 transfers powers to make by-laws in respect of taxi ranks from the Garda Commissioner to local authorities. This is in response to a commitment given in the report of the Dublin taxi forum. Section 16 transfers powers from the Garda Commissioner to local authorities to determine the locations at which bus stops can be provided. In a related initiative, section 20 extends the range of matters in respect of which the Minister for the Environment and Local Government may make regulations under section 35 of the Road Traffic Act, 1994. Henceforth, it will be the Minister, as opposed to the Garda Commissioner, who may make rules relating to the control of the stopping and parking of vehicles at bus stops. These initiatives effectively complete the transfer from the Garda Commissioner of powers relating to the making of traffic laws that have been in place since the passing of the Road Traffic Act, 1933.</P>
    <P>With regard to road safety and traffic law enforcement, section 18 of the Road Traffic Act, 1968, provides that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government may make regulations in respect of the control of driving instruction. That section is being amplified significantly by way of amendments to section 19 of the Bill. These amendments will, in particular, empower the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to approve bodies for the purpose of the quality control of driving instructors. In addition, the new provisions will allow for an exemption for driver instructors from the direct licensing requirements in the section where they are granted certificates from an approved body. This implements a measure identified in the road safety strategy.</P>
    <P>The purpose of section 21 of the Bill is to introduce a new and significantly augmented legislative basis for the use of cameras and other equipment for the purpose of the enforcement of traffic laws. At present, under section 105 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, such equipment may only be used in the context of establishing the speed of vehicles. The new section provides that the equipment may be used to establish any constituent of a range of offences that relate to road safety. This will provide significant support for the enforcement of traffic laws generally and for the enhancement of the deterrent value of the new penalty points system.</P>
    <P>The Bill will enhance the existing framework set out in the Road Traffic Acts relating to the overall application and enforcement of traffic law. Its aim is to support the overall themes identified in the Government's road safety strategy and to add value to particular measures identified in that strategy. The immediate headline measure provided for in the Bill is the introduction of the <Col N="1152" />penalty points system. However, when one considers the various provisions aimed at enforcement as a whole, one should realise that the Bill will foster a new reality in respect of traffic law enforcement. Where a person commits a traffic offence, he or she will be penalised and, if that behaviour is repeated, the person will be disqualified. Therefore, the Bill represents an important addition to the overall legislative code that applies to traffic and road safety. I commend it to the House and look forward to the Senators' contributions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and the broad thrust of the Bill, the major aim of which is to reduce the numbers of accidents on the roads, particularly fatal accidents. In the Lower House the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, talked about a reduction target of 20%. I am not sure how he reached this figure, but if the Bill is capable of achieving that goal, it is to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>With regard to the imposition of penalty points, I am glad a two tier system has been devised whereby penalty points will remain lower if fines are paid within 28 days and cases do not proceed to court. However, there are a few issues that concern me. Irish motorists are being asked to pay substantially more for their cars than their counterparts elsewhere in Europe due to vehicle registration tax. I have asked that the Minister re-examine the reasons we should have to pay so much more. Irish motorists pay a substantial amount, through taxation on their cars, road tax and high insurance premiums.</P>
      <P>A lady indicated to me the other day that, despite a five year no claims bonus, her insurance premium went up by 50%. Insurance companies are charging substantially more and will justify this on the basis of the number of young people involved in accidents, particularly fatal accidents. However, I would love to see their books opened up to see the actual costs and the profits being made by them. My fear is that when penalty points are introduced there will be a change in the regulations to ensure every time a person accumulates a certain number of penalty points his or her insurance costs will increase accordingly. That might be fair enough if one is starting from a low base, but as the majority of young motorists are paying well over £1,000 or £2,000 for insurance cover, any percentage increase will penalise them severely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have all been touched in some way by a serious or fatal accident on our roads, and are all concerned to reduce the number of road accidents, if not eliminate them. Practically, they cannot be eliminated, but they can be reduced. There is an inclination to point to the major causes. The Minister of State referred to the issue of drinking and driving. He mentioned that in 40% of accidents elsewhere in Europe drinking is a factor, <Col N="1153" />whereas in Ireland, it is a factor in 33% of fatal accidents. That is a phenomenally high percentage, and means drink driving is a major cause of accidents and a major source of concern. It would be unfair to suggest, however, that it is the only cause or that little else matters.</P>
    <P>As someone who travels a lot, one of the things I notice is that road conditions in some areas are unacceptable. I would like to know the number of accidents that have taken place on the new N4 motorway relative to the volume of traffic it carries. It is a road on which a person can drive at 70 miles per hour. Compare this with a minor county road where there may be just enough spare for two vehicles to squeeze past, yet drivers can legally reach a speed of 60 miles per hour. I am sure the majority of accidents occur on roads not intended for heavy or high speed traffic.</P>
    <P>Drivers burdened with enormous costs are not getting a fair return for their money because the roads are not being maintained. Despite what the Minister of State said, roads in Ireland are primitive in comparison to our neighbours elsewhere in the European Union and on mainland Europe. Conditions are absolutely primitive when one considers the amount of money motorists pay. They are also a cause of many accidents. Badly lit and badly marked roads, bad road edgings, narrow roads, roads subject to flooding on a continuous basis, and roads with bad signs all contribute to accidents. If we are to penalise drivers, we should also penalise the Department of the Environment and Local Government which must accept responsibility for the number of accidents on the roads.</P>
    <P>Attention was focused recently on the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy's introduction of a new regulation on car phones, a matter I raised in the House because I was confused. It turned out that the public and possibly even the Minister of State were also confused by the regulation. I agree that a person who drives with one hand on the steering wheel and the other holding a mobile phone should be charged with careless driving. However, it was not necessary to introduce any new regulations. Current regulations allow any garda to charge someone who is not in proper control of their vehicle with careless driving. This regulation does not offer any new benefit to road users. Last week, a speaker described it as an experimental idea that appeared to have been written on the back of a cigarette box with a view to impressing the public before the general election.</P>
    <P>This regulation is ill-thought out and ill-timed. It will also affect the Garda &ndash; I can imagine a scenario where a garda in pursuit of a criminal must pull over to the side of the road before he can summon the help of his colleagues. Must a garda ask a bank robber to wait around while he calls for the assistance of his colleagues? I know it sounds farcical, but it is the truth given the way that the regulations will operate.</P>
    <P>When the Minister refers to a &ldquo;hands-free&rdquo; phone, what exactly does he mean? Is he refer<Col N="1154" />ring to a phone that is fixed in place or a phone that a user can install in his or her car and remove when he or she is leaving? The Minister has also stated that phone users may not have an additional earpiece, but I believe such devices are safe, if not safer than the system suggested by him. Using an earpiece means the driver is less distracted and the sound is clearer, allowing him to pay attention to the road ahead. This regulation is not practical. How will a garda prove that a driver was using his or her phone in the car? When the Minister refers to a mobile phone being &ldquo;on the person&rdquo;, does he mean that a driver is responsible for the phone that is in his or her bag in the back seat or that someone who has his or her phone in his or her pocket will be liable to a charge of careless driving? I am sure the Minister will agree this is a ridiculous situation and that a more practical regulation is required.</P>
    <P>Speed cameras have a role to play in improving road safety. However, such a technique can only ever be a snapshot in time. For example, if a driver wishes to overtake another road user who is driving at 45 mph in a 60 mph zone, to do so safely, it could be possible that the driver must attain a speed of 70 mph to overtake. That driver could be charged with speeding, despite the fact that all he was doing was overtaking at a point on the road where it was safe to do so. Another example of fines being issued unfairly can occur when other road users accelerate to prevent an overtaking car from moving back onto the correct side of the road. These things happen and if penalty points are to be issued for minor offences, some people will lose their licences on the grounds that they committed a number of non-offences. I wonder if the Minister can think of any way of avoiding such a scenario.</P>
    <P>I agree that the use of rear seat seatbelts is both reasonable and practical. The Minister should also consider the introduction of regulations similar to those in Sweden where the sidelights of vehicles are on at all times. I have often noticed people driving at twilight without any lights on; one would think that their electricity bill was going to increase. Visibility is often poor on a grey evening or when the sun is low and it can be difficult to see these cars on the road.</P>
    <P>I have, on previous occasions, addressed the issue of insurance costs for young drivers. With a view to reducing insurance costs and improving the skills of young drivers, the Minister should consider the introduction of simulators. I heard a lecturer at Trinity College discuss this idea and it is a good one. Airline pilots learn how to fly in simulators which reproduce random conditions which they must then learn to cope with and I do not see why a similar programme could not be introduced for the driving test. Test candidates could be required to demonstrate their ability to respond to all types of driving conditions that may not prevail on the day on which they sit their tests. A candidate who takes his or her test on a sunny day may find it easier to pass than someone who is examined on a wet winter's morning. A <Col N="1155" />simulator would fully test all aspects of a driver's ability in all circumstances. I know the Garda has various levels of driving tests which its members may take. Insurance companies should consider rewarding drivers who pass advanced driving tests with lower premia. This is a reasonable concept. People who take part would incur costs, but they would get this back in experience and reduced insurance costs.</P>
    <P>The Minister is from Cork. I drove from Cork to Dublin recently, using a machine that measures the average speed of my car. Three years ago, the National Roads Authority stated that its aim was to ensure road conditions in Ireland were such that users could drive at an average speed of 50 mph. When I drove from Cork to Dublin last Saturday, I registered an average speed of 27.8 mph. Think of the delays that are incurred by people transporting goods. Road conditions are so poor that I wonder why anyone in this country has a car. If this situation continues, all road users will do is sit in gridlock. If we had a proper public transport system, perhaps fewer people would be on the roads. I cannot see how the NRA will ever reach its target.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the national car test is a great idea. However, there are extensive delays for drivers who need to have their cars tested. I appeal to the Minister to find a way of ensuring that no one has to wait longer than a fortnight for an NCT. The costs involved in having a car repaired to meet the standards are high and people should not have to wait.</P>
    <P>I support the general concepts in the Bill but I would like the Minister to address the issues I raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire agus molaim é mar go bhfuil an Bille tábhachtach seo á phlé. I welcome the Minister of State and this important legislation which is very comprehensive. While it covers a wide range of areas, the primary purpose of the Bill is the introduction of the penalty points system which has been spoken about for some time. As the Minister of State rightly pointed out, in countries where this system is not in operation they take a multifaceted approach to driver behaviour and safety. While the introduction of the system will be an important component of improving road safety, it is just one of a number of changes required to significantly reduce the level of accidents, particularly the number of injuries and fatalities on our roads.</P>
      <P>One of the most important issues is the enforcement of the various road traffic legislation which was referred to previously in the House. It is fair to say that in jurisdictions where enforcement is of a very high level, motorists are much more careful because the likelihood of detection is much greater than perhaps is the case in this country. That in itself is a tremendous incentive to avoid breaking traffic regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1156" />In that regard, the thrust of the Bill in increasing and improving the remit of local government in the whole area of traffic management is to be welcomed. While it is just a small step, which includes the issue of taxi stands and so on, there is an argument for a specialised section to deal with the enforcement of traffic legislation. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, alluded to the issue at the recent party Ard-Fheis and this was welcomed by many people. Similar systems work very effectively in other countries and one of the benefits would be to release gardaí to allow them to become involved in crime detection and other areas of responsibility rather than being involved in multi-purpose tasks, including road traffic management, which could divert them away from their other duties.</P>
    <P>Senator Coogan referred to the condition of our roads. We have had a number of debates in the House and it is proven statistically that where there are very good quality roads, particularly motorways and high standard dual carriageways, the number of accidents is significantly reduced. Senator Coogan referred to travelling from Cork to Dublin at 27 mph or 28 mph. I often find &ndash; I will come back to the issue later in the Bill &ndash; that this causes time to be lost and frustration on the part of drivers, leading subsequently to chances being taken which might not be taken otherwise. I look forward to the acceleration of the national development plan, which clearly spells out our objectives for the future in the whole area of road improvement, so that people will have the benefit of travelling on good quality dual carriageways and motorways, particularly between the major centres of population. This will, in turn, significantly reduce the number of accidents.</P>
    <P>As the Minister of State outlined, the Bill deals with a range of issues, including the penalty points system. It also deals with breath testing and I was interested in his comments and statistics in this regard. It will enable local authorities to take control of taxi stands and so on, including a range of other provisions. It is interesting that it will apply to all licence holders, whether full or provisional. In this regard I want to refer to a point I made during previous debates. The time has come to consider the introduction of an improver driver licence. Once a provisional licence holder has passed the test, he or she would qualify for an improver licence, perhaps for a period of two years, before getting a full licence. The system we are now introducing of licence records would perhaps facilitate the introduction of this system where, if an improver driver committed some offences within that period, he or she would revert to a provisional licence. If statistics are drawn up, they would probably indicate that in the early years people who move from a provisional licence to a full licence think they know it all. We have all gone through such a phase at some stage. However, <Col N="1157" />these people lack the experience which is so valuable in the area of driver safety.</P>
    <P>It is a very good innovation in the penalty points system where, upon payment of a fixed charge, one will qualify for a lower penalty than if one goes through the courts system. That will avoid clogging up the courts with minor offences, an accumulation of which can often lead to serious consequences. The mere fact of incurring penalty points will, in turn, make people much more attentive to their driving to avoid penalty points and putting themselves in line for disqualification. However, there are issues that may need to be considered. Obviously, breaking the speed limit is an area where people will incur penalty points, and rightly so. This should be the case particularly in built-up and traffic controlled areas in villages and so on where speed limits are in operation. Most members of local authorities, including myself, if they are honest, will concede that during various discussions on the introduction of speed limit signs in villages or reducing speed limits they have heard comments that if people lived within the existing limit of 40 mph, there would be no need to reduce the limit to 30 mph. The response has been that if a 30 mph speed limit is introduced, perhaps people would remain within the 40 mph limit.</P>
    <P>In this instance, if the speed limits are unrealistically low, it may bring the system into disrepute. This is an issue which should be considered. There should be some standard set nationwide in regard to where there should be 30 mph or 40 mph speed limits. I am aware of certain areas where these limits have become status symbols to signify the entrance to or exit from a village and where, in many instances, there is very little residential accommodation.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State will correct me if I am wrong, but I did not come across the issue highlighted by Senator Coogan in the list of offences. He said that when passing a car one may find it impossible to pull in ahead of it simply because the driver may be driving too close to the vehicle in front. There is a much more dangerous situation where one may feel it is macho not to let a driver pass. Therefore, he or she closes the space so that one cannot pull in in front of him or her. It is highly dangerous to decide to pass someone who may well be travelling well below the speed limit but suddenly takes off at 60 mph to close the space. This is a serious offence which should be included in the legislation. A high number of penalty points should apply for this type of behaviour, the consequences of which could be fatal for passing drivers or oncoming traffic.</P>
    <P>When travelling on dual carriageways or motorways in Holland, if the person in front indicates to pull out, he or she has the right of way. As one has full visibility, there is an obligation on one to slow down and let him or her move into the outside lane. My recollection is that in Ireland the person who is driving in that lane has the right of way. Issues such as this could usefully be looked at to improve driving patterns.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1158" />A three-year roll-over of penalty points with automatic disqualification, enforced administratively without going to court, is a good innovation. The Bill is first class and it provides for what is needed to enhance road safety. However, there are certain anomalies. There is a question regarding the penalty imposed for having inadequate brakes. It will be one or three points depending on whether a person pays the fixed charge or is convicted. Having inadequate brakes is hazardous and the number of points imposed appears low when considered against the range of offences.</P>
    <P>The mobile phone is mentioned but it is not clear whether the hands-free set is exempt. Another area where the points are too low is in regard to trailers without rear lighting. Tractors and machinery on the roads without rear lights, in particular at twilight, have been the cause of many fatal accidents. The penalty of one point for that offence, or three points on conviction, is too low. If someone drives into the rear of a tractor because it is not lit the consequences are usually serious and often fatal. The penalty points should fit the consequences of that dereliction of responsibility.</P>
    <P>I found the issue of penalties for crossing white lines interesting. The penalty is two or four points depending on whether a person pays the fixed charge. There is a proliferation of white lines on national routes. I am sure others will agree that in many places where there is clear visibility, a person will find themselves beside a continuous white line and he or she will have to wait 20 to 35 metres before meeting a break where he or she can pass. It would often have been safer to pass 20 or 30 metres earlier. From a driving point of view, it would be much safer to cross the continuous white line and overtake than to wait until reaching the broken white line where visibility and space to pass may be curtailed. Will common sense be applied in regard to such technical breaches of the regulation?</P>
    <P>The prohibition on vehicles limited to a speed of 50 mph from passing on the outside lane of motorways is new. How practical is it? Articulated lorries are limited to a speed of 50 mph. If they are behind someone doing 40 mph, they will not be allowed to pass. That does not seem right. We have few motorways here and they are mostly two carriageway motorways. Anywhere I have seen this regulation has been in cases where there are three lanes, the first for driving, the second for heavy vehicles to pass or for motor cars and the third specifically for motor cars to overtake. How practical is this provision? The Bill's provisions are first class but the anomalies that might arise should be considered.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the bilateral agreement within the EU is welcome. It does not make sense that a person convicted of a serious motor offence in a member state could subsequently drive with impunity in Ireland. If we subscribe to the notion of an integrated European community, we must have community wide provisions in this regard. <Col N="1159" />Has any consideration been given to changing our driving from the left to the right hand side? With the exception of Britain, all the other EU countries drive on the right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Cyprus is not a member yet. Our many European tourists and our American tourists find it difficult to make the adjustment to the left hand side. It is an issue people are concerned about, particularly around entry points such as Rosslare. When people come off the boat there is a real risk of accidents because they may overlook the fact that they must drive on the left. Senator Coogan made a valid point in relation to this matter. He said that cars probably would be cheaper as a consequence of such a change. One of the reasons given for cars being so expensive here, apart from the high taxes, is that they are left-hand drive.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provision to extend the remit of the Garda in regard to taking breath specimens. It is alarming that 33% of fatalities result from people being under the influence of drink. Any legislation that remedies that must be welcomed. We must change our habits. Human life is inviolate and the Minister should be applauded for this provision.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. The Minister deserves commendation on the various safety introductions he has made. Of the many provisions I have seen over the years in regard to road safety, this Bill will have the biggest single benefit. It will put people on guard that unless they comply with regulations and legislation they stand a risk of losing their licence. We need strict enforcement so that the high likelihood of being caught will be the ultimate deterrent.</P>

      <P>There is carnage on our roads and every death is a tragedy. Last night I listened to Vincent Browne interrogating various candidates for the forthcoming general election. He asked Deputy Denis Naughten about road fatalities and particularly about spot breathalyser checks. The Deputy replied that he was in favour of it. We need that type of courage. I was touched by his reply because I remember when the Deputy's father, Liam Naughten, who was Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, was tragically killed in a motor accident. He was not even driving but was being driven by a State driver. One day he was vital and alive and the next we were attending his funeral. That brought home to us how terrible the situation is and the necessity to do something about it. The Minister can be congratulated because road fatalities have dropped by 12% over the last year or so and he has a target drop of 20%. I wish him well in reaching this target.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My colleague on the Fianna Fáil bench suggested changing the side of the road on which we drive. There are initial apparent advantages to the suggestion. He pointed out that many tourists <Col N="1160" />are faced with readjustment when they get off the boat. That is true, but just imagine the other side of the problem and the scale of it. First, look at the mayhem and chaos that would be caused trying to re-educate our own drivers to change to the other side. Also, we have a Border with Northern Ireland. They would have to change when they drove here. The English are piggish about hanging on to their own traditions. They want their own coinage, currency, etc. I imagine they see something quaint and charming about driving on the opposite side of the road to the continentals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Senator mean we would drive in the middle of the road? I can envisage carnage on the Border so I am not sure how practical this would be.</P>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of the points system. We called for this vigorously on this side of the House, particularly my colleague, Senator Feargal Quinn, and the answer given was that there was a problem with the computerisation programme. I assume this has been brought up to speed because that was the technical reason for not fully implementing it earlier.</P>
      <P>Car phones are a menace. I frequently see people using them, including someone the other day who was driving a large lorry. The man had one hand on the wheel and was telephoning while driving around a corner. Women used to be careful drivers but they are just as bad offenders with regard to telephones. I use the hands-free kit in the car but, even with that, there is a particularly dangerous point when one is dialling because one has to reach down and push little buttons. I presume the technology will eventually arrive whereby one can dial by voice in some manner, although even that may not be safe. Most of the time I try to pull in to the side of the road when using the phone because I am aware that one takes one's eyes off the road when dialling, even though one does not have to hold the telephone.</P>
      <P>I am glad to hear people referring to the practice of keeping car side lights on &ndash; it is a good idea. I have to say that because two weeks ago I spent a morning in a recording studio making some of the advertisements which will be broadcast from July in order to promote this practice which I believe started in Scandinavia. We always did it when there were showers or fog and it is a good idea to do it all the time.</P>
      <P>I always thought it was an offence to drive a vehicle with an illegible number plate. This happens for two reasons: they are covered in mud and cannot be read and &ndash; which is more intriguing &ndash; they are becoming fancier. I saw a Westmeath registered car yesterday and, with the curlicued writing, it could not be read. I had to drive right up behind it at traffic lights to discover that it was from Westmeath.</P>

      <P>I do not think so. It was not a Mercedes.</P>
      <P>The practice of vehicles stopping on the hatched box which is supposed to be kept clear is a bad practice from the point of view of traffic management and is also dangerous. Is it possible to have &ndash; certainly at the busiest junctions where these hatched boxes occur &ndash; a fixed point camera which would automatically register the numbers of cars? It is a dreadful practice and this would help to stamp it out, particularly if penalty points were applied.</P>
      <P>Is there a plan to send a warning notice when about two thirds of the maximum number of points have been inflicted on the driver? This would have a salutary effect. People are quite blithe about it. For the first few points they will shrug their shoulders, but as they get closer to the danger level, their care in driving will be increased if they receive notification in writing that they have only so many points left beyond which they will lose their licence.</P>
      <P>Members have spoken about the speed at which lorries are driven and someone suggested that lorries are subject to a 50 mph speed limit but the drivers do not observe it nor do they keep to the inside lanes of roads. I have seen it. I have travelled behind them and most of the time they were driving fast away from me &ndash; I have to include that caveat in case I get awarded a few points myself. These lorries are travelling at 70 mph in the fast lane along with buses which is dangerous.</P>
      <P>In the city of Dublin, there is a responsibility on those who are charged with the management of traffic to be really responsible, not just in terms of the welfare of car owners and users, but also cyclists. There has been a series of tragic cases in the last year. One that comes to mind is the case of Doctor Olivia Potterton, a splendid young woman who was giving remarkable service in Ballymun as a medical practitioner and who was flattened by a lorry on O'Connell Bridge. This has happened several times and the corporation has done absolutely nothing about it. It is very dangerous.</P>
      <P>There is increased danger for cyclists because of the corporation's traffic plans which are aimed at squeezing the cars out but they are actually making it more dangerous for cyclists. It is like an obstacle course. In the principal street of our capital there is no provision for cyclists, which is a grave mistake. This Bill is an advance in legislative terms and I see it as part of a programme by the Government to reduce road fatalities. I hope it will be successful in reducing road deaths to a minimum.</P>

      <P>We must still observe the rules of the road no matter whatever rush we are in. It is frustrating when one is in a hurry and there is a slow driver in front when one is trying to make time. Indeed, slow drivers can be as dangerous as fast drivers in traffic.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris referred to truck and bus drivers travelling at 70 mph and faster but my experience is of motorcyclists. I might be driving at 70 mph &ndash; perhaps breaking the law at the time &ndash; when a motorcyclist will overtake me, crossing two white lines and eating up the road at 80 or 90 mph. How many of these motorcyclists are being prosecuted for dangerous driving? I guess that the percentage of motorcyclists who are prosecuted as a proportion of the total number of motorcyclists is smaller than the corresponding percentage of motorists. If the statistics were known I am sure we would see motorcyclists are getting away with murder as far as violating road traffic laws is concerned. I see cyclists driving through red lights, which is a danger to traffic and pedestrians.</P>
      <P>Senator Coogan mentioned that in winter, especially when it is raining or in dusk, it should be an offence for drivers of motor propelled vehicles not to use their lights. This should be included in the range of offences for which one would be docked three penalty points. Anyone driving without sufficient lighting when natural light is poor &ndash; in rain, dusk and so on &ndash; should have penalty points deducted. I appeal to the Minister to make this an offence. On a day like today it is all right to drive without lights, but it would cost vehicle owners nothing extra to use their lights when visibility is bad.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State said the Bill &ldquo;permits the control and management of traffic by local authorities for reasons of environmental protection.&rdquo;  Earlier today I travelled to Dublin by car from my home in County Limerick. I left home at 6.30 a.m. and was barely in time for the Order of Business. I stopped for 20 minutes on the way for some refreshment, not drink.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, tea and some toast. As usual, I came via the Naas Road and turned right on to the Long Mile Road. However, there was a queue on the inside lane back to the Red Cow roundabout because traffic lights at the junction were changing frequently. This caused a big backlog which can be frustrating to those trying to make it to their destinations on time. The control and management of traffic approaching the capital should be improved in order to avoid such undue delays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State also said &ldquo;significant improvements have been made in waiting times for driving tests.&rdquo;  I welcome this. He further said &ldquo;special educational programmes have been launched for both primary and secondary schools.&rdquo;  Driving lessons should be included in the school curriculum with a knowledge of the <Col N="1163" />rules of the road. When I went to school, a long time ago, we all learned the rules of the road, even though there were very few cars in use. If students undertook a test on leaving school to ensure they had a proper knowledge of the rules of the road, there would not be such a waiting list for the driving test and it would also reduce the number of failures. I do not know what provisions are being made for this in the Bill. The Minister of State only said &ldquo;special educational programmes have been launched for both primary and secondary schools.&rdquo;  Are these programmes voluntary or compulsory, and are teachers available to provide them?</P>
    <P>We will have to ensure potential drivers learn the rules of the road at a young age because many fail the driving test due to insufficient knowledge in this regard. If more were aware of them, they would not make mistakes when sitting the driving test. The best time to ensure people have a grasp of them and, thus, pass the driving test later on, is in the fifth or sixth class of primary school. While that may be a job for the Minister for Education and Science, such training should be included in the primary school curriculum, perhaps for 30 minutes per week. In that way less people would fail the driving test and, consequently, young people could obtain full driving licences at an earlier stage.</P>
    <P>The penalty points system was also mentioned, under which drivers will lose their licences after incurring a total of 12 points. The use of mobile phones has recently been outlawed, but other actions by drivers can also constitute a danger to road users. These include lighting a cigarette and eating a sandwich or bar of chocolate. Anyone undertaking such practices can pose a danger on the road. I was listening to a radio programme recently and someone said they saw a couple engaging in sexual activity while driving a car. I am sure that is very dangerous also.</P>

      <P>I give the Bill a guarded welcome. While the Minister of State set out the issues involved, I was amused by some of the terminology he used because in some cases it is contradictory. He stated:</P>
      <P>It is our aim that penalty points will prove as positive here as has been the case in those other states. It must be recalled that penalty points of themselves will not address all the elements that negatively influence road safety. In many of the more advanced states in the EU, penalty points systems do not apply. The success of their road safety programmes has been based on a multifaceted approach that features various related initiatives. The approach in this Bill promotes a variety of initiatives that will support and add value to the penalty points system and will lead to an improvement in the overall environment for the enforcement of traffic laws and, consequently, in road safety.</P>
      <P>On one occasion we heard Senator Lanigan say Ireland was not just the envy of Europe but the envy of the world. Here, however, the Minister of State is stating, &ldquo;In many of the more advanced states in the EU, penalty points systems do not apply.&rdquo;  If that is the case and we are as advanced as we are supposed to be, why are we not following the example of the more advanced EU member states? Perhaps the Minister of State will answer that question.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State has quite rightly pointed out that the penalty points system will not, in itself, deal with our road safety problems. On many occasions Senator Farrell and I have sought a code of practice or conduct for road users. While the Bill deals mainly with the penalty points system, a great opportunity has been missed to introduce a code of conduct. The Garda Síochána would play a major role in implementing such a code which is needed, as those of us who travel around the country know. Every day we see motorbike, car and lorry drivers breaking the law and showing no concern for other road users. Drivers in England, however, are very courteous. They will allow another driver onto the road or to move in front of them. In this country, if a person even so much as shoves out his or her nose, it will be taken off. That is the reason I say a golden opportunity was missed in the Bill to introduce a code of conduct.</P>
      <P>The legislation is being rushed through because nothing has been put in place in the past five years. The carnage on the roads is increasing despite initiatives taken which were referred to by the Minister of State relating to the drink driving laws and so forth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State said: &ldquo;In many instances the penalty points will have accrued from the payment of fixed charges, which will result in the person avoiding the matter proceeding to court.&rdquo;  This obviously means that, if a person commits <Col N="1165" />what the Garda believes is an offence, he or she will pay an on-the-spot fine and accrue a penalty point. Who will oversee the accumulation of points for each driver? Who will administer the system and how will it be set up? The Garda Síochána does not have the manpower to do this nor does the courts system. There is also a huge backlog of applications for the driving test. It is in this context that we should bear in mind that probably every driver will at some stage accrue a penalty point over a three year period. It will be a hefty administrative workload for whoever will be in charge of the system. The Bill does not set out how it will be controlled and administered. It does state on-the-spot fines will be imposed. It appears the Government wants to collect the receipts. This is yet another way of filling the State coffers. We have seen this happen in recent years where on-the-spot fines have filled its coffers. This is one of the priorities in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I agree with previous speakers who referred to the issue of people driving with their sidelights on during the day. This is important, especially during certain months of the year. It is done in other jurisdictions. The reason they deem it necessary should be investigated.</P>
    <P>One of the greatest hazards on the road is drivers whose rear foglight is turned on at night. Such people should receive double penalty points. A person in front of or who pulls in front of another driver and has his or her foglight turned on will impact seriously on the driving capability of the person behind him or her. The person whose foglight is turned on may not be aware of this, but he or she should be made so aware and made to pay the price for it.</P>
    <P>The reply to a recent parliamentary question tabled by Deputy Hogan showed that the driving theory test is administered by a company in England. It is a sad state of affairs that we cannot do this ourselves. It has been brought to my attention that, when a person applies for a provisional driving licence, he or she must sit an oral test. When he or she applies for the driving test, he or she must pay a second fee and sit a second oral test. People who are required to do this believe they pay twice for an oral test. This should be examined.</P>
    <P>I agree with some parts of the Bill into which I will go in more detail on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Minister of State on bringing the Bill forward. It updates a code of law which dates back to 1961, since when major changes have taken place in society. One need only look at the road infrastructure and how the pattern of life has changed dramatically in recent decades to see this. The number of houses in each locality and the number of cars outside each one give a clear indication of the amount of traffic on the roads today. It is important we take stock of this when asking the reason there are so many road traffic accidents and young people behave so irresponsibly on the road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is timely in this regard. I am pleased to congratulate the Government on bringing it <Col N="1166" />forward and acknowledge the road safety strategy in place for the past four years. I welcome the fact that it is being updated and brought to its grand finale, namely, the introduction of a penalty points system whereby, if one accrues 12 points, one is automatically disqualified from driving.</P>
    <P>This is the way forward and the system should be implemented quickly. When the public sees this happening, it will welcome it because it wants it more than anything. We only have to read the newspapers to see the number of families with tragic stories to tell because some young culprit decided to do his speed trick while also possibly having drink taken, thereby not only destroying himself but others in the process. It is a pleasure to compliment the Government on bringing the Bill forward.</P>
    <P>It is important that the conditions laid down and the rules and regulations specified in the Bill are implemented. Otherwise, it will lie idle as legislation. That is not what the Government wants. It wants to go the whole way on this because that is what the public wants. It is timely that we are bringing initiatives in this area to their grand finale today.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the review of on-the-spot fines. The statistics have been well documented for the number fined in recent years for not wearing their seat belts or speeding. The number of fines in the latter category has increased dramatically in recent years. I also welcome the fact that speed cameras and electronic equipment will be updated. Gardaí cannot always be on traffic duty and must rely on electronic equipment which I am glad to see is being updated in the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is important that there is co-ordination. New planning legislation was enacted last year which provided for action plans to deal with infrastructure, parking facilities, road traffic management and so on. It was well overdue. It also provided for the transfer from the Garda to local authorities of responsibility for traffic calming measures and parking in residential areas. While this is important, perhaps the Minister of State will tease out further how local authorities will manage this. We know they will, for some unknown reason, pass the buck and state something is not their responsibility.</P>
    <P>I welcome this timely measure. When I have spoken at local authority level about traffic flow and the fact that parking facilities can be a cause of accidents, I have been told that is a matter for the Garda. It needs to be made very clear where the responsibility lies.</P>
    <P>The Bill also refers to education facilities and programmes for young people in relation to the rules of the road, respect for other people and responsible behaviour. If those traits are inculcated in young minds, it may be possible, with a co-ordinated effort between local authorities, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Department of the Environment and Local Government, to make progress.</P>
    <P>Parents must take responsibility for their children. Many households have two or three cars <Col N="1167" />and too many young people are engaging in late night drinking and driving. Parents must play their part in inculcating a responsible attitude in their children. We must try to change behaviour patterns at individual and societal level in an effort to redress the factors contributing to the awful carnage on our roads. I compliment the Minister of State and his Department on this Bill and I look forward to its speedy implementation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;following what Senator Ormonde has already said. Nevertheless, I welcome the Minister of State to the House. This Bill is one more very specific measure aimed at promoting road safety and protecting life and limb and it is to be warmly welcomed. Má's maith, is mithid.</P>
      <P>Next July, four years will have elapsed since a penalty points system in traffic legislation was first mooted. We have waited a long time and I do not say that with any rancour but rather in appreciation of the fact that the Bill is now before the House and that this Government has not left office without introducing this very essential measure to promote road safety and protect human life. While there is more to this Bill than just the penalty points system, that is a major innovation and it has a great deal to recommend it. I believe it will act as a preventative measure against bad and careless driving.</P>
      <P>On-the-spot fines for speeding offences were increased to £50, but young people now have so much money in their pockets that it is no problem for them to pay up and forget about it. It was not a great preventative measure. However, the fear of losing one's licence is a huge deterrent and I believe it will work. Desperate cases sometimes need desperate remedies.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State and I have observed the introduction of the clamping system in Cork city. Under the disc parking system, people were prepared to take a chance on parking over time in the hope the traffic warden would not get there before them, but since the clamping system has come into operation, people no longer run such risks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully support the strategy of bringing in a very severe measure for people's own protection and to prevent serious accidents. The toll of death and injury on our roads is such a deep tragedy. People went into overdrive in speaking of the slaughter in Northern Ireland over recent decades &ndash; and rightly so. That was a huge political issue and a huge political effort was put into breaking the cycle of violence, putting peace in place and stopping the carnage. Yet, in the last 30 years, substantially more people have been killed on our <Col N="1168" />roads, more families left in grief and more people consigned to wheelchairs and life support machines.</P>
    <P>Fatal accidents usually make news but we do not always hear of those road accidents that cause irreversible brain damage and serious incapacity to young people who should be in the prime of their lives but are suddenly struck down, many of them reduced to an almost vegetable existence. That is only part of the overall cost of the death and destruction which occurs on our roads.</P>
    <P>It is fitting and not before time that the measures in this Bill are being introduced. In any one year, the carnage on our roads can wipe out the equivalent of the population of a sizeable village in Clare, Kerry or west Cork. Imagine the outcry if the Taliban or some other terrorist group came into the country and caused such loss of Irish lives. Yet we are doing it to ourselves. I believe the measures in this Bill will be effective but a great deal more needs to be done.</P>
    <P>I agree with those who have advocated more systematic education. In the conditions of this new century, we must teach better human behaviour to growing young people. In more innocent days, there was a belief that if people were educated, they gained a moral and ethical outlook towards their fellow beings. We can no longer take that for granted and we must focus on responsibility for one's own behaviour. Careless behaviour is having a terrible impact on innocent people. While I appreciate that this is not a debate on education and I must not side-track myself, I believe we have to teach young people to think and how to drink and drive responsibly. We need a good code of safe driving, courtesy and consideration for other road users. That has to be an inbuilt part of our education, though I am reluctant to say that because our schools are already being overloaded with responsibility for looking after the prevention of all kinds of social problems.</P>
    <P>Another Senator commented earlier on the on-the-spot fines, a measure of which I fully approve. I am glad to see money going into the State coffers, where it can be used in education, health or other areas of public service rather than going into the pockets of lawyers. I welcome any measure which brings issues out of the courts and achieves an on-the-spot settlement to the benefit of public funds which can be put to good use. That is a major feature which this Bill has to recommend it.</P>
    <P>A number of things need to be done simultaneously with the introduction of this Bill. I am concerned that relatively good and safe drivers could find themselves losing points very easily. The location and positioning of speed limit signs is a matter of concern to me. On entering a town one usually sees the speed control signs and one slows down to 40 mph and then 30 mph, but on driving out of the built up area there is often a lack of signage or very poorly positioned signage announcing the end of the speed limit area. I hope the Minister of State takes this point very <Col N="1169" />seriously. A thorough audit of speed limit signs in towns and villages is necessary. We owe that to good drivers. How effective are they at present? How visible are they? We must also bear in mind that areas have become even more built up since some of these signs were put in place. It would not be fair if good drivers were caught for speeding out of towns where it was not clear that they were still in a restricted speed area. Very often laws catch out the least culpable people and the ones who break the law to beat the band get away with it. I urge the Minister of State not to let that happen with this law.</P>
    <P>Another area of concern is the disgraceful quality and positioning of many directional signs. This very often leads to accidents when people who do not know the road come to a junction and are forced to drive to a point where they become a hazard because they cannot read the directional signs. This is especially the case with older county roads where the directional signs are often very poorly positioned; some are invisible and others are pointed in the wrong direction. I include the &ldquo;Yield&rdquo; signs and the &ldquo;Stop&rdquo; signs as well as the directional signs. I appeal to the Minister as a matter of urgency to initiate a thorough review of those signs as it would certainly enable the objectives of this Bill to be fully met.</P>
    <P>Centralising the control and management of traffic is a good idea. Traffic congestion can be a scourge in cities. How many times have we heard county managers say that the Garda is the traffic authority and the local authority only has responsibility for the roads? It is a ludicrous division of authority. One would hardly have traffic &ndash; apart from aviation and the birds &ndash; without roads, or would not expect to have roads without traffic. It is nonsense to have a division of authority between the Garda and the local authority. It should be co-ordinated and streamlined, which would lead to a greater promotion of safety. I am pleased to see that will be done in the context of this Bill.</P>
    <P>In order for this Bill to be fully and fairly enforced, we need to put in place a special Garda traffic corps in cities, as they have in the United States and other places. Their sole function should relate to the promotion and monitoring of road safety. They need a wider brief than the Garda has at present. Gardaí are pretty good at speed detection but their approach is somewhat erratic. They go at it in bursts and people get to know where they are and slow down until there is a relaxation of Garda efforts. There has to be a more consistent approach.</P>
    <P>In cities there is one set of people in uniform enforcing the litter laws while another set of uniformed people enforce parking regulations and then there is the Garda. They are all looking after the same community of pedestrians and motorists. All these functions should be brought into one special corps of people to look after the needs of cities. This would allow an incorporation of the laws in regard to parking, driving, litter and public order. That would be a good day's work.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1170" />I endorse this Bill and look forward to its speedy implementation. I repeat a point made earlier by the Acting Chairman, Senator Coogan, and a number of others that motorists must be required to use their side lights at dusk. There is no one single measure that will achieve the objectives of road safety and the protection of human life, but if we could bring all the disparate strands together then much would be achieved. A good day's work is being done in the context of this Bill, which I support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Very much of what I want to say has already been said. I welcome this Bill and see it as a great move forward in trying to improve the standard of driving. Unfortunately people take very little notice of fines. People who are rich enough to pay them do so and those who cannot ignore them. Our prisons are unable to cope with the numbers of people who are sentenced for non-payment of fines and discharged almost at once.</P>
      <P>City driving needs to be looked at very carefully. We do not pay enough attention to it. Most of the debate this afternoon has been about driving on the open road but driving within the city is of great importance. A considerable number of pedestrians and cyclists are knocked down every year, some of them fatally injured. If we want to pedestrianise the city more and give pedestrians and cyclists more power within the city, it follows that we curtail the activity of drivers. It is regrettable that so many drivers in the city seem to feel a pedestrian crossing is of minimal concern if nobody is on it. Even outside Leinster House where there is always a garda on duty people frequently drive through red lights.</P>
      <P>The number of pedestrian crossings in the city is very limited. I made my own efforts to get a crossing on Merrion Street. A couple of years ago I fell on that street having had to rush across. I contacted Inspector Tim Doyle who said he would investigate the matter of putting in a crossing. One of the reasons given by the then corporation authorities for not doing so was that it would slow the traffic &ndash; that was one of my intentions. If I were hit at 20 mph it would do far less damage than if I were hit at 40 mph.</P>
      <P>Traffic islands were installed but I have been waiting for two years to see the lines painted on the road. I have constantly been given the excuse that they are waiting for a fine day. It has been fine several times in the past two years and I would be most grateful if they would try to complete the crossing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other parts of the city where there are no traffic crossings for nearly half a kilometre. I do not know the length of the side of St. Stephen's Green where Iveagh House is located but when the Minister for Foreign Affairs was trying to walk to his Department he was knocked down one day by a motorcycle. It is quite ridiculous that there are no traffic lights to allow pedestrians to cross the road. What does it matter if traffic is slowed <Col N="1171" />down? The idea is to have it pass through the city more slowly to allow pedestrians to make more use of the streets. This is what we are trying to encourage.</P>
    <P>Another problem is the very short length of time which traffic lights allow to pedestrians to cross the road. Some allow only 20 seconds. I have even had complaints made to me about the traffic lights outside Trinity College, which are mainly used by students who are very fleet of foot. It is not as though we have elderly people trying to cross there all the time, yet it is the young people who complain that the traffic lights change extremely briskly. This matter should be pursued in favour of the pedestrian in order that we get people to use public transport and their feet more when in the city. Although improvements have been made, the city is still designed mainly to cater for the car.</P>
    <P>I have great sympathy for drivers regarding the state of road surfaces. The repair of roads in cities and the country leaves much to be desired. We need to address this problem. Accidents are caused by potholes. A friend of mine drove into a very bad one on her way back from County Clare recently which bent her wheel. She pulled into a garage and was told that hers was the fourth car that morning that needed to have a wheel changed. That is intolerable and drivers are entitled to complain bitterly about it. Though there may be a considerable number of houses along them, private roads also have problems. People living along on private roads with between ten and 20 houses have told me of the difficulties they have had in getting roads resurfaced.</P>
    <P>We have to do things to help drivers too. I do not want them to think that I want them off the roads, but the effect they have in the city is incredible. I suggest that, for the safety of pedestrians and cyclists, whoever tots up the penalty points in cities takes into account people going through traffic lights at pedestrian crossings and endangering others by driving too close to cycle lanes. Driving in cycle lanes is another way in which the law is being breached.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister of State and hope the Bill has a speedy passage through the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators on all sides for their contributions to what has been an invigorating and informative debate. I acknowledge the general welcome the House has extended to this innovative legislation. This House has been to the fore in generating public debate on road safety and engaged with Ministers on a regular basis in addressing the issue. It is, therefore, no surprise that contributions have been both thoughtful and focused and I will endeavour to respond to them as positively and constructively as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am particularly pleased that the House has enthusiastically endorsed the proposed penalty points system and agreed that there is a need to <Col N="1172" />enhance current enforcement efforts. Penalty points will, however, have no direct relationship to insurance. Since the aim of the system is to improve behaviour, we should look at it as a means of supporting that improvement. Avoidance of penalty points should be the focus of drivers when the system is introduced. Senator Walsh referred to penalty points with regard to vehicle standards. Again, it must be recalled that the system is targeted at improved behaviour, not at disqualifying drivers. We are giving them the opportunity to improve their performance on the road.</P>
    <P>Travel on all roads, irrespective of type, entails a risk to road users. Analysis of Garda road accident reports consistently shows that driver error is the major contributory factor in accidents and was the cause of in excess of 80% of road traffic accidents in 2000. In the case of two vehicle accidents where specific contributory factors were identified, the main driver faults were travelling on the wrong side of the road, exceeding safe speed levels and driving through &ldquo;Stop&rdquo; and &ldquo;Yield&rdquo; signs followed by improper overtaking. It is neither feasible nor cost effective to provide high quality dual carriageways and motorways in all cases given the projected traffic volume to be catered for on specific routes and the overall scale of funding requirements for the current national roads improvement programme. Safety is, however, an integral feature of the design of the appropriate type of road in all cases. Issues relating to junctions strategy for national roads, including safety, are kept under constant review by the authority and changes made where relevant.</P>
    <P>On 19 March my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy, signed regulations dealing with the vexed question of people using their mobile phones while driving. This is a road safety issue as using any mobile phone while driving is a distraction, which is compounded in the case of a hand-held unit. Using a hand-held device is doubly dangerous because it impairs the driver's ability to control the vehicle, particularly in an emergency which is more likely to be caused because of the distraction in the first place. The volume of representations to my Department from the public and elected representatives over a long period shows that this is a serious road safety issue. The representations called for action along the lines of last week's measure. The high level group on road safety also saw the need to give attention to the matter as a road safety priority. It is not the case that the regulations are draconian or confused and their effect will be to prohibit people from using mobile phones while driving, unless they are being used in conjunction with a conventional hands-free kit. It is nonsense to suggest that the ban covers extreme circumstances, let alone a switched off mobile phone in someone's pocket or purse. A common sense reading of the regulations makes it clear that the phone must be in use before an offence can be committed. The regulations make for a positive <Col N="1173" />road safety initiative that has a good deal of public support and should be supported here in the interests of reducing death and serious injury on our roads.</P>
    <P>International research literature on the daytime running of lights shows substantial disagreement on the measure's effectiveness in improving road safety. The European Commission has given detailed consideration to this complex question but, to date, has not reached any conclusion. It has included daytime running of lights among road safety priorities to be progressed at EU level which will involve more research before a consensus evolves. At the heart of the discussion is that while daytime lights can have certain safety benefits for the motor vehicles that use them, their use may lead to additional deaths and injuries among more vulnerable road users, such as pedestrians and cyclists, because they are relatively less visible in those circumstances. It is, therefore, prudent not to take a definitive position in Irish law until there is much clearer evidence about where the balance of costs and benefits lie.</P>
    <P>Senator Walsh raised the matter of driving on the left hand side of the road in regard to which there are no proposals to change the rules. The House might be interested to know that, in world terms, more people drive on the left than on the right. Senator Rory Kiely referred to the road theory test, which is not a requirement in the granting of a provisional driving licence.</P>
    <P>Senator Burke referred to the penalty points systems of other states. It is true to say that not all EU member states employ such systems &ndash; Sweden and Holland being examples &ndash; but the United Kingdom and France do. The United Kingdom and Sweden are ranked best in terms of road safety in the European Union. The administration of the penalty points system will be shared by the Garda, the Courts Service and my Department, as set out in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator Quill raised the matter of traffic signs. The Traffic Signals Manual, published in 1996, provides information on the three categories of traffic sign and road markings generally. The manual provides a comprehensive guide to the provision of road signage in Ireland and sets out the technical and other standards to be followed in the provision and maintenance of signs. Use of the manual is intended over time to lead to greater uniformity of practice and to the creation of a more consistent approach to signs generally. While regulatory signs must be in accordance with the sign regulations, all other signs and road markings should be in accordance with the traffic signs manual unless otherwise authorised by the Minister.</P>
    <P>In its oversight role of the non-national roads programme, the Department issued a circular letter to road authorities in August 1998 emphasising the importance of providing and maintaining a high standard of road signage. The Department's memorandum on grants for non-national roads, issued on 5 February 2001, again reminded local authorities of the need to bring their signage <Col N="1174" />on the non-national road network up to the standards of the Traffic Signs Manual. An extensive review of the existing traffic sign regulations and the Traffic Signs Manual is proposed in 2002. The road traffic, traffic and parking regulations, No. 182 of 1997, and the road traffic, traffic and parking regulations of 1998, Nos. 274 and 441, provide for the general regulation and control of traffic, including the parking of vehicles, and pedestrians in public places. The application of traffic or parking restrictions in other areas is for individual road authorities to consider in the light of particular circumstances.</P>
    <P>I hope the Bill will contribute to a more rapid reduction in road casualties. Our aim is to see Ireland ranked among the most progressive states in Europe in terms of road safety. Much has been achieved over the lifetime of the road safety strategy but we must move forward and the passing of this Bill will move us towards the achievement of our goals. I thank Senators for their positive and encouraging response to the Bill, which promotes measures that will contribute to our efforts to combat the horrific carnage on our roads. I look forward to our continued consideration of the Bill tomorrow.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 14 provides for an enhanced enforcement mechanism, replacing the provision for a compliance notice as published in section 45 of the Bill with the provision for a notice by the commission of intention to prosecute. This new provision is based on provisions contained in the Company Law Enforcement Act, 2001. It will provide for the imposition of a fine of &euro;1,000 in cases where the commission has reasonable grounds for believing that a person has committed an offence under the provisions of a European directive. Where the person fails to pay the fine, the commission may proceed with prosecuting the offence in the courts. This represents an improvement on the original provisions of section 45 which had no associated mechanism to impose a fine. Following further consideration we have concluded that there is no need for the original provision in section 45. The reason is that the requirements and obligations imposed on operators in the various legislative provisions had their own compliance notice provisions.</P>
      <P>The purpose of amendment No. 2 is to insert a definition of the term &ldquo;prescribed&rdquo; in the Bill. This amendment is related to amendment No. 14, which refers to the commission giving a notice to a person or a company in a prescribed form. In other words, we make it statutory, clear and regular by having it on a prescribed document. It is intended that the Minister may, by regulations, prescribe the form of this notice. I recommend both amendments to the House.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State. What worries me is that, again, there is a reference to the Minister for Finance. It has been a complaint of mine throughout the Bill that the Minister for Finance &ndash; I have had a chance to look at two of the other Bills relating to regulators &ndash; seems to be much more in evidence in this Bill compared to the others. Frequently one would complain, because the commission is supposed to be independent, that perhaps too much notice was being taken in the Bill of what the Minister for Public Enterprise thought, but in this case the Bill states that all payments to the commission in pursuance of this section shall be paid into or disposed of for the benefit of the Exchequer in such manner as the Minister for Finance may direct.</P>
      <P>Given the levies it will charge, the commission will be self-financing. I cannot understand why the Minister for Finance has to keep appearing in every section of the Bill. As a result, I sometimes feel that the Minister for Finance will make more decisions than the commission. Why is it not possible to provide that the commission rather than the Minister for Finance would deal with the money that is paid?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two elements to this, one of which is the public service element. This is a public service organisation created by the State and the Oireachtas to manage telecommunications regulation, which is an important area in this time of global communications and will be much more important in the future. They are publicly appointed people paid from public funds. If we reach a position some day where this organisation did not have surplus resources, the State would be obliged to look after its interests and that would be a call on the resources of the Minister of Finance and the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Alternatively, the organisation could be in surplus, as it is at present. Therefore, it is important to take into account the requirements of the State, the Government and the various Departments, but particularly the Minister for Finance. This will ensure that these resources are prudently used and deployed to the maximum benefit of the State in whatever area the Government or the Minister for Finance may decide, rather than a position where there is a surplus lying in a commission, which would not have a mandate to expend those resources, and where the Government or the Minister for Finance may have a requirement for those resources at a particular time. It is important that there is such flexibility, taking into account the model of partnership which exists in modern public service performance and also the efficiencies which have been brought to bear on the management of public expenditure over the years. It is normal for the <Col N="1177" />State to take fines and fines are involved in this case. The mandatory structure on which the commission is based requires that the surplus income of the commission must be refunded to the Exchequer at minimum on an annual basis.</P>
    <P>The role of the Minister for Finance is restricted to pay and pensions of the commissioners and the staff, licence fees and the treatment of the commission's excess of income over expenditure. It is a standard, structured provision which is consistent with the position in the case of the aviation and electricity regulatory structures. We are maintaining that consistency. It is important that we do so. Otherwise there could be a slight distortion in either systems criteria or resources from other similar organisations which could compound any complex situation in the future.</P>

      <P>I have looked at the legislation on both aviation and electricity regulation, but I did not look at that aspect. I believe the Minister if he says that is the position, but the commission might be able to think of very good things to do with its money because this is an expanding area. Throughout the Bill the hand of the Minister for Finance seems to be much stronger than in the other regulatory Bills. If the Minister of State says that is the position, however, I will not oppose the amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 11, between lines 11 and 12, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(2) On the establishment day there is transferred to the Commission the functions of the Minister under <i>section 20</i> (except in so far as it relates to television sets) of the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1988.&rdquo;.<Col N="1178" /></P>

      <P>Under section 20 of the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1988, the Minister may by regulations prescribe the fee to be paid in respect of applications for licences or any class of licence under section 5 of the Wireless and Telegraphy Act, 1926. Under the text of the Bill, as initiated, section 20 of the 1998 Act was included among the functions of the director, which are now transferred by this Bill to the commission. However, that section had not been transferred to the director in 1997. Therefore, the function continues to rest with the Minister. However, it is now appropriate for the provision to be transferred to the new commission because it will have responsibility for handling applications for licences.</P>
      <P>It is a requirement of the new European directive on the authorisation of electronic communications networks and services that administrative charges imposed on operators for authorisations be related to the administrative costs of administering the licensing system. The functions of section 20, as it relates to the licensing of television sets, had not been transferred to the director in 1997 and will not be transferred to the commission. Provisions relating to the licensing of television sets are a broadcasting policy matter under the responsibility of the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. Accordingly, the amendment explicitly excludes the transfer of these functions to the new commission. I trust the House will accept the amendments.</P>

      <P>In page 12, subsection (1)(<i>c</i>), line 30, to delete &ldquo;a&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;an efficient&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It is quite timely that we are addressing this Bill today when one considers what happened in respect of the postal services in England yesterday. Apparently Consignia was totally disbanded and great changes have to be made to the postal service. It is probably one of the most important parts of the Bill for the public. While we may manage without the various digital channels we may have provided, the postal service is still extraordinarily important.</P>
      <P>The amendment seeks to encourage the development of the postal service. It is fine to speak of its development, in particular, the availability of a universal postal service within, to and from the State at an affordable price, but efficiency is also very important. It is no good if post arrives three weeks after it is required. This is the problem the postal service ran into in England in terms of first class and second class post and all the various innovations made over the past ten or 20 years, which led to its downfall. Efficiency is extremely important in the postal service because people will not use it if it is not efficient. They will use whatever courier service is available or any other method of sending letters and parcels unless they have what can be seen as an efficient service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest to what the Senator said. The powers of the regulator in the postal sector arise from Directive 97/67 on common rules for the development of the internal market of community postal services and the improvement of quality of service. S.I. 310 of 2000 transposes Directive 97/67 into Irish law. Neither the EU directive nor the statutory instrument gives the regulator the power to monitor efficiency. The directive refers to the provision of a universal service and the wording of section 12(1)(<i>c</i>) reflects its intent. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to extend the objectives of the commission beyond the directive to promoting the development of an efficient postal sector as a function which is not envisaged either by the directive or the subsequent S.I. 310 of 2000.</P>
      <P>The main focus of the directive is on fair competition and quality of service. The efficiency of a postal operator is an internal matter for the management of the individual postal company. The regulation of efficiency would involve far more detailed intervention in the operations of a company than is necessary to achieve the objectives envisaged by the directive. Hence, I cannot accept the amendment as proposed.</P>

      <P>All the time in the House I am told about European directives and that they have to be provided for word for word and so forth. However, I have seen the way in which they are interpreted in other countries. I once spoke to the Minister about sustainable energy competitions and was told by the Department that we had to hold competitions here. I was present at a meeting where this matter was discussed and told that other countries do not interpret matters in exactly the same way as we do. For example, in terms of sustainable energy, the Germans decided to give, say, DM6 for solar energy per kilowatt, DM7 for wind energy per kilowatt or whatever. However, we appear to be in a set of circumstances where we interpret European directives very narrowly.</P>
      <P>Surely we want an efficient postal service. I cannot believe the Minister of State does not want the commission to promote an efficient postal service. All the time the buck is passed to Brussels. After all, the interpretations in various countries of EU directives are not necessarily all the same. If we say we want an efficient postal service, why can we not provide for this?</P>

      <P>I did not table any amendments to the legislation at this juncture. However, I have some suggestions to make on a few sections of the Bill. Perhaps they will be considered on Report Stage. Amendments seem to be confrontational and trying to enforce them by a voting system in the House seems to be a futile exercise. I presume the Minister of State is anxious to have the best legislation possible which is what we are all aiming at.</P>
      <P>With regard to section 12, specifically I thought the Minister of State might refer to promoting the Internet given the role it is playing in the commercial life of the country. It is the vehicle for the future, by which we will do business and communicate. It is gaining a significant foothold in both business and the lives of domestic users. A line or two promoting it in this section would be of benefit to the legislation. It would signal the Government's commitment and interest in ensuring the Internet will continue as a main source of communication within the State and in a global context.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>When a public utility has a near monopoly, the measurement of performance is fundamental to consumers. The Minister of State has pointed to the EU directive, and the correct approach may not be to have the regulator responsible for this. Creating competition should be the responsibility of the regulator, however, and the greater the competition the more efficient the company will have to become in order to survive. Competition is one of the best yardsticks in defining efficiency. I have some sympathy with the Senator's point that where you have a near monopoly, efficiency is a huge factor. Accelerating competition within this sector is the <Col N="1181" />single most effective thing one can do to ensure efficiency because survival will depend on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to Senator Henry at the outset, when S.I. 310 was passed, it gave additional powers to the regulator to implement Directive 97/67/EC of 2000 and monitor the universal services obligation requirements of An Post, monitor compliance with general principles, set and monitor quality of service standards, approve price increases in the reserve area and monitor accounting standards. This role is common to all national regulatory authorities in the EU. In terms of ensuring efficiency in the postal sector, the regulator has the power to approve or not approve prices increases in the reserved area and to monitor quality of service standards, both of which are valuable tools in improving efficiency in the sector.</P>
      <P>Part of the postal market is already open to competition and the transposition of the amending directive will provide for further competition in the sector. An Post is therefore already facing competition in part of the postal market. With the increasing liberalisation of the market it will face increasing competition over the next few years. The existing powers enjoyed by the regulator and the increasing competition in the market will prove incentives for increased efficiency among postal operators. A reference in the Bill to efficiency measures is not required.</P>
      <P>In response to Senator Caffrey, I refer to section 12, subsection (2)(<i>b</i>) which states:</P>
      <P>In so far as contributing to the development of the internal market is concerned&ndash;</P>
      <P>(i) removing remaining obstacles to the provision of electronic communication networks, electronic communications services and associated services at Community level</P>
      <P>(ii) encouraging the establishment and development of trans-European networks and the interoperability of transnational services and end-to-end connectivity,</P>
      <P>(iii) ensuring that, in similar circumstances, there is no discrimination in the treatment of undertakings providing electronic communications networks and services and associated facilities, and</P>
      <P>(iv) co-operating with electronic communications national regulatory authorities in other Member States of the Community and with the Commission of the Community in a transparent manner to ensure the development of consistent regulatory practice and the consistent application of Community law in this field.</P>
      <P>The Senator will see from this that we are totally committed to ensuring a global, efficient communications network, and there should be no impediments placed in the way of those networks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1182" />The new commission has the function of regulating electronic communications networks, including the Internet, as set out in the definitions in section 2. The Internet is a major tool of communication on a global basis and is critically important to a small island nation so that we can do business from any part of this island to any part of the world. The opportunities created in this Bill will enhance the power of the commission to ensure the Internet and electronic network system, and the investment we are making in connectivity, can be maximised in the interests of all our citizens.</P>

      <P>It seems extraordinary that, in section 12, subsection (1)(<i>b</i>), the commission is described as having the following function:</P>
      <P>to ensure the efficient management and use of the radio frequency spectrum and numbers from the national numbering scheme in the State in accordance with a direction under <i>section 13</i>.</P>
      <P>Yet when we get down to subsection (1)(<i>c</i>), we cannot have an efficient universal postal service. Why can the commission promote efficiency in the area of radio frequency spectrums but not in the postal service? I am sure the Minister wants an efficient postal service, but why is the term &ldquo;efficient&rdquo; acceptable in subsection (1)(<i>a</i>) but not (1)(<i>b</i>)? I am not happy to be fobbed off with claims that the EU directive must be followed to the letter because I have seen that increasingly it is not in other places.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Henry is confusing different issues pertaining to subsections (1)(<i>a</i>) and (1)(<i>b</i>). Subsection (1)(<i>a</i>) outlines the function of the regulator to ensure absolute efficiency in managing the radio spectrum. This refers to communications, the waves, the system and the transmission.</P>
      <P>Subsection (1)(<i>b</i>) moves on to the postal services. Responsibility in law for the efficient running of the postal services in this country rests with An Post, the registered company responsible for the delivery of a universal postal service across this island and into the international sphere. One subsection is technological, while the other deals with the delivery of postal services. The responsibility for the first rests with the commissioners, that is, the director today and the commissioners tomorrow. On that basis, it would be unwise to compound the situation by transferring responsibility for efficiency from one organisation to another.</P>
      <P>The management of the radio frequency spectrum does not involve regulating the efficiency of individual companies. It relates to the efficiency of the commission in managing the spectrum. We are not comparing like with like.</P>

This is consistent with the provisions of the new European regulatory framework for electronic communications. Section 12 sets out the guiding principles under which the commission is to operate. There had been criticism from some quarters of the existing legislation that it did not lay down guiding principles for the director. The new European directives on electronic communications specify the objectives which national regulatory authorities must follow. Section 12 is based largely on the text of the European directive. However, one provision of the directive had not been incorporated into section 12. This was the obligation on national regulatory authorities to facilitate technological neutrality.

If the Minister decided to amend the draft direction before issuing it in the light of comments received, the section as currently drafted could be interpreted as requiring the Minister to re-publish it. This could result in endless delays in issuing a direction. It is proposed therefore to make specific provision to enable representations to be made to the Minister about the proposed direction and enable the Minister to issue an amended draft direction following consideration of the representations. Amendments Nos. 11 and 12 are consequential amendments adjusting the subsequent references in the light of amendment No. 9.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 14, lines 40 to 42, to delete subsection (5).</P>
      <P>I proposed these amendments on the grounds that the commission is totally under the supervision of the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy. The competitions will be controlled by the Minister for Finance, as indicated in subsection (4)(<i>b</i>):</P>
      <P>the means by which entitlements to use such spectrum may be assigned (including appropriate fees)</P>
      <P>That appears fine until we read subsection (5), which states:</P>
      <P>A direction under <i>subsection (1)</i> relating to fees referred to in <i>subsection (4)(b</i>) may only be given with the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has control of the competition. I thought the most important aspect of the regulations was their independence. It now appears the commission is to be reduced to a subdivision of the Department of Finance. The only area in which the commission appears to have <Col N="1185" />independence is the acceptance of individual undertakings for small schemes. This section of the Bill will spancel the commission in the competitions it undertakes.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will be able to accept amendment No. 13. With the exception of the Competition Authority Bill, 2001, I examined other Bills relating to the regulators and, as I recall, the Competition Authority did not have any restrictions regarding staff. I understand the reason for restricting staff numbers, but I do not understand the thinking behind subsection (3)(<i>a</i>) that determines the grading, remuneration and other conditions of staff to be appointed to the office of the commission. I do not believe any of the other regulators had to accept such restrictions regarding the employment of staff. Staff requirements will vary from time to time and consultants are often employed on a short-term basis. It is ridiculous that the commission should have to refer to the Department of Finance every time it wishes to have its instructions changed. I cannot understand why this subsection is included in the legislation. Perhaps the Minister's officials can tell me whether a similar rule applied to the Competition Authority, but I do not think so.</P>

The commission will not be able to buy cornflakes without asking for the Minister's permission. Such a role is unduly interfering. The commission should have more autonomy. It does not need the Minister for Finance looking over its shoulder at every twist and turn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will respond to amendments Nos. 10 and 13 together. I thank Senator Henry and Senator Caffrey for their contribution to the debate. Subsection (5) provides that a direction issued by the Minister relating to fees charged by the commission for the use of the radio frequency spectrum may only be given with the consent of the Minister for Finance. We are talking about a national asset. The radio frequency spectrum is a scarce national resource and, as such, fees charged by the State for its use by private sector entities are a matter of public policy. Government control of licence fees for radio frequency spectrum is the norm in other European countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment seeks to eliminate the legitimate role of the Minister for Finance in determining the appropriate level of fees to be charged for the use of this scarce national resource. The Minister has a responsibility to ensure that the fees charged adequately reflect the value of the spectrum assigned while taking due account of non-financial obligations and the importance of the development of the telecoms infrastructure in Ireland. This is a national asset and we are asking a commission to regulate it and charge fees to private companies for its use. Such companies and individuals will make a large <Col N="1186" />amount of money from their use of this national asset and it is important that the State has the double security valve of a commission that is overseen by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Neither the Minister for Finance nor the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, could accept amendment No. 13. Subsection (3)(<i>a</i>) provides that the commission may determine the number, grading and remuneration of its staff, with the consent of the Minister for Public Enterprise and the Minister for Finance. In legislation for the establishment of State-sponsored bodies, it is common practice that the number, grading and remuneration of staff are subject to the consent of the relevant Minister and the Minister for Finance. Similar provisions are contained in the Aviation Regulation Act, 2001, and in the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999. The provision is necessary to ensure the co-ordination of the Government's budgetary policies and its human resource strategy across all State and public bodies. It is also necessary to ensure the satisfactory operation of industrial relations machinery in the public service as well as continuity of delivery of public services. Consequently, I decline both of Senator Henry's amendments. I think that she will now understand the reasoning behind these aspects of the legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">

The original proposal set a maximum fine of &euro;1 million in respect of persons found guilty of being in breach of the conditions of a licence. The amendment proposed will increase the maximum fine to &euro;4 million, or 10% of turnover, whichever is the greater. It brings the penalties for breaches of regulatory obligations in the communications sector into line with penalties laid down in the Competition Bill for breaches of competition law.

      <P>I wish there was a sense of urgency in the section in order that those who dig up the roads for electronic infrastructure reinstate them immediately. This causes considerable problems for some, like myself, who live on a main thoroughfare. The reinstatement of roads is frequently delayed and not done to the standard one <Col N="1190" />would like where hot asphalt is driven over immediately leaving potholes in the road and it takes months to get something done about the problem. As I said during the debate on the Road Traffic Bill and driving penalties, we need to do something about road surfaces, currently a very serious problem in the city.</P>

      <P>Subsection (18) requires network operators to provide information on request to road authorities in regard to their underground infrastructure. This amendment will have the effect of deleting the creation of an offence for failure to comply with this obligation. To ensure compliance with this obligation it was originally intended to create an offence for failure to comply with it. However, on further consideration, it has been decided that the provisions of section 19 will be a sufficient and more appropriate means of enforcing compliance with the obligation. If we were to retain provision for an offence, it would be necessary to include reference to it in subsection (21). Accordingly, I hope the House will agree to the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with Senator Henry on road openings and so on. I am aware of instances where roads with a very good tarmacadam surface and a lifespan of approximately 20 years were dug up within a matter of months. No matter how well or evenly the work is carried out these roads will subsequently be like patchwork quilts, which is a pity given the expenditure invested in order to improve them. I have argued with the council that there should be full reinstatement rather than just repairing of cuts in roads. No matter how well the work is done it does not seem to be a properly finished job, detracts from the aesthetics of the area concerned and very often leads to potholes as a result of subsidance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As local authorities repair roads and lay good quality tarmacadam surfaces which will last for <Col N="1191" />many years, they are putting ducting in place which facilitates the networking companies. I would like them to be given an incentive to recoup the cost of this work. This could be done by giving access to the ducting on the basis that they can charge the full cost of doing the cut and reinstating the road for each of the networks making an application. The council would recover a supplementary cost which might obviate areas where the services might not be applied for in the future but where ducting has been laid. It seems minor but it is important. Where good quality paving is being done there should be an undertaking by the local authority to ensure some cohesion between the bodies so that it can be done in a way that will facilitate the networks but not undo the investment already made on the roads.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators Henry and Walsh referred to the provision for a road authority to impose charges for the cost of reinstating a road. This provision, contained in section 4(5), is an improvement on the existing regime where there is no such provision. Telecommunications operators can be made liable only for the openings for which they are responsible. However, the Bill allows the council to cover reinstatement charges. Sharing of ducts will eliminate openings and we hope there will be more efficiency in this area.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Senators that it is important that we have a uniform application of the regulation to reinstate roads. However, we must take account of a number of issues in regard to this such as the traffic situation, peak and off-peak times and atmospheric and weather conditions which might affect the application of tarmacadam or other materials to roads. We want value for the investment made, efficiency for the surfaces laid and durability and longevity. It is critical that the applications be made in dry weather. Taking these issues into account we hope the changes we have proposed in the Bill will allow for authorities to be recompensed, at their discretion, where utilities have breached the regulations.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 56.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>This section deals with cost apportionment where a relocation is required due to road improvements. I refer specifically to subsection (4), where a road authority, on an application by a network operator for installation, gives notice that the road is due to be improved by the authority within 18 months, then it does not incur the cost of relocating. That is a welcome provision but could the 18 month timeframe be extended? Between now and Report Stage, will the Minister consider extending the 18 months to <Col N="1192" />30 months, particularly given that we have multi-annual roadwork programmes? It seems that 18 months is too short. While roadworks are often planned they depend on funding from the Exchequer. Will the Minister consider extending the timeframe by 12 months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator has made a good point. The section provides that if, despite having been given notice by the roads authority that it intends to realign the road for which the operator has sought consent to establish telecommunications infrastructure, within 18 months of the planned commencement of infrastructure re-establishment the operator goes ahead with the build out of infrastructure, the road authority will not be liable for the cost of relocating the infrastructure if the road realignment goes ahead within the 18 months. That time has been agreed with the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the local authorities and in the balance of interests it is seen as agreeable.</P>
      <P>We have a strong commitment to ensuring we have broadband connectivity delivered to all parts of the country and want to ensure that happens. We have also a major national development plan which is the responsibility of various Government Departments and statutory bodies and it is important that we manage it efficiently.</P>
      <P>If we are to lay major infrastructure, whether broadband connectivity or roads, a delay in either or one conflicting with the other could lead to problems. If I extended the timeframe to 30 months it could lead to procrastination in certain areas. Certain companies might have signed contracts but would still have 30 months, on another aspect of statutory law, removing them from the obligation of the contract and delaying the investment that might be required for the delivery of the infrastructure. That must be taken into account.</P>
      <P>The Bill has been through public consultation with all the relevant bodies. We have agreed the bottom line on the basis of fairness and in the interests of the common good. We feel that 18 months is the most operable figure.</P>

      <P>The conditions are similar in all three Bills &ndash; the two that have been enacted and this Bill which I hope will be enacted soon. It is important that we have consistency. We cannot have a situation whereby one authority can use surplus resources to perhaps create new posts, structures or systems while another entirely dependent on the Exchequer but carrying out an equally important job for the nation is impeded in terms of flexibility because it does not have the necessary resources. This is the case in order to maintain the balance of efficiency in financial management, fairness in structures, promotions, grading, accommodation and facilities. It has served us well during the years and maintained a common denominator of opportunity for those who enter and move through the service or others from outside to enter. It would be foolish to change it in the Bill as distinct from others.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Minister of State on his common sense approach to introducing this legislation which contains a series of practical provisions.

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for steering this important legislation through the House. I regret that I was unable to make the input on Second Stage that I would have wished. The current climate did not allow me to put the necessary time into the debate; I am referring to the political climate, rather than the weather. While I regret this, the Bill was well marshalled through the House. I thank Senator Coghlan for standing in for me during the debate. I welcome the legislation and hope it will make a major contribution to freeing up the communications industry which is a vital component of the economy. The industry is in its infancy, given the extent of the roll-out of the communications sector generally and the astounding developments that have taken place in the past four or five years. If the Bill, when enacted, helps to continue this progress, it will be well worthwhile.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister of State on bringing the Bill through the House. He has been greatly helped by my amendments, although he explained very carefully the reasons they could not be accepted. The Bill is important. A great deal of work must have been put into it by the Minister of State's officials. It is a practical measure which deals with an important industrial sector. During the debate we have dealt with everything from the ether to the felling of trees, including those covered by preservation orders. I congratulate the Minister of State and his officials on introducing this comprehensive Bill.</P>

      <P>I thank all Senators for their contributions to the debate. I sincerely thank Senators Henry, Caffrey and Walsh, all of whom spoke eloquently and excellently on the Bill. Their contributions have demonstrated a keen awareness of the importance of the communications sector to the social and economic development of the economy.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides for the creation of a commission for communications regulation, the dissolution of the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation and the transfer of its functions to the new commission. It provides for a substantial increase in penalties for breaches of licence conditions by operators and the improved management of public road openings for the laying of telecommunications infrastructure. The importance of the Bill cannot be underestimated. It will be vital to support the unprecedented and ever-increasing pace of change in this important sector in the country. The electronic communications sector remains an important building block for the development of the information society, and the regulatory framework for the sector plays a major part in enabling it to move towards the information society.</P>
      <P>The reform of the regulatory framework for the sector set out in the Bill takes account of a number of developments since the existing arrangements for regulation of the sector were put in place under the Telecommunications (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1996. The contents of the Bill represent the outcome of detailed consideration and the balancing of various options. It benefits from substantial public consultation and debate on various approaches. We are satisfied that the Bill represents the optimum balance between various avenues of approach, taking into account the interests of the consumer, industry players and the general public interest and common good.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, has placed on the record of the House her appreciation of the work of the director, Etain Doyle, and her staff in the past five years. I underline the Minister's appreciation of the work of the director and her staff and welcome their continued availability to the new commission so that they can bring the benefit of their experience to the new body. Ms Doyle and her staff have done an outstanding job. We can be proud of them as distinguished public servants in a complex, professional area of importance. I thank them sincerely for their work and look forward to their continuing involvement as part of the new commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reform of the regime governing access to public roads for the construction of electronic communications infrastructure has been long awaited. The existing legislation dates back to the 1860s. The Bill brings legislation on this matter <Col N="1197" />up to date and I am sure it will be welcomed by everyone.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the Minister for Public Enterprise, I sincerely thank Senators who spoke and turned up to vote for their valuable contributions to the debate, the evolution and conclusion of the Bill and for facilitating its passage through the House. As someone who will face the national adjudication panel some time this year with reasonable optimism, I wish Senators every success in the future. I assure them that, given the opportunity, we will acknowledge their tremendous performances as valued Members of the Oireachtas and the democratic structure. I appreciate the great work done by the Seanad in ensuring we have the best possible legislation available to the people.</P>

    <Title>Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Bill, 2002: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators will be aware of the background to the Bill. The Government approved in principle the setting up of a tribunal of inquiry into allegations of misconduct on the part of certain members of the Garda Síochána in Donegal. The Government also decided to have amending legislation drafted to enable the tribunal to conduct its inquiry without prejudicing various court proceedings which have been instituted relating to the alleged misconduct.</P>
      <P>When dealing with parliamentary questions or motions relating to alleged misconduct by gardaí in Donegal, the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, consistently made it clear that he was not opposed to the holding of a public inquiry on the issue but that there was a real concern about the danger of prejudice to criminal and civil proceedings. He mentioned this problem specifically to the Dáil on 23 May 2001 and advised Deputies that he was seeking the advice of the Attorney General. His advice confirmed that the holding of such an inquiry at that time could have prejudiced the civil and criminal proceedings which had been instituted as a result of the alleged misconduct and that, on the basis of the information then to hand, the best course was to let the criminal and civil proceedings run their course. If matters were not fully ventilated during those proceedings, then a tribunal of inquiry could be established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Neither the criminal nor civil proceedings advanced quickly and there was real concern, which the Minister shared, about the length of time it was taking to bring the various inquiries and proceedings to finality. On 13 November 2001, the Minister announced that he was appointing an eminent legal person to examine the matter. Mr. Shane Murphy, senior counsel, <Col N="1198" />was appointed shortly after by the Minister with the following terms of reference:</P>
    <P>To conduct an independent review and undertake a thorough examination of the action taken and of relevant papers held by An Garda Síochána and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform relevant to allegations that members of An Garda Síochána in the Donegal Division engaged in criminal, unethical or unprofessional behaviour, particularly in the context of the investigation into the death of Mr. Richard Barron and with regard to the finds of bomb-making equipment;</P>
    <P>To advise, taking into account relevant criminal, civil and disciplinary aspects and mindful of the public interest, whether all appropriate steps had been taken with due diligence and expedition;</P>
    <P>To advise what further measures, if any, may now be taken to bring those who have engaged in criminal, unethical or unprofessional behaviour to account at the earliest opportunity to address public concerns;</P>
    <P>and</P>
    <P>In this regard, to submit a Report to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>The Minister received Mr. Murphy's report on 30 January 2002. While recognising the need to ensure that civil and criminal proceedings were not compromised, Mr. Murphy endorsed the view that, &ldquo;A Tribunal of Inquiry represents the only comprehensive method of inquiry to resolve outstanding issues of fundamental public importance.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The enactment of the Bill will allow a tribunal of inquiry to be established to investigate matters in Donegal without prejudice to criminal proceedings. I am pleased that Mr. Frederick Morris, former President of the High Court, has agreed to be the sole member of the tribunal. The Minister is in the process of consulting the Opposition parties on the Government's proposed terms of reference. He will try to facilitate them by taking on board any suggestions of theirs which could help us reach as broad a consensus as possible as well as a satisfactory conclusion to this matter.</P>
    <P>A further consideration underlying the legislation is that the sole member of the Tribunal of Inquiry into Certain Planning Matters and Payments asked that the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts be amended to state clearly that a tribunal may comprise more than one member and to provide expressly for a reserve member. Mr. Justice Flood suggested that this was necessary to avoid any possible challenge to the process of the tribunal. He also suggested that it should be provided that, where any of the full members of the tribunal is unable to act for any reason, the tribunal should be able to proceed to hear evidence on the basis of the remaining two <Col N="1199" />members and the reserve member. The Bill responds to Mr Justice Flood's requests.</P>
    <P>The timescale for consideration of the Bill in both Houses is regrettably but inevitably short. It passed all Stages in the Dáil on Friday and needs to be passed by the Seanad today. The Bill must be enacted before the Easter recess so that the Dáil can pass the necessary resolution pursuant to it, which will be tabled by my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, to provide for the appointment of additional members and a reserve member to the Flood tribunal. For this reason, the House will be asked to pass an earlier signature motion later this afternoon.</P>
    <P>The Bill has, as I have indicated, two main purposes. First, it will facilitate the work of the tribunal of inquiry into the Donegal allegations by ensuring that a risk of prejudice to any pending criminal trial will not arise from the tribunal's proceedings. Second, it will provide a clear legal basis for the appointment of additional and reserve members of tribunals, as requested by Mr. Justice Flood. The Bill also provides that a tribunal may appoint investigators to assist it in carrying out its functions.</P>
    <P>Section 1 is a standard interpretation provision. Section 2(<i>a</i>) of the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921, provides that a tribunal can exclude the public from its proceedings where, in its opinion, it is in the public interest expedient to do so for reasons connected with the subject matter of the inquiry or the nature of the evidence to be given. Section 2 of the Bill amends this by adding a provision that a tribunal can, in particular, avail of its power to exclude the public if there is a risk of prejudice to criminal proceedings. Thus, it elaborates on the existing power to exclude the public by making clear that one of the circumstances in which this can be done is when there is a risk of prejudice to criminal proceedings. It should be noted that this provision applies to proceedings which are in existence at the time the tribunal is hearing the relevant evidence, not possible future proceedings. The Attorney General's office advises that it would be inappropriate to use the word &lsquo;existing' as this is already implicit in the word &lsquo;proceedings'.</P>
    <P>Section 3 deals with the situation which would arise if a tribunal reports at a time when criminal proceedings are pending in respect of a matter connected with the tribunal's inquiries. This is not adverted to at all in the tribunals of inquiry legislation as it stands. Subsection (1) provides that the person to whom the tribunal reports, for example a Minister or the Clerk of the Dáil, may apply to the High Court for directions regarding the publication of the report if he or she considers that publication might prejudice the criminal proceedings.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that it is only the person to whom the tribunal is to report, as specified in the instrument establishing it, who can apply to the court <Col N="1200" />under this section for a direction. A person who may be criticised in the report and who, therefore, would like to prevent publication has no standing to bring an application to the court under the section. Clearly, this provision is necessary because there is little point in having the provision for hearing evidence in private under section 2 if the tribunal's report has to be published on completion though criminal proceedings are still in existence. Indeed, I consider that publication of a tribunal's report could have greater potential to prejudice criminal proceedings than evidence heard by a tribunal in public in that the report will include the evidence, or a summary of it, together with the possibly negative findings made by the tribunal, on the basis of the evidence, about the conduct of the person who is the subject of the criminal proceedings.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) provides that, before determining the application, the court may hear the Attorney General, whose duties include representing the public interest before courts and tribunals, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the defendants in the criminal proceedings. Subsection (3) provides that the court may direct that the report or any part of it be not published for a specified period of time or until the court so directs. Subsection (4) provides that the court may, if it considers it appropriate, hear an application under this section otherwise than in public. There would be little point in having a provision to facilitate non-publication of a report because of the risk of prejudice to a criminal trial if the contents of the report were disclosed during the very proceedings the purpose of which is to determine whether publication should take place.</P>
    <P>Section 4 deals with membership of tribunals and inserts seven new subsections in section 2 of the Act of 1979. The new subsection (3) provides for the appointment of additional members to tribunals at any time after the tribunal is appointed. The existing section 2(1) of the 1979 Act already provides for the appointment of more than one member when the tribunal is initially established in that it states that a tribunal may consist of one or more than one person. The new subsection (4) provides that, subject to section 6 of the 1979 Act, a decision or determination of a tribunal may be that of a majority of its members and, in the case of an equal division, the chairperson shall decide. The phrase &ldquo;may be that of a majority of its members&rdquo;, rather than &ldquo;shall be.&rdquo; is to take account of the possibility that decisions and determinations may be unanimous. The phrase &ldquo;Subject to section 6.&rdquo; means that decisions on the award of costs are to continue to be made by the chairperson if the tribunal consists of more than one member, as provided for by that section.</P>
    <P>Subsection (5) provides for the appointment of a member to replace the chairperson if he or she is unable to continue to act. It also envisages the situation in which the chairperson may step down from the chair but continue as an ordinary member. Subsection (6) provides that the appointment of additional members under subsection (3) <Col N="1201" />and the designation of a new chairperson under subsection (5), shall be done by way of an amendment of the instrument by which the tribunal was appointed in accordance with section 1A of the 1921 Act, which was inserted by the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1998, except that consent of the tribunal to the identity of appointees will not be required.</P>
    <P>I think I should explain this in a little more detail. The 1998 (No. 2) Act provides for the amendment of the instrument establishing a tribunal in two situations, first where the tribunal has consented to the proposed amendment following consultation between it and the Attorney General on behalf of the Minister in question and, second, where the tribunal has itself requested the amendment. This provision was, essentially, intended to deal with changes in terms of reference, that is the matters which the tribunal is to investigate. The two circumstances mentioned in the Act arose in relation to the Flood tribunal and, in fact, gave rise to this provision, as Senators will recall. However, while it is appropriate to require the consent of the tribunal to the appointment of additional members and to a change in the list of matters it is to investigate, it would be wrong, in my view, to require its consent to the identity of the new members or new chairperson. Accordingly, subsection (6) provides a procedure for the appointment of new members or a new chairperson by way of a modification of what is provided for in the 1998 (No. 2) Act for the amendment of instruments generally. Most important, from the point of view of this House, is the fact that the amendment of any instrument shall be made pursuant to a resolution of both Houses, and so the Dáil and Seanad will have the opportunity to debate the changes proposed for the tribunal.</P>
    <P>Subsection (7) was inserted by a Committee Stage amendment moved by the Minister in the Dáil and provides that an appointment of additional members or a designation of a new chairperson shall not affect decisions, determinations or inquiries made or other actions taken by the tribunal before the appointment or designation. This amendment was suggested by Mr. Justice Flood in a letter to the Attorney General last Thursday and the Attorney General advised the Minister to move it in the Dáil. Mr. Justice Flood fears that, if there is not a saving provision of this kind, decisions which he has taken and orders which he has made may be subject to legal challenge because the tribunal will then consist of three persons rather than a sole member.</P>
    <P>Subsection (8) provides that a member of a tribunal who is unable to act shall be deemed not to be a member for the period of that inability. With reference to subsection (9), as I said earlier, one of the points made by Mr. Justice Flood was that it should be provided that, where any of the full members of the tribunal is unable to act for any reason, the tribunal should be able to proceed to hear evidence on the basis of the remaining members and reserve member. Subsection (9) <Col N="1202" />is relevant to this proposal in that it provides that a tribunal may continue to act notwithstanding one or more vacancies if it is satisfied that the legal rights of any person affected would not be unduly prejudiced.</P>
    <P>An example of where a tribunal might consider that it should not continue to act because the legal rights of a person would be unduly prejudiced would arise if the original tribunal member has left the tribunal and that person was the sole member when particular evidence was heard, while the additional member or members were not members or reserve members at that time. The tribunal might, in those circumstances, conclude that it would unduly prejudice a person's legal rights were it to make findings on evidence it did not hear and to which it has access, perhaps, only in the form of transcripts. On the other hand, the tribunal might consider that it would not unduly prejudice a person's rights if it made findings in a situation in which a member was not acting as such for a brief period. It will be a matter for the tribunal to decide.</P>
    <P>Section 5 deals with reserve members. Subsection (1) provides for the appointment of reserve members by the instrument establishing the tribunal or an instrument amending that instrument. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government will, assuming the appropriate resolutions are passed by both Houses, make an instrument appointing a reserve member to the Flood tribunal and, similarly, one or more reserve members can be appointed by the instrument setting up any future tribunal on any subject.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) sets out the role of a reserve member. He or she may sit with the tribunal during its proceedings, consider oral evidence, examine documents produced or sent in evidence and be present at deliberations of the tribunal. However, he or she may not otherwise participate in the proceedings or deliberations and may not seek to influence the tribunal in its decisions or deliberations. The principle on which this provision is based is that the reserve member, though not a member of the tribunal, will be fully <i>au fait </i>with its work and will be in a position to replace a full member if that becomes necessary. This model for the role of the reserve member is taken exactly &ndash; except for drafting changes &ndash; from that set out in resolutions of the Dáil and Seanad, passed on 5 July last, in relation to the appointment of a reserve member to the Flood tribunal at a stage when it was proposed to proceed with the appointment of such a member on the basis of the legislation as it stands. Subsection (3) provides for the appointment of a reserve member to be a full member, if a full member is for any reason unable to continue to act as such.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) &ndash; again in line with the Dáil and Seanad resolutions of last July &ndash; provides that the appointment of a reserve member as a full member may be deemed to be operative from a prior date. This shall not be earlier than the date on which he or she became a reserve <Col N="1203" />member. This provision can be best understood in the context of a tribunal whose work can be divided into two or more modules. The reserve member might be appointed as such during the hearing of evidence part way through the first module and, in the course of the second module, it might be necessary to appoint him or her to be a full member. In that case, it would be appropriate to backdate the appointment as a full member to the beginning of the second module. The appointee would be regarded as a full member for the whole of the second module but it would not be necessary or appropriate to deem him or her to have been a full member during the whole or part of the first module since that might already have been the subject of findings and a report by the tribunal as it was then constituted.</P>
    <P>Where the appointment as a full member is backdated, subsection (5) provides that this shall not affect decisions or determinations made before the actual appointment. Were it otherwise, a situation could arise in which a decision of the tribunal, validly taken by a majority at the time, might be later regarded as invalid because it would not be the decision of the majority when the new member's appointment is backdated. As I have already outlined, section 4 provides that a decision of a tribunal consisting of more than one member is to be that of a majority. A Committee Stage amendment, made by the Dáil on the Minister's proposal, in line with the terminology used in section 4(7), inserts the reference to &ldquo;inquiries made or other actions taken&rdquo; in section 5(5). This was at the suggestion of Mr. Justice Flood, who considers that this language strengthens the provision.</P>
    <P>The final subsection of section 5, subsection (6), provides that the appointment of a reserve member to an existing tribunal, or of a reserve member to be a full member of a tribunal, shall be by the same procedure as I outlined earlier in relation to the appointment of additional members and of a new chairperson, that is, the instrument appointing the tribunal will be appropriately amended pursuant to resolutions of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Section 6, on investigators, is designed to remedy a defect in the existing legislation in relation to the power to compel a person to co-operate in a tribunal's preliminary investigation. It is well recognised in the case law that has built up over the past decade or so in relation to tribunals of inquiry that the work of such tribunals involves a number of stages, namely, a preliminary investigation of the evidence available; the determination of what is considered to be relevant; the service of such evidence on the persons likely to be affected by it; the public hearing of witnesses in regard to such evidence and the cross-examination of witnesses by or on behalf of the persons affected by their evidence; and the preparation of a report and the making of recommendations based on the facts established at the public hearings.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1204" />In 1999, the Supreme Court held in the case of Lawlor <i>v.</i> Flood, 1999 3 IR, that the principal powers of a tribunal under the legislation were to enforce the attendance of witnesses, to provide for their examination before the tribunal and to compel the production of documents and that the examination of witnesses, particularly those who were not willing to co-operate during the initial stages, was not a matter which, in the absence of express statutory authority, could be delegated by a tribunal to any other person or body. In other words, while a person can be compelled to attend before a tribunal itself to answer questions, she or he cannot be compelled to answer questions of the tribunal's legal team in the course of the preliminary investigation. Section 6 deals with this by providing for the appointment of investigators and for their duties and powers.</P>
    <P>Under subsection (1), a tribunal may appoint investigators with the approval of the Minister who appointed the tribunal and the consent of the Minister for Finance or the approval of the Government if the Government appointed the tribunal. Subsection (2) provides that the appointment of investigators shall be for such term and subject to such terms and conditions as the tribunal may determine with the approval of the relevant Minister or the Government, as the case may be.</P>
    <P>Some have suggested that the requirements for ministerial approval and the consent of the Minister for Finance open the way for the Government to frustrate the work of tribunals by not permitting them to appoint investigators. This is clearly an absurd view as I cannot imagine a Government, accountable as it is to these Houses and to public opinion and subject as it to rigorous scrutiny in the media, attempting to hinder a tribunal by unreasonably and for improper motives withholding approval of the appointment of investigators by a tribunal. This provision is nothing more than one for essential ministerial oversight of the expenditure of voted funds and it is a provision of a type which appears regularly in the Statute Book. For example, the employment equality legislation provides that the members of the Equality Authority hold office and receive remuneration on such terms as the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance may determine. It also provides that the Minister may appoint such number of persons to be staff of the authority as may be approved by the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance. Similarly, the legislation provides that staff may be appointed by the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to assist the Director of Equality Investigations. I have not heard it argued that the independence of statutory bodies, to which provisions of this kind apply, has been compromised by such provisions which, as I have said, are commonplace in the Acts of the Oireachtas dealing with staff and resources.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) of section 6 specifies what the role of investigators is to be. This is to assist the <Col N="1205" />tribunal in the performance of its functions by carrying out preliminary investigations into matters relevant to the inquiry. In doing this, they are subject to the direction and control of the tribunal.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) of section 6 provides that investigators will have power to require persons to give information, produce documents and answer questions and it imposes a duty on persons to comply with such requirements. Furthermore, under subsection (5), a person's answers may be reduced to writing and the investigator may require the person to sign the document. There are a number of precedents for this type of provision, one example being section 10 of the Companies Act, 1990, in relation to company inspectors.</P>
    <P>The most notable characteristic of the powers being given to investigators is that they parallel the powers of the tribunal itself, except that they will be used at the preliminary investigation stage. Accordingly, I do not propose that the investigators should examine persons on oath &ndash; that is for the tribunal itself if it decides that the answers given by a person to the investigator merit the calling of that person to give evidence at a public hearing of the tribunal.</P>
    <P>Subsection (6) provides that if a person refuses to comply with the requirement of an investigator, the latter may, with the consent of the tribunal, apply to the High Court which may order the person to comply with the requirement, thus making further non-compliance a contempt of court. This method of enforcement of the investigator's requirements is essentially the same as that provided for in relation to tribunals in section 4 of the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Act, 1997.</P>
    <P>Under subsection (7), a person who is required by an investigator to give information, produce documents or answer questions shall be entitled to the same privileges and immunities as a witness before the High Court. For example, such a person, if sued for defamation as a result of what he or she says to an investigator or what is in a document produced to an investigator, would have the same privilege as if they had given this evidence or produced the document as part of High Court proceedings.</P>
    <P>Subsection (8) protects the confidentiality of information obtained by investigators subject to the overall control of the tribunal. It will frequently be the case that the preliminary investigation discloses material that is of no further interest to the tribunal, perhaps because it falls outside its terms of reference. The confidentiality of this material must be respected and subsection (8) so provides. Subsection (9) provides that an investigator shall be furnished with a warrant as evidence of his of her authority to exercise the very significant powers of the office.</P>
    <P>Section 7 makes it a summary offence for a person not to comply with the requirement of an investigator or to obstruct or hinder him or her. The penalty for such offences will be a fine not <Col N="1206" />exceeding &euro;3,000 and-or imprisonment for a maximum of 12 months. It should be noted that we are not providing for trial on indictment, which is provided for in the 1979 Act for broadly similar offences in respect of a tribunal. Section 7 and the power to seek a High Court order under section 6(6) represent adequate and proportionate enforcement mechanisms to ensure that investigators will be fully effective in carrying out their functions on behalf of tribunals.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides that a statement or admission made to an investigator cannot be used as evidence against the person making it in any criminal proceedings. This parallels section 5 of the 1979 Act which deals with tribunals themselves and, as such, it is also necessary in respect of investigators.</P>
    <P>Section 9 increases the maximum fines for offences relating to failure to co-operate with, or to the obstruction of, a tribunal from £500 to &euro;3,000 on summary conviction and from £10,000 to &euro;300,000 in the case of conviction on indictment. The fine of &euro;3,000 on summary conviction is the maximum appropriate amount according to the advice of the Office of the Attorney General. The increase in the maximum fine on conviction on indictment is more than twentyfold and, even allowing for the length of time since the maximum was set in 1979, it is by any standard a very significant increase. It will show how seriously the Houses of the Oireachtas regard the offences to which the penalty applies. This section applies to offences committed after the passing of the Act, irrespective of whether the tribunal concerned was appointed before or after such passing.</P>
    <P>Section 10 deals with the application of the Act, which, except for sections 4, 5 and 9, shall apply to tribunals established after it is passed. The provisions with regard to membership of tribunals, reserve members and increased fines will apply to existing tribunals, while the sections on the exclusion of the public and publication of reports &ndash; where this might prejudice criminal proceedings &ndash; shall apply to future tribunals. It is not considered necessary to apply these provisions to existing tribunals, which have been functioning satisfactorily under the current law on these matters.</P>
    <P>The provisions applying to investigators, which are expressed in section 10(3), will not to apply to existing tribunals unless such application is provided for by an amendment to the instrument appointing the tribunal. In other words, existing tribunals could use investigators, provided their instrument of appointment is amended appropriately under the procedure in the 1998 (No. 2) Act which involves prior resolutions of both Houses.</P>
    <P>Section 11 is a standard provision which states that any expenses incurred by Ministers of the Government in the administration of the Act shall be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1207" />Section 12 is also a standard provision dealing with the Short Title and collective citation. This measure achieves a number of important objectives in that it ensures the tribunal of inquiry into the Donegal allegations can function properly, having regard to the existence of criminal proceedings. It also provides the legal basis for the planned enlargement of the Flood tribunal. The benefits of the provisions in respect of both these objectives and of the provisions on investigators will be available generally to tribunals in the future. Accordingly, I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. The last speaker on the last item of business before the House, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Treacy, paid tribute to the Seanad for its role in processing legislation by ensuring it was adequately examined and providing the best possible value in the legislative process. He would not say that if he was here to speak on this Bill.</P>
      <P>Sometimes one feels one is taking part in a parliamentary charade in which standing up and speaking will make no difference whatsoever. It might be as easy to tell the Minister of State to take her Bill away with her now because nothing we say here this evening will make the slightest difference. The Minister of State will not accept any changes as the Bill is rushed through all Stages in the space of a couple of hours or less. Most Opposition Senators feel there is little point pretending that the Bill is being examined in detail or that what we say will have any impact. The Bill will be whisked away to the Phoenix Park this evening to be signed and that will be that. I wonder what is our role in all this, but that is the position.</P>
      <P>When the history of the last ten years of the last century is written, it will almost certainly be dubbed the decade of the tribunals. Whether that decade becomes an age of tribunals, only time can tell, but we are on the way. We are only barely into the 21st century and already we are being asked to establish a second tribunal. There may be more in the pipeline. While this has been a long Parliament, during its lifetime we have had more motions relating to the establishment of tribunals of inquiry, amending their terms of reference and providing new statutory mechanisms to them than we had over the entire previous history of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State said that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, will send the Government's proposed terms of reference to the Opposition very soon and that he looks forward to consultation on the text of the appropriate resolution. He will try to facilitate the Opposition parties by taking on board any suggestions. Perhaps the Minister of State could elaborate on that and explain to <Col N="1208" />me exactly what that involves. I am confused, but the confusion may be my own fault.</P>
    <P>We are now rich in experience of the operation of tribunals and, clearly, it is time to establish a body to take an overall look at them. It should discover what lessons can be learned by going back to the beef tribunal and examining ways in which tribunals could be made more cost effective. The majority of people would like costs reduced because the fees paid to most lay people seem out of all proportion to those paid there. Most lawyers will say that they are making great sacrifices and giving up income by working for tribunals. If there are alternatives to tribunals, they should be investigated. The Committee of Public Accounts was very effective as a tribunal, but it was probably the only parliamentary committee to be so. We need to find out if greater use can be made of committees to carry out investigations, although it is clear from the judgment of the High Court that there are very real problems with that course. We have yet to see the decision of the Supreme Court. There may be alternatives to tribunals that can be found in procedures within existing systems.</P>
    <P>As the Minister of State said, there are two immediate reasons for bringing forward the Bill. The first is to appoint additional members to the Flood tribunal and the second is to establish a tribunal to investigate what has become known as the McBrearty affair. In neither case is there an objection to what is proposed, but there is a question about why it has taken so long to do something. In each case the Government had to be goaded and prodded, over a period of months, into taking these actions and we find, in the dying days of this Parliament, that the Bill is being rushed through in matter of hours, leaving us with no way of changing it. It is nine months since Mr. Justice Flood asked for new legislation and additional resources. It is strange that this process has taken so long, given that the Government frequently boasts that it set up these tribunals, although it was the Houses of the Oireachtas that did so after great pressure had been exerted by its Members and the public. Had the Government been serious about expediting this matter, the legislation could have been passed by both Houses many months ago.</P>
    <P>The McBrearty case was an issue for a long time but it was due to the persistent efforts of Deputy Jim Higgins and Deputy Howlin that it burst into the Lower House in a sensational fashion. It was one of the more sensational debates in the life of this Oireachtas. That followed a long period of delay and obstruction by the Minister who denied there was a problem and seemed to hope that, if left alone, it would go away. There was certainly no enthusiasm on the part of the Government to address it, even less to set up a tribunal. Eventually the Government gave way, gracelessly and under enormous pressure from the Opposition and the media. There has never been a credible explanation of why it <Col N="1209" />took so long. The Minister made a feeble attempt to explain but that did not cut much ice.</P>
    <P>I have no intention of discussing the issues which led to the establishment of the Donegal tribunal. They have been comprehensively ventilated in the Lower House, largely due to the efforts of Deputy Jim Higgins and Deputy Howlin, and have received extensive media coverage and analysis. There is little point in rehearsing them. What we are doing here today is largely pointless. We are being asked to rush all Stages of a Bill through the House in a period of hours. As there is no question of amendments being considered, it would be pointless to propose any. It would merely be a case of going through the motions and pretending some form of serious scrutiny will be given to the Bill by this House. It would mean pretending that the Minister is open minded, will listen to what we say and will carefully consider our amendments. That will not happen and I wonder why we are going through this charade.</P>
    <P>The Bill must be rushed through the House this evening. It will then be sent by Army outrider to the Phoenix Park where the President, after eating her boiled egg, will either sign it or refer it to the Supreme Court. After months of inaction and obstruction, the motorcycle is revving up outside to get the parchment to the park for signature.</P>
    <P>This Bill was examined in detail in the Lower House and strenuous objections were made to some provisions. Some Members considered it a flawed Bill and the flaws were outlined in detail. I will not insult the intelligence of Members of this House by repeating those points today. I hope that when this Bill is passed it will facilitate a full exposé of what happened in Donegal, allow the facts to be established and provide an opportunity to the Garda Síochána to clear the cloud of suspicion or root out any corruption that may exist.</P>
    <P>It is important that the tribunal allows this to happen in a way that is fair and expeditious. We do not want, three or five years hence, to discover the Donegal tribunal is seeking additional powers, extra members or more time. Alternatively, we might find ourselves in a situation where, due to one of the stranger aspects of this legislation &ndash; and I understand the need for it &ndash; the tribunal has long finished its business but its report still awaits publication. At any rate, we hope to see these matters treated with greater expedition than earlier tribunals were able to achieve.</P>
    <P>The Flood tribunal has done great work. It has had to withstand sustained attacks from powerful forces in this country. Indeed, some of those powerful forces were aided and abetted by tame journalists, whose agendas might not withstand close scrutiny and who systematically tried to undermine the standing and work of the tribunal. It is a great tribute to that tribunal that it withstood that sustained and systematic attack. The people who carried it out know who they are and should be ashamed of themselves.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1210" />However, from the point of view of the public, the tribunal has been at a virtual standstill for some time. It is true that important work is being done behind the scenes but there is now the hope that there can be some degree of expedition. It is important also to note the point about natural justice made by John McManus in <i>The Irish Times</i> yesterday. He talked about the injustice which attaches itself to people who have been declared to be &ldquo;under investigation&rdquo; by the tribunal. These people might find themselves living, for a period of a year or longer, under a cloud of suspicion, in some way guilty by association because they are under investigation. The assumption is that they have done something wrong.</P>
    <P>One well-known person, a distinguished former Member of this House, for a long period of time was described as being under investigation when his name appeared in the newspapers. He cleared his name. He was blameless, as anybody who knows him knew he would be. Nonetheless, for a long period he had to engage expensive lawyers and live with that situation. It is probably inevitable that this is part of the process but the tribunal should be aware of the need to move as quickly as possible in the interests of both those who are co-operating and those who are being investigated as they may well be as clear as the driven snow. Sometimes it can take a year or more and this is a serious injustice where people are blameless. I hope the Bill, after it has been whisked to the park and receives the presidential signature, will inject a new sense of energy into the Flood tribunal so that it can continue to do its important work.</P>
    <P>I wish to conclude on a personal note. Before Christmas, in the course of a debate in this House, I made a reference to Senator Mooney which was unfair. He had made remarks which I said could be construed as racist. I was wrong to do that. Senator Mooney is, of all things, not a racist; he has a strong record on civil liberties and human rights. I regret it. It was not personal. I had misinterpreted what he said, that there was a degree of substance in it. I apologise to him for that and am happy to withdraw the remarks. I am glad to have the opportunity to do this because the Senator is present in the Chamber. This being holy week, I have no difficulty supporting the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. It is important because it provides for a tribunal of inquiry to be established to inquire into alleged misconduct by gardaí in Donegal. This is necessary. I happened to be an observer in a case where that same group of people tried to accuse innocent people of an offence. I was glad I went with those innocent people to stand by as an observer. I was not enamoured with what happened. But for forensic evidence innocent people would have been in serious trouble as a result of how some of the gardaí conducted an interview which I witnessed. <Col N="1211" />On a couple of occasions I had to intervene. I am delighted, therefore, that this day has come. I had intended to raise the issue at the time but I was too hot under the collar. I have a cooler head now and I am delighted to welcome this Bill as a result of that case alone.</P>
      <P>The majority of gardaí are decent, respectable, honourable men and women. They are considerate. When they stop a person on the road they are reasonable if one is reasonable in turn with them. I prefer to meet a garda than a speed camera because the camera does not listen. At least one can make a case to the garda. By and large, they are reasonable.</P>
      <P>The small cliques within any organisation should be weeded out. Unfortunately, every section of the community &ndash; politicians, gardaí, teachers, priests and accountants &ndash; has a few bad apples. That was and will always be the case. One must remember that Our Lord had only to pick 12 men and he picked one bad one who took the little backhander. Human nature has never changed. It is the same today as it was then. Therefore, I welcome the Bill dealing with those acting dishonourably.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the fact that the Bill will speed up the introduction of more manpower for the Flood tribunal. As has been said here, while the procedures of tribunals were intended to be informal, speedy and inexpensive, the increased involvement of the legal profession has tended to make the hearings more formal, prolonged and costly and to lead to an overemphasis on legal procedures and technicalities.</P>
      <P>When a tribunal was established some years ago a previous Minister, when asked what he thought of it, stated it was a barristers' fattening exercise. The amount of money the legal profession is earning from tribunals is disgraceful. There are people talking about what is being spent on other projects, but the thousands of pounds per hour being paid to legal people is excessive and astonishing.</P>
      <P>I would like to see the Committee of Public Accounts handling more of these inquiries. It handled the DIRT inquiry for a fraction of the cost, we got answers and the inquiry paid for itself. One does not need legalese to question people about whether they gave backhanders, bribes or anything else. This has gone too far.</P>
      <P>There is a case relating to the Abbeylara inquiry in the courts. I am fully convinced the reason it has gone to court is because the legal profession wants to make sure it keeps its hands on the pot and gets its money. If the Committee of Public Accounts could conduct inquiries like these, the legal profession would get no money out of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will have to devise a system whereby there would be a time limit on tribunals and a cap on legal expenses. I do not understand the need for senior counsel, junior counsel and solicitors representing individuals in a case. This is not done <Col N="1212" />in any other country. As I have often said here, the compensation culture is a classic example of this, where taxpayers are being taken to the cleaners.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the Bill and I am happy that it will speed up the work of the tribunals and bring them to a conclusion sooner, I would like to see a time limit put on tribunals in future. There should be greater accountability. They cannot continue indefinitely. There has been a tribunal sitting for two and a half years, but what has come out of it? Millions have been spent and there have been and will be no answers. There will be a report issued in perhaps two years' time, when nobody will know the reason the tribunal was established in the first place.</P>
    <P>The second flaw with tribunals is that those who did give bribes are getting away scot-free. There is no word about them at all. If there were no receivers, there would be no thieves. If there were no people to buy stolen goods, there would be no goods stolen. Those who gave the bribes were at the tribunals stating they gave this and that, yet they have not been charged. That is as great a crime as taking it, but the tribunal is established in such a way that the people concerned are exonerated from all blame. If they had got what they wanted, there would have been no inquiry. Therefore, we must do something to provide for a little balance and ensure everybody is treated fairly.</P>
    <P>In addition, as Senator Manning said, people can go into a tribunal and make all kinds of allegations. The tribunal has gone on for two years and there are people with that cloud hanging over them. That is wrong. There should be a system whereby they are brought before either the Committee of Public Accounts or a court of law, tried and a decision is given. It would then be black or white, they would be declared guilty or innocent.</P>
    <P>Tribunals are not moving as fast or as expeditiously as was intended. For this reason we need to speed up the process. I welcome the Bill because it will provide for more manpower. It would be nice to see a speedy end to the tribunals.</P>
    <P>It is amazing how there is so much emphasis on some tribunals, yet there are others dealing with the loss of life, for example, the ongoing tribunal dealing with the Blood Transfusion Service Board, about which nobody is talking. As a result of what happened, many lives were lost. At least there were no lives lost in the bribes scandal. We should also look into how the emphasis is placed on certain tribunals.</P>
    <P>I welcome that fact that the Bill will speed up the work of the tribunals and bring them to a speedy conclusion. I hope when they are cleared up the next Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will look at a speedier and better way of conducting tribunals similar to that adopted by the Committee of Public Accounts to deal with all such allegations and inquiries. This would bring them to a speedy and satisfactory <Col N="1213" />conclusion and let the people know the results. By the time we get results, they will be asking what was the tribunal about. They will have forgotten all about it. It has gone on too long.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and know that a great deal of work had to be done on it. I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, and the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, on bringing it before the House. I hope it will speed up the inquiry and bring it to a final conclusion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, and thank her for elucidating the detail of legislation that we had all hoped would not have to come before the House. It is in two parts essentially: one dealing with the McBrearty inquiry and the other with the appointment of extra members of the Judiciary.</P>
      <P>Before I make my observations on the Bill, I express my appreciation of the graciousness with which my colleague, Senator Manning, has dealt with the rather unsavoury incident that occurred in the House prior to Chirstmas which had a very deep personal effect on me. One does not like to be referred to as a racist in any forum, certainly not in one of the Houses of Parliament. It would be ungracious of me &ndash; I do not feel it within me &ndash; not to acknowledge the manner in which Senator Manning took the opportunity to state his regret and withdraw the remarks. There is really little else that one can say about it. It is rather sad that while the remarks will remain on the record of the House, to which I attach a great deal of importance, they will not receive the same publicity that the original allegation received in the national media at the time.</P>
      <P>I will not deal with the details surrounding the McBrearty case as this has already happened in the debate, other than to say that those who come from the north west would have been familiar with the case over a long period of time. I knew Frank McBrearty and his family because, wearing another hat, I organised several musical events in The Parting Glass in Raphoe during the years. I am not sure if that is a declaration of interest, but I did know Frank. Perhaps because I knew him, I was aware of the details of the McBrearty case as the family saw them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I have no wish to cavil with the remarks of Senator Manning about the fact that it emerged as a result of the investigative powers of two Deputies in the other House, the details of the case were well known. The McBreartys were anxious that the matter should be cleared up and there were several attempts made by politicians to ensure the matter was kept in the public eye, not least by Deputy Blaney, who is a friend of the McBreartys and who I know brought this matter to the attention of the political establishment. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform was fully aware of the matter and did not need to be prodded into action. It is important to put that on the record. In the world of politics, spin rules supreme. I have no doubt that the two <Col N="1214" />Deputies referred to by Senator Manning will live long on the perception that they were the ones who brought this particular development to the public arena.</P>
    <P>In outlining the details of this Bill, the Minister of State has made quite clear the sequence of events that led to this legislation. She stated in very great detail its background from the earliest opportunity that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform had to address this issue in a judicial fashion. I believe he has done the correct thing &ndash; he has moved cautiously. It would be dreadful if both Houses were to rush through legislation purely because of the political football being made out of the issue without taking into account the consequences for the McBreartys themselves if, as has happened, they were to institute criminal proceedings. There was a great deal of sensitivity involved and I applaud the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, for the manner in which he discharged his ministerial responsibilities in this regard.</P>
    <P>What has now emerged, as the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, has outlined in the House, is a balanced response in a legislative context to what is a very complex issue. It is an issue that has yet to be resolved, and all of us, in both Houses, look forward to resolving it in the best interests of fairness, justice and equity.</P>
    <P>I reiterate the remarks of my colleague, Senator Farrell &ndash; the Garda Síochána is a fine body of people and this particular affair and its wider implications have caused great pain to its serving members. One can only look at the implications throughout society where, inevitably, rotten apples have emerged &ndash; be it in the church, politics or now, sadly, in the Garda Síochána. It does not reflect well on any of us. It does not reflect well on society and there is a moral responsibility on the Administration, as has happened in this instance, to move swiftly and cautiously to ensure that these matters are brought to a resolution. The framework under which this Bill will operate will ensure that it will go a long way towards doing that.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the element of the Bill which relates to the appointment of extra judges to the Flood tribunal. When Justice Flood requested this and when it was pointed out early on that there was a real difficulty in getting suitably qualified personnel to sit on the tribunal &ndash; certainly, this emerged very early in the media &ndash; I immediately anticipated the members of the Opposition would focus on this and suggest that the Government was dragging its feet. It was a perfect platform from which to snipe at the Government and say it never wanted the tribunal in the first place and ask why it should it be anxious to ensure there would be extra judges appointed at the request of Mr. Justice Flood.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State dealt with the aforementioned matter in a different context in her own speech. She referred to subsection (2) in respect of the appointment of investigators. She could <Col N="1215" />have given the same answer to that particular charge. She said:</P>
    <P>Some have suggested that the requirements for ministerial approval and the consent of the Minister for Finance open the way for the Government to frustrate the work of tribunals by not permitting them to appoint investigators. This is clearly an absurd view as I cannot imagine a Government, accountable as it is to these Houses and to public opinion and subject as it is to rigorous scrutiny in the media, attempting to hinder a tribunal by unreasonably and for improper motives withholding approval of the appointment of investigators by a tribunal.</P>
    <P>That sums up and answers the charges that have been made unfairly and inaccurately. There was, and continued to be, a real problem concerning the appointment of personnel. I understand the Attorney General has had to go down to lower levels in the legal profession to encourage people to take up the appointments, notwithstanding all the money to which Senator Farrell referred.</P>
    <P>I hope that the incoming Administration will bring forward the necessary legislation to permit Parliament to investigate these matters. Senator Farrell went into this point in some detail and I will not enlarge on it, but I applaud and put on the record my admiration for Deputy Shatter. He went to the law courts and attempted, using the considerable expertise at his command and all his rhetorical flourishes which we know and love, to point out in the context of the suspension of the two investigative committees &ndash; the Abbeylara and the mini-CTC inquiries &ndash; that the Judiciary is intruding in the work of Parliament to an increasing degree.</P>
    <P>As a strong advocate of the separation of powers, I believe this intrusion is inherently anti-democratic. There is a very real responsibility on Government to ensure that the separation of powers, which we have enjoyed since the foundation of the State, be restored because it has been impacted upon as a result of the Supreme Court judgments. It is now a matter for these Houses to reassert their authority as the representatives of the people. The people are not represented by the Judiciary &ndash; they are represented in these Houses. These Houses should have the right to appoint Members to investigate, using all the expertise they can draw on, matters such as those that have come before the two tribunals, which, as Senator Farrell pointed out, seem to be unending.</P>
    <P>I share the concerns of those who have pointed out that the media treatment of those who have come before the tribunals is to be deplored. I hold no brief for any of the people who will ultimately find themselves reported on adversely by the tribunals. I have no wish in any way to discuss that matter. However, this is the only opportunity I have had to make the point that the treatment <Col N="1216" />of Deputy Lawlor by certain members of the tabloid press was nothing short of disgraceful. They actually created a photographic montage. I do not think most people would even have known this because it was in a little corner of the paper &ndash; one would need to be in the media to understand what it meant. They took a photograph and then inserted two hands with an improper gesture that were not Deputy Lawlor's, put bars in front of his face and said, &ldquo;This is how Deputy Lawlor looks behind bars.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Have we sunk to a new low of reportage? Is there such inherent hatred and hostility within the media towards somebody who has not yet been proven to be guilty of anything other than contempt of court? It is past time that we, as legislators, should look at that type of treatment. Given the concept that one is innocent until proven guilty, no citizen should be subjected to that sort of outrageous treatment by anybody. I hold no brief for anything relating to Deputy Lawlor &ndash; I am talking about the inherent principle. I am grateful to the Acting Chairman for allowing me to extend my extra time. As a good Mayo man, I appreciate it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I guardedly welcome this legislation. It is not before its time. As previous speakers have said, it represents a two-pronged approach. One approach is to set up a tribunal in respect of the McBrearty case, and the second is to appoint additional judges in respect of the Flood tribunal.</P>
      <P>The majority of people are wondering why these tribunals are going on for so long. People are at a loss when they consider that the Flood tribunal is nearly five years <i>in situ</i>&ndash; it will not be long until this is the case. Are we as far away from its making a decision as we were at the very beginning? People are very annoyed at the cost of those tribunals and there seems to be no haste in regard to them. As representatives of the people, it is our duty to see that they are concluded as quickly as possible, even if that requires additional judicial input. I am delighted that the McBrearty tribunal will be put in place. It is a while since the Lower House decided a tribunal should be established.</P>

      <P>I thank Senators for contributing to the debate. Many Members asked about the terms of reference of the Donegal tribunal of inquiry. The Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, is in the process of consulting with the Opposition parties in relation to the terms of reference. I understand he supplied the proposed terms of reference to the Justice spokespersons in the Dáil this afternoon. He has asked for their views and hopes to be in a position to proceed with a resolution establishing this tribunal on Thursday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Manning expressed concern about the rushing through of the Bill. I sympathise with this <Col N="1217" />point and I assure the Senator that it is in no sense a slight on the Seanad. The same schedule was, unfortunately, also necessary in the Dáil. The expansion of the Flood tribunal will be provided for pursuant to a resolution of both Houses. We wish to have the resolution passed before the Easter recess. The Bill was prepared very carefully in consultation with the Attorney General, but this was done with as much speed as possible. In so far as the Bill deals with the expansion of the Flood tribunal, this only arose on foot of a request from Mr. Justice Flood in the recent past. The Bill was also drafted in the knowledge that amending legislation was being prepared in any event to deal with the Donegal situation.</P>
    <P>Senators Manning, Mooney, Farrell and Burke referred to the experience of the work of tribunals to date, including their cost effectiveness and other issues. It may interest the House to know that the Law Reform Commission has included, as a matter of priority in its current work programme, an examination of the law on tribunals. This will be very worthwhile and I look forward to the publication of a consultation paper in the autumn.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrell spoke about the many cases in recent years in which both Houses considered it necessary to pass resolutions providing for the establishment of tribunals and he pointed out that these various scandals and allegations are damaging to national morale. What is most important, however, is that scandals are not allowed to fester, that they are investigated and that the truth of what did or did not happen is brought out.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney and Senator Farrell applauded the Minister's handling of these matters. It is important we recall that, last May, the Minister said clearly that he was not opposed to the holding of a public inquiry, but that there was a particular danger of prejudice to criminal and civil proceedings. He noted at the time that he would seek the advice of the Attorney General and that advice confirmed that the holding of such an inquiry at that time could prejudice criminal and civil proceedings. It is also important to note that neither the criminal nor the civil proceedings advanced very quickly, which was a real concern shared by the Minister. In November, he announced the appointment of Mr. Shane Murphy to examine the issue.</P>
    <P>The Bill has to be enacted before the Easter recess so that the Dáil can pass the necessary resolution pursuant to it, which will be tabled by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to provide for the appointment of the additional members and the reserve member of the Flood tribunal. The Bill has two main purposes. The first is to facilitate the work of the tribunal of inquiry into the Donegal allegations by ensuring that a risk of prejudice to any pending criminal trial will not arise from the tribunal's proceedings. It was important to do that and all this arises from the report of Mr. Shane Murphy in January. The second purpose is to provide the <Col N="1218" />legal basis for the appointment of the additional members and reserve member of the Flood tribunal, as requested by Mr. Justice Flood.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Education is central to the development of the individual. It is key to helping a person achieve his or her potential. It provides a person with the aptitudes and capacities to live as fulfilling a life as possible and to contribute to the greatest extent practicable to the life of the society in which he or she lives. This is true for all people, but it is especially true of those who, because of disabilities, are at risk of becoming marginalised in society. Without access to services that will meet their special education needs, people with disabilities who have such needs will be denied the capacity to develop as fulfilled members of society and society will be denied their contributions as citizens. This is very much a &ldquo;lose lose&rdquo; situation.</P>
      <P>The way in which society has responded over the decades to the needs of children with disabilities is a topic too large for me to deal with at any length now. There is and always has been in society great affection for such children and a desire to respond to their needs. This is especially true of so many families who have dedicated themselves in a special way to their child who, because of a disability, needs special care and protection. It is also true of the many people in public and voluntary agencies who for years have provided vital services and support for people with special needs arising from a disability.</P>
      <P>In the education sector significant resources have been provided for the education of children with special educational needs, yet for all that, it must be admitted that in the struggle to find resources for the education system generally the focus was primarily on the majority of children who did not have special needs. Special education commanded less attention and less of its share of the budget than should have been the case. Even so, many children with special needs have, through a combination of parental effort, voluntary agencies and public funding, received a good education which has prepared them well for life. Unfortunately, there are others about whom the same cannot be said. Children who could have achieved more in their lives, however limited their capabilities, have not benefited from education as they might have. Lack of resources, poor planning and ineffective co-ordination of service providers have failed them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More recently the situation has been changing, and the Government has presided over an unprecedented level of development in special education services. In September 1999 the learning support teacher service was extended to every first and second level school in the country. As a result, the number of learning support teachers in the primary system has grown from 1,242 in September 1997 to 1,485 at present. In October 1998 the Government decided that all children with disabilities within the primary system should have an automatic entitlement to a response to their needs. As a result of this development, the <Col N="1220" />number of special resource teachers catering for children with special needs in ordinary schools has increased from 104 to more than 1,500. At the same time the number of special needs assistants in the system has grown from less than 300 to approximately 3,000.</P>
    <P>Since September 1999 the pupil-teacher ratios applicable in all special schools and special classes have been reduced to the levels recommended by the special education review committee. Since October 1998 the Department of Education and Science has recognised the distinct emotional needs of children with autism and made special dedicated provision for such children. As a result of this development, more than 90 dedicated special classes have been established to cater for children with autism. Each class caters for a maximum of six pupils and has the support of a teacher and two special needs assistants. Funding of &euro;3.2 million has been made available in 2002 to support the development of a nationwide pre-school service for children with autism. Further funding of &euro;3.2 million has been made available in the current year to support the extension of education programmes for children with autism throughout the month of July. A sum of &euro;1.2 million is being provided in 2002 to support the operation of three pilot projects utilising the applied behavioural analysis model of approach to the education of children with autism.</P>
    <P>Developments in technology can be of great assistance to the educational development of children with disabilities. In the current year I have secured additional funding of &euro;2.2 million to facilitate the purchase of special equipment for children with special needs. This brings the allocation for equipment to almost &euro;4 million in the current year, compared with an allocation of &euro;1 million in 1998.</P>
    <P>Since September 1999 funding has been made available to facilitate the appointment of escorts on every special school transport service that conveys pupils to and from special schools and classes. In excess of 600 individual routes are involved in this. Funding is also provided for the purchase of a safety harness where required. There are now 108 special schools with 6,614 pupils, 1,089 teachers and 934 full-time equivalent special needs assistants. There are 465 special classes with 3,743 pupils, 465 teachers and 653 full-time equivalent special needs assistants.</P>
    <P>There are approximately 12,736 pupils attending primary schools on an integrated basis. These children are supported by approximately 1,500 full-time equivalent resource teachers and approximately 2,031 special needs assistants. A total of 49 special classes dedicated to autism are attached to special schools and a further 49 are attached to ordinary national schools. These 98 classes can cater for up to 588 pupils with autism. More than 50 other children are receiving an education in other publicly funded facilities, such as the CABAS facility in Cork.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1221" />I am aware that people can be sceptical about statistics. However, these figures represent real expenditure, real people providing services and, most of all, a real provision enhancement for the services provided for children with special educational needs. Even the strongest critics of the services provided for these children cannot dismiss these developments and additional resources as negligible. In the last three years our annual expenditure on children with special needs has risen from &euro;7 million per annum to &euro;70 million per annum. These figures represent a significant resourcing of the special education system. I accept that still more needs to be done. Through this Bill I will ensure more is done. Provision which has been made to date as a matter of administrative arrangement will now be available to children with special educational needs as a matter of right of law.</P>
    <P>In October 2000 I established a special task force to carry out an independent review of current approaches to the educational needs of children with autism. This task force, which also made recommendations for the future development of services in this area, presented its report to me in November 2001. Although it had specific focus on autism, many of the task force's recommendations were equally applicable to the education generally of people with special educational needs. I have paid special attention to the recommendations of the task force in the area of legislative issues and incorporated them into the Bill. In particular, the Bill covers the following proposals of the task force: enactment of a civil rights statute dealing with the educational rights of persons with disabilities; a clear presumption in favour of mainstreaming; a statement of educational need and an individual education plan for each individual; a statement of the resources required to implement the plan; a statutory right related to professional and other services; a statutory right to appropriate ongoing education and training; a method of evaluating progress; an independent appeals-complaints mechanism.</P>
    <P>As the explanatory memorandum to the Bill states, the purpose of the Bill is to provide a statutory framework within which the education of children and people who have special needs due to disabilities can be guaranteed as a right enforceable in law. The Bill sets out a range of services which must be provided, including assessments, individual education plans and support services. It provides for a process of mediation where needs are not met. The central role of parents in the education of their children is also provided for. The Bill establishes the National Council for Special Education through which the Bill, as enacted, will be given effect.</P>
    <P>The education of children with special educational needs alongside those who do not have such needs has long been Government policy. The Bill gives statutory force to this policy. In doing so, it is acting in the best interests of the <Col N="1222" />children concerned, who can best grow and develop in the company of their peer group. The Bill provides that the needs of the child concerned and the wishes of his or her parents are taken into account. Similarly, the needs of the children alongside whom the child is to be educated and the efficient use of resources must also be considered. The section goes on to provide that the education of a child with special needs shall occur in special classes and separate schools. Settings removed from the ordinary school environment will only be used when education in that environment with the use of appropriate support services cannot adequately meet the needs of the child.</P>
    <P>Early identification of children with special needs is essential if those needs are to be identified and proper planning undertaken to meet them. The Bill provides for a system of registration of such children, involving health boards, parents, schools and the National Council for Special Education. Where a health board is of the opinion that a child has, or is likely to have, special educational needs, it must inform the parents of the child and the council as soon as possible. The purpose of this provision is to alert parents and the council to the needs of the child concerned in order that, in the case of the council, it can plan ahead for the child and intervene early in his or her education, if appropriate.</P>
    <P>Parents may also bring their concerns about the potential special needs of their children to the attention of the council by seeking to have the child entered in the register. Where it receives an application for registration, the council can arrange for an assessment of the child by appropriate experts, including experts in psychology, medicine and education. Parental consent to an assessment is required. In carrying out the assessment regard will be had to any relevant assessment that has been commissioned or carried out by a health board. This is part of the process of ensuring that the different services provided to the child are co-ordinated in the child's interests. A report on the assessment is to be made available, as soon as possible after the assessment is completed, to the parents of the child and to any people engaged in the education of the child who have a need to know.</P>
    <P>The drawing up of education plans tailored to meet the educational needs of children with special educational needs is a key provision of the Bill. Through the planning process, disabilities can be identified, needs assessed, goals decided on and progress monitored. In preparing the plan, the special educational needs organiser assigned to a school is given very special responsibility. It is he or she who must convene a team of people, including the parents of the child and various professionals, to assist in preparing the plan. The planning process must take account of assessment of needs carried out by health boards.</P>
    <P>The matters to be addressed in an education plan include the nature and degree of the child's <Col N="1223" />disability, the present level of educational performance, where relevant, the child's special educational needs, the services to be provided to him or her and the outcomes or goals which the child is to achieve over a specified period. This period cannot be longer than 12 months. The transitions of a child with special educational needs from primary to post-primary school and from school to adult services are recognised as particularly important milestones and the plan is specifically required to address these from as early as 14 years in the case of transition out of school to adult appropriate provision.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the review at regular intervals of individual education plans both by schools and the special educational needs organisers. The purpose of these reviews is to establish if children are achieving the objectives set in the plan. If they are not, then the plan is to be amended accordingly.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for a range of duties for schools in respect of children with special educational needs. These duties are additional to those already imposed on schools by legislation such as the Equal Status Act and the Education Act. This Bill provides that a school must make all practicable efforts to assist a child who is not benefiting from the regular education programme, prior to concluding that he or she is a child with special educational needs, unless, of course, the child's special needs are obvious. The intention here is to avoid over-identification of a child as having special needs when reasonable accommodation for the child within the standard school programme can meet his or her needs. If a child has special educational needs the school is required to prepare an individual education plan for the child. To assist the school in this, the National Council for Special Education will set down guidelines. The special educational needs organiser for the school will arrange for the assessment of the child and the plan will be based on that assessment. Provision is also made for consultation with the parents and other relevant people in preparing the plan.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides that the board of management of a school must ensure that, as regards admission to and participation in the school, a policy of maximum accommodation for children with special educational needs is in place and implemented. Schools must make all reasonable efforts to meet the needs of students, co-operate with the council and contribute to awareness among staff and students of the needs of children with special educational needs.</P>
    <P>It is my intention that the Bill will give an effective and meaningful voice to parents in the education of their children. An essential element of that voice is the capacity to have decisions of schools and the council reviewed independently. The Bill provides that parents of a child may appeal to an independent appeals board against any statement or description of their child's <Col N="1224" />special educational needs or any other statement or description appearing in the educational plan which they consider incorrect or inadequate to meet the child's special educational needs. It is likely, however, that many parents will wish to pursue a less formal approach to a review of decisions. For that reason the Bill provides that before processing an appeal, the appeals board will inform the parents concerned of the procedures that are available for mediation. Mediation will be voluntary and parents may withdraw at any time.</P>
    <P>The mediation will be facilitated by an independent person, appointed with the agreement of all parties concerned, who will be familiar with the educational needs of children with disabilities and any relevant legislation. Any agreement made through this process of mediation will be set down in writing and signed by all relevant parties. The appeals board will not deal with an appeal if the parents concerned choose to avail of the mediation procedure, except where they decide to withdraw from the mediation process. On hearing an appeal, the appeals board may give directions to the council, which it must implement, or may dismiss the appeal.</P>
    <P>Provision of statutory rights to education and training to those whose education in a school environment ends is an important part of the Bill. The rights of people with special needs as regards equal treatment are already provided for in legislation such as the Equal Status Act and the Education Act. However, this Bill goes further and provides statutory, enforceable rights to people as regards access to and benefit from continuing education and training.</P>
    <P>Section 16 sets out a range of education and training provision which is to be made for adults with disabilities. If the council considers that on the person's reaching 18 years of age, his or her special educational needs can be met most effectively by providing for a continuation of his or her education in the school which he or she is attending, it can arrange for the person to remain at that school for the period of one further school year. If, on the other hand, the council considers that the person concerned can have his or her special educational needs met more effectively in a setting other than a school, it is required to inform the relevant health board not less than one year prior to the eighteenth birthday of the person concerned. The council and the relevant board will, following consultation with the young person concerned, his or her parents and others with appropriate expertise, consider what is the most appropriate educational provision that can be made for him or her post school. If the council and the health board are of the opinion that the person concerned can benefit from training or employment support services, FÁS will be informed and it will exercise its statutory functions to make appropriate provision.  </P>
    <P>If the council and the health board consider that the person concerned is not capable of ben<Col N="1225" />efiting from a programme of training or employment support immediately, or at all, the relevant health board will make provision for a programme of continuing education and personal development in a setting appropriate to the age and needs of the person concerned for as long as the health board considers necessary to assist the person to make the best use of his or her capacities or until the person concerned can move to training or employment. Provision for a person in this situation must include a qualified teacher in a multi-disciplinary team which will be required to provide the necessary services.</P>
    <P>The Bill specifically acknowledges that many people with special educational needs will move to higher, further and continuing education and states that nothing in the Bill restricts the right of a person to receive and benefit from such education in the same way and to the same extent as a person who does not have a disability.</P>
    <P>The Bill establishes the National Council for Special Education as the body charged with ensuring that the Bill as enacted will be given full effect. Its specific duties include the compilation and maintenance of the register, the co-ordination of special education in conjunction with schools and other educational institutions and the regular review of provision made by such institutions. It will have responsibility to conduct research in the area of special education and provide relevant advice and information to the Minister. The Bill provides for the structure of the board and for a consultative forum which will be drawn from the education partners. This forum will provide advice to the council.</P>
    <P>The provision of appropriate education services to children and adults with special educational needs crucially involves close co-operation and co-ordination of activities between education and health authorities. The health boards have a key role to play in providing support services such as the various therapies people concerned need and also because children and others with disabilities often reside in health board facilities or attend day care services. It is regrettably the case that services to date have not been as co-ordinated as they should be. The Bill when enacted will resolve these difficulties.</P>
    <P>Section 36 provides that the council may from time to time request a health board to take specified actions where it considers this to be necessary to the delivery of an adequate education plan or, more generally, to assist the council in carrying out its functions. Prior consultation with a health board is required before a request is made to it. A health board must comply with a request unless, in its view, the assistance requested is not necessary, taking the action would not be consistent with its functions or it would not be reasonable to comply having regard to its resources. If the health board decides that it cannot comply with a request of the council, it must state its reasons and the council may appeal the refusal to comply. On hearing an appeal, the appeals board <Col N="1226" />may direct the health board to comply with the request or dismiss the appeal.</P>
    <P>These provisions bring clarity to the role of the health boards, provide a formal process through which the boards, following consultation with them, can be informed of what is required and provide a structure for resolving disputes. The beneficiaries of these provisions will be those who rely on the services of the boards to access appropriate education and training services and their parents.</P>
    <P>There will be those who will criticise the fact that we have not legislated sooner for the education of people with special educational needs. It is worth remembering, however, that the practice of legislating for education is for the most part a relatively recent innovation. The Education Act is just over three years old. In the term of office of the Government there has been a more comprehensive and far reaching programme of legislation covering all areas of the education system than in the entire period since the foundation of the State. It gives me special pleasure to introduce the Bill as the final piece of legislation in that programme. In preparing it we have had the benefit of being able to review the law applying in other jurisdictions, notably the United States and the United Kingdom. We have had the benefit of the advice of a number of advisory committees and groups, notably the task force on autism and earlier the special education review committee. We have had the experience of past failures and successes to guide us. Most importantly, we have consistently had the voice of parents telling us how they want to see a legal basis constructed for the education of their children.</P>
    <P>I want to move forward with this Bill without delay in order that the potential benefits it offers to those with special educational needs and their parents can become a reality as quickly as possible. I rely on the support of the House in that endeavour.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators for taking the Bill at this time. It is important legislation which will confer rights. We are providing many necessary services. There has been a huge change in this regard in recent years as a result of the O'Donoghue case and subsequently the Sinnott case to some extent. While services are being provided, parents would like to see them copperfastened in legislation. I thank Senators for the opportunity to bring forward the Bill tonight.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. This may be a good Bill. Everybody empathises with its objectives, the people it is designed to help and its proposals. However, I have no way of knowing tonight whether it is good or bad. The Minister has put a fuse to a time bomb which may well go off in his face over the next couple of weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister need not thank this side of the House for taking the Bill as we opposed this just <Col N="1227" />as we will oppose taking Committee Stage tomorrow. If the Minister thinks he will get it through all Stages in the Dáil on Thursday, he may have another thing coming. He would be wise to think again about the approach he has adopted to the Bill. There will be generous support for it, but on past experience it needs to be teased out carefully because it deals with an area pregnant with litigation possibilities.</P>
    <P>A copy of the Bill appeared in our pigeon holes at 10.25 a.m. Most of us have been busy in the House all day. It is normal courtesy and practice, when a Bill is published, to allow a period of a couple of weeks in order that Members can acquaint themselves with it, talk to various interest groups, educate themselves and find out the reaction of practitioners as to how it will operate in practice. Without any advance notice, we were given six to eight hours today to do this while we had other work to do. Nobody here is prepared to deal with the Bill tonight. We have not seen it nor had time to examine it and have not had time to talk to people about it. Nobody is in a position to give it the sort of attention it needs.</P>
    <P>We are being told to take Committee Stage tomorrow. How can we go and talk to all the groups involved and examine the Bill in detail to see what amendments are needed? The Minister then proposes to put it through all Stages in the Dáil on Thursday. Today I did what anybody does when a Bill appears. I rang the various groups, most of which were unaware the Bill was being brought forward. Others were scrambling to get copies of it. When I called them back later they were up in arms. The Minister has a revolt on his hands. They are angry because they were not consulted. Time after time I heard from various groups that they had written and asked to speak to the Minister but were told he was too busy to see them. They are angry because they have had no input into the legislation. They do not trust the Minister or his Department and believe that this is big brother telling them what to do. Of all the lessons learned in recent years in this area the Minister must know that he has to talk to people to bring them along with him.</P>
    <P>The Bill has been foisted upon us. Solomon Grundy born on Tuesday, married on Wednesday, dead on Thursday will be its life. Why is it so urgent? Is it a banner the Minister wants to bring into the election campaign? It has far more to do with electioneering than with resolving the particular problems it proposes to address. How can the Minister justify rushing through a complex Bill like this in three days, particularly the last days of the Government when timetables are already overloaded?</P>
    <P>This morning the Leader of the House spoke about lightening the burden, but suddenly these Bills come along. I could accept it if I thought the Minister wanted the Bill to pass through Second Stage in order that it could be available for dis<Col N="1228" />cussion throughout and after the election campaign. The Bill cries out for detailed Committee Stage debate, especially since its commencement order will be determined by the Minister. The wherewithal is not in place for the Minister to sign an order next week commencing its operation. Therefore, it is being rushed through for the wrong reasons. It is part of the election campaign. The Minister will be sorry he did it this way.</P>
    <P>Every group to which I spoke today was angry at the way it was treated by the Minister. They raised aspects of the Bill to which they took exception. Their reaction was hostile and they were concerned about the increasing layers of bureaucracy. They believed the Bill was not child centred and that there were too many let out clauses where, subject to the Department of Finance, things could or could not be done. There are a great number of fail safe provisions in it. There are concerns about guarantees about getting an IEP and that there is no statutory requirement for consultation with parents on these matters.</P>
    <P>I spoke at length to Mrs. Kathryn Sinnott today. She received copies of the Bill at 4 a.m. and spent most of the hours since then examining it in detail. She is particularly angry at what she sees in it. She says the Bill &ldquo;rows back on the promises made after the Supreme Court decision&rdquo;. She totally rejects the Bill at this stage, although she may have a more balanced view tomorrow. As it stands, she finds the Bill a great betrayal.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wants to get good legislation through, he should revert to the normal procedures of these Houses. He should allow Members time to study the Bill in detail, have a proper consultative process and Committee Stage debate rather than trying to get it through on a guillotine of three days. There is an arrogance of mindset which suggests that the Minister and the Department know best, the Houses of the Oireachtas do not count, they do not need to be given time to study the Bill, they do not need to be consulted, there is no need for reflection and the Minister has all the answers.</P>
    <P>In everything else the Department has done in the area of special needs and autism and so on, it has been wrong as often as it has been right. The Department of Education and Science does not have a good track record. It is not trusted by the parents or very many of the groups outside. That is particularly true in the history of the Department. It gives me no pleasure to say so &ndash; I prefer to say positive things about people &ndash; but there are people throughout the country who are up in arms about this Bill. They do not like the way it is being rushed in and they do not like the lack of consultation. If the Minister wants this Bill to be treated properly, he should stop this mad rush to get it through as an election fig leaf. He should engage in the proper process. If he does so, he will get a Bill which will stand up in court and <Col N="1229" />make the people happy so that they do not have a sense of being steamrolled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. I am disappointed with the force and choice of words of my colleague, Senator Manning, in relation to this Bill. I read the legislation and have been reading around the subject extensively since 1998 and the Education (Welfare) Act, 1999. Provision was made in that Act to deal with this problem and has been ongoing since then. We set up the task force two years ago which is dealing with recommendations and there have been many consultation procedures during that time. I totally refute the claim that there has not been sufficient consultation. I understand the Senator's point that the Bill is coming at this late stage in the term but we have had a consultation process and will continue to do so. The Minister is available to listen to everyone's point of view and we have an opportunity tonight for people to express their views.</P>
      <P>I have knowledge of this area from another forum where I worked in this areas of disadvantage, special needs and special education needs. I welcome this Bill because it puts a statutory framework on what has been initiated over the past few years &ndash; a framework which will endorse the rights of people to special education. That is to be welcomed. The provisions are in the Bill through the national council for special education needs, the details in relation to individual education plans, how the assessments will be carried out and the extra support services.</P>
      <P>One must acknowledge the increase in the number of support teachers in primary schools in recent years. The number of special resource teachers who deal with special needs in ordinary schools has increased from 104 to more than 1,500. To suggest that we have not been doing our work over the past few years is most unfair. I know the actual position.</P>
      <P>Of course everything is not right and more needs to be done in this area. Enough is never enough where special education needs are concerned. We must always pay particular attention to how we can best move things forward and improve our education plans and assessments. More needs to be done but this is a start. This Bill will put this in a statutory framework, which is a great step forward. I welcome the opportunities it provides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I stress to the Minister how important the national council for special education will be because it will set down guidelines from pre-school to adulthood. It is important that the members of that council will represent psychologists, teachers, special education remedial teachers, the caring profession and people who will have a knowledge, understanding and empathy in terms of how we should move forward and the procedures which should be set up to deal with this sensitive area. The national council is the core of these provisions and if we do not get <Col N="1230" />that right the legislation will go nowhere. However, I believe we are on the right road.</P>
    <P>The Minister said we will have assessments in the ordinary schools and I welcome the idea of an integrated system being approached first &ndash; trying to contain matters within the ordinary school context. We will refer the matter to school authorities and the specialists in the schools to set up an educational plan dealing with the individual nature of the disability and how it will be contained in the school setting.</P>
    <P>I have some concern about who will carry out the assessments and how they will be done. I understand the Minister will have special organisers who will be the link between the national council and the schools. I understand these special organisers will deal with a group of schools but I ask the Minister to spell out further how that will work on the ground. We have had an example of that in the past and sometimes it works and sometimes it does not. I remember that the Minister was dealing with referral of young children with educational disability who were referred to the psychological centre in the Mater Hospital and very often the system broke down in the transition from one area to another.</P>
    <P>It is also important that we consult with parents because they sometimes need a lot of help in this area and do not know how to resolve the problem. I have said in numerous other speeches that those people dealing with problems &ndash; the experts and clinicians &ndash; need to have an empathy with parents because of the concern that they will have for the child concerned. It is important that parents' feelings are considered along with the clinical assessment of the child.</P>
    <P>I welcome the process in the area of appeals and mediation and the fact that parents will have an opportunity to appeal if they are not happy with a particular education plan. The Minister has said that if they are in the mediation process they cannot go to the appeals board to have their case heard fully. I would like to think that people would work through the mediation process and then, if necessary, go a step further to the appeals board. Perhaps I am misinterpreting that point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>They would have to withdraw because it would be a step forward in the process. I would like to hear the Minister's view on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am interested in the area of early intervention because, as we all know, the younger the child is picked up &ndash; as early as three years of age &ndash; the more we can serve the needs of children in that category. It is important that there is co-ordination because detecting problems with children under the age of three is difficult when they are not yet in school. The health boards and the links with them through the public health nurse &ndash; or whoever is dealing with it &ndash; will have to spot that there is a problem. I am unsure as to how that will work. How will that work for children under <Col N="1231" />three years of age? I believe in early intervention because if we get it right at that stage, we can set in motion a series of support services which could help parents in arranging an education plan for students.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that those who are in adult education facilities will be allowed to stay on if they can be accommodated in a normal classroom and if the educational programme works well for them. If that does not work, however, the Bill will enable the school authorities to work with the organiser and the health board to formulate some plan to facilitate them in another setting. Perhaps the programme could be transferred to FÁS or another training body. Whatever way it develops, the health board, in conjunction with the parents, will facilitate the further development of appropriate education and personal development according to the child's or adult's ability. Such a provision for lifelong learning is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The Bill represents a great start, although it has been a long time coming. I have no doubt that everyone interested in the area of disability and special education needs will welcome this legislation. More needs to be done and there will be areas that need to be tidied up. Since 1998, however, huge investment has been made in special education programmes in schools, including resources, special assistants, remedial teachers, reducing the pupil-teacher ratio and involving a co-ordinated approach between schools, health boards and experts in education, psychology and medicine generally. All those elements have been collated to make sure they work well and one cannot say that is a bad idea; it is a great move. We would have liked it to have happened six months ago, but the task force has given us time to scrutinise its recommendations which the Bill reflects.</P>
    <P>The Minister is right to bring the legislation forward now. I have no doubt that the relevant interest groups will be pleased with the legislation and will be prepared to consult with the Minister. If there are any areas of doubt, I am sure the Minister will bring forward his views on Committee Stage tomorrow. I thank the Government for introducing the legislation and for keeping it on the agenda for the past four years. If that had not been done, it would not have been possible to deal with the Bill today. Such legislation cannot be snatched out of thin air and presented to the Oireachtas. It has come about as a result of consultation, work and deep reflection.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the Minister's reply concerning the various doubts that have been raised by Opposition speakers. I congratulate him. Although much remains to be done, we are on the right road towards creating a statutory framework to give those with special education needs the same rights as those in ordinary schools. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish I could share Senator Ormonde's optimism. I remind the Minister that on previous occasions I defended every section of the Education Bill and the Teaching Council Bill, but I will be opposing this Bill. As someone who has led the move towards a greater partnership approach in many aspects of Irish life, I am appalled at the way this legislation has come before the House. There were no discussions on the heads of the Bill, despite the fact that the Minister's Department gave a clear commitment to the INTO and to various disability groups that there would be such discussions. I do not know where the Minister's advice came from or how we can find ourselves in this situation which is just a re-run of the O'Donoghue and Jamie Sinnott cases. Nobody put their toe into the water to check what the response might be.</P>
      <P>The Bill is high on bureaucracy, low on resources and there are extraordinary gaps in it. The fact that there has been no consultation shows in every section. It is obvious in terms of where parents and school boards of management stand in this legislation. I assure the Minister that unless significant changes are made, school management associations will not support the Bill and neither will parents' associations or the teacher unions.</P>
      <P>The legislation starts off with the right idea and I have no problem with the Long Title, but the contents of the Bill do not reflect it. I do not see where the rights of persons with disabilities are in the Bill. I heard the discussion on those rights, but they have not been written into the legislation and I want that to happen. The difficulties for school managements and parents will cause chaos among principal teachers and school staff members. There will be an appalling reaction to the Bill among teachers.</P>
      <P>I asked four officials of the INTO to examine the Bill this afternoon. I asked the first person to make a list of what matters should be in a Bill such as this and to check if they were included. I asked a second person to go through the Bill and to tell me what things were missing from it. I asked a third person to take a school principal's view to determine the gaps concerning children. Finally, I asked the fourth person to give me a general response to the Bill. All four of them, separately and individually, were appalled by what they found. The idea is great but the legislation is unworkable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should put himself in the position of a principal of a two to seven teacher primary school who is trying to implement this legislation. Can he tell me how, when and where it could be done? It cannot be done. It is grist to the mill of those who say the Department of Education and Science does not care about how schools operate or how they can implement plans. This is another example of where those of us with great concern for children with special needs will find ourselves fighting battles on two fronts &ndash; one on behalf of those children and another against this appalling <Col N="1233" />example of bureaucracy which will fall flat on its face.</P>
    <P>This Bill may have started out as some sort of electorally attractive legislation but it will prove a huge electoral handicap. It will make people furious. The Bill contains a statement and a path to identify needs, as well as a mechanism for checking whether those needs have been met. What the Bill lacks, however, are the resources to implement the statement. The relationship between principals, class teachers, special education needs organisers and the team generally has not been written into the Bill. We are establishing a council that will have authority over certain aspects of the operation of ordinary schools, but it has no inter-linkage with the system for ordinary schools.</P>
    <P>In section 1, I have grave difficulty with the definition of a child with special educational needs:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;child with special educational needs&rdquo; means a child who, because of attributes arising from a disability, is unable to benefit from an ordinary school programme without special classes or other special education services and cognate expressions shall be construed accordingly;</P>
    <P>I do not agree with that definition. It is completely wrong and I do not think any parent would agree with it. Parents and teachers would say that the ordinary school programme would be inadequate to meet all the needs of such a pupil, but I do not think anybody would say that it would be of no benefit to him or her or that he or she could not benefit from it. The definition should refer to &ldquo;somebody who needs more than the ordinary school programme&rdquo;. What is required is an addition or an extra element. There will always be some benefit. It is an appalling statement about the Minister's curriculum that he would say that any child in the system is unable to benefit from it in any way. That cannot and should not be right.</P>
    <P>I do not have a problem with examining inclusion or integration as an objective where a child with special needs would be integrated into or included in the ordinary school system. That would be the objective of teachers, parents and school authorities wherever it can be done. However, has the Minister considered the workload involved where a principal is of the opinion that a student cannot benefit from the system and the Bill requires him to take &ldquo;such efforts as are practicable to meet the educational needs of that student?&rdquo; Can the Minister imagine my explaining this to schools with overly large classes or which are located in substandard school buildings or which are waiting for resources to make it work? This is additional work for those schools without the resources being put in place.</P>
    <P>The Bill requires a principal to prepare an education plan. I agree with this idea. No one can object to the making of an individual assessment to which we would refer. In preparing the plan <Col N="1234" />the principal is required to consult the parents of the child concerned, the special needs organiser with responsibility for the school concerned and such other persons as he or she considers appropriate. There is no mention of the class teacher who might be important. There is no mention of the class teacher anywhere in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister say how he or anyone else will explain to teachers the difference between this and the occasion when it is decided that the special needs organiser will prepare the plan? In this case, the special needs organiser is required to convene a group of people, referred to in the Bill as a &ldquo;team,&rdquo; to provide him or her with advice on the preparation of the plan and the team is required to provide the advice accordingly. The Bill goes on to state the team will include the parents of the child and one or more of the following: the principal, a psychologist and other persons. At the same time a principal is expected to do all this on his or her own with no team or resources for the 10% of children in the school who have special needs. It is not going to work and I appeal to the Minister not to come back with words to the effect that it will. It will not work. He has addressed principals' groups in recent years and knows their views. He has also heard from me. We have made this case to the benchmarking body. It is unworkable at this level.</P>
    <P>The Bill refers to assessment of needs, which I agree is an essential part of the operation. It states an assessment &ldquo;shall be carried out by persons possessing such expertise as the special educational needs organiser . may consider appropriate.&rdquo;  Who would be able to tell a person about the special educational needs of a child? To whom would that person go? Would it be to a medical doctor, social worker or therapist as specified in the Bill? I do not think so. A psychologist is specified. I would agree with that if it was an educational psychologist, but there is no point going to a clinical psychologist to work out the educational needs of a child. A teacher is also specified, to which I say, &ldquo;Well done&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This section of the Bill is a disaster. If the Department of Education and Science has not learned at this stage the difference between an educational and clinical psychologist in determining educational needs, we have a long road to travel. I am appalled that, 20 years after we concluded this argument with the Department, we are back into it again. It is an appalling insult to educationists and the teaching profession that the Minister would tell me that educational needs would be determined by a medical doctor, social worker, therapist or psychologist. It is no wonder teachers feel hard done by and not properly catered for. As one goes through the Bill, it gets worse in terms of these issues.</P>
    <P>Section 10, which deals with the content of the education plan, refers to the goals a child is to achieve over a period not exceeding 12 months. I would like to talk to the person who wrote this and bring him to a school which deals with chil<Col N="1235" />dren with severe and profound disabilities where what can be done in 12 months is hardly measurable and the most that can be done is to assess the position. I expect Senator Kett to support me, if not publicly, then at least privately, when I say the Government should withdraw this legislation because it cannot go through in its current form. It will not do the business and will cause many problems at many levels.</P>
    <P>What I find most cynical is that, in section 10, there is a list of matters to be specified in the plan. These include the nature and degree of the child's disability and the special education and related support services to be provided. That is fair enough, but who will provide them? From where will they come?</P>
    <P>The next section requires a principal to conduct a review of the plan at regular intervals of not less than once a year. Such a principal, who may teach a class full time and have to discuss matters with parents in the classroom with the children still present, will have to write up education plans of which he or she will have to conduct an assessment once a year or more often. All this is to be done, probably although not necessarily, without resources. I do not know from where these resources will come. From where will the back-up come and what will happen if it does not?</P>
    <P>The advice of the INTO to teachers, principals and school authorities will be to go along with assessing educational needs, but until such time as provision is made for schools, we will take a stand on these issues. We will not have children made pawns in a political game to move this issue forward and over the edge of the cliff towards which it is heading.</P>
    <P>What is appalling about the statement of needs is that the only person who can use the appeal process if he or she has a problem with the nature or any aspect of the plan is the parent, although the teacher, school authorities and child are also partners in the process. Teachers may believe there are flaws in a plan which is not produced in a school or that other items should be included in it and that they should have a right to appeal to have the plan modified or changed or to make the case that it does not adequately meet the needs of a child. Given that the plan can be produced by people with no educational background, it is obvious this could happen.</P>
    <P>On the issue of those in charge of the process, the special educational needs organisers, the Bill states the council may appoint such and so many of these people as it determines are necessary to perform the function without giving any indication as to what type of people they might be. Will they have educational qualifications? I would insist that they would if they are to be special educational needs organisers.</P>
    <P>The Bill lists the duties of schools' boards of management. I do not have the time to detail all of them, but among them are the requirement to make all reasonable efforts to meet the special <Col N="1236" />educational needs of pupils, to co-operate with the council, to ensure relevant teachers and employees are aware of a child's needs, to inculcate in students of the school an awareness of the needs of people with disabilities and to ensure as regards admission that a policy of maximum accommodation for children with special educational needs be implemented. The school authorities will state that is fine, but they will also request to be allowed to determine the resources they need to do this.</P>
    <P>We are talking about 3,000 school boards throughout the country struggling in an under-provided school system. While I give the Minister credit for the increases in resources to schools and would not be mealy-mouthed about it, what is being asked of boards in the Bill is impossible. They are being asked to do something without being given the resources to do it.</P>
    <P>I could speak for another six hours on the Bill but will conclude on a final piece of cynicism. We are establishing a council which will make decisions on best educational practice in schools. It will tell us how to do the job. Who will make up its membership? Will it consist of educationists of the highest order? The Bill states it will consist of a chairperson and ten ordinary members. From where will they come? The chairperson and ordinary members of the council will be appointed by the Minister from among persons who have a special interest in or knowledge relating to the education of children with disabilities. If this is openness and accountability in this day and age, it is unacceptable. If we are to establish a council, we need to ensure it reflects the educational concerns of school managements, parents, teachers, the Department and, probably, the health boards.</P>

      <P>All through the Bill there are references to &ldquo;the consent of the Minister for Finance&rdquo; and &ldquo;with the approval of the Minister for Finance&rdquo;.

The Bill is cynical legislation which is being introduced without consultation with the partners, including those concerned with autism, who said they have not been consulted. It will prove to be a severe embarrassment to the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and while I welcome the Bill, I have reservations about it. <Col N="1237" />There have been tremendous improvements in the area of special education over the past four or five years, as the Minister outlined. Although I missed the early part of his speech, I have read the text. Nobody can deny that there have been great improvements. I laud the objectives of the Bill wholeheartedly. It is most important to establish a legislative framework around this area, the justification for which has existed for some time. In relation to the methodology, I have serious reservations about the Bill. I tend to agree with Senators Manning and O'Toole that this is high on bureaucracy and low on resources. There is great detail in relation to structures, how things are to be put in place and will operate. Matters are currently operating in a very similar way, but there are huge deficiencies.</P>
      <P>School transport is an entitlement of every person with a disability. The contract is with CIE or Bus Éireann as the case may be and has been subcontracted out to various transport operators who are entitled to put three passengers to a bench designed for two. That may be all right for small children who can fit in comfortably. However, some people with disabilities are much bigger than their age would suggest and are also put on a bench for two. We discussed road safety earlier this afternoon, including the use of mobile phones in cars and the need for seat belts, particularly in back seats. There is an ongoing television advertising campaign &ndash; quite rightly so &ndash; yet on school buses seat belts are not obligatory. That is one of the issues which give rise to my concern about the methodology of the Bill and the lack of resources. It is fine to have the objectives and justification for putting a structure in place but unless it is backed up by resources one is at nothing.</P>
      <P>I also go along with Senator Manning's view that it is unfortunate we have not had an opportunity to look at this important Bill in detail. I would prefer to have time to go through it in far more detail than was possible. That is unfortunate and the legislation will suffer as a result. It relates to an area about which people speak from the heart, giving their views freely and openly. It is not a political issue and never will be. I regret there is not more time to discuss it in detail. There is considerable bureaucracy involved.</P>
      <P>The national council for special education is being established which is a very good idea. Special educational needs organisers are being put in place, of which I am totally in favour. However, I am concerned as to how many will be appointed because, unless there are sufficient to cater for existing needs, they will not be able to do their job effectively. Will the pupils benefit? With the existing system, although a great deal of good work is being done, there are, unfortunately, huge deficiencies due to the lack of support services at the coal face.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another area of concern is in relation to wheelchairs. A young person getting a wheelchair at seven or eight years of age is liable to be told that <Col N="1238" />a replacement will only be provided at age 16 or 17 years, even though they will have long outgrown the original wheelchair. That is appalling. The cost of determining whether a person needs a wheelchair is far greater than its actual cost. It is time to put resources where they are needed.</P>
    <P>The situation with regard to speech therapy in special schools is nothing short of appalling. As Senator Ormonde pointed out, early intervention is vitally important. There are not enough speech therapists or educational psychologists. There are not enough graduates coming out of college and one reason is that they cannot get into college because of the high requirements under the points system. That is not to say they would not make very good educational psychologists, speech therapists or occupational therapists. We need to look at this area in far greater detail because, in the final analysis, it is the pupils with disabilities who will benefit. That is where the focus should be.</P>
    <P>The requirement for social workers in special schools needs to be taken on board. It was piloted in a number of places some 25 years ago and worked very effectively but never seemed to get off the ground properly. The reasoning behind it arises from the various dealings between such schools and other organisations, including health boards. A school may be at a location serving two, three or even four health boards which can give rise to a great deal of red tape. The appointment of a social worker, with responsibility for looking after all the details, would enable matters to run much more efficiently and teachers to focus on what they are supposed to do rather than chasing health boards on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>While I support the Bill, I have some reservations about it and hope that when we come to Committee Stage the Minister will have an open mind regarding suggestions from both sides of the House. This is something about which people genuinely feel strongly, as I am sure does the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I will return to the very interesting and extremely forthright speech of Senator Gibbons. I honour him for it because, although he sits on the Government benches, he made it clear that he has very strong reservations about the Bill. That is significant and it is a tribute to the House and to him as an individual that he is comfortable, or perhaps so uncomfortable, that he has to make a speech like it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not even attempted to read the Bill in the very short space of time it has been available to us. If I had only read the Minister's speech without hearing the comments of Senators Manning, O'Toole and Gibbons, I would be congratulating the Minister for doing such a wonderful job. Towards the end of Senator O'Toole's speech, the Minister invoked the concept of rights. Rights were referred to in the Minister's speech &ndash; it is all over it &ndash; but where are they in the Bill? I do not see them, but perhaps the Mini<Col N="1239" />ster can spell them out. I imagine this is why Mrs. Sinnott, among others, has opposed the Bill and that is why I will oppose it. Underneath what Senator Gibbons said is the implication that this is not a child-centred Bill and I do not believe it is.</P>
    <P>At the heart of the concern that led to the production of the Bill, post-haste in this House, is political motivation with an election coming. That is a pity. It is a shame because children should be at the centre of the Bill and it is clear that they are not. As Senator O'Toole said, it is hedged with so many provisions and let-out clauses, such as &ldquo;subject to the Department of Finance&rdquo;, &ldquo;as far as possible&rdquo; or &ldquo;as far as is capable&rdquo;. I cannot remember the exact words from glancing through the Bill, but it is so vague, particularly in terms of the production of resources. From where are all these things coming? I do not understand it. I still hear about schools running raffles to provide things that are not provided by the Department of Education and Science. From where will we get all these extra resources all of a sudden? There does not seem to be any provision or planning for that in the Bill.</P>
    <P>That highlights the deficiencies and problems of the legislation. The way it was introduced was extraordinary and scandalous. It is unprecedented, despite the fact that this is the end of term and we are used to every Administration railroading legislation through both Houses of the Oireachtas. This is a Bill in an area that has already been in trouble. There has already been a Government backdown. The Bill is suddenly produced and we are supposed to take all Stages tomorrow, although we only got the Bill some time this morning. Perhaps the Cathaoirleach will remind me if it was before the Order of Business or during it that the Bill was delivered to our pigeon-holes. I think I am right that it was this morning. It is astonishing, given the Bill's size and degree of complication, that we are expected to speak on other Bills while digesting this one and coming up with a reasoned analysis of it. It is virtually impossible.</P>
    <P>Thank God we have people like Senator O'Toole in the House. It shows the relevance of university seats because he is elected from that constituency and has direct and special expertise in it. For a number of years he has been head of one of the most significant unions in the area. He has the resources to supplement his knowledge by getting four people, as he instanced, to analyse the Bill for him and to come back with their conclusions. Each of them said it is a disaster. The Minister is hearing that very strongly and he should be very worried about it.</P>
    <P>I raised a case on the Adjournment involving the parents of an autistic child who had been receiving remedial teaching, particularly the attention of a speech therapist, which stopped because of a change in the school or the retirement of this person. The parents had to watch in <Col N="1240" />an agonised fashion as their child went backwards. The reply I got was a complete run-around referring to the health board, the hospital, the school, the Minister and the Department, but at the end of the day nothing was done. On that occasion the Minister explained one of the problems &ndash; to which Senator Gibbons referred &ndash; was the fact that provision of money alone was not enough as there were not sufficient people taking courses in the universities. There were insufficient graduates so the personnel simply was not there. From where will they come now? I do not believe they are there and the Minister is giving us an idle promise. This is wrong and unfair.</P>
    <P>It is very significant and interesting that so many organisations, even in the limited time we have had to consider the Bill and to refer it to them, have come out and said clearly and unambiguously that they regard it as mistaken. When one looks at the Minister's speech, there is a very long preamble, which is some six or eight pages long, reciting the achievements of the Department of Education and Science during the Minister's term in office in increasing the number of support teachers and so on. I will not be mean spirited and I will acknowledge that there have been achievements in that area, but that does not justify the Bill. It does not provide any greater resources in the Bill and a recital of this kind of history is intended as a kind of cosmetic framework for what is being delivered in the legislation. That makes me suspicious and when I was reading the Minister's speech, I wondered why it was taking so long to come to the boil. It was obvious it was providing, in as far as it was possible, a kind of positive environment in which to give us what I can only regard as a kind of double sell because I do not see where any of these resources will be found.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole made a devastating attack on the Bill and it was very useful and instructive to hear him. He listed the people involved in carrying out assessments &ndash; a psychologist, a medical practitioner, a teacher nominated by the principal of the school, a social worker and a therapist. He made an extremely effective point when he mentioned that there is no distinction drawn between a clinical psychologist and an educational psychologist. This is Dickensian stuff. It would do well in the context of Dotheboys Hall.</P>
    <P>Section 10(2)(<i>f</i>) of the Bill regarding the content of the education plan refers to &ldquo;the goals which the child is to achieve over a period not exceeding 12 months&rdquo;. The only comment I will permit myself on that is what limited horizons. Section 10 also deals with the appointment of the council at the discretion of the Minister. Unfortunately, this will not work. Even in the Long Title of the Bill there is no mention of rights and I challenge the Minister on this as he raised the question of rights and accused Senator O'Toole of standing in the way of children's rights by opposing the Bill. There is not a word about it in the Long Title but one telling phrase that is <Col N="1241" />included is &ldquo;to the greatest extent practicable&rdquo;. There is the Minister's let-out clause; the whole Bill is riddled with such clauses.</P>
    <P>This Bill should be withdrawn if the Minister wants to limit his losses. There is no doubt in my mind that he is making significant political losses by the unwise and hasty introduction of this Bill and the attempt to ram through all remaining Stages tomorrow. A sign of that is the considered reservation on the Government benches. I am glad that the proceedings of this House are now being televised and recorded because if anybody in the future wants to learn about the quality of this debate and its emotional content, all they will have to do is watch the body language of the Government speakers, including the Minister. They are clearly embarrassed and they have every right to be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKett" hpid="Mr. Kett Mr. Kett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kett</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. I am privileged to have been part of the Government that has been responsible for an unprecedented level of services for people with disabilities and special education needs over the last five years. It is an unfortunate reality that this area has been neglected for many years and many Governments can hold their hands up on that account. There were other priorities and it is no wonder that parents found it necessary to take matters into their own hands, which in certain circumstances led them to the courts.</P>
      <P>The problem that faced this Government when it came into office was a formidable one and many improvements were needed in the areas of disability and special needs education. There was a need to expand services and while there were areas in which developments had been set in train, there were others where nothing existed for the disabled. Therefore, I welcome this vital legislation which provides a statutory framework for those who educate people with special needs. It is right that meeting those needs is enforceable in law and this Bill targets a range of services which must be provided, including assessment and individual educational plans, along with support services to allow for mediation and appeal if these plans are not met.</P>
      <P>The Bill recognises the key role of parents in the education of their children and section 1 defines the criteria whereby a child is recognised as having special needs. Section 2 provides for the integration of children with special needs and those without them in an overall educational plan, taking into account the needs of the children and the wishes of parents. Most importantly, the Bill removes any doubts about having to retain children in special classes or schools, a matter that has been a sticking point for teachers in the past. I remember many parents having nightmares about their children being in special schools and special classes when they felt that those children were quite capable of integrating with the mainstream.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1242" />I welcome the substantial resources the Government has provided in this area over the last five years. The programme for government was an ambitious one as it related to disability and the Minister and Deputy Martin before him are to be commended for their commitment to it. It is a job well done.</P>
    <P>Those of us who work with the disabled accept that there is no magic wand for solving all the ills that need to be addressed, but the equality legislation that has passed through the House in the last five years, along with this Bill and the Disability Bill, will copperfasten the law in this area. The legislation will serve to increase the ability of children with special needs to educate themselves in the way that we all want them to. The days when a child registered in a special school could not be transferred to a school with an integrated approach are disappearing. That used to happen because the resources were not available. The parents and principals who managed in a few instances to get a child moved found that it led to the embarrassment of the child having to be looked after by their fellow pupils for toilet purposes and for their little comforts. That was appalling, but thankfully matters have improved considerably over the lifetime of this Government.</P>
    <P>This Bill places parents at the centre of the child's education and that is right, but I caution against giving them the right to choose what happens entirely. Parents with handicapped children &ndash; in fact, any of us with children &ndash; want the best possible outcome for them. People who have disabled children have a special desire and focus in this regard and in wanting the very best for their child they are not always the most objective adjudicators when it comes to deciding what the child's needs are. They often put their child at a disadvantage by over-exaggerating their capabilities and by arguing with the powers that be about what the child's requirements are.</P>
    <P>I recall an incident I was caught up in involving a young child, who had gone through the school system and an after school skill-based programme working on computers. She and her parents wanted her to be involved in the programme but, with the best will in the world, the child could not have worked on computers because she had poor hand movement. Having gone through the whole assessment process with psychologists, paramedics, therapists, the whole thing fell apart because the parents felt they were not getting a fair crack of the whip. I can understand that because parents want the best for their child and a parent with a handicapped child has a greater focus in that regard. The story gives a small insight into how a parent can react in certain circumstances. Senator O'Toole alluded to the fact that parents were the only people under the Bill who have the overall right to object and that is something that could be looked at.</P>
    <P>There is a need to train teachers and other personnel working with people with disabilities. <Col N="1243" />Ongoing resources are required to provide for pre-service and inservice training for special needs teachers and their assistants, irrespective of where their placements are. The teachers working in the special needs schools also need additional training to bring them up to speed with the new requirements being made of them through the introduction of the individualised programmes and the complex issue of integration.</P>
    <P>Section 8 of the Bill provides for a register of all children with special needs, the idea being to identify them at an early stage in their development to ensure that their needs are met and, more importantly, to ensure that those needs are monitored. This is an excellent idea, which should have been implemented years ago, and it should not be introduced in the education system only. A register gives the opportunity to plan, apart from anything else, because through it we know what needs might or might not have to be met down the road.</P>
    <P>Section 16 is also extremely important, setting out as it does the position of adults with disability. If the council considers that a person, on reaching 18 years of age, has not really got the best value from the education system, it can opt to provide for an additional year of education. This is very important. As someone who has served on the board of management of a special school, I know that one of the predominant requests being made by parents has been for an additional year for children who parents felt had not matured sufficiently. That was not possible because the resources were not there. The Department of Education and Science said that the school could provide it, but would get no money to do so and, consequently, it was not possible to provide the service.</P>
    <P>The increasing availability of more meaningful programmes, training courses, employment support services, such as FÁS, and ongoing EU-funded schemes is a real source of comfort to parents. The fact that the ongoing capabilities and needs in this regard are now being pegged a year in advance of the child finishing school is also encouraging.</P>
    <P>People referred to the use of technology. Technology plays a major role in children with disabilities accessing the curriculum. To date the technology has been made available to the school rather than to individual children. That practice should be examined. If one gives a piece of equipment to the child, the child will see it as his or her own special tool for learning. However, there appears to be a conflict between the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Education and Science as to which Department pays for it. The use of technology is a major issue for children in special schools and I urge the Minister to examine it. He should also look at the use of technology in State examinations. I welcome the Bill and wish it well.</P>

      <P>I was at a meeting in London yesterday to discuss the problem of litigation relating to obstetrics and the high number of cases that are taken regarding cerebral palsy and other problems and disabilities in children which parents believe to be associated with birth injuries. The number of cases taken in this country is much higher than in the UK. One doctor said something very depressing, that it was only after she had visited Ireland and seen the standard of care we provide for people with disabilities that she began to understand why people took these cases. They were so desperate to do something for their child, they thought that if they could ascribe the condition to birth injury &ndash; perhaps they believed it was due to birth injury &ndash; and secure substantial funds as a result, they could do something for the child because so little is done.</P>
      <P>The Minister has secured more funds for educationally deprived people but this Bill is not the solution to the problem of education for people with disabilities. I support Senator O'Toole's contribution. I did not see this Bill until 2.30 p.m. today. It was extremely difficult to go through such a long Bill. In fact, I do not know if it deals with behavioural disorders, which is one of the most difficult problems for the people who contact me about their children. Last week I voiced my gratitude to the Minister for including mental illness alongside mental disability in the Residential Institutions Redress Bill. However, there is so much in this Bill to be considered that I cannot see how it can possibly be done tomorrow, along with what else is planned.</P>
      <P>I support Senator O'Toole's comments on this matter. I hope the Bill can be withdrawn so we can examine it more thoroughly. Let us hope we will be back in the House to do so at a future date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed with the treatment given to this Bill. There is great need for urgent legislation but the way this Bill has been treated leaves much to be desired. I am disappointed with the Minister. We received this Bill at 2.30 p.m. today. There has been no chance for the various organisations, who have made numerous representations over the years to Governments and Opposition spokespeople on disabilities, to put forward amendments or their side of the case.</P>
      <P>The Bill is flawed. It does not contain a financial provision. I am disappointed that the Minister brought the Bill to the House without any financial considerations being put in place. Ultimately, the Minister for Education and Science will be at the mercy of the Minister for Finance because the Bill does not contain the financial provision it requires. I support the comments of other Senators in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1245" />Who will carry out the assessment of the students? That is an important consideration. I urge the Minister to reconsider the Bill, even at this late stage, or to give an indication that he will take corrective action by putting forward relevant amendments to ensure there will be financial provision and to guarantee that funding will be put in place to implement the Bill's provisions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I circulated the Bill last Friday in a White Paper. My difficulty was getting the Bill printed due to all the legislation being processed at present and the consequent pressure on the Bills Office.</P>
      <P>I thought it was important to pursue this Bill because people have come to me, including some of the people mentioned in the debate today, and said that I am providing the resources. Nobody can deny that stepping from £7 million to £70 million per year is a huge quantum leap forward. That has never happened in our history. Yet, when we debate this issue, some Senators talk as if we are trying to cut resources. We are not doing that. We are providing virtually unlimited resources. I said as much earlier in my term of office and people laughed, but let them laugh now. When £7 million has been increased to £70 million in such a short time, it is not a laughing matter. It is a clear demonstration of commitment.</P>
      <P>In October 1998 the Government made a formal decision for the first time, and I am not blaming previous Governments, that the needs of children in education with special needs were to be met and the money was to be provided to do that. When I was appointed to office at the beginning of 2000, I interpreted that decision literally. I outlined my interpretation and secured agreement on it. That is why I said, when I was under pressure from people who claimed we would not do various things, that the Government decision had virtually given me an open cheque book for assessed needs. That is the way it has been since then and that is how it will continue.</P>
      <P>People now accept that this is happening. The number of classes for autistic children, with six children in each class, increased from five to 90. The number is now 98 and it continues to rise. I hear people say it will not happen and that people will not do it, but they are doing it. There was reluctance but there is no reluctance now. Some people will not do it, but there are always people who will not do everything. It is a big country with plenty of people and there will be some people who will not be anxious to do it. However, parents and teachers got together in the interests of the children and we now have 98 classes where previously there were five.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no question of somebody trying to pull a trick for an election. This work is already happening. I meet the people. I visit them and see what they are doing and how they are working. There is argument about the different systems <Col N="1246" />and the training methods. Some people have a registered system and they believe it is the best system. However, the Department will not go entirely for a registered trademark system. It will go for the best systems. People can go their own way after that.</P>
    <P>I accept the comments about training. There is a great deal of work to be done. It is a matter on which I am working. I will have a statement for the Senator very soon before the general election. I do not know when it will be held, but it will be some time in May. I just work on what has to be done. Notwithstanding the upcoming general election, I will put the matter on the table and if people do not like it, they will say so, but I will do my best to get it right. I will listen to what is said.</P>
    <P>People asked, &ldquo;If there is a change of Government and a change of Minister, how can we be sure that it will continue?&rdquo;  I said in response that I would include it in legislation and make it binding on any Government. I had to go through all of the process with my officials, with the task force carrying out extensive consultations on my behalf and putting together views, not just those of any one group but of people all over the country. My officials have had extensive consultation with those leading and organising groups. The proposals before the House arose from that process.</P>
    <P>It is a statutory provision about which Senator Kett was quite correct. The Bill does provide a statutory framework. It also guarantees rights and will be enforceable in law. That is what all Governments in the past avoided. I had to go to Government eventually and get it to agree to more than the blank cheque which it gave me earlier, not for just anything but for assessed needs.</P>
    <P>We had problems trying to get all the assessments done. They are ongoing. There were people saying they wanted an assessment, but they also wanted a plan. They did not want it to be just an assessment as a start. They wanted it to be continuous. Therefore, they wanted a plan. They were correct. I accept that is the way it should be.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the points made by Senators. I am anxious to give that statutory right. I would like to have been here with the Bill sooner, but there were many issues which caused delay. Senators know what it is like getting legislation organised and through the office of the parliamentary counsel, etc. Last Friday I could not get the Bill printed by the Bills office, which was under too much pressure. Therefore, I printed a White Paper which we proof-read ourselves. That was referred to in the newspapers on Saturday and people commented on it. This morning the Bills Office gave it priority and had the Bill ready for us today.</P>
    <P>Senators have made many points which I will consider. In addition to the task force, I must mention that from an organisational point of view <Col N="1247" />there was the Cromien report which stated there should be a national council. We had it examined independently which report stated there should be a national council for special needs because somebody must be meeting these needs in a co-ordinated way on a national basis. It is not to exclude education or anything else, but to ensure there is a driving force to deliver on the report.</P>
    <P>Everybody has read the Cromien report which we have discussed. It is not new. We also discussed the task force report. The Bill encapsulates both. In effect, the national council will become the framework through which this is driven. They will ensure it happens.</P>
    <P>The other aspect of all this is that we provide a mediation and an appeals system. In addition, one can take the matter to court and insist on rights. Various people have been looking for this whole process, this statutory right and the right to take the matter to the courts. In this case, for primary school children one can go the whole way through. That is a statutory right. It is all in this legislation which Senators can reject. They can vote against it if they feel they want to do so.</P>
    <P>People spoke mostly about resources. There is a section in the Bill which details the provision of resources. The Bill uses the words &ldquo;the Minister shall&rdquo;. The Minister does not have an option. He or she must act in consultation with the Minister for Finance. Everything one does on that score is done in consultation, but the words used in the Bill are &ldquo;the Minister shall&rdquo;. It does not state &ldquo;the Minister may&rdquo; or &ldquo;the Minister for Finance may or may not,&rdquo; but that &ldquo;the Minister shall,&rdquo; and he or she must do so. That is how a person, if he or she so wishes, can go right through the process all the way to court to insist on this right which is spelled out clearly. Any Minister in any Department must consult with the Department of Finance, but in the case of resources, the obligation is set out in the Bill and is a statutory requirement.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole spoke about the need for resources. He said one could not do any of this until the necessary resources are in place and the people are prepared for it. All that must follow. We are already doing much of it. I stated the numbers in operation where services are being provided. All that must be discussed and the necessary resources must be provided, but I gave figures for the numbers of staff and assistants.</P>
    <P>One of the big issues is the question of assistants. The number of assistants in classrooms has risen from 299 to over 3,000 in just two and a quarter years. I cannot do any more than this. I provided the resources which will continue to be provided. They are going in by the hundred at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Because the courts decided, as the Minister and I both know.</P>

    </P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>No. I know that the Senator has a particular view. As Minister, I am saying what I am doing. The courts do not decide for me. I am the Minister and bring legislation forward. I am providing the assistants, although there will be argument about how many there should be and about other matters. We are working out the systems which will be well worked out. Given a little time, I am quite confident that the support for children with a disability in Ireland will be as good, if not better, than that provided anywhere because that is the way it is going.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole was very concerned about resources generally. Time and again he returned to the issue. I must point out to him that the resources for assessed needs will be provided under the direction of the national council. They must be provided and the Bill states the Minister shall provide them.</P>
      <P>No doubt, as Senator Kett stated, one cannot do this overnight with a magic wand, but the one issue about which the vast majority who came to me were concerned was that the right would be set out and would not change in the future. Now that we have taken this quantum leap, I do not see it changing. I do not see it changing if there is another Government or Minister. However, as it could change, we are including it clearly in the legislation in order that people can work to it.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole talked about schools' ability and problems with them etc., but the onus will be on the Minister and the Department to provide the necessary support for children in these cases. If a particular school cannot do it, it will have to find another way. They must also provide the resources and there will be an appeals system in place.</P>
      <P>This is, in effect, a huge change. No doubt it will be an expensive one, but we have made the decision that we will go along this road. I said earlier that it follows the various decisions in the courts &ndash; I am not saying otherwise. I know people who have worked in this area for many years. I have collected money myself, as have other Senators and Deputies, and have done various things over the years. Of course many people have done much good work, but we now want to provide a first-class service to these children. That is expensive but it is being done.</P>
      <P>One of the problems is that, because we have provided extra resource teachers, supports and assistants, schools which were doing fine otherwise now need extensions. Not only do we have to deal with all the schools that have problems from the past &ndash; there are many of these because a historical deficit has to be made up, and a lot of money is going towards this &ndash; but in addition, new facilities, resources and spaces are needed. It is a headache and a difficulty, but it is being dealt with. Much of the money I am spending on buildings is going towards extra resources for children with special needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Toole spoke of the involvement in the board. As far as we are concerned, we will <Col N="1249" />involve the education partners in the council and in its composition&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>That is in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It has taken place all the time in respect of every possible thing we do. Under the Cromien report, I am setting up the national council because that is part of the re-organisation and the arrangements. However, this will give it a statutory basis and authority. I can give it an administrative basis and administrative authority.</P>
      <P>Both Senators O'Toole and Kett raised a question about the parent being the only person who can appeal. We will return to that on Committee Stage as we go through the sections. I have listened to what the Senators have had to say in that regard.</P>
      <P>I regret that I could not have had the Bill available earlier or printed sooner. However, it is good legislation. It gives a statutory right for the first time. It puts an onus on the Minister of the day to provide the resources and it provides an appeal system where this is not done, right up to court level. It also provides a whole system. The obligations are on the national council. Section 19 sets out the requirements and says the council &ldquo;shall&rdquo; have the functions to establish and maintain the register and disseminate to schools and parents the information. It does not say that it &ldquo;may&rdquo; do so. There is a compulsion.</P>
      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions to this debate. I thank Senator Kett, who is obviously close to the issue of special needs and who welcomed the provision of a statutory framework for the services and their provision as a right. Likewise, Senator Ormonde recognised that and welcomed it, for which I thank her. Senator Gibbons welcomed it and had some reservations and concerns. I hope that, by the time we are finished, his concerns will be met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot do a lot about the school transport system, which is a separate issue. Much has been developed and prepared in this regard. I accept <Col N="1250" />the points made about a sort of bureaucracy in terms of the national council, but this legislation is to provide the underpinning for the delivery of all the services that will be provided and guaranteed.</P>
    <P>A question was raised about speech therapists. I have recently authorised another 75 places at university for speech therapists. There is a deficit in this respect and there is not doubt it is a problem area. We have to find ways to get over the problems. The health boards have direct responsibility in providing the speech therapists but I am not passing the buck.</P>
    <P>Educational psychologists are defined at the beginning. There were 44, but we have increased the number to 100. Interviews are taking place at the moment, which will bring it up to 160. The figure given as needed for the whole country, for all educational circumstances, was 200. Within a matter of weeks, we will be up to 160 and by the end of the year I will have approval to increase the number to 200, two years ahead of the arrangements under the national plan. The Government has agreed to advance it and it is now being addressed very urgently. The effects are beginning to be felt. Because the assessments are available, it will be possible to get the plans and do the other things which cannot be done until one has the staff. The staff numbers are now increasing substantially and we will have a good service in a relatively short time throughout the whole country.</P>
    <P>The educational psychologists now come directly under the aegis of the Department and we have approval for that. Within a matter of weeks, when the appointments commission has finished its work, we will have another 60 educational psychologists, which will bring the figure up to approximately 160. We have permission to increase the number to 200 by the end of the year, which we will proceed to do.</P>
    <P>I thank everybody for their contributions. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
