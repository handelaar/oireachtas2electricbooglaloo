      <P>I have received notice from Senator Glynn that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Environment and Local Government to provide the necessary resources to upgrade the Mullingar sewer network and sewage treatment plant in order to allow the town to develop as a gateway town as envisaged in the national spacial strategy.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Ross of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Transport to outline the criteria he uses in appointing members to State boards under his aegis, in particular Aer Rianta.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Coghlan of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Transport to outline the details of the intended closure and proposed sale of the Torc Great Southern Hotel, Killarney, County Kerry; the present position of the Great Southern Hotel, Parknasilla, and the proposals, if any, for the remainder of the group.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Henry of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to outline the reason Ireland has not signed the Oviedo Convention which, among other matters on human rights, prohibits the cloning of human beings.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator John Paul Phelan of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need to ask the Minister for Finance, in view of the fact that research has shown that the south-east region has lagged behind the State average in the context of economic performance and prospects, the action he is going to take to reverse this trend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1394" />I have also received notice from Senator Morrissey of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Transport to outline the measures he proposes to initiate to overcome the traffic gridlock which will be caused at Parkgate Street, Dublin 7, with the introduction of a two and a half minute interval for the Luas service crossing there.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Glynn, Ross and Coghlan as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senators Henry, John Paul Phelan and Morrissey may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. B. Hayes Mr. B. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>We agree with the Order of Business as proposed by the Leader. I avail of the opportunity afforded to me under the Order of Business to refer briefly to the tragic loss yesterday of our colleague and friend, Jim Mitchell, a distinguished former Member of the other House, a former Cabinet Minister, a former Lord Mayor of Dublin, and an institution in Irish politics for over two and a half decades. The sense of loss is felt by many Members of this and the other House on all sides, but it is particularly felt by the people of Dublin who lost a champion, one of their own, who was able to cut through a lot of politics and get to the heart of issues and was able to articulate their concerns. The family of the late Jim Mitchell, Patsy and the five children, and particularly his brother, Gay, who is known to us all, have lost a husband, a father, a brother. On behalf of my colleagues in the Seanad I take this opportunity to convey our sympathies to the Mitchell family on this loss, which is not only a loss to them but a loss to politics and to the country. It is terrible that at the age of 56 he was taken from us.</P>
      <P>I am pleased that you, a Chathaoirligh, the Leader and Members have afforded me the opportunity to state that in the Seanad. We will miss him greatly as we go forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>We would all like to be associated with the condolences to the Mitchell family and to the Fine Gael Party and to express our appreciation of the remarks uttered by Senator Brian Hayes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An issue has arisen in the past two or three days in Limerick city with the murder of a security man. I raise this issue, which happened in the <Col N="1395" />Cathaoirleach's county, because often murders, stabbings and killings in Limerick city are written off as being the work of thugs. This man worked hard to keep a clean, safe city for young people and stood up to the drugs barons and drugs gangs in Limerick city. He was killed cruelly by contract killers who, it would appear, had been sent to the States to train in the use of automatic weapons.</P>
    <P>This is a matter about which we should all be concerned. It would be terribly wrong to look on this as something that has simply happened in Limerick city. This is as fundamental as the murder of Veronica Guerin who also stood up to the same kind of people. Limerick is a self-contained city where people like this could be dealt with. That night club was frequented in the main by secondary school children and was well run. If they can insinuate themselves in those areas we are all at risk.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come into the House, make a statement on the issue and indicate the steps the Garda will take and what resources are needed. A huge amount of resources were put into following up the murder of Veronica Guerin and it should be done in this case also. It is a watershed and we need to grasp the nettle now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I would like to be associated with the remarks of Senator Brian Hayes. I had the pleasure of knowing Jim Mitchell for the best part of 20 years or more. As well as being a politician I respected, he was a person I liked. On both grounds his demise at a young age is particularly regrettable. We in the Labour Party would like to convey our deepest sympathies to his family and the Fine Gael Party.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator O'Toole. Perhaps I am poorly informed, but in the 1980s, if there was even a whiff of a Northern Ireland connection with political activities with which I was involved, at least three or four large members of the Garda Síochána would observe the meeting to make sure nothing subversive happened. It is a mystery to me how the resources that were available for such activity in the 1980s have not been redirected to deal with an equally potent threat to life in society. I urge the Leader to invite the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the House to discuss the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform should also be invited to discuss the issue of the abuse of alcohol. I do not want to be driven by television, but it makes things we do not wish to see clear to us. Last Thursday night's &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme on the abuse of alcohol should have everybody concerned. I say this as one who is anything but a puritan on the topic. There is a case, not for a partisan political look, but a serious reflective look at the issue. We should have a serious look at attitudes to alcohol, the regulation of its sale, its control and our value system. I am concerned about living in a society <Col N="1396" />where one quarter of our young people seem to believe the only way to enjoy oneself is to get so drunk as to forget one has enjoyed oneself, and to do this on a regular basis. I find this quite distressing.</P>
    <P>Senator Leyden has been articulate about what is happening in Iraq. The Government should restate its position. It is an extraordinary contradiction that the UN inspectors are being facilitated to a degree none of us imagined, yet the President of the United States is saying the opposite of what everybody else seems to think. Everybody except one of the major players is encouraged. What is the Government's position on progress? A debate on the matter would be useful.</P>
    <P>Last week I raised the issue of competitiveness. May we have a discussion at some stage on privatisation, public ownership and competitiveness? There is much ideological baggage involved on both sides as the national report on competitiveness indicates. I have no desire to see the ESB sold off as it is, perhaps, the jewel in the crown of the public sector. It is so good no private body is prepared to compete with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not normal practice for the Seanad to mark the passing of someone who was not a former Member of the House, but the circumstances surrounding former Deputy Jim Mitchell's death are exceptional in view of his ability and record of service to the other House. I had the privilege of travelling with him this time last year. He was in great spirits, full of enthusiasm and ideas and looking forward to the challenges ahead. It is a matter of great regret that he has died in such tragic circumstances and at such a young age. We extend our sympathy to his wife and family, his Fine Gael colleagues and his brother, Chairman of the Joint Committee on European Affairs. I thank the Cathaoirleach for his flexibility on the matter.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Ryan that we should debate the issue of Iraq at an early opportunity. It should be held when it is clear what the Iraqi response is to demands in regard to information on its weapons and when we know the outcome of the inspections. I was in the United States at the weekend when it seemed there was a mood for war within the Administration, irrespective of what findings were made. This is worrying. It is a matter to which this House should give attention. I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy" hpid="Mr. McCarthy Mr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange for the Minster for Education and Science to come before the House for a debate on the schools building programme? A worrying article in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> lists a number of schools that are in a substandard condition, which is not acceptable. Development projects for the schools in question are all at the tendering stage and, given that there was a 4% reduction in expenditure in the area in the Estimates, I appeal <Col N="1397" />to the Leader to allow the Minister to discuss the matter with Members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I echo calls from Senator Ryan and others for a debate on alcohol misuse, particularly in terms of how it affects accident and emergency and acute psychiatric units. It is outrageous and horrendous that accident and emergency units have almost become battlegrounds because people enter them late at night having been involved in rows as a result of their ingesting too much alcohol. Most people took a dim view of the recent RTE &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme which &ndash; though not through any fault on the part of the producers, who should be commended &ndash; made for grim viewing. We must also reflect on the types of products, such as alcopops, which are available to young people. I ask that an urgent debate be arranged with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on the matter.</P>
      <P>I requested a debate on the management of housing estates and the Leader correctly replied that this is a matter for local authorities. However, the legislation governing the regulation of housing estates is a matter for this House and the Dáil and, therefore, I ask for a debate on the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the calls by Senators Dardis and Ryan for a debate on Iraq, but from a different point of view. Today is world population day and I have in my possession the UNFPA's most recent figures on maternal and infant mortality. In Iraq, maternal mortality is now 370 women per 100,000 births, while in Iran, the figure is 130 per 100,000 births. In Iraq, infant mortality is 64 per 100,000 live births, while in Iran, it is 36 per 100,000. Iraq always had the better medical service of the two countries, so who will now state that sanctions have not hurt Iraq's civilian population?</P>
      <P>I also support calls for a debate on alcohol consumption and young people. The Leader said she was fortunate enough to have not supported the calls for an extension to opening hours. Unfortunately, I did support those calls because I believed that our drinking habits might become more like those of people on the Continent. On the contrary, we seem to have become uncontrollable. I suggest that we could narrow the debate down to a consideration of reversing the extension to drinking hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the calls by Senators Ryan and Glynn for a debate regarding the alcohol problem, particularly among young people. We must examine the impact of this matter on society and see what steps can be taken. It is important to have a prompt debate on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A subject in which I am particularly interested is An Bord Pleanála and its role in relation to planning. I have requested a debate on this matter on many occasions. There is a suggestion that Part V of the planning legislation is to be reviewed in respect of its provisions on social and <Col N="1398" />affordable housing in terms of the role of An Bord Pleanála. There seems to be conflict regarding the transparency of An Bord Pleanála in respect of a number of applications for planning permission that have been referred to it. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government should come before the House to make a statement so that Members can discuss this matter which is causing great confusion among members of the public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh" hpid="Dr. Mansergh Dr. Mansergh">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to urge the Minister for Finance, on the next occasion he attends an ECOFIN meeting, to congratulate his Swedish counterpart on his Government's courage in organising a referendum on the euro, which it is uncertain of winning. Completing the spread of the euro is of great importance to people in Ireland and to others on these islands. Perhaps if the Swedes are successful, others will take a leaf out of their book. Perhaps we could have a debate after Christmas on European economic and financial issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader ascertain from the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources whether he proposes to introduce a hardship fund to provide financial assistance for fishermen who lost boats during the severe storms last weekend? In Seafield and Quilty six boats sank causing very severe financial hardship to those involved. May we have some indication as to whether the Minister will have any funds available to help alleviate the situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EddieBohan" hpid="Mr. Bohan Mr. Bohan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bohan</NameTxt>
      <P>I watched the recent television programme to which reference has been made and was greatly shocked by it. I venture to say 99% of publicans in Dublin and throughout the country also found it shocking. They are not responsible for what was shown on the programme, which showed events happening at 3 a.m. The individuals involved were staggering out of night clubs. It is now common practice for many teenage drinkers to start their evening's drinking before they leave home &ndash; they may be already drunk before they leave the house. It is much cheaper for them to buy their supply in an off-licence or supermarket and drink at each other's houses in turn from week to week.</P>
      <P>I was shocked to learn a few weeks ago that a licence has been granted, for the first time ever, for an off-licence in O'Connell Street, Dublin, at a time when it was already difficult enough to control the situation on the streets when people were coming out of pubs. It makes matters far worse when they can buy alcohol in an off-licence and consume it on the streets. The behaviour shown on the television programme in question was not confined to Dublin &ndash; it also applies in other urban areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know of no publican who would serve alcoholic drink to children aged 13, 14 or 15 years. However, they are quite freely buying supplies in an off-licence or supermarket and getting <Col N="1399" />drunk on the streets. Publicans are being wrongly blamed for this. While there may a few black sheep in the licensed trade, publicans in Dublin and elsewhere in the country were as shocked as I was by the scenes shown on the programme in question. The sooner the Garda clamps down on those serving alcohol in such circumstances, the better.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call for a debate on the abuse of alcohol which should not be confined to opening hours and closing times. It is a far bigger issue, and includes the question of advertising. The drinks industry has hijacked many of our sports events, including the club championships with which the Cathaoirleach will be familiar. There have been moves by successive Governments to tackle the tobacco advertising issue. A similar approach must be followed in relation to drinks advertising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonScanlon" hpid="Mr. Scanlon Mr. Scanlon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Scanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Ormonde's call for a debate on An Bord Pleanála. In two instances of which I am aware a local authority granted planning permission for developments, objections were made to An Bord Pleanála whose inspectors visited the sites and recommended that the local authority decision be upheld, yet the board refused permission. That was totally outrageous. There are questions to be answered in the House by the appropriate Minister. Faceless people are making decisions with regard to areas they have never visited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader clarify whether it is intended to take only Committee Stage of the National Tourism Development Authority Bill this afternoon, not Report and Final Stages? We have tried over the years in this House to establish a policy of not rushing through Committee and Report Stages together. I gather the Leader did not say what was planned, but I hope that the standards of the House will apply and we will have time to reflect on points made on Committee Stage. The Bill was published very recently and we should have the opportunity to give it our full attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan" hpid="Mr. Minihan Mr. Minihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I too support the call by Senator Ormonde for a debate on An Bord Pleanála and the planning issue. I raised this on the Order of Business two weeks ago. I emphasise again that the co-relationship between local authority planning decisions, inspectors from An Bord Pleanála and the ultimate decision of the board leaves much to be desired. It is all over the place and we have to get it right. It negates proper development when local authority planners and inspectors from an Bord Pleanála can uphold a planning decision and it can be overturned by the board on one objection. This has severely affected major developments in Cork and elsewhere. The debate should be held sooner rather than later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1400" />
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Ms O'Rourke Ms O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to speak on the matter raised by Senator Brian Hayes, the leader of Fine Gael in the Seanad. He discussed it with me briefly before we started. Despite the fact that the late Mr. Jim Mitchell was not a Member of this House, his status and his singular record as a politician make it proper that the leaders of the parties of the Upper House of the Oireachtas should have a chance, albeit in an informal way, of paying our respects to him.</P>
      <P>It was Jim Mitchell's bravery more than anything else that I always commended. He had to face up to a horrendous health problem and he did so while continuing to work. I admire how he dealt with it publicly and, I am sure, privately. In so doing he was an inspiring example to other people who face such grave news about their health.</P>
      <P>He had an undoubted record in public life in all sorts of ways, but most of all he had the common touch. He was a Dubliner who interacted with the people of his city in various ways, at local elections, general elections, European elections and everyday activities. On behalf of Fianna Fáil I join the leaders of other parties who have expressed their sympathy.</P>
      <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for his latitude in allowing this discussion. I also commend the Fine Gael decision, out of respect for the late Jim Mitchell, not to raise anything on the Order of Business. We appreciate that and understand it. Senator O'Toole also joined in paying respects to him.</P>
      <P>The murder in Limerick of the security man has touched a raw nerve in everyone. It was compared to the murder of Veronica Guerin and the resources which were put in place to track down those killers. We will have a debate on that and related crime issues with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan mentioned the alcohol debate and the need for the Minister to come to the House to discuss it. He also mentioned a debate on Iraq. I too heard on the morning news the seeming contradiction of the inspector saying that all was well so far and the immediate response from President Bush that it was all a sham. Senator Ryan also wants the report on competitiveness and privatisation discussed. That would be a very worthy debate. We sent a message to the Tánaiste's office and I will renew it in an endeavour to debate that matter.</P>
      <P>Senator McCarthy suggested inviting the Minister for Education and Science to discuss the schools building programme. I read the page with great attention, as did everyone who has been involved in supporting such projects. The Minister for Education and Science has been very open about it and has published the state of play. It would be good to have a debate with him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Glynn raised the issue of alcohol abuse and how it affects the accident and emergency units of hospitals, particularly at night, when there are stand up fights. That is one factor. <Col N="1401" />Another factor is the products which make up such a lethal combination, particularly for young people who are unable to cope.</P>
    <P>The Senator also asked for an examination of legislation relating to the management of housing estates and I agree such a debate would be worthwhile. The Senator spoke to me about the legislation earlier and I feel it would be useful if he were to bring forward amendments.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry spoke about Iraq. The infant and mother mortality rate in Iraq is quite high and it is clear, as the Senator said, that the sanctions affect people every day. Such statistics are overlooked and rarely cited, but they are a strong reminder of what is happening.</P>
    <P>Senator Ormonde asked about alcohol issues and An Bord Pleanála. Senators Scanlon and Minihan also referred to An Bord Pleanála. I can inform Senators that a planning Bill will be brought before the House next week. The debate on the Bill will be an opportune time for Senators to express misgivings about how the system works. I hope the matter will receive a good airing.</P>
    <P>Senator Mansergh referred to next year's referendum in Sweden on the euro and I congratulate the Swedish Government on taking such a risky decision. I hope the House will debate European economic and financial issues in the new year, as such a debate would be worthwhile in the light of vague threats coming from Europe.</P>
    <P>Senator Daly asked about the hardship fund for fishermen whose boats were ruined during the storms of the past week. I remind him that such matters can be raised in the context of the Fisheries (Amendment) Bill, 2002.</P>
    <P>Senator Bohan was quite right to express his views on the fact that young people buy alcoholic drinks from off-licences for consumption at home before they go out. I wonder what parents are doing if that is happening so readily within the home. I appreciate the Senator's opinion.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry spoke about the opening hours of licensed premises and I agree that they are one aspect of the problem. As Senator Glynn said, the changing nature of alcoholic products is also a factor. The issue of many people, fuelled with alcohol and in many cases determined to cause a nuisance or huge upset, spilling out of clubs and on to the streets at 3 a.m. should be examined.</P>
    <P>Senator Kitt discussed the advertising of alcohol, which is a huge issue. We will have to look at the fact that many of the sporting venues and events we love are sponsored by drinks companies. A lively advertisement featuring sparkling people can make alcohol seem attractive. Such advertisements are part of the overall scene which is influencing young people in an adverse manner, leading to the over-consumption of alcoholic products.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn asked about Report Stage of the National Tourism Development Authority Bill, 2002, Committee Stage of which will be taken this evening. I intend to ensure, as far as possible, that sufficient time is allowed between <Col N="1402" />Committee and Report Stages of Bills that come before the House, but it may not be possible with one or two Bills.</P>

I will leave it to Senator Quinn to decide about amendment No. 4, but I had expected it would be obligatory, rather than legally possible, to publish things electronically. The Minister's amendment does not make it clear that this is the case.</P>

      <P>Like Senator Ryan, I have no problem with the actual wording of the electronic terms. The area of which I am not sure is that mentioned by Senator Ryan. My intention all along was to make sure that it would be possible to have any of these details electronically published, but also to compel publication under certain circumstances. This is not dealt with in this section or in amendments Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, and I would like the Minister's view on it at this stage. The reason I was a little late was that I was speaking at the Law Society offices at a very interesting conference on drafting legislation. The point I made was this: if we are to make sure legislation is not remote from citizens and that there is real democracy, legislation must be accessible. There is no better, easier, less costly or speedier way of making it accessible than through electronic media.</P>
      <P>In the past when we asked that something be published, it could be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> or in a local or national newspaper. In certain circumstances we should insist that it be published electronically in order that someone who does not want to buy a newspaper or travel to inspect <i>Iris Oifigiúil </i>will find it accessible. We must compel, not just enable, publication in certain circumstances. Does the Minister accept that there must be a compulsion in the legislation for certain of the publications to be available in an electronic format? It is the modern way to do things, it is quicker, more open and accessible and costs much less.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 4 responds to the concerns raised by Senator Quinn. We maintained that electronic publication was not prohibited under the legislation as drafted. To avoid any doubt we extended the definition of &ldquo;publication&rdquo; to include the electronic mode of publication.</P>
      <P>Compellability is a different issue. Legislation cannot be prescriptive in that sense as it could lead to circumstances that might cause huge difficulties, not only for this agency, but for all agencies. Given that its whole ethos is to move parameters in IT, the digital hub will use the most up-to-date means of getting the message out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment should take care of the Senator's main query about the inclusion of electronic means, but it will not act as a compunction to the authority because that would put a differ<Col N="1404" />ent slant on the work of all agencies. The amendment is suitable in the circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I indicated on Committee Stage that I would table amendments to spell out in greater detail what is already explicit in the Bill regarding the agency's commercial remit. These amendments deal with the powers of the agency arising from its functions to exploit commercial opportunities arising from its functions to receive income and to make payments. This highlights the fact that, as a commercial body, the agency will be obliged to obtain revenue from its activities. The amendment to subsection (1)(<i>a</i>) reflects the fact that in some instances it would be more appropriate for the agency to take a direct role in procuring land or property for the digital hub and in carrying out construction and maintenance works as opposed to using PPPs.</P>
      <P>While I am satisfied that, as it stands, the Bill would confer all the necessary powers to the agency, it has been decided to include two further amendments to subsection (1), at paragraphs (<i>h</i>) and (<i>i</i>), which will outline in greater detail the powers of the agency to partner the private sector in order to fulfil its commercial remit. These deal specifically with the agency's powers to enter into agreements for the purpose of developing the hub, including agreements for funding. A further three amendments, which will add three new subsections to section (8), will outline what is already implicit in the Bill regarding the agency's commercial remit. The new subsections (5) and (6) will deal with the powers of the agency arising from its functions to exploit commercial opportunities and to receive income and make payments. This highlights the fact that the agency, as a commercial body, will be obliged to obtain its revenue from its own activities.</P>
      <P>The new subsection (7) complements the provision at section 9(6) which gives retrospective sanction to any agreements entered into by the company prior to the enactment of the Bill. These new provisions will make the statutory underpinning for these aspects of the agency's functions as explicit as possible to take into account the perception of the project by potential commercial partners. It will strengthen the PPP process and the standing of the agency in the eyes of the market. The amendments are in line with current legislative precedents such as the State Authorities (Public Private Partnership Arrangements) Act and the Transport (Railway Infrastructure) Act.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that and I will do my best. It was late in the afternoon before I had a chance to read the section.</P>
      <P>I wish to inquire about subsection (1) of the new list of functions. It states the functions of the agency shall be to enter, where appropriate, into an agreement with a person who has arranged or provided funding for the carrying out of any part of the development of the digital hub. I would like this to be less formal. I am concerned because I do not understand how the Minister can be sure these will be commercial arrangements.</P>
      <P>The agency is meant to be a commercial body. The Minister has told us that any agreement entered into should be a commercial arrangement, but there is a potential licence for favours to be done for those who make a small contribution for the carrying out of any part of the development. In return for this contribution they could get an agreement. Any agreement should be based on normal commercial relations rather than the implication of favours. I do not believe that is the intention, but there is a risk as the paragraph is written. The Minister should, at least, spell out that this is meant to be a commercial arrangement in which the agreement with the person who has arranged or provided the funding is of a commercial nature and is proportionate to the contribution made, not some sort of favour out of which enormous gains can be made.</P>
      <P>That is my only concern. I could not figure out any mechanism for dealing with it on Report Stage. I would like to hear the Minister's view.</P>

      <P>Senator Ryan and I do not always agree, but I appreciate his intention. I understand the Minister's worthy intention, which concerns a commercial arrangement.

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">

      <P>The agency is one for which State funding will run out at the end of next year. After that, it will effectively be on its own with regard to availing of any possible revenue streams. From that point of view, the functions in the Bill give it a remit, in effect, to operate commercially. To make this even more explicit, subsections (5) and (6) of amendment No. 10 state that the agency may exploit commercial opportunities arising from its functions and may receive income arising from or make payments in respect of any of its functions referred to in subsection (1).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1408" />The Senator may parse and analyse paragraph (<i>i</i>) of amendment No. 9, but it is necessary to give the agency the authority and mandate to enter into commercial agreements. The Senator says favours might be done, but I cannot envisage that. A body like this must be given the opportunity to enter into agreements with private individuals who provide funding. This must be done with the aim of developing the digital hub or it would not be caught by the legislation. I do not have as jaundiced an eye as the Senator.</P>

      <P>There has to be something in the legislation to allow individuals to enter into agreements with the authority. If the paragraph in question was not in the Bill, it might make this more difficult. I have endeavoured to make it more explicit and make the distinction clear as between the ending of State funding at the end of next year and the point when the agency will enter the commercial world without the sustenance of that funding.</P>

There is no one in the Ireland of today who would not be wary of an agency established by the State that has the capacity to either make, or not make, people rich.</P>
      <P>The Minister has said State funding will cease at the end of next year. Will it be possible for the digital hub agency to seek funding from the State? What will happen if it loses money? Will it have a State guarantee if it loses money? Will it cease operations if it does not make money?</P>

Given that he seems to be prepared to reconsider the functions of the agency &ndash; given its location in this city &ndash; a specific function aimed at assisting people suffering from physical or other disabilities would make a statement with regard to addressing the digital divide. There is a problem in western societies, where, if one is below a certain threshold, one does not have access to the most extraordinary new method of communicating information since the invention of the printing press. If this agency is to fulfil some of its more visionary objectives, it should not focus on those that are already digitally engaged. It should have some function to look at those who are, or are likely to be, excluded from the digital age by physical or other disability.</P>

      <P>In page 9, between lines 1 and 2, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(<i>a</i>) publish the draft development plan by electronic means;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I have already spoken on this issue and the Minister has given me his views. Approximately eight or nine amendments have been tabled. Similar amendments were accepted to other Bills. It seems a shame not to accept them to this Bill. The intention is not enabling, but compelling. There is no question or doubt about whether the body will deal with the power it has to publish. I want to ensure it publishes material by electronic means. The Minister has said it is not his intention to accept these amendments. That is a shame because those involved in the digital hub area and those who wish to make legislation more accessible and the system work better must have this information. If someone wants it, he or she must buy a newspaper or get it in other ways.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will accept amendment No.&nbsp;35 which reads: &ldquo;published by electronic means by the Agency as soon as may be after the gift is accepted, and shall also be.&rdquo; The Minister has already said he foresees difficulties with publishing it by electronic means. We are living in the past if we do not recognise that it is easier, speedier and less costly to press a button and publish something which is already in a word processor. Of all the amendments tabled, the Minister should accept amendment No. 35 if only for the sake of recognising that this is a high priority area. We should recognise that the particulars about gifts which have been accepted will be published.</P>
      <P>Publication by electronic means is the way of the future and the correct thing to do. We will amend such legislation in the future to include this because we do not know what type of publications will be available. We know that more citizens are using electronic means of gaining information. I urge the Minister to consider the amendments and insist that any new agency will publish particulars about gifts which have been accepted. I urge him to reconsider his views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment. If one needs to be persuaded that such amendments are necessary to focus minds, one only has to look at <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> for a model of a publication which has more to do with the 19th century than with modern digital communication. Although it is the <Col N="1411" />official publication in which enormous amounts of extremely important information are published, it is not sent to Members of the Oireachtas for some reason which has not been satisfactorily explained to me. It is only sent to the Oireachtas Library, although most publications are sent to every Member of the Oireachtas. It is also obscure and difficult to read.</P>
      <P>I am not trying to pin the Minister down, but does he know if it is available electronically? I do not think it is and do not understand the reason such a fundamental document, in terms of the governance of the State, is not available electronically. I use that assumption to reinforce Senator Quinn's point that something as fundamental as <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>, which may be published electronically, is apparently not published, presumably because of the reluctance of some people. I have visions of people in the scriptoria in the 1400s being threatened by a new invention called printing, becoming convinced it will not catch on and declining to be compelled to publish via it because the old ways are the best. We must remind people in our legislation that it is not that they may do it, but that they must do it like that.</P>
      <P>This raises a huge environmental question. Electronic publication should result in less waste because only those who want the information will print it. Doing it the other way means that the information is printed and vast numbers of copies are made, many of which end up being pulped because one cannot forecast in advance how many people will want them. There is a strong case for requiring agencies, not only this one, to publish information electronically. It would be apposite that this agency should be compelled to do so.</P>

      <P>I do not want the message to go out that the Government is against publication by electronic means. The amendments have been superseded by amendment No. 4 which states publication of any of the reports or documents specified in the legislation &ldquo;includes electronic modes of publication which are capable of being read in a legible form and cognate words shall be construed accordingly.&rdquo; This means that part of the publication process of these reports will be by electronic means. That is mandatory. All other documents might be put out by the digital hub. Given the type of entity it is, it will publish by electronic means. The amendments are not necessary because it is already included in amendment <Col N="1412" />No. 4. This should take care of the Senator's concerns. I am trying to be as helpful as I can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister is trying to be as helpful as he can. Amendment No. 4 uses the word &ldquo;includes&rdquo;. It does not stipulate that the agency must do that. &ldquo;Includes&rdquo; could refer to print, radio or many other things and it will not be possible to take a case against this body if it published in paper form rather than on the Internet in the hopes that it would be seen in that medium, but not otherwise. We have to compel and insist.</P>
      <P>I accept the use of the word &ldquo;publication&rdquo; in amendment No. 4 in terms of what is included, which is everything. What the agency must do, however, is not specified. As Senator Ryan has said, this agency should lead the way because this is how communication will take place in the future. The younger generation does not buy <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> because it does not seek information in that way. It communicates on the Internet which is a much simpler way. We should insist on online publication and using the words &ldquo;publication shall include&rdquo; enables that to happen rather than compels it.</P>
      <P>If the Minister is not willing to accept the amendment in terms of those publications, he should accept amendment No. 35. It will be high profile because it relates to gifts. I seek to provide that instead of requiring the publishing of particulars of gifts accepted under this section in the annual report, page 20, line 30, after &ldquo;shall be&rdquo; should read &ldquo;published by electronic means by the Agency as soon as may be after the gift is accepted, and shall also be published in the annual report.&rdquo; The annual report will not be published for three or four months after the end of the year and if a gift is given in January of the previous year it is essential that the knowledge be available then, not 15 to 17 months later. The onus should be placed on the agency to publish electronically at that point. The Minister is saying the agency can publish the information in the annual report.</P>
      <P>I am making a case for amendment No. 35 rather than for the others and I accept reluctantly that the Minister is of the opinion that amendment No. 4 will cover all of those.

The Senator will recall that formal consultation with a multiplicity of stakeholders is a <i>sine qua non</i> for the agency and we must therefore afford it adequate time and space in which to conduct it. <Col N="1414" />As I outlined on Committee Stage, by way of comparison the Communications Regulation Act, 2002, provides that the Commission for Communications Regulation, by chance established yesterday, shall adopt a strategy statement within six months of the establishment date.

      <P>We debated this matter earlier. The precedent we were following emanates from the Dublin Docklands Development Authority Act, 1997, and also the Western Development Commission. These do not require that membership of a local authority precludes a person from becoming a member of the board. The Bill is similar in that it deals with the particular locality. It is important that local councillors, who would be well placed to make a contribution, should be given the opportunity to be on the authority or a sub-committee of the authority. From that point of view, I am not prepared to accept the amendments.</P>

Is there any requirement in the Bill for people to cease to be members of the agency if convicted of a criminal offence?

I would have thought there would be disqualification for a criminal offence, but I may have missed it.</P>

      <P>This amendment was tabled following the debate on Committee Stage. This is a standard provision to which Senators wished to add the requirement that the agency would agree a code of conduct with the employees within three months of the enactment of the Bill. I appreciate the intention of the proposal. To include such a level of detail to cater for particular circumstances of a State body would be at odds with the overarching nature of this type of governance provision. It is not suitable to be dealt with specifically in legislation. The drafting of the code of conduct requires detailed consultation with staff and possibly the examination of legal issues which may arise. A deadline such as that proposed in amendment No. 26 would put significant constraints on the process. On that basis, there is no precedent for a timeframe being specified in this type of provision. However, the parliamentary counsel has advised that the wording &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; can be inserted into the section and I propose that this be done.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 37:</P>
      <P>In page 22, to delete lines 7 to 10.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister to give serious consideration to this amendment. The wording contained in the section 32(2) smacks of a previous era and seems to envisage different rules for different committees. The subsection states that the chief executive, if required to give evidence under subsection (1) &ndash; which refers to giving evidence to a committee of Dáil Éireann established under the Standing Orders of Dáil Éireann to examine and report to Dáil Éireann on the appropriation accounts and the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General &ndash;&ldquo;shall not question or express an opinion on the merits of any policy of the Government or a Minister of the Government or on the merits of the objectives of such a policy.&rdquo; It is incredible that this wording should appear in legislation. Wording of this nature has no place in modern legislation. To the best of my knowledge, such wording appeared on only one previous occasion and was withdrawn by the Minister concerned in response to a strong case made by Senator O'Toole and others.</P>
      <P>The provision that the chief executive &ldquo;shall not question or express an opinion&rdquo; is extraordinary and refers only to one particular committee, namely, the Committee of Public Accounts. It is clear from the next section that there is no such restriction in relation to other committees. It is possible for the chief executive to appear before any other committee and express an opinion on the merits of Government policy. I cannot accept that the proposed restriction in relation to the Committee of Public Accounts has any place in good governance, legislation or the rules or standards for this nation. I am amazed that it should appear here. I do not know from where it came. Perhaps, having been buried in the archives, it has appeared by mistake. Is it a word processing error? Following the withdrawal of a similar wording on the previous occasion to which I referred, I did not expect to see it reappear. I hope it is, in fact, a mistake and I urge the Minister to confirm that it is inappropriate, in a modern democracy, to prescribe that a chief executive shall not question the merits of Government policy. The Minister should say <i>mea culpa </i>and remove that provision from the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment. The difficulty of &ldquo;cutting and pasting&rdquo; legislation is illustrated by the subsection Senator Quinn wishes to delete. The Committee of Public Accounts, the committee referred to in the section, is precluded from giving opinions on Government policy. Perhaps that was understandable under an older regime, when the committee's function was to consider only Government Departments and the accounting officer of a Department came to give evidence in relation to a Department's use of the funds allocated to it under the relevant Estimate. Under that regime, the civil servant had no independent existence but was, effectively, an extension of the Minister. In that context, it would be understandable that a civil servant, being, in a sense, the embodiment of the Minister, could not have an opinion which differed from that of the Minister on matters of public policy. That is not how a civil service should operate, though the Department of Finance is capable of making its views clear on many matters despite any supposed constraint. Others in the House may be better informed than I in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision we are discussing is appropriate to the role of a civil servant in a Government Department when representing his or her Minister in relation to a review of expenditure, as voted in the Dáil. In that scenario, the civil servant is simply doing the Minister's bidding. However, it is a travesty of the role of the chief <Col N="1423" />executive of a State agency, particularly an agency which must operate in the commercial sector. For example, the chief executive would be precluded from speaking about Government plans for the roll-out of broadband in Dublin, even to the extent of expressing approval. The subsection does not merely preclude criticism, it actually prevents any expression of opinion on the merits of any policy or the objectives of such policy. If, for example, the Government decided to abandon the use of fibre optic cable in the national broadband roll-out and use something less useful&mdash;</P>

      <P>If the Minister wishes to take me on, I will not lack enjoyment in that exercise. However, let us not go down that route. For the sake of illustrating the point, let us suppose the Government made such a decision and the chief executive of the national digital hub agency appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts. He would not be allowed to tell the committee that the decision was a bad one. I presume he would be free to express that view in any other forum outside the Committee of Public Accounts, including, incongruously, any other Oireachtas committee. Due to the fact that there was a provision in relation to the Committee of Public Accounts at a time when it had a narrowly limited function concerning Government Departments, it has now been inappropriately inserted into the Bill quite and, for some unknown reason, an otherwise reasonable Minister has decided to retain it. I support the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly support the amendment and I urge the Minister to give it due consideration. I have no doubt about the origin of the provision in section 32 (2) of the Bill. I believe it did not come from the Minister, the Department, the industry or the consumer but, rather, from the parliamentary counsel. Unless the Minister can prove me wrong, that is my firm conviction in the matter. I cannot visualise the Minister or any official of his Department wishing to put such a provision in the Bill. I am prepared to bet that it was not included in the draft Bill which originated in the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a member of the compellability committee of these Houses, which is responsible for the rules under which witnesses may be called before committees &ndash; a serious responsibility that has led to the High Court on occasion &ndash; I am certain the provision we are discussing cannot be implemented. In the event of a person appearing <Col N="1424" />before a committee of the House and being questioned on the merits of a certain policy, it would not be acceptable to that committee &ndash; or, on appeal, to the High Court &ndash; for that person to say he or she was precluded from answering that question because of a legislative provision against discussing such matters with a committee of the Oireachtas. I am convinced that the author of that provision did not consider its meaning in real terms.</P>
    <P>The Minister has taken a progressive approach to policy issues in many areas. However, this provision is regressive and there is no question that it is not in the spirit of democracy. I do not accept that it is undemocratic, because a democracy can decide to put restraints on people. However, it is certainly not in the spirit of democratic movement. We like to have leadership in politics, trade unions, churches and Government Departments. The last thing we need is a passive and accepting leadership. The yardstick of leadership is that it should be courageous, challenging and questioning at all times. Those in authority should lead on these principles, but this provision gives lie to and undermines them in a way that is not acceptable.</P>
    <P>I have a marginal disagreement with Senator Ryan with regard to the interpretation of the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924, to which he referred. It has been the mark of good secretaries general or Department secretaries, as they were then called, since the foundation of the State that they were always able to make their position clear publicly. Mr. Whitaker was a master of this. I listened to John Bowman's Saturday morning programme three weeks ago. Liam Ó Broin, a former Secretary of the Department of Post and Telegraphs, indicated exactly how he made public his views, which were contrary to the views of ten Ministers, on the founding of RTE.</P>
    <P>The Minister and I know that this provision does not reflect the approach he has taken on particular issues in the past. As a lawyer, would the Minister, if he was a member of an Oireachtas committee, find it acceptable if a witness who appeared under the rules of the House and the provisions of the 1998 legislation governing the attendance of witnesses was asked an honest and reasonable question on the merits or demerits of a point of policy and offered no reply or stated that he had a view but was precluded from voicing it to a properly constituted committee of the Oireachtas? It would be no more acceptable to him than it is to us. The Minister should accept our argument on the subsection and withdraw it. I ask him to give this matter his deepest consideration. Such a provision was withdrawn in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I support arguments put forward by previous speakers. As a former Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, I am aware that one sometimes had to bite one's lip when querying the exactness of statements made by secretaries general who appeared before the committee. Constraints are often placed on a line of questioning at meetings of the Committee of Pub<Col N="1425" />lic Accounts and I understand the need for these in the case of the secretaries general of particular Government Departments.</P>
      <P>As the Minister stated, the Digital Hub Development Agency will be expected, from the end of the year, to have a commercial mandate with no State subvention. The agency needed a State subvention during its gestation period to allow it to commence operations. However, the Minster now expects it to behave, to be commercially responsible and to try make progress in terms of funding its operations.</P>
      <P>The chief executive may attend the committee to which he is answerable. He might find that the barriers and impediments which prevent him from making the company a commercial entity are retained because of policy or directives. In the context of a digital hub, which the preliminary literature claims will be exciting, this is a throw-back to a previous era when Big Brother was watching. I do not believe this provision is compatible with what we are trying to create in terms of the digital hub. It is extremely regressive in nature and should be removed from the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure Senators that I have considered this matter carefully since Committee Stage. The section as drafted allows, indeed instructs, the chief executive to appear before the Committee of Public Accounts to give evidence on all matters pertaining to the expenditure of the agency. It also contains a proviso regarding the expression of an opinion on the merits of any policy of the Government or a Minister or on the objectives of such a policy. While Senators have suggested that similar provisions have been deleted from previous legislation, I assure them that I have no doubt that said legislation passed through the Seanad as required. The Human Rights Commission Act, 2000, the Ordnance Survey Act, 2001, and the Family Support Agency Act, which I promoted and brought through both Houses, contained provisions concerning the expression of an opinion before the Committee of Public Accounts and other committees. It is a relatively standard provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senators are correct that the chief executive officer is not allowed to express an opinion under this subsection. However, it only relates to dealings with the Committee of Public Accounts and policy in this section specifically means financial policy, rather than Government policy as a whole. No such constraint applies to appearances before other committees. The intention behind this provision is to ensure that the chief executive officer, when accounting for the financial performance of the agency to the Committee of Public Accounts, will not speculate on what might have been achieved had the allocation been higher. The aim of including such a provision is to avoid the undermining of the Estimates process, which would result from such speculation. It does not mean that the chief executive officer would be unable to take issue with regard to funding, <Col N="1426" />but that it would not take place within the context of the Committee of Public Accounts, the remit of which is to concentrate on actual financial outcomes and performances.</P>
    <P>This provision is not an effort to muzzle the chief executive officer because &ndash; this was acknowledged by Senators &ndash; he can appear before other committees of the Oireachtas or talk publicly. The provision is to ensure that chief executive officers do not use the Committee of Public Accounts to undermine the Estimates process, which is between the relevant Minister and the Minister for Finance and his Department. Something that the chief executive officer would say at a critical time during the course of a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts might have an impact on the Estimates process which, under the Constitution, is primarily between the responsible Minister and the Minster for Finance.</P>
    <P>I gave specific consideration to this matter because Senators put forward a strong case in respect of it on Committee Stage. In case anyone suggests that this is an effort to muzzle the chief executive officer, I emphasise that it is not. The chief executive officer is entitled to express an opinion on Government policy at any other committee. It is simply that the Committee of Public Accounts deals with the financial outcomes of various agencies and must deal with the actual, rather than a speculative, situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened carefully to what the Minster said. It seems that the provision is totally against the spirit of the legislation. Surely a chief executive appearing before the Committee of Public Accounts can be asked about the merits of a policy. The wording says that &ldquo;the chief executive required to give evidence shall not question or express an opinion on the merits of any policy&rdquo;. As Senator Ryan said, he may not even offer congratulations on the merits. I am aware of the Minister's objective, but he is not achieving it with this wording.</P>
      <P>The Minister talked about certain aspects such as appropriation accounts, but the reference in section 32(1) is to &ldquo;all matters pertaining to the expenditure of the agency.&rdquo; The chief executive is not allowed to give an express opinion on the merits of Government policy or the objectives of such a policy. It sounds like Stalinist Russia rather than what the Minister is trying to achieve. Senator O'Toole, who, like Senator Ryan, made an impressive contribution, has said he is confident that the Minister knows what he is doing in this area of law. This section of the Bill does not cover what it was intended to cover; it is too strong and goes too far. The chief executive is able to comment on these areas at other committees, but cannot do so at meetings of the Committee of Public Accounts. If he thinks this matter through, the Minister will realise that he is wrong. He will understand the point I am making and agree to this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am disappointed by this section of the Bill, but the House has removed similar clauses in the <Col N="1427" />past and should do so again. The Minister has said it has slipped through, which is a reflection on those of us who have failed to notice such clauses in our examination of other Bills. It seems a complete travesty to include this provision in legislation at a time when we are talking about facilitating transparency. Given that the Government claims that the aim of the Bill is to create <Col N="1428" />commercial success stories, it seems a shame that it intends to include a provision that will muzzle a chief executive who may wish to comment favourably on the merits of a policy. I urge the Minister to reconsider this section of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I made the case for this amendment on Second Stage and do not intend to delay the Minister. It is important that we make it clear that we recognise the importance of speed in business matters. The two dates I have included are quite acceptable and should be approved. The reason I mention this is that it is possible for quite large bodies to publish accounts and results much more quickly than has traditionally been the case. For example, I checked today whether the RTE annual report for 2001 &ndash; last year &ndash; had been published. It has not. We must do something to speed up the general process of making information available. I urge the Minister to consider this.</P>

      <P>Senator Quinn, in referring to RTE, has picked the semi-State authority which is probably in the greatest financial difficulty. I appreciate the sentiments he has expressed both today and on Committee Stage, but there is no precedent for what he is suggesting. It is always presumed that a body will present its report as early as practically possible. That is the reason we are specifying 30 June as the latest possible date for submission. From that point of view, what we have included is reasonable.</P>

      <P>We do not want the situation to arise where the chairman, in the event of a chief executive not being available, steps into the chief executive's shoes. The legislation provides that a member of staff would replace the chief executive but there may be circumstances where a member of staff would not have the required skills or expertise. In that event it would be necessary to take on an adviser or consultant for the period during which the chief executive was not available. From that point of view, I do not accept the amendments.

      <P>&ldquo;(2) The Minister shall, as soon as may be after making any direction under this section, cause a copy of such direction to be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The amendment relates to the concept of openness and transparency and the way the Government does its business. If a future Minister was to give such a policy direction to the National Tourism Development Authority, it would certainly be in the public interest to know all about it. The amendment does not attempt in any way to restrict the Minister's power to do whatever he or she likes in this regard. All it would require is that he or she would be open about what was being done, which is the very least we could expect. We are talking about the National Tourism Development Authority, not the secret service. I cannot think of any good reason such a policy should continue to be kept under wraps. The amendment does not attempt in any way to restrict the Minister's power, it just seeks more openness and transparency.</P>

There may be a better way in this instance, but my proposal would not create any hassle for both Houses of the Oireachtas. It would not take up our time. We would not have to give it attention, it would be included just to be seen, if necessary.

    </Speaker>
    <P>In the current climate where many State authority boards are packed with party political hacks, the amendment proposes to introduce into the new authority a new system of appointment of <Col N="1434" />members of the authority whereby persons would be appointed on the basis of what they knew rather than who they knew. This has been the case, by and large, through the years, but it has not always been the case. The amendment proposes to establish a process whereby persons who seek membership of an authority would have to come before a committee of the Oireachtas before their appointment could be ratified.</P>

      <P>The effect of this amendment would be that any person appointed to the board would have to face a committee which could deem that person unsuitable. There is no doubt this could lead to a major political wrangle over nominations and would lead to opposition to appointments for political reasons. This would not be conducive to the good working of the board and everybody would agree with that.</P>
      <P>There is such a vetting system in the United States and, while it is often quoted as being a good precedent for the appointment of members to boards, it invariably gives rise to unseemly and interminable political wrangles. They sometimes make good copy but little sense.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan" hpid="Mr. J. Phelan Mr. J. Phelan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
      <P>I take what the Minister has said but there is already political wrangling about the appointment of certain individuals to various Government bodies. The amendment will not introduce new wrangling and, with the launch of the new authority, is a chance for a new departure in the way these appointments are made. I do not know if the Minister agrees with bringing this before a joint committee of the Houses and I am not sure if that is the correct way to do it. However, some new mechanism should be brought into play for the selection of members of authorities. The current system is unsatisfactory and the Minister should look urgently at it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Phelan's amendment. It is unlikely that the Minister will accept this but it would be wise to stitch into the Bill a measure to deal with the unease concerning unsuitable appointments over the years. This may not be the ideal way to address that, as Senator Phelan acknowledges, but the Minister should give attention to overcoming the criticisms that have arisen over not just political appointments but bad appointments.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned the American system and I accept it has presented difficulties. However, I urge the Minister to find a way around this, though not necessarily in this Bill or this area. There is a problem and an alternative method should be considered.</P>

      <P>I agree it is important that people with expertise are appointed to boards, where possible. This expertise can take the form of expert knowledge on a given subject but can also take the form of common sense, which is often the most important ingredient in decisions boards take. It would be unprecedented for the Government to set up a committee system to vet members of the National Tourism Development Authority and an extraordinary step to do it with regard to one board and not to others.</P>
      <P>I take issue with those who say that appointments to important boards such as this are purely political. I recently made appointments to a number of State boards. It would be unfair to name the boards concerned but those appointed are not of my political persuasion and have tremendous knowledge in the areas concerned. A mix is important but this is not the way to go as it would create wrangles. I do not mean the authority to be some kind of honours system and I assure the House it will not be.</P>

      <P>In page 12, between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) In appointing persons to be members of the Authority, the Minister shall in so far as is practicable and having regard to relevant experience, ensure an equitable gender balance between men and women in the composition of the Authority.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I do not want to waste time by arguing this issue from scratch as nobody will disagree with it. This is the weakest form of words I could find concerning the gender of appointments. Its weakness is the only criticism that could be made. However, some recognition should be given to the need to achieve a gender balance in almost every Bill. This is a modest way of achieving it for this Bill.</P>
      <P>I also plead for its inclusion on grounds of consistency. Other Bills have passed through this House this year which contained exactly this provision and I lifted the exact wording for this amendment from another Bill. If it appears in some Bills, why not in others? The amendment is weak in that it does not say genders must be equal but that this be taken into account.</P>
      <P>The least that people should expect of legislators is consistency. I would hate to think it was a matter of personal whim whether a provision of this kind was included. This has been included in legislation before. I snitched it from another Bill and it is the exact wording from that Bill.</P>

      <P>This is always a difficult subject. The Equal Status Act, 2000 and the Employment Equality Act, 1998, which I moved in this House as the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, govern equality in terms of employment and the provision of services. The grounds mentioned in those Acts are far wider than that of gender and include areas such as ethnic origin, religion, sexual preference and others. The gender issue is not the only one to consider when dealing with the attainment of equality.</P>
      <P>There is a Government guideline to the effect that State boards should, as far as possible, be constituted of 40% females and the remainder males, though it is possible to increase the number of females. In some State bodies, there is a relatively even spread between genders, though this is not the case for all boards.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to ensure that the question of gender is taken care of while also ensuring there is a reasonable spread with regard to the equality agenda generally. It is my preference to ensure that the Government guideline is adhered to. I admit that Senator Quinn's amendment is relatively mild. It may be replicated in the Industrial Development (Enterprise Ireland) Act, 1998 and there is other legislation on the Statute Book, for example, the Irish Sports Council Act, 1999, which deals with this in a different way. That Act provides that at least three members shall be men and at least three women. The new National Tourism Development Authority will, as far as possible, adhere to Government guidelines to ensure that 40% will be women.</P>

    <P>The five year term of office of members of the authority is too long and should be replaced by a three year term. Most organisations tend not to have five year terms of office for board members. There is always a need for organisations to have <Col N="1437" />new people become involved.

      <P>The term of membership of Bord Fáilte Éireann currently stands at five years and members may be reappointed. Membership of CERT is three years while reappointment is allowed. The chairman has a five year term. It has long been the case with Bord Fáilte that members serve a five year term. This allows for continuity for the board and ensures the executive is relatively vigilant. Having longer experience as a member of a board allows an individual to make a greater contribution. It is best to leave the term of office at five years. It is debatable whether it should be three years. This is not set in stone but, on balance, a term of five years is right.</P>

      <P>In page 13, subsection (1), line 29, after &ldquo;functions&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, but shall hold at least one meeting in each quarter of a year&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is modelled on a similar provision in the Digital Hub Development Agency Bill. My earlier points about consistency apply again. This would add a minimum to what is otherwise an entirely vacuous enabling clause and deliver a hint to the authority of what we shall expect from it. This is a necessary provision given the structure of committees, subsidiaries and delegation of powers envisaged in the Bill. If the full powers of the Bill were invoked, it would be possible to delegate all the work to other bodies, subsidiaries and committees and turn the authority into an empty dummy. I know this is not the intention, but the amendment seeks to safeguard against this. Its acceptance would go some way towards reminding people that we do not want them to do this.</P>
      <P>This is the very least that should be done &ndash; I would be surprised if there were not ten or 11 meetings per year. Including a stipulation such as this would strengthen the authority.</P>

On the other hand, it is important that the board meets regularly. I understand it currently meets once a month. The Senator seeks to invoke a sense of authority and urgency by making the holding of a meeting every quarter a statutory imperative. I have no objection to what he has proposed. The wording may have to be changed from &ldquo;one meeting in each quarter&rdquo; to &ldquo;one meeting every three months&rdquo; to give statutory expression to the proposal.

      <Col N="1439" />I feel particularly strongly about this amendment. As matters stand, persons nominated to contest elections can remain members of the authority and continue to practice their duties until elected. It is wholly inappropriate that somebody can remain in his or her role while contesting an election. The possibility of a candidate using his or her position as a member or employee of an authority to advance his or her chances in an election is something about which I would be very unhappy.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am unlikely to get much support for amendment No. 17. Our usual practice when we are faced with such sections in Bills which deal with the establishment of State bodies is that we go through a song and dance against the ban on elected Members of the Oireachtas. I want to extend that ban to include members of the local authority for a number of reasons. I can already hear a few sighs in the House. I fail to see the rationale for making a distinction between politicians at national or European level and local representatives. One could make a better case for excluding local politicians first as they are more likely to be affected by local issues. We should remember that the most blatant examples of corruption unveiled recently were at local rather than at national level. We should consider that approach for all State bodies. It will not be a surprise to learn that I also raised this issue during our discussion of the Digital Hub Development Agency Bill, although I did not get anywhere with it.</P>
      <P>This issue is relevant to the Bill. Tourism is a national priority, but it is a local issue. No debate about tourism is complete without a wrangle between national and local interests because they do not believe they are getting a fair share of the national pot. That is all the more reason to formally exclude from membership any elected member of a local authority. They, by virtue of their membership, could hardly be expected to take a national view at the expense of the people they were elected locally to represent. Recent developments show this would be a good amendment to any Bill setting up a State body. We have a double reason for doing so in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe I will get much support for this amendment and I am not likely to push it to a vote. However, I would like it included in the Bill because it is the correct way forward. If we are talking about excluding elected members from <Col N="1440" />State bodies, we should start at local rather than at national level. I understand why we do not permit elected Members of this House to sit on State bodies. We should extend that downwards rather than upwards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>It was unfortunate that we extended the practice of keeping public representatives off such bodies. There was a good legitimate reason why many Members of the Oireachtas were on committees. I was a member of a fisheries authority for a number of years until legislation was introduced which excluded people like me from being on such authorities. It gave Members of the Oireachtas a deep insight into the activities of many bodies, particularly tourism bodies which have strong regional involvement, as the previous speaker said. I was not enthusiastic about prohibiting by legislation Members of the Oireachtas from sitting on committees. If a Member of the Oireachtas had a keen and legitimate interest in inland fisheries, it would be beneficial both to the Oireachtas and to the body if that person was on the board. I was not enthusiastic about the legislation.</P>
      <P>It would be unwise to adopt Senator Quinn's approach because, as he knows, local authorities are involved with State organisations in the development of the tourism product. It is important that this body has the benefit of the views of members of local authorities who have first hand professional knowledge of what is required to develop a tourism product in the region. It would be unwise to introduce such an amendment which would prohibit members of local authorities from being on boards, either at regional or national level. Until recently, local authority members did not receive remuneration of any significance. Even now they only get a small allowance. They have a wide and vast knowledge of tourism, particularly in the regions. I will make further comments when we discuss other sections of the Bill about the effect the new body will have on the regions. It would be detrimental to introduce this proposal. I am not sure the sections we support, which prohibit Members of the Oireachtas and of the European Parliament from being on such bodies, are productive in the long term.</P>

      <P>I do not agree with the amendment or Senator Quinn's assertion that local authority members should be excluded. As Senator Daly said, if members of a local authority are interested in this area &ndash; many such members are involved in the tourism business &ndash; there is no reason they should be excluded. They give a lot of time and effort to serve the local community. Strategic policy committees were set up under the new local authority structure. In the majority of cases throughout the country the local representative attends the meetings rather than <Col N="1441" />the people outside the local authority structure. I do not support the total exclusion of local authority members. People with an interest in the tourism business should be considered if it is necessary to put a member of a local authority on the board.</P>

It would be unfair to prevent them from becoming members of a body. If an agricultural committee was established and a member of a local authority was a farmer, it would not be right if he or she could not serve on it because he or she would have excellent knowledge of the area. I know a number of local authority members who have great experience of the tourism business. It would be wrong to introduce an amendment which would prevent them from being members of the body.</P>

Any system which is enhanced by the role of a member and which is able to elicit information is good. This proposal is akin to saying that a county councillor cannot be a member of the Irish Hotels Federation.</P>

      <P>This amendment represents my little effort to hold back the tide of inflation. In this very House today we dealt with Report Stage of the Digital Hub Development Agency Bill, 2002, which is very similar legislation to this. The Bill also made provisions in regard to revealing confidential information and the wording in it and the Bill before the House is exactly the same with one difference. In the other Bill the figure mentioned is &euro;2,000 and in this it is &euro;3,000. Surely, a 50% inflation in two hours is a record given that it was about 5 p.m. when we discussed the matter previously. Is the Minister seriously arguing that offences of this kind when committed in context of the national tourism development authority are exactly 50% more serious than when considered in the context of the Digital Hub Development Agency Bill? If so, I look forward to hearing exactly how those computations are made.</P>

The figure is &euro;3,000 because that sum represents the upper limit of what can be imposed by the District Court. It is not for me to justify why the other Bill provides for &euro;2,000 as I am not responsible for that legislation. In this case, the District Court's upper limit is the appropriate amount and, in any event, given inflation, over time the value of the amount will reduce.</P>

The Minister will be aware that the company operates and manages tourism in the extended mid-west region and I wish to know if it will continue to promote in the way it has. Will the company's functions, responsibilities and budgets be taken over by the new organisation? I ask if that is provided for in this legislation because it is not clear what the relationship will be between this new body and the Shannon Free Airport Development Company which has this remit in the mid-west region. There are also regional development organisations in other areas and the question of what will be the over all scheme of things in the long term begs to be asked. Is it envisaged by the Minister that in the long term the role and responsibilities of Shannon Development in this regard will be incorporated into the new tourism body?</P>

      <P>Senator Daly raises a very good point. No relationship between the new authority, to be known as Fáilte Éireann, and the Shannon Free Airport Development Company is proscribed or specified in the legislation, nor is any proscribed between the new authority and any other regional tourism body. The question of structures has exercised many minds over several years and it is best to address the structure in question in the context of the review I have ordered into tourism policy. The final report is expected to be completed towards the end of April next.</P>
      <P>Many argue there is duplication in terms of promoting tourism in Ireland and are of the view the organisation could be slimmed down to avoid that duplication. It is important to have a regional input in the tourism policy. In general terms, the regional tourism bodies have been a success, one such example is Shannon Free Airport Development Company. If we are to look at tourism policy it is necessary to see whether the structures, as presently constituted, make the best contribution possible. I have asked the review group to look at that issue and will await its report before coming to a decision on how to proceed. Suffice it to say the Bill does not deal with the relationship which Senator Daly has raised. However, the relationship between the regional structures and the new authority is of considerable importance in the context of how to proceed with the development of Irish tourism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the setting up of the regional authorities there is a new structure at the top for marketing <Col N="1445" />Ireland internationally. Tourism Ireland has been statutorily established and is now responsible for the marketing of Ireland on the international stage. It is necessary to clarify the relationship which will exist between the regional groups and the National Tourism Development Authority on the one hand and Tourism Ireland on the other. Now is the time to examine those questions. I have my own views on how matters should proceed but I am happy to await the outcome of the report of the review group before coming to a final decision. It must be an informed decision, avoid unnecessary expense and ensure the best value for money.</P>

      <P>The actual marketing spend on tourism this year, despite the budgetary constraints, will be the highest in the history of the State. The amount available for marketing Ireland will be 20% higher in 2003 than in 2002. This is an indication of the seriousness with which we are addressing the tourism question. It is imperative from our perspective that the industry which is set to become the largest in the State grows. It is important that we are out on the ground selling Ireland. It appears likely the num<Col N="1446" />ber of gateways from the United States into Ireland in 2003 will increase by one third.</P>
      <P>At present there are six gateway cities. Recently Aer Lingus announced it would restore the Baltimore-Washington-Ireland route and that is welcome. This evening US Airlines made an application to the US Department of Transport which will enable it to fly direct to Dublin and Shannon from Philadelphia. That we will have eight gateway cities in the United States in 2003 is a substantial improvement. Between 1 July and mid-August 2002 there was a problem in that airline capacity was down 20%. While there were empty beds in many parts of the country and Americans willing to occupy them, many could not travel due to reduced capacity. That capacity has been increased by the addition of two gateway cities in the United States in 2003 which is immensely important in terms of increasing the number of US visitors. For example, in 2001, with six gateway cities there were in the region 907,000 US visitors to Ireland whose total investment in revenue terms was in excess of &euro;700 million. That the number of gateways has been increased means, all else being equal, we should be able to increase the number of visitors from the United States. That is conditional upon there being no international events which interfere with that but that is something we cannot foresee. If the position remains as it is I would be confident of a good increase in visitors from the United States in 2003 arising from the news from Philadelphia this evening.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I offer my apologies. This amendment seeks to delete &euro;65 million and substitute &euro;50 million. I spoke earlier about the inflation that occurred since 4 p.m. when it increased from &euro;2,000 to &euro;3,000. This is another kind of inflation, a disease called &ldquo;euroitis&rdquo;. Where on earth did we get the figure of &euro;65 million? I think there was a civil servant who thought of a nice round figure of £50 million. Then he or she suddenly remembered we are using euro which would bring it up to about &euro;63 million. To make it look respectable he or she rounded it up again and arrived at the odd figure of &euro;65 million. I suggest we go back to the first principles and pick a round figure such as 50 and make it &euro;50 million. That figure is sufficiently big and round. By the time the National Tourism Development Authority has spent its &euro;50 million it will be high time to have another look at how it is getting on. The passage of amending legislation to increase that amount will give us that opportunity. I believe legislation should come <Col N="1447" />back to us on a fairly regular basis to be looked at. Let us round things down for a change; instead of &euro;65 million let us make it &euro;50 million.</P>

      <P>I regret to disappoint Senator Quinn but no civil servant has been as creative as he described. Under the National Development Plan 2000-2006, the amount allocated under the tourism product development fund is &euro;130 million. Senator Quinn will know that half of &euro;130 million is &euro;65 million. That is the reason for the figure of &euro;65 million.</P>

      <P>I am not happy with this section because it allows the authority to pay such sums as it considers appropriate to such persons as it considers appropriate out of moneys advanced to it. There is no definition of the words &ldquo;such persons as it considers appropriate&rdquo;. In view of the present situation regarding the payment of &euro;250,000 to the Irish Open golf championship this should be examined. The money is not being paid to Portmarnock Golf Club which does not allow women members, but to those promoting the Irish Open. Are they really the appropriate persons to receive State money? We will find ourselves in the same situation with this authority which could also pay money to such an organisation. The promoters of the Irish Open are going to use facilities, the policies of which are not in accordance with equality legislation.</P>
      <P>I heard the Minister explain on radio that if a woman took a case against Portmarnock Golf Club, she would probably win under equality legislation. How would the Minister feel if Portmarnock Golf Club could exclude black or Muslim men and the Irish Open was still to be played there? I realise it is an important championship and good for the promotion of golf in Ireland. However, how good is it for Ireland's image that some facilities here are segregated? Would the Minister have allowed the money to be given if it was to be paid to a club which excluded black or Muslim men?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not tabled an amendment, but will do so on Report Stage to suggest that there should be some explanation of what is meant by &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo; people. It is not appropriate to promote anything that is in contravention of equality legislation, but if we allow this section to be inserted <Col N="1448" />unopposed, that is what we will be doing. We will have a situation where anything goes and organisations not in accord with equality legislation will be able to get money from a State, local or regional authority once the Minister thinks it is all right. This is what is happening.</P>
    <P>I sympathise with the Minister because he has no control over Portmarnock Golf Club. However, he should have sent a warning shot across the bows of those who organise the Irish Open golf championship and questioned the suitability of Portmarnock Golf Club as a venue. I do not play golf as I am one of those who think it spoils a good walk. However, I know we have splendid golf courses all over the country that would have been suitable. The Minister may have problems, but I will not let them continue into the future with this sort of legislation.</P>

      <P>I agree with Senator Henry. Would the Minister be favourably disposed to an amendment tabled on Report Stage to amend this section of the legislation to the effect that only clubs under the auspices of the authority which conform with equality legislation would be permitted to avail of moneys? The Bill states, &ldquo;For the purposes of <i>section 8(2)(b)</i> or <i>(c)</i>, the Authority may pay such sums of moneys as it considers appropriate.&rdquo; Does this mean the chief executive officer on the advice of the members or would he or she be acting on a directive from the Minister? From where exactly does this direction come &ndash; the Minister, the chief executive officer or individual members of the authority?</P>

      <P>As I said, I condemn discrimination against women or discrimination of any kind. When Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I introduced the Employment Equality Act and the Equal Status Act which prohibited discrimination on nine grounds in regard to employment and the provision of services. Legislation to deal with discrimination is on the Statute Book. Under the Equal Status Act, the position is that the Equality Authority or, in the alternative, a member of the public, may make a complaint of discrimination to the courts in regard to any private registered club. If such a complaint is upheld by the courts, there is a ready made sanction provided for in the legislation which provides that the certificate of registration may be withdrawn. In turn, this means that the drinks licence attached to the club could be forfeited. This is a major sanction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision to hold the Irish Open golf championship at Portmarnock was made by the European Tour. For months Bord Fáilte sought a <Col N="1449" />sponsor to help it with the Irish Open. Fortunately, Nissan Ireland agreed to co-sponsor the event. Bord Fáilte is not giving a raw deal to Portmarnock Golf Club. It has decided to make funds available to ensure the Irish Open is held. It decides what it should or should not sponsor. There would be no need for legislation like this if boards did not make such decisions.</P>
    <P>The Irish Open is of immense importance in the sporting calendar. It is important, not just to sport, but also to tourism. It is estimated that 220,000 visitors come here annually on golf related holidays. The revenue generated is about &euro;144 million. The Irish Open is beamed to 90 countries and has a television audience of approximately 200 million.</P>
    <P>I unreservedly condemn discrimination on the grounds of gender or on any other ground. We have on the Statute Book the most modern legislation in Europe to deal with discrimination. If there was no legislation to deal with discrimination, I would contemplate the call by Senator McCarthy to insert an amendment in this legislation. However, this legislation establishes the National Tourism Development Authority and does not touch on issues of equality. There are ways and means by which the Equality Authority and/or any member of the public can make a complaint about discrimination. I understand a complaint of this nature has been made about a certain club and a case is pending before the courts. A decision on that case will create a precedent for other cases to follow. The legislation in place is the most modern in Europe in terms of outlawing discrimination. It received a good reading and debate in this House on all Stages over a protracted period. In those circumstances, there is no question of a semi-State agency becoming involved in supporting discrimination.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte has decided to continue its sponsorship of the Irish Open event as distinct from the venue and felt obliged to do so in view of the returns we have had from the sponsorship of golfing events. It has lead to an increase in the number of people visiting Ireland. Ireland boasts some 37 of the 169 or so links courses in the world. Like Senator Henry I do not play golf, although my reasons are different &ndash; I have too much to depend on St. Anthony for without his having to look for my golf balls. That notwithstanding, those links courses are among the finest in the world and are of immense importance to the country. The board of Bord Fáilte is helping to sponsor the Irish Open event &ndash; not the venue. Neither I nor Bord Fáilte nor any of its members would seek to support discrimination in any form. I hope that explains the position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Minister would not support discrimination of any sort. He was thorough in the equality legislation he introduced while he was responsible. He is right to say this event will <Col N="1450" />be beamed into homes all over the world &ndash; BBC commentators have already pointed out that the Irish Open is being played in a club which discriminates against women. This is not a good image and the Minister will hear about this increasingly until the event takes place.</P>
      <P>It troubles me that Bord Fáilte felt fit to give money to the organisation even though the competition is to be held in one of the few clubs that discriminates against women. I accept the sponsorship is of the event rather than the club, as the Minister has stated tonight and on the radio. I also accept we have the finest links clubs in the world &ndash; everybody tells me so. Visitors get off the boat in Rosslare or the plane in Shannon, play their way around the country's courses and enjoy themselves thoroughly. I do not blame the Minister but it is a great shame this opportunity to promote golf involves Bord Fáilte's supporting an international competition being played in one of the few clubs that discriminates against women. Could the Minister publish a leaflet stating that few clubs in Ireland discriminate against women? It would help.</P>
      <P>I was one of the first two women members from Trinity College in the Kildare Street Club which was run for many years as a men-only club. The late Ms Grace Carroll and I behaved so well that, after less than a year, the club asked if we could get more women members. We were good, did not complain and paid our bills. The club now has a considerable number of women members. I was fascinated by a member of the Government on television recently suggesting that women could not afford to join. What does he know about women with money? I am not suggesting women in the Seanad have money but I know plenty of women with money from other professions.</P>
      <P>Bord Fáilte is being subsumed into this Bill and we must not pass legislation that would allow this problem arise again &ndash; we must alter it slightly so all bodies abide with the law of the land in every respect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 26:</P>
      <P>In page 18, subsection (2), line 4, to delete &ldquo;6 months&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;3 months&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I confess that when I saw this provision in the Bill I laughed. The subsection states:</P>
      <P>Accounts kept in pursuance of this section shall be submitted not later than six months after the end of the accounting period to which they relate by the authority to the Comptroller and Auditor General for audit.</P>
      <P>This does not refer to publishing or auditing accounts within six months but submitting accounts for audit within six months. I know the Minister has a strong sense of history but I assume his motivation is not to produce history books but rather books of account.</P>
      <P>Speed of reporting is an essential component of accounting. I looked for RTE's annual accounts for 2001 today but they have not yet been published. It may be that RTE handed the books to the auditor three, four, five or eight months ago and they have remained there since. This Bill proposes to hand accounts to the auditor within six months but I want to see them published within three months.</P>
      <P>There is no reason such accounts should not be ready within one month of the end of the financial year. Some of the biggest banks publish their accounts within days or hours of the end of the financial year. Since all well-run businesses keep accounts on a monthly basis, only one month's accounts would remain to be closed at the end of the financial year. On this occasion, I am not pushing to have the books sent for audit within one month &ndash; I am prepared to settle for three months. In doing so I am pursuing consistency &ndash; three months is the standard provided for in this type of legislation. In tabling these amendments, I looked at what has been provided for in other legislation and it is normally three months. I do not know where the six month period came from. Unless the Minister can make a convincing case that there is something unique about the accounts of the National Tourism Development Authority that do not apply to any other State body within the spectrum of the public service, I suggest he should accept this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was chairman of An Post in the 1980s and one of our challenges as a semi-State body was to set a standard in publishing accounts within three months. We were able to do so in the 1980s and get the accounts to the Minister of the day. Having set out to win an award and establish accounting standards, we wished to have the accounts published within three months but when we handed them over to the then Minister, he acted as if he intended to sit on them. However, we pursued him and succeeded in getting him to publish the accounts within a further month. In the <Col N="1452" />current context, we are not discussing publication of the accounts but handing them over to auditors for publication at a later stage. I believe three months is quite sufficient. I know of no other State company where a six months period applies. That appears to be a throwback to a previous era.</P>

      <P>The effect of this amendment would be to require the authority, under statute, to submit annual accounts for audit to the Comptroller and Auditor General not later than three months after the end of its financial year. While in practice it has been extremely rare for either Bord Fáilte or CERT to have been unable to submit their accounts within three months, it is possible, due to external factors such as a prolonged EU audit query, for example, that the authority might be unable to meet this deadline. Consequently, a six months period was proposed. The practice varies across State bodies. In many instances no deadline is set, as in the case of the Tourist Traffic Acts, the Air Navigation and Transport (Amendment) Act 1998, the Turf Development Act, 1998, and the Dublin Docklands Authority. In other cases, a three months period is set, as in the case of the Food Safety Authority and the Equality Authority. The specified period is six months in the case of national cultural institutions, the Irish horse racing authority and the Irish Sports Council.</P>

      <P>As currently drafted, this Bill would require the National Tourism Development Authority to publish its annual report by 30 June each year. Two things will have happened by that time. First, the next year's tourism season will be half way through. Second &ndash; and this is the interesting one &ndash; the Houses of the Oireachtas will have risen for the summer recess. The publication of the annual report of a State body is an important occasion from a strategic point of view. It enables us to look back on what has been achieved with a view to adjusting policy or changing course for the future. In tourism, it is vital to learn the lessons of each year as quickly as possible. If the annual report is published by the end of March, rather than the end of June, the essential difference is that virtually the whole season will still be in front of us and there is still time to take appropriate action. The annual report can then have an effective influence on how we manage the tourism sector from year to year.</P>
      <P>As far as the Oireachtas is concerned, publication of the annual report on the date now proposed would make it impossible for the report to receive the attention of either House of the Oireachtas until the following October at the earliest &ndash; some ten months after the end of the year under review and with another tourism season having passed in the meantime. We cannot have reporting on such a time scale and still claim to be applying accountability to tourism. I referred earlier to one or two State bodies which slipped through the net. Some bodies tend to be rather laggardly in this regard, including RTE. When I checked the position a few years ago, the publication date was 1 December, 11 months after the end of the relevant year. As of today, 11 months and three days after the end of last year, the RTE report has still not been published. Some action is essential in relation to such laggardly behaviour. In the particular case of tourism, competent modern practice demands earlier publication. I urge the Minister to accept my amendment.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Quinn's amendment. In my experience, when we push forward the publication date of reports, the people involved in writing them are pleased. I refer in particular to the report of the inspector of mental hospitals. When Deputy Cowen was Minister for Health and Children, that report usually emerged some 15 to 18 months after the end of the year. Very soon, that interval had been reduced to nine or ten months and the people involved in producing the report were pleased with that improvement. Such reports should not be regarded as simply historic documents. As Senator Quinn has advocated, they should be issued as promptly as possible so that there is still time to take action to influence developments.</P>

      <P>The effect of this amendment would be to require the authority, under statute, to submit its annual report not later than three months after the end of its financial year. A difficulty in that regard is that the Comptroller and Auditor General has rarely completed his audit of either the CERT or Bord Fáilte accounts within that period. Accordingly, the report would be incomplete due to the omission of information which would be contained in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report. I do not regard that as a desirable option and, in those circumstances, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>If ever an amendment was needed, this one is. Bord Fáilte Éireann does not publish its annual accounts on its website. I have been promoting the many advantages of electronic publication for all companies, including speed, transparency, accessibility and cost. Bord Fáilte's best attempt at publication is to invite people to write in for copies of the printed version. I know of no other body which has a website but still confines circulation of its annual report to the printed version. <Col N="1455" />In this 21st century, that is not good enough. How can a State body justify its refusal to make its annual report available to the public via its website? Only Bord Fáilte manages this remarkable feat. I leave it to others to judge what that performance says about the readiness of that organisation to communicate with the public at large.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to pick on Bord Fáilte in particular because, after all, that organisation will soon be history. We must now look to the future and make sure that the present information gaps are not repeated. I commend this amendment to the House. Having spoken on this topic many times, I do not wish to labour the point at this stage. The ability to communicate by electronic means, at the touch of a button, has many obvious advantages in terms of speed, accessibility and cost. I urge the Minister to insist that the new National Tourism Development Authority is not merely allowed to publish via its website, as all other bodies do, but that it is actually compelled to publish in electronic format for maximum accessibility.</P>

    <P>What does all that mean? There is something more to this amendment than might appear on the face of it. Ostensibly it means just what it <Col N="1457" />says, namely, it makes it possible for a member of the authority's staff to fill in for the chief executive in his absence when the position is vacant. By implication, it actually prevents, and is intended by me to prevent, the functions of the chief executive being assumed on a temporary basis by the chairman of the authority. Recent history has shown several examples of this practice taking place in State bodies. I do not want to dwell unduly on these experiences other than to say that we should strongly discourage that practice. We could guarantee through legislation that it does not happen.</P>
    <P>In the business world it is a widely accepted principle that in companies which are publicly accountable there should be a clear separation between the roles of chairman and chief executive. The case for this separation is even stronger in State bodies. I have suggested amendments previously which would directly close off this possibility but I am advised that this somewhat roundabout wording is the proper way to do it. For the exact wording I am once again indebted to the Digital Hub Development Agency Bill. I got it from there and I am sure the Minister would not like to be out of line with what happened earlier today.</P>

      <P>It is not proposed to accept the amendment. Bord Fáilte Éireann has had an acting chief executive officer for the past 15 months, Mr. Niall Reddy, who has done an extremely good job and is to be congratulated and thanked for it. My understanding is that when the chief executive officer is absent the secretary would be designated to take over his functions. This is something which happens quite regularly, for example when the chief executive officer is abroad the designation takes place.</P>

      <P>That may well be the correct thing to do, that the secretary takes over. It should be the authority's decision. The point I was making was that it is accepted in business, for publicly quoted companies, that it is not good practice or good governance to have the chairman and the chief executive both doing the chief executive's job. The amendment was to avoid that. It has happened in the past and there was an effort to remind State bodies that it was not good governance.</P>

      <Col N="1458" />Here we have a little baby that has cropped up before. I oppose this section. I do not know where it came from but it is against the spirit of the age to put a legislative gag on anybody. Has the Minister any idea how appalling this section looks? It smacks more of Stalinist Russia than anywhere else. It states: &ldquo;In the performance of his or her duties under this section the chief executive shall not question or express an opinion on the merits of any policy of the Government or Minister of the Government or on the merits of the objectives of such a policy&rdquo;. Can we really believe that something like this is being introduced in the 21st century? If we were talking about Stalinist Russia I could understand it.</P>
    <P>This only applies under certain committees. Is it only under the Committee of Public Accounts? It is something which should not be allowed. It is a complete travesty in a measure from a Government which is always trumpeting its openness and transparency.</P>
    <P>We have thrown out clauses like this before. Last year there was a clause exactly like this. It was spotted, I am glad to say, on the independent benches by Senator O'Toole. The Minister of the day, on having his attention drawn to how out of date and out of line it was with openness and transparency and with normal democracy, agreed to withdraw it. I am sure the present Minister, when he sees it, will wonder how it got into the Bill and be happy to withdraw it.</P>

      <P>I concur with Senator Quinn. I heard Senator Quinn raise this issue on the other Bill earlier this afternoon. The wording of this section is Dickensian. I cannot understand the wish of anyone to restrict the expression of another person's opinion. This goes against the notion of accountability and transparency and is not healthy. It also restricts the role of the chief executive officer. There could be a situation where a decision is made by the Minister or someone in the Department and the chief executive officer could not advise the members of the authority of his decision accordingly.</P>
      <P>This definitely needs to be re-examined. If we look at the decision-making process and the workings of the authority that could be affected by the section, we can compare the effect of this provision with Senators not being allowed to speak on the Bill. The wording of the section seems to thwart the attempts of an individual who may wish to give his or her opinion when employed by the State to do so in many respects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister tell the House who decided that section 32(2) should be worded to read &ldquo;in the performance of his or her duties under this section, the chief executive shall not question or express an opinion on the merits of any policy of the Government or a Minister of the Government or on the merits of the objectives of such a policy&rdquo;? We need to remove this section. There<Col N="1459" />fore, I support wholeheartedly the amendment tabled by Senator Quinn. I would appreciate it if the Minister would tell me who decided that this provision should be included in the Bill.</P>

The wording of section 32(2), which states, &ldquo;the chief executive shall not question or express an opinion,&rdquo; is quite amazing. Given that we are looking for openness, transparency and accountability in the various Government agencies, it is hard to believe such a clause has been proposed. It is a regressive and draconian step and should not be part of the Bill. I urge Deputy O'Donoghue, who is an enlightened and forward thinking Minister, to accede to Senator Quinn's amendment. He has shown this evening that he is prepared to listen.</P>

      <P>I am not sure whether those who have spoken against this section are familiar with the events of recent years. The chief executive of a State body in the mid-west has been having an ongoing argument with the chief executive of another body in recent times. Both officials are in the service of the State as chief executives of Government agencies. Their public disagreement was bad for Shannon Airport and both agencies.</P>
      <P>During a recent debate on tourism I raised the question of a huge public dispute between Clare County Council and Shannon Free Airport Development Company in relation to development works at the Cliffs of Moher, an important tourist destination. When the matter was referred to An Bord Pleanála, it meant that three State agencies were trying to resolve a dispute that should have been resolved by the two agencies involved. I do not have a problem with bodies expressing their views as part of their private communication with the Minister, but public expressions of grievance can undermine the bodies concerned. Regardless of where this provision came from, it is necessary in the light of the experiences of recent years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government decided to insert this standard provision which relates to civil servants, who are instruments of Government policy. The Government of the day is charged with making policy, determining objec<Col N="1460" />tives and imposing plans of action. It is simply not permissible for the chief executive of a board like the National Tourism Development Authority to express publicly the fact that he or she does not agree with Government policy. It is his or her function to implement Government policy and it would be highly inconsistent for him or her to decide to criticise such policy. He or she could not credibly carry on the duties and functions with which he or she has been charged under statute, including the implementation of Government policy, after making such criticisms.</P>
      <P>Those who criticise the policies they are charged with implementing may become political footballs and be used by various groups to score political points from the Government of the day. It is not acceptable, irrespective of the Government which happens to be in office, for the chief executive of a national board to go around the country criticising Government policy. There are instances where this has happened in the past and it has never been helpful. Those who make such statements may do so with the best will in the world, but it is always utterly undesirable. If one wants to set policy, as opposed to implementing it, one has to make a straightforward decision to run for election. The people can decide if such persons should set policies or not. Those who do not run for election, but instead decide to become civil servants, have chosen a clear role for themselves. This is a free country.</P>

      <P>Nobody is forcing public servants to stay in their positions if they do not want to do so. If one's objections to Government policy are sufficiently great that one cannot continue in one's position as a civil servant, one can retire from one's job and decide instead to try to change the policy. It is a reasonable situation. Any other provision would be unreasonable, unworkable and quickly lead to chaos in the system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have difficulty with the Minister's views on my amendment. Section 32(2) is strongly worded. It states, &ldquo;The chief executive shall not question or express an opinion on the merits of any policy of the Government&rdquo;. It does not merely state he or she should not criticise the policy. If I was on a committee that invited members of the National Tourism Development Authority to speak, I might like to ask the chief executive if he or she could do more if he or she had more money. It would be foolish if he or she was legally compelled to say he or she could not answer, as it would mean that members of the committee would be gagged. Under the section, the chief executive will not be allowed to speak out on the merits of Government policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Government genuinely does not want the chief executive to comment or make clear his or <Col N="1461" />her views, it should not establish an authority. The concept of separate State bodies dates from the 1920s, when the ESB was established. Such bodies have separate boards in order that they can be flexible and free from the control of Ministers and their civil servants. If we are to establish a separate authority and a separate board with functions as outlined in the Bill, which are exactly what we want them to do, it is pointless to ask them to do only what the Minister wants. In such circumstances, perhaps we should not be setting up a separate authority.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said he does not like the idea of a chief executive going around the country saying things with which the Government does not agree. If I was on the board of a company, I would sack its chief executive if he was saying he did not agree with the company's policies. That is the only thing to do when a chief executive behaves in the manner the Minister has outlined. I disagree, however, with the measures proposed in the section for solving such problems. We have to re-examine the matter to find a better way of running the authority without using words from another era like &ldquo;the chief executive shall not question or express an opinion on the merits of any policy of the Government,&rdquo; as such words are almost as strong as one can get.</P>

      <P>It is possible that the converse could occur. The chief executive of the authority, with a view to ingratiating himself or herself to the Government of the day, might decide to tell the committee that the authority has money in abundance when he or she knows quite well that it does not. Surely this is the converse of the argument made by Senator Quinn. It is never desirable for a chief executive who is charged with the implementation of Government policy to be at liberty to criticise it. It reminds me of an old song: it does not work in politics.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an Aire Stáit go dtí an Teach. I thank the Cathaoirleach and the Minister for taking this matter for discussion. In Mullingar we have a serious problem in that the sewerage network and plant are at capacity and certain parts of the treatment network are unable to take any more. As a result, planning applications are being refused. Two local authority engineers, members of our own staff, are trying to do their best within the constraints under which they have to operate, given the nature of the problem, to ascertain the degree of development that can be supported. The channel of the Brosna, which flows through the town, also needs to be dealt with. In the past we have had serious flooding in Mullingar due to the inadequacy of the channel in terms of taking surface water.</P>
      <P>A preliminary report has been produced by JB Barry and Partners, consulting engineers, and presented to the council. It points out various development constraints in the sewerage network and the sewage treatment plant. Although I am being parochial, I am delighted that Mullingar and Athlone have been selected as gateway towns in the national spatial strategy. If we are to develop in the manner envisaged it will be necessary, as a matter of urgency, to provide the necessary upgrading to the sewerage network and treatment plant as well as dealing with the Brosna channel.</P>

      <P>Ar an gcéad dul síos ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a chur in iúl don Seanadóir as ucht na ceiste thábhachtach seo a ardú. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, regrets that he cannot be in the House to respond to the important matter raised by the Senator. I am, however, pleased to have the opportunity to respond.</P>
      <P>The main objective of the national spatial strategy, which was published last week, is to achieve more balanced development of the country along with a better quality of life for everyone. Vibrant urban and rural areas and a better environment are also aims of the strategy. In drawing up the strategy we were aware of the special position of the midlands and the pressures it faces as a result of being so close to the greater Dublin area. Clearly it was important to create self-sustaining urban areas in the midlands. There was also a recognition that gateways must be able to sustain a population of around 100,000 in the city and its hinterlands.</P>
      <P>The necessary scale and critical mass can be established if a number of towns work together, as is to happen in the midlands. Athlone, Mullingar and Tullamore will work together as a linked gateway. All three towns are reasonably near each other, are strategically located on or near national road, rail, energy and communications links and have appropriate infrastructure and facilities. In harnessing these complementary strengths the link gateway will create scale and critical mass for the region. The trend of long distance commuting to nearby cities such as Dublin will be countered through this approach.</P>
      <P>The national development plan includes provision for expenditure of &euro;4.4 billion up to 2006 on water services infrastructure. The groundwork to support many of the aims of the national spatial strategy has already been done by the progress made to date under the current national development plan and successive water services investment programmes. While all major capital programmes will have to be reviewed to establish how they best reflect the infrastructural requirements arising from the national spatial strategy, &euro;138 million allocated for County Westmeath under the current water services investment programme will leave Mullingar particularly well placed to realise the objectives of the strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The schemes already approved in the programme for County Westmeath include the Mullingar sewerage scheme which will cost more than &euro;25 million and is scheduled to commence construction in 2004. I understand from the Senator that the preliminary report is available to the council. However, we are awaiting the report in the Department at an early date. There will be no delay in approving the scheme when it comes to hand. The funds for the scheme have been allo<Col N="1465" />cated under the water services investment programme and it will be advanced as quickly as the planning and procurement process allows.</P>
    <P>The new Mullingar water treatment plant has been approved to begin construction in 2004. Network extensions to serve new development areas will follow soon afterwards. The Senator will be aware that the Minister has already sanctioned funds for a &euro;6 million filtration plant to treat the water supply from Lough Owel to existing consumers in order to eliminate the water quality problems that emerged earlier this year. The plant will be operational very early in the new year. As soon as the preliminary report is received, work will progress as quickly as possible because I realise the importance of the issue. However, nothing more can be done to progress the work until the report is received.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister for Transport outline the criteria used in appointing members of State boards under his aegis, particularly Aer Rianta? The reasons I bring up the issue are very obvious. It is currently a very topical matter, particularly as it relates to the board of Aer Rianta which is in the middle of a public controversy. The reason any objective person would assume one is appointed to the board of a semi-State body is he or she has two qualities, first, expertise in the area and, second, independence. In almost all companies, particularly public companies, the requirement of corporate governance is not so much expertise, but, above all, that directors should have independence in order that they would not be subject to external or internal hidden pressures.</P>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that this is not the case in regard to semi-State bodies. The record is one of political parties willy nilly appointing friends and supporters to semi-State bodies as a priority above their interest, expertise and knowledge of the industry or business which they have been appointed to safeguard. This is an open secret, not something any party particularly hides. It just becomes Buggins's turn every five years. If the political landscape changes and a person is normally not reappointed, someone from the opposite political party takes his or her place and is either a supporter or a member of the party concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, the record is peppered with such incidents. This does not just apply to Fianna Fáil, it also applies to Fine Gael, the Labour <Col N="1466" />Party, Democratic Left and the Progressive Democrats. There is a ruthless tendency to appoint friends to such positions. There was the situation in the VHI, with which the Minister will be undoubtedly familiar, which was full of members and supporters of the Fine Gael Party and supporters of the Minister for Health and Children. It is time to end this phenomenon. There would be a great opportunity, if the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, took my suggestion on board, in the case of Aer Rianta where two appointments must be made. He should make them in such a way that he could not be accused of appointing members or supporters of the party. He has the opportunity in the midst of this controversy.</P>
    <P>Meetings of the directors of Aer Rianta must be fairly unique spectacles. Members of the board could be forgiven for believing they are at a side show of a Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis or a Fianna Fáil cumann meeting. The chairman, Mr. Noel Hanlon, is a long time friend and supporter of Fianna Fáil. Board member, Mr. Dermot O'Leary, is a member of the national executive of Fianna Fáil. Another director, Mr. Tadhg O'Donoghue, was a recent Fianna Fáil director of elections in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown while Ms Freda Hayes is closely associated with the Soldiers of Destiny.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil has a vice-like grip on Aer Rianta, which is not good for the semi-State body. The Minister has been given a Heaven sent opportunity to break the flawed practice of appointing party loyalists to key positions in semi-State bodies. He should break the mould of political patronage by refusing to appoint both Mr. O'Leary and Mr. O'Donoghue who are now up for reappointment or replacement.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity of making one or two suggestions. Now that the joint committee dealing with semi-State bodies has been abolished, those appointed as directors to semi-State companies should be subject to some sort of public examination and scrutiny at the very least. It would not be beyond the ability of this House to ask fair and sensible questions of the people concerned at a public hearing about their qualifications for sitting on such boards. We should also consider the very dubious practice of appointing members of the so-called social partnership to the boards simply and solely because they are social partners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Ross for rais<Col N="1467" />ing the issue of the appointment of members to State boards, particularly Aer Rianta. A total of nine State bodies operate under the aegis of the Department of Transport. These include the main commercial State bodies in the transport sector, most notably, Aer Lingus, Aer Rianta, the CIE group of companies and the Railway Procurement Agency. The Department of Transport also has responsibility for the National Roads Authority, the Dublin Transportation Office, the National Safety Council, the Medical Bureau of Road Safety and the Irish Aviation Authority.</P>
      <P>The commercial State enterprises are involved in the provision or procurement of services on a commercial basis. Bodies such as the Railway Procurement Agency and the National Roads Authority have specific functions in relation to the procurement of metro and light rail and the advancement of the national roads programme respectively. The DTO co-ordinates the implementation by the relevant agencies of an agreed integrated transport strategy for the greater Dublin area.</P>
      <P>The principal function of the Medical Bureau of Road Safety is to carry out analyses, on behalf of the Garda, of the alcohol content of specimens taken from people suspected of drink driving offences. The National Safety Council promotes road and fire safety awareness through publicity and educational campaigns. The Irish Aviation Authority has responsibility for the provision of air navigation services and it also acts as the air safety regulator.</P>
      <P>In the case of Aer Rianta, which is specifically referred to, the company has a general duty under statute to operate and manage the three State airports at Dublin, Shannon and Cork. This includes the provision of the necessary infrastructure and services at the State airports at the lowest possible cost to meet the needs of the various airport users, including airlines and passengers, consistent with safety and commercial operations and the requirement to promote the development of traffic at the airports.</P>
      <P>A broad range of considerations is taken into account in the appointment of members to State boards. In the case of a number of the companies involved, including Aer Rianta, a third of the board membership is comprised of worker directors elected in accordance with the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Acts and duly appointed by the Minister on foot of the outcome of those elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of other board members, the considerations which are taken into account include the type of body involved, whether commercial, technical or regulatory, the major issues facing the bodies involved including challenges and opportunities, the need for an appropriate balance as between the various disciplines currently represented on such a board, the need for gender <Col N="1468" />balance, the need, where relevant, for the appointment of persons with particular technical expertise and the need to achieve representation for specific sectoral or regional interests where this is relevant.</P>
    <P>Apart from the worker directors, and members of the Railway Procurement Agency, where a specific skills mix is identified under the legislation governing the body, there is no specific formula governing the choice of appointees to State boards. Of necessity, the choice made involves a question of judgment. The foregoing sets out in broad, yet reasonably accurate, terms the mix of considerations which are taken into account when a vacancy arises on a State board and a decision is required in relation to the filling of that vacancy. It is also relevant that discussions may be involved between the Minister and the chairman of a particular State body before decisions are made to fill vacancies that arise on the board of such a body.</P>
    <P>A glance at the make-up of the current membership of the State boards under the aegis of the Department of Transport shows a broad mix of experience and expertise in the composition of those boards. Current board members include worker representatives, persons from the banking and insurance communities, from the various professions including accountancy, auctioneering and engineering, local and regional authorities, civil servants, the hotels sector, the legal, medical and pharmaceutical sectors and the universities, to mention but a few. I hope that the foregoing remarks will be helpful in illustrating the efforts made to achieve a broad representative balance together with specific expertise, where relevant, in making appointments to State boards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned, as the Minister is aware, by the blunt recent announcement that the Torc Great Southern Hotel in Killarney would not reopen and was on the market to be sold by public tender without consultation with staff. There are persistent rumours in Kerry <Col N="1469" />regarding the hotel at Parknasilla and surveyors have visited there. Will the Minister scotch these rumours because it is widely believed that the Parknasilla hotel is unofficially on the market? I understand there is concern in Galway regarding the Corrib hotel and that it is the intention of the hotel group to reduce bit by bit. I believe that the board of the hotel in Derry, if not the Aer Rianta board, is not happy with its involvement there.</P>
      <P>There was a recent sale of 4.6 acres of land attaching to the Torc Great Southern Hotel in Killarney. The railway company was not consulted despite its difficulties in Killarney. The Minister will be well aware of the assurances given in the other House by the then Minister for Public Enterprise, Senator O'Rourke, on 18 May 1999, that there would be no change without the fullest consultation, in particular with the staff of the hotels, and with the overriding objective of maintaining and maximising employment. That commitment has been reneged on.</P>
      <P>The Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, whose constituency is Kerry South, assured staff through the local media that they would be accommodated in the Torc Great Southern Hotel in Killarney. From my consultation with staff, they have no understanding of that and do not believe it. They had a meeting yesterday or today and will ballot with regard to possible strike action.</P>
      <P>The hotel group is a wholly owned subsidiary of Aer Rianta and its board holds the view that the hotel group is not central to its operations, is non-core activity, that it should exit the hotel sector and that the proceeds of the sell-off should be directed towards the airports. A report by Warburg Dillon Read and AIB Capital Markets agreed with the board's view in that regard. This raises the most fundamental question with regard to the future of the hotels. Should they ever have been placed with Aer Rianta? Does the Government intend that the hotel group will continue with Aer Rianta or will it reallocate the hotels within the semi-State sector to a more convivial home? Is it the intention to see them reduced by individual sell-offs, as is believed in parts of the country?</P>
      <P>There is a clear public need for a new and expanded railway station in Killarney. The station is adjacent to both hotels and is the only station in the country into which trains must reverse, on their way from Tralee to Dublin. There are six or seven acres adjoining the Torc Great Southern Hotel, the end of which would make an ideal site for a train station. This need not interfere with the sale of the hotels and there is no need to sell the hotels for that. The urban council in Killarney is having difficulty obtaining land for housing and that should be kept in mind if some land is surplus to requirements. I do not accept that the hotel is surplus to requirements but there are six or seven acres with the hotel which at the stroke of a pen were lost to the railway company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1470" />I tried to raise the Torc Great Southern Hotel land sale a month ago but my question was disallowed due to lack of ministerial involvement. A Dáil question received the reply that the Minister has no direct function with regard to the matters raised as they are a day-to-day matter for the company concerned. I welcome the Minister of State to the House and thank him for his courtesy and kindness regarding the matter, in anticipation of his reply. I am disappointed that an allied matter was ruled out of order, through no fault of the Cathaoirleach. There seem to be many inconsistencies in the responses that have been given in the past week or more.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Coghlan for raising this issue. The Great Southern Hotels Group is a wholly owned subsidiary of Aer Rianta CPT. The group currently employs the equivalent of 750 full-time staff and owns nine hotels, five of which are located in prime tourist destinations. A new Great Southern Hotel adjacent to Cork Airport opened last year and fulfils the group's objective of having a hotel at each of the main tourist gateways. The company also has a minority interest and a management contract in the four-star City Hotel in Derry.</P>
      <P>The slowdown in the world economy, the foot and mouth disease crisis in the UK and the impact of the events of 11 September combined to make last year an arduous one in the Irish hotel sector. The Great Southern Hotels Group was also affected and recorded a 34% drop in profits from &euro;4.8 million in 2000 to &euro;3.2 million in 2001. Retention of market share and cost containment were the group's main focus this year in order to position it for the expected recovery next year.</P>
      <P>The Killarney Great Southern Hotel will celebrate its 150th birthday in 2004. I understand from Aer Rianta that an examination of the two Great Southern Hotels in Killarney in 2000 concluded that extensive renovations and refurbishment were required to be carried out in both hotels if they were to continue in business, particularly with regard to meeting the new fire regulations and safety requirements. The board of Great Southern Hotels decided in early 2000 to carry out a full restoration of the old Killarney hotel at a cost of &euro;15 million and to keep the other hotel, the Torc, open while this was being carried out and to review its position when this project had been completed. The financing for the restoration of the old Killarney hotel was to come from the sale of surplus assets in the group. The objective of re-establishing the old hotel as Killarney's leading hotel has been achieved and the hotel was reopened in the middle of the year to resume its year-round operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that if the Torc Hotel were to be kept operational it would require expenditure in the region of &euro;8 million to &euro;9 million which, in <Col N="1471" />the opinion of the board of the Great Southern Hotels, could not be justified, particularly as this hotel operated for only six months each year. The Torc Hotel has now closed and it is not the intention of the board to reopen it. The board recently decided to offer the Torc for sale by public tender in the near future. The Great Southern Hotels Group is committed to accommodating the staff of the Torc either at the old hotel in Killarney or with an agreed voluntary redundancy package. The sale of the Torc will complete the group's strategy for its Kerry portfolio and ensures that borrowing for capital investment purposes remains at an acceptable level.</P>
    <P>The board of Aer Rianta accepted the proposals of the board of Great Southern Hotels and fully endorsed the strategy. There are no proposals at this time for the sale of any other hotel, including the Parknasilla Hotel, in the Great Southern Hotels chain. Overall, planned investment by the Great Southern Hotels Group over the next five years will amount to approximately &euro;33 million.</P>
    <P>In a strategic review undertaken in 1999 for the Minister's predecessor, the board of Aer Rianta considered that the Great Southern Hotels Group, while operating successfully, is non-core to Aer Rianta's airport management operations. The board recommended that it should exit from this business and use the proceeds from the sale towards financing capital expenditure programmes at the State airports. A subsequent <Col N="1472" />report, prepared by Warburg Dillon Read and AIB Capital Markets for the former Minister, agreed with the view of the Aer Rianta board on this matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Transport has indicated that he will revisit the question of the future of the Great Southern Hotels Group in due course. He stated, however, that he intends to concentrate for the time being on the priority issues of aviation and transport in general as set out in the programme for Government. I am unfamiliar with the question of land availability and will raise this issue with the Minister when he revisits this subject.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister of State's response regarding the land availability question. He said that hotels are not core to Aer Rianta's business and that while there are currently no proposals in that regard, it will be revisited. Does that not mean there will be further sales with a view to a management buy-out? Will they be reallocated within the State service?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Senator is aware, such decisions are a matter for State boards but the Minister has agreed to revisit the issue of the Great Southern Hotels in due course. It might become the subject of a motion the Senator tables in this House.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 4 December 2002.</P>
