      <P>I have received notice from Senator Connor that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to indicate the current status of the application by Ballyleague national school, County Roscommon, for grant assistance to provide necessary improvements.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Norris of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to make provision for the retention of nine child care workers, three project workers, a receptionist and a personal assistant at Mountjoy prison visitors centre.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Quinn of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to inform this House of the outcome of the review of the scheme for naturalisation arising from investment which was instituted by him in September 1997 and which he informed the House on 4 March 1998 &ldquo;will be determined by Government shortly&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Taylor-Quinn of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to outline the background to the recent decision taken by his Department to provide an extension to St. Joseph's secondary school, Tulla, County Clare, rather than a new school on a greenfield site.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected the matters raised by Senators Connor, Norris and Quinn, and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senator Taylor-Quinn may give notice on another day of the matter she wishes to raise.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business is No. 1, motion re Council Framework Decision on joint investigation teams, back from the Joint Committee on European Affairs, to be taken without debate; No. 2, motion re Council decision on the Schengen information systems, back from the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, to be taken without debate; No. 3, Ombudsman for Children Bill, 2002 &ndash; Committee and Remaining Stages; and No. 22, motion 19, to be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m.</P>

      <P>Since it is unlikely that we will sit more than eight or nine more days before the general election, will the Leader give a realistic indication of the legislation he expects to bring before the House between now and the end of the session? This is a reasonable request. Does he expect any unpublished Bills to come before the House? Will the telecommunications Bill be published in time to be taken before the dissolution of the Dáil?</P>
      <P>We all receive circulars in the post and I have discussed the media in the past, but many of us received a circular from <i>The Sunday Times</i> last weekend which reached a new low in offensiveness. It asked if any member of my family had had an abortion. I do not know, I do not want to know and it is none of my business. That would be the reaction of everyone here. Intrusion into anyone's private life in this way is intolerable. The fact that the information could then be used publicly, because we were asked to sign this document, to embarrass family members is deeply offensive. I want to put on record the fact that I have not answered the questionnaire. Anything I have to say on the subject is on the record. I want to note this circular and that those who sent it should be ashamed of themselves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Manning. I also received a copy and threw it into the bin. When I first looked at it, I saw only the survey and did not see the question. I found it appalling and could not believe that it came from a reputable Sunday newspaper. I thought it was a set-up.</P>
      <P>A significant number of the Adjournment Debate matters today and others recently, including the Leader's matter last week, relate to education. Senator Costello, Senator Ormonde and I, among others, have raised the need for a debate on education. The Leader has consistently given commitments to arrange such a debate. This whole area, including school buildings, is a huge issue throughout the country. There should be a debate on that aspect and on the difficulties in education. The Minister should discuss the matter here and I ask the Leader to arrange such a debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An issue I raised before and which must be looked at now is the question of participation in democracy. We are facing a referendum and an election in the next couple of months. I ask the <Col N="511" /> Leader to invite the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to explain why he will not introduce on-line voting for people who cannot be physically present in their constituencies, such as students and people abroad on business. I also include emigrant voters. This affects my colleagues on the Independent benches as we are the only representatives of emigrant voters. People who live abroad could vote more easily and it should be introduced. Now that the Government has introduced electronic voting, the next step is on-line voting, which can be done in every radio and television station in the world. It would be in all our interests to increase the participation of young people in democracy. I ask the Cathaoirleach to support the introduction of on-line voting. It is safer than any other way of voting. We can change money and do all our business on the Internet. We should also be able to participate in democracy on-line.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator O'Toole's suggestion in relation to on-line voting. Has the Leader considered introducing electronic voting? It would be the first step towards technology in this House. It has already been introduced in the other House and perhaps we could graduate to on-line voting in the Seanad.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Manning's point. All my colleagues received documentation from<i> The Sunday Times</i> which asked them intrusive questions regarding family and personal matters. It is regrettable that since Rupert Murdoch took up ownership, the standards at what was a reputable newspaper have sunk so low. I question the motives of other moguls who have taken up ownership of other newspapers where standards have also deteriorated.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole requested a debate on education. A number of other issues also require debate, such as health, the environment and waste management. Given that we are approaching the end of the session, perhaps the Leader will prioritise these issues. There is also a need to hold a debate on justice. While there appears to have been a decline in the incidence of non-serious offences, serious crime has been increasing. In addition, there is a need to debate the level of fatalities on the roads and for resources to address this issue. The question of policing also requires debate, especially the need for a Garda board and ombudsman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important we on this side of the House join with Senator Manning in expressing concern about the questionnaire issued by <i>The Sunday Times.</i> I was shocked when I received it. There was a commitment that it could be anonymous but irrespective of that, we were invited to give our name and party affiliation and to indicate how we would vote in the forthcoming referendum. However, the offensive aspect of the questionnaire was to ask questions about per<Col N="512" /> sonal family matters, including whether the recipient or any family member had an abortion and, subsequent to the referendum, whether the recipient would report a family member who had one. That is outrageous.</P>
      <P>We need to return to the debate on the question of a press council and on standards in journalism. If journalists in <i>The Sunday Times</i> were prepared to make the effort to research the records of the Houses, they would know how many Deputies and Senators were going to vote in the referendum. The questionnaire was totally unwarranted and intrusive and it must be condemned unreservedly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to ensure that the damning report on the orthodontic service by the Joint Committee on Health and Children is debated in the House as soon as possible. We would be shirking our responsibility if, before the end of this session, we did not fully debate the report and address its recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that between now and the dissolution of the Seanad and Dáil, Members will be concentrating on national issues but if this House is to be relevant we must hold a full debate on foreign affairs. As a First World country we will be judged on what we are doing for poorer countries. A debate will show what we are attempting to achieve in conflict areas. For example, an attempt could be made to stop the conflict in the Middle East, where people are dying every day, if the western world decided to act. There is poverty in places like Mozambique, a war in Angola and crises in the Congo and Zimbabwe, where many Irish citizens are living. We must address the political elements that are necessary to change what is happening in the Third World and we should have a debate on this matter.</P>
      <P>I will not address the matter of <i>The Sunday Times</i> but regarding a debate on such an issue, a Member mentioned the owner of the newspaper. I am not referring to <i>The Sunday Times</i> specifically but surely the journalists involved should receive as much blame as the editor. Those in the NUJ who allowed this to happen are just as much at fault as the owner or the editor.</P>
      <P>I seek a debate on our concerns regarding countries which do not have the same financial resources as Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not support the Order of Business as it is not good procedure to take Committee and Remaining Stages of the Ombudsman for Children Bill. This bad parliamentary procedure was adopted last week on the Competition Bill. We took all Stages, but there was no Report <Col N="513" /> Stage debate. This is not a good idea as we cannot table proper Report Stage amendments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have been interrupted, I will comment on the interruption. It was agreed under protest and in very particular circumstances. I won an undertaking that this would not become a regular matter in the House. I will oppose the Order of Business on that basis because, having made the breach in that instance, we are now following it by making it a matter of routine.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I also seek a debate on the reporting of judgments, particularly Supreme Court judgments. If we cannot have a debate perhaps the Leader will communicate our concerns about this to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. My correspondence indicates that Supreme Court judgments are sometimes left for 30 years and one specific case, dated 4 March 1955, has only just been reported. These judgments are part of the democratic process and if they are not reported, it is very difficult to include them in legal pleadings. This was the case of Kavanagh <i>v.</i><i>The Leader</i>&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>With the greatest respect, I am not commenting on it. I am commenting on the lack of reporting. The Supreme Court does an exceptionally fine job and citizens are entitled to know its decisions. They should not be locked up in a cupboard and left to rot.</P>
      <P>The House should also express its grave concern that a member of the Government, a Cabinet Minister, will attend the meeting in University College, Cork, at which Henry Kissinger will speak.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the Leader a question. I am asking him to communicate our concern to the appropriate authorities or perhaps we could have an emergency debate on the fact that somebody who stands in danger of a warrant for war crimes should be welcomed to University College, Cork, and that members of the Government should be lickspittling a person of very doubtful&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>

      <P>I ask the Leader to consider a debate on State policies regarding the Irish language. Members will have noticed that in recent weeks further debate on this has been activated and I am particularly pleased by the balanced nature of this discussion as well as the goodwill that has been expressed. It seems the right atmosphere in which to discuss the national language. Many issues related to the Irish language need to be addressed aside from education, such as business.</P>
      <P>What particularly impresses me is that we now have Foras na Gaeilge, a cross-Border body which involves both traditions. Following from the Good Friday Agreement and the establishment of Foras na Gaeilge it is right that the Seanad should give leadership in this debate. Tá súil agam go mbeidh sé sin ann chomh luath agus is féidir.</P>

      <P>I accept the Cathaoirleach's ruling with regard to <i>The Sunday Times</i> article. I completely support the way in which it was dealt with by the leaders of the various groups. I wish to raise the issue first raised by Senator Costello regarding the adoption of electronic voting in this House. I must admit that I am in two minds about it. We have a tradition in the way we conduct our voting. We are smaller in numbers than the other House and we are more practical and can get it done in the old, traditional manner.</P>

      <P>I also wish to raise the Government's U-turn on the Disability Bill. Is it intended that the Bill, as modified, will be brought before this House before it rises? If it is not brought in before the end of the session, and there are very few days left, it will not be dealt with until some time next year. It is only right and proper that a Bill that has been so long in the waiting should be given priority.</P>

The Minister for Foreign Affairs should come into the House before the end of the session to give us an update so that we <Col N="515" /> can establish where we stand on the achievements of the Government on all aspects relating to the North.</P>

      <P>Less that two weeks ago I raised the problems I could see happening in accident and emergency units, not just in this city but in other cities around the country. Industrial action in less than two weeks' time has been voted for by 95% of nurses in accident and emergency units. The Minister has set up a forum on the issue. I have not been aware of so many fora and committees in the Department of Health and Children, and some of them do not come to fruition before the Minister takes action, for example, the one on the deregulation of the pharmaceutical industry. Pharmacists feel they were not properly consulted as the committee had not come to a conclusion. There are two issues, one of which is that because we did not wait for a committee to report, a dispute has arisen between the Minister and pharmacists. A forum has been set up in the other case but it will not be in action before the industrial dispute in accident and emergency units is under way.</P>

      <P>Will the Leader of the House arrange a debate on the effects of coastal erosion? A flood tide is due again tomorrow. Many people are deeply concerned about the last flood tide and the detrimental effect it had on homes and on the coast itself. While I welcome the money the Government has allocated to flood victims, it is very important to point out that no money is available in the national development plan to deal with coastal erosion. If we make a special change to the plan millions of euro could be made available to those coastal communities who will be devastated again by coastal erosion.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Henry's request that the Minister for Health and Children come to the House to discuss the current crisis. The country should face the reality that 93% of nurses voted to withdraw their services from accident <Col N="516" /> and emergency departments. Whatever bluster may emanate from various places, it is a statement of fact which must be addressed.</P>
      <P>I seek a debate on volunteerism in Irish life and also on volunteerism and amateurism in sport since it appears that Fianna Fáil policy is for the GAA to become professional. That is what the Minister for Finance effectively said to the Select Committee on Finance and the Public Service yesterday.</P>

I wish to say something positive about this morning's <i>Irish Examiner</i>, which contains a full page spread on Dr. Kissinger's visit to Cork, which is being hosted by that newspaper's owners among other people. The newspaper also carries a stinging attack on Dr. Kissinger and I wish that other owners would allow the same diversity of views within a newspaper, where the guests of the owner could be criticised by a columnist. There is one organisation where that would not happen.</P>

      <P>A few weeks ago I asked the Leader how the euro changeover was going and he stated then that it was excellent. I disagree because inflation is high. The relevant agency will not comment on this and no one appears willing <Col N="517" /> to admit that it is running high. Anyone who does not recognise that the currency from ten cent downwards is not working must be living in another world.</P>

      <P>Last weekend we saw figures that suggested that the number of deaths on the roads this year will be greater than last year. Steps to reduce these deaths are not being implemented. The answer is the penalty points system. I have often asked when the Road Traffic Bill will reach this House. I was worried when Senator Manning said that we have only eight or nine sitting days left. This Bill was due here months ago and we are told that the penalty points system, which is part of it, will not be operational for another two years. If we are to do something about the carnage on the roads, it is essential to pass this Bill.</P>
      <P>I also support Senator Norris's comments about the tendency for the Committee and Final Stages of Bills to take place on the same day or immediately after each other. Senator Dardis explained the position regarding the Competition Bill. I asked on the Order of Business when the Final Stages of the Competition Bill would take place. It was sprung on us that they were to be taken there and then, with the House's agreement, because of the urgency of the matter. We should not develop this habit and the same procedure should not be suggested today.</P>

      <P>Since the lifetime of this Seanad is now very short, we need to focus on the most important issues facing us as public representatives, and there is no more urgent issue than the state of our health services. As has been pointed out, we are facing a crisis in accident and emergency, not only in terms of overcrowding problems experienced by patients and nurses but also because of the action likely to be taken by nurses in the coming weeks.

    <P>On the question of standards in the press and the issue of a press council, as a former journalist I published a proposal for the establishment of a <Col N="518" /> voluntary press council which was supported by the National Union of Journalists and by the voluntary sector in particular which believes it is vitally important to have some access to an informal but well established council, but there was no response from media owners to that proposal.

      <P>Senators Manning, O'Toole, Costello and Dardis expressed strong views regarding the questionnaire sent to us by <i>The Sunday Times</i>. I agree with the Senators but if we are sincere in calling for the establishment of a press council, the proof of the pudding will be the number of political parties which will include it as part of their manifesto and programme for Government. I have been calling for a press council for the past 14 years and it is about time we had the power of our convictions and set it up.</P>
      <P>On Senator Manning's other point, it is my estimate that we will sit for a total of at least 12 days before the general election.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole inquired about a debate on education. I understand that an education Bill will come before the House in the next few weeks and Senators will be invited to make whatever comments they wish at that time. Because of the amount of legislation being initiated here, as well as the number of Bills coming from the Dáil that have to be completed before the general election, debates on other issues will be few and far between unless we devise some special formula to sit on Mondays.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (2), line 16, after &ldquo;provisions&rdquo; to insert:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;, provided that no commencement date shall be later than 2 years from the day of enactment&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment would ensure that the Bill, when enacted, would come into operation within a reasonable period. I realise the advice from all the different Departments will be against this move. I have a good reason for tabling the amendment as we have experience of legislation not coming into operation. This is something that has dragged the Legislature into disrepute.</P>
      <P>As far as I am aware, many of the sections of the Bill that replaced the Children Act, 1908, did not come into operation at various stages. My experience recently has been the Education Act. When the Education Bill was going through the House in November 1998 or 1999, it was written into the Bill that all sections would be fully operational within a year. The then Minister, Deputy Martin, suggested that such a timeframe was too tight and could not be achieved. I recall that Senator Costello proposed an amendment to reduce the period of time to six months, but I supported the Minister in increasing it to two years. Looking at the complexity of the Education Bill, it seemed fair to presume that by the time consultation had finished and things began to be established, a year would have passed.</P>
      <P>I looked at this Bill in a similar manner and I congratulate all who had an input into it, including the Minister of State, as it is an extraordinary and progressive step. It would be devastating, therefore, if the Bill were ignored and not implemented as speedily as possible. If Fianna Fáil is not returned to office, which I know the Minister of State would not wish to contemplate, and a different Minister is appointed to this area&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Those of us with a broader view have to consider all possibilities. If it happens that none of us is here after the elections, at least we will have the satisfaction of having ensured that this Bill is operational. The Minister of State could argue that she made a decision, enacted by the Legislature, to put a commencement date into the Bill. All aspects of this Bill that support children should be brought into operation within two years of the day of enactment. Presuming that the Bill will be passed by the Seanad this week and by the Dáil in a month or so, before the general <Col N="523" /> election, my amendment proposes that its provisions be commenced by mid-2004, which is not unreasonable.</P>
      <P>I am not attempting to get at anybody, but it is important we ensure that the positive aspects of the Bill in relation to protecting and doing the best we can for children, which are supported by all Senators, come into operation as soon as possible. I have no difficulty in withdrawing my amendment in favour of one with a different period of time if the Minister of State feels that two years is unreasonable. I believe that my proposal is reasonable, but if the Minister of State considers that it will take longer to fully enact the Bill, I will accept her point of view. I am interested in anticipating closure in the sense of implementing all sections of the Bill. I do not think two years is unreasonable and I ask the Minister of State to accept my amendment.</P>

      <P>I support Senator O'Toole on this matter. I wish I had thought of putting down similar amendments to other Bills. The Minister of State will recall that all Senators welcomed the Bill last week and she must not feel that we do not support her endeavours. In this worthwhile amendment we are trying to ensure that the Bill will not be allowed to drift if the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, is not in charge of children in the future &ndash; God between us and all harm. Both Houses pushed through the Mental Health Bill, 1999, with great haste before the summer recess last year, but not a line of it has been implemented.</P>

      <P>I was reduced to tabling a Private Members' Bill some months ago to try to impress on the Department of Health and Children a sense of urgency by recommending that the Mental Health Act should be implemented by a date in March of this year. The courts repeatedly mention the problems they encounter because mental health legislation has not been updated. I wish I had thought of introducing an amendment similar to Senator O'Toole's when this House considered the Mental Health Bill last June. I support this amendment and hope it will be accepted.</P>

      <P>I also support Senator O'Toole's amendment in the context of the House's support for the Ombudsman for Children Bill. We are facilitating its quick passage through the Seanad so it can be dealt with and passed by the Dáil before the general election. Like Senator Henry, Fine Gael Senators were disappointed not to have introduced a commencement date by amendment to the Mental Health Bill, 1999, which does not have such a conclusive date. I consider that two years is a realistic timeframe to allow implementation of this relatively short Bill, which is extremely important for the protection of children. I support <Col N="524" /> fully the proposal in this amendment, which I hope will be accepted by the Minister of State.</P>

      <P>May I add my voice to those of Senators O'Toole, Henry and Jackman? I have tried, since I entered this House, to ensure commencement dates are included in Bills so their measures are implemented as speedily as possible. There has been a tradition in this State of putting many items of importance on the long finger. Senator Henry is right. The Mental Health (Amendment) Bill, 2001 is an example of where there seemed to be urgency yet nothing has happened.</P>
      <P>In practically every Bill coming through the House on State companies I have tried to ensure that reports are published. I discovered that unless that was done the reports were not published on time and sometimes drifted for a long time. This is not the same item. I am aware that the Minister's heart is behind this and the urgency is there at the moment. However, that may not be the case in the future and it is important that legislation ensures it.</P>

      <P>I know the perspective the Senators are coming from is one of support. Not for one moment am I anticipating that this would be left to lie like other legislation. The difference between this and other legislation is that the funding has already been allocated. The funding for the establishment of this office is in this year's Estimates. We are just awaiting the passage of the legislation through the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>It is my expectation, rather than my hope, that the office will be fully functioning by the end of the year presuming the legislation goes through. While I am not opposed to calls to have it up and running within a year or two, I believe it is unnecessary to include this in the legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's argument against the amendment is that it is unnecessary. I accept that is logical, but it does not address my point. Who knows who will be sitting in the Minister's seat, who will introduce a mini-budget before the end of the year, what different views a new Government might take on these matters, what constraints might be implemented by the next Secretary General of the Department of Finance when finances are revised towards the end of the year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment does not discommode the Minister or her Department in any way. The acceptance of this amendment would demonstrate a huge level of commitment and support behind this legislation. It would mean that the job is finished when it is enacted; it brings closure. In deference to the levels of support for what the Minister has said &ndash; she almost received a round of applause when she made her presentation here last week &ndash; we have all been genuinely impressed by the obvious commitment she has shown in dealing with this. It would be great if the Minister would respond to us on this issue. <Col N="525" /> There is no additional cost to anybody as the money is already allocated. It would be an acceptable way to go forward and I appeal to the Minister to make a concession to us on that point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator O'Toole in his remarks. The Minister's response is actually supportive of the argument on this side of the House. The fact that the funding is in place is very welcome and indicates, in theory at least, the commitment of the Government to ensure that this legislation is implemented. I do not think anybody would question the Minister's personal commitment to seeing it implemented.</P>
      <P>However, we know from our own experience that unless something is written down and tied into legislation, it is not enough to rely on aspiration or goodwill. There have been too many examples of Bills being passed which have not been implemented, or not implemented early enough. We are all on the same wavelength on this. We all want to see the Bill enacted as soon as possible. That is the thinking behind this amendment and I support Senator O'Toole in asking the Minister to accept it.</P>

      <P>I was rather confused when I saw yesterday that this amendment was listed under my name before subsequently appearing as a Government amendment. I am sure the Minister agrees with the point raised on Second Stage, but I reiterate that this same issue arose in relation to the case of Jamie Sinnott <i>v.</i> the Minister for Education and Science.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within the context of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, there is flexi<Col N="526" /> bility to allow Irish law to treat persons over the age of 18 years as adults. The issue of marriage is peculiar in this respect, in that the minimum age at which a person can marry has, since 1996, been 18, but in special circumstances younger people can marry, with the permission of the Circuit Court. Such young people are very vulnerable up to the age of 18 and I am glad the Minister saw fit to address this issue since Second Stage. It makes for a much clearer definition and is more protective of children.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 9, subsection (1), line 44, after &ldquo;promote&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and protect&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister of State will accept this amendment as the Bill is concerned not just with promotion, but with protection. The 1989 UN Convention on the Rights of the Child recognised that children are vulnerable and in need of protection. I can envisage the promotion of children's rights in a specific area, but protection is very much part of the Child Care Act, 1991, on which I spoke in the House. That Act began the protective process for children at risk and in need of protection.</P>
      <P>Surely one of the ombudsman's responsibilities will be to protect children's rights. This issue was commented on by the Committee on the Rights of the Child, established under the Commission on the Rights of the Child in February 1998. I have strong feelings about this issue and I do not understand why it would create a problem to include the role of protection. The protection of children's rights is even more important than the promotion of those rights. Promotion is important, but I would have thought the role of the ombudsman would be one of protecting rights.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to accept this amendment as the role of the ombudsman is not to protect. The role we are proposing for the ombudsman is far wider than in most other jurisdictions where such an office is being introduced. Our proposal includes promotional and investigatory roles.</P>
      <P>The onus of protecting children cannot be placed on the ombudsman. That onus has to be on parents, the health boards, the courts and society and it would be an unnecessary burden to place it on the ombudsman. In a general sense, the ombudsman will carry out this function in promoting the rights and welfare of children, but it would not be appropriate to place the onus of protecting children on an ombudsman.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason for establishing the office of the Ombudsman for Children is, as the Minister of State pointed out, because of failures in the system. Such failures may be in the courts and we referred recently to Mr. Justice Kelly. The whole point of introducing this office is to provide protection. Promotion is fine, but the aspiration of the ombudsman is surely one of protection because of the failure of existing systems to do so. One can refer to health boards and courts, but they have failed. We were looking forward to the fact that there would be an independent ombudsman to provide such protection. Promotion and protection go hand in hand.</P>
      <P>I have strong feelings about this issue as the amendment would not place an undue onus on the ombudsman in terms of the overall Bill which confers significant duties on the office. Later in this debate I will raise another issue regarding the Minister's intervention which I do not accept. The role of the ombudsman will be important in terms of the protection of the rights of children. I might have a different perspective if this legislation referred to adults, but children are so vulnerable that the ombudsman may be the only person there for the child when other bodies have failed. I regard protecting the rights of children as part and parcel of the ombudsman's responsibilities and terms of reference.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State and Senator Jackman are referring to different things. Senator Jackman is not seeking the protection of children, but the protection of the rights and welfare of children. This issue does not specifically arise under the health boards, whatever about the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Henry made the point I wished to make in that there is a difference between protecting children and protecting the rights of children. This legislation was referred to on Second Stage and in the media as providing for the appointment of a children's champion. Incidents and events over the past number of years have given rise to the call for the establishment of an independent office of a champion for <Col N="529" /> children because those people and agencies to which the Minister of State referred &ndash; parents, society, the health boards, the courts and other agencies &ndash; have, in some instances, failed children. There is a need for someone independent of the system to ensure that the rights of children are promoted, as provided for in the legislation, but also that those rights are protected. Hopefully those rights will also be enhanced. We will discuss this issue later in the debate when dealing with broader amendments regarding the full role of the ombudsman. Does that role go far enough to ensure that the ombudsman can be a true champion for children and the true protector of their rights? This amendment is important in terms of ensuring that the ombudsman is able to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot add the word &ldquo;protect&rdquo; to the Bill. The role of protection is understood in so far as the ombudsman can investigate matters. There is also a certain element of protection in terms of promotion. However, there are groups such as the health boards which have a statutory duty and responsibility to protect children and their welfare. By inserting the word &ldquo;protect&rdquo; in <Col N="530" /> the Bill and placing the onus on the ombudsman, would that mean, for example, that he or she would be responsible for placing a child somewhere else if he or she discovered that a health board was failing to protect the welfare of a child in foster care? That would constitute an unnecessary burden which cannot be backed up.</P>
      <P>In reality, the ombudsman will protect children's rights by promotion and investigation. However, to include in the legislation that the ombudsman was responsible for protecting the rights or the welfare of an individual child, or of children, could cross over other services. An additional voice would not be an additional help. Senators should bear in mind my closing comments last week to the effect that the ombudsman is not the solution to every problem in society regarding children. The ombudsman will have a particular role. We are setting out that dual role of promotion and investigation, but not protection. Those whose job it is to protect should do so. The ombudsman will ensure that they do so.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Under section 7(6), the terms of reference of the ombudsman can only refer to protocols for the time being in force in the State, which means that any protocol not ratified by the State cannot be included. We have already debated the role of the ombudsman in promoting the rights of children and the Minister of State clearly indicated that, under this legislation, it is the role and duty of the ombudsman to promote them. However, the role of the ombudsman should not be limited to protocols currently in operation because, unfortunately, many have not been ratified by the State. <Col N="531" /> This includes many protocols relating to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, such as the protocol on child soldiers. That would not have the same relevance in this country but the principle is an important one. That is the thinking behind this amendment.</P>

If and when those are ratified by the country they will then become part of the promotional role of the ombudsman but it is designed so that only those which have the force of law in this country will be the subject of promotion by the Ombudsman for Children. I do not propose to accept this amendment.</P>

Where there are protocols which do not have the effect of law in this country he would not then be promoting those. If they are ratified they become part of it. Otherwise one would be extending the remit of the ombudsman to deal with issues affecting other countries and which may not apply or be relevant to children here. He will have enough to do to deal with matters which have the effect of law here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 11, between lines 9 and 10, to insert the following new subparagraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(i) taken in circumstances which gives rise to a failure to meet the fundamental rights of the child, in particular where such failure gives rise to an urgent need,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to section 8, which is a very important section as it deals with complaints against public bodies, such as schools and voluntary hospitals. This is clearly a fundamental and central part of the legislation and one we all welcomed very strongly when discussing the Bill last week. It is central to the workings of the Office of the Ombudsman for Children when it is in place.</P>
      <P>I told a class in a secondary school in Nenagh about this Bill, trying to increase our relevance to the lives of non-voters and under 18s. When I told them we were setting up this office the news was greeted very positively. They also welcomed the fact that the office would accept complaints against public bodies such as schools and voluntary hospitals. The spirit of this amendment aims to strengthen the fundamental principles of the section.</P>
      <P>The amendment seeks to insert a new subparagraph, which states: &ldquo;(i) taken in circumstances which give rise to a failure to meet the fundamental rights of the child, in particular where such failure gives rise to an urgent need,&rdquo; and would be inserted between lines 9 and 10. The amendment would extend the role of the ombudsman to address an issue I raised on Second Stage last week, which Senator Jackman referred to earlier.</P>
      <P>This relates to incidents in which the State fails to meet the fundamental rights of the child, particularly where such failure gives rise to an urgent need, as the amendment states. I said last week that the failure of the State to meet the needs of children, particularly in urgent circumstances, must be seen as a basis of complaint and part of the fundamental work of the ombudsman. Otherwise we are excluding a whole area which has given rise to large scale public concern in recent years, specifically where children are involved in crises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After debating this last week I went home and read the local newspaper. The front page story concerned what was termed an out of control child, a 13 year old who was before the courts having engaged in activities which had led to his arrest, including driving a car at 90 miles per hour through villages. Evidence was given in court that he had attention deficit disorder and his mother, present in court, begged the judge to have him taken into care, but the judge said there was nowhere to send him. We know this is not an isolated case. Some judges have been very vocal on this issue and have commented on the State's failure to provide sufficient places for children. I know the Minister of State has done Trojan work <Col N="533" /> on this issue but we have some distance to go to have services put in place which meet the needs of the child to which I referred. Clearly those services are not in place.</P>
    <P>I made the point last week and I reiterate that unless the brief of the ombudsman is extended to monitor cases where the State is not providing a service that a child clearly needs, we have to question the effectiveness of the ombudsman's office and whether that office can be the true champion of children. There are expectations abroad, particularly when communities hear stories such as the one I have instanced, that in setting up an independent body, the body would have powers not only of investigation but, in certain circumstances, to intervene and say that something must be done if a child's fundamental rights are not being upheld, if a child is in need of a particular service or of professional help or if a child's parent cannot cope and asks the State, via a judge, to provide a service. If the ombudsman does not have a role there, we are failing in our duty. I know the Minister of State will say the health board has authority here and that there are other institutions involved, but when there is a failure who has the power to intervene?</P>
    <P>We are all familiar with the Office of the Ombudsman proper, which has been established for a number of years. A fundamental aspect of that office is the independent monitoring role of the Ombudsman, the power to say that something is not good enough, whether that relates to the Department of Social. Community and Family Affairs or another Department. The Ombudsman has the power and authority to publicly state that the manner in which the State agency is behaving, or not behaving, does not meet the standards expected by the Oireachtas or the public. I would have thought that the same principle should apply here; the expectation is that it would apply. This is the basis for this amendment and it is fundamental to the operation of the office. Without it, the office would be weaker than we want and the public expects.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator's point would be covered in this case by the failure of the health board to provide a service. It would be covered by section 8(3), where the action is as a result of negligence, particularly in the type of cases the Senator raised. The example Senator O'Meara gave would be an obvious one where the ombudsman would be able to investigate the failure of the health board to provide for the child and was negligent in its statutory role, set out in the Child Care Act, 1991. It is covered because the ombudsman can investigate, carry out an examination and make recommendations. This is the type of thing he should and will do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should not lose sight of the principle which we agreed to last year regarding the Children Act, namely, that detention should be used only as a last resort. I am not referring to any cases in particular, but I am not happy to see people try<Col N="534" /> ing to lock up 13 year olds. I fully accept that services have to be put in place for families and communities locally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator O'Meara's amendment and relate it specifically to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD. The Minister said that the ombudsman's remit is not confined to health boards and I know it will extend to the investigation of schools. I know two children who are serving prison sentences because this disorder was not detected. Eventually their behaviour was such that they ended up in prison. They did not understand the consequences of their behaviour. That is part of the attendant diminished sense of responsibility. Until now, the Department of Education and Science did not have any way of dealing with this problem.</P>
      <P>I understand why the Minister would be concerned about the extended role of the ombudsman as we are talking about children. Cases will come before the ombudsman and we want to know that he or she has the power to look beyond the school at the tremendous difficulties facing parents and children at risk. The children may be aged 13 or under and their parents and social workers can see that they are on their way to prison not through their own fault, but because they suffer from a condition which is not being treated. These issues will come before the ombudsman because of the distress caused to those involved.</P>
      <P>As Senator O'Meara said, a particular parent wanted her child placed in care because she knew she was not offering the child the best help. It would have been impossible to do so; she was not a trained expert. We will find that the ombudsman has to deal with these issues more and more. It will not be helpful for us to discover that we should have extended the remit when we were debating the issue. It is something the Minister will have to consider.</P>
      <P>That is just one issue; we could talk about other disorders. As a teacher, I am very much aware of cases that emerge repeatedly. They are highlighted in the mid-west because of the support of parents, not the health boards, who raised the issue. The Minister of State was a teacher and I am sure that, with hindsight, she may be able to detect those who suffered from ADHD. Knowledge of the condition did not exist until recently.</P>

      <P>It is important that we continue to remind ourselves of what the ombudsman will do. He will investigate complaints against public bodies for actions taken in the performance of their administrative functions or, as I pointed out, for negligence or carelessness. The ombudsman cannot replace the Oireachtas. He will not be responsible for policies, investment, capital expenditure or any of the things for which we in these Houses are responsible. He can highlight issues, but the Department of Education and Science is setting up the special education agency. The Govern<Col N="535" /> ment will allocate resources for that; it is not the job of the ombudsman. Where people are failing in their administrative duties, as set out by legislation, the ombudsman will investigate. Let us not think that he will be the panacea for all ills because he will not.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Minister that the ombudsman will not replace the Oireachtas or Departments. The role of the ombudsman is very different. It relates to accountability as well as being a championing role. I am clear on that and I do not suggest that the ombudsman should displace the role of other State agencies and institutions. The amendment seeks to underline the power and role of the ombudsman. It does not seek to alter or widen it.</P>
      <P>I partially accept what the Minister said about section 8(3) and the results of negligence or carelessness. My amendment strengthens and underlines that aspect. It refers to the fundamental rights of the child, particularly where such failure gives rise to an urgent need. It would aid and assist the role the Bill intends the ombudsman to have.</P>

      <P>It is unfortunate to have to insert a word such as &ldquo;malicious&rdquo;. Complaints can be trivial and vexatious, but they can also be malicious and this amendment is unfortunate but necessary. &ldquo;Malicious&rdquo; means trying to do harm to someone, &ldquo;trivial&rdquo; means of very little importance and &ldquo;vexatious&rdquo; means to be a nuisance. People could make complaints which attempt to do harm to the person about whom the complaint is lodged. I regret that a word like this has to be used, but unfortunately this is the kind of society in which we now live.</P>

      <P>I do not consider &ldquo;malicious&rdquo; to be necessary in this context. &ldquo;Malicious&rdquo; is often <Col N="536" /> used in complaints against an individual whereas we are dealing with complaints against public bodies. I believe &ldquo;vexatious&rdquo; covers that point. The same problem as in the previous amendment of defining &ldquo;malicious&rdquo; would arise. In whose eyes is it malicious? The word &ldquo;vexatious&rdquo; covers it because it is a public body, but it would be different in the case of individuals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 14, before section 11, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&ndash;Notwithstanding the terms of section 11(1)(<i>a</i>), the Ombudsman may apply to intervene in any court proceedings involving the welfare of a child as an <i>amicus curiae</i>, and may furthermore initiate such proceedings as it considers necessary for the exercise of his or her functions.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Our concern is that, while one can understand the need to delineate between the role of the Ombudsman for Children and the operations of the courts, children should be adequately represented, as is the case in many jurisdictions. The purpose of the amendment is to allow the ombudsman to intervene in court proceedings where he or she believes that it is in a child's interests to do so. It is not prescriptive or a requirement to do so always, but to leave this possibility open. The legal profession is not perfect and sometimes a child's representation might not be adequate or the parents might not act properly.</P>
      <P>In my native city, there was a horrific case in which an 11 year old girl was made pregnant by a local man and the child's mother did not wish to prosecute so as to spare the &ldquo;poor man&rdquo; a court appearance. In such a case, there is an overwhelming public need to provide further support for a child. I do not seek to make this rancorous, but suggest that the otherwise reasonable separation of the ombudsman and the courts could be breached by giving the former the right to intervene if deemed necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not accept this amendment. There is already in place the system of the guardian <i>ad litem</i> to be a voice for a child in court. It has run for many years and will be reviewed under the national children's strategy. That system is there to provide a voice for children and <Col N="537" /> the ombudsman should not be involved in individual cases in court.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was by dint of blood, sweat and tears in this House that the position of guardian <i>ad litem</i> was included in the Children Bill by the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, when he was the responsible Minister. However, this position is not identical to what is being proposed. Where the ombudsman is satisfied that a guardian <i>ad litem</i> has been appointed and there is no need to intervene, he or she would not do so. However, why should it be excluded under all circumstances? This is a clause to enable the ombudsman, where he or she sees fit, to act. We can rely on the discretion of the person of high quality, whom we expect to be appointed, not to use this right in a way that would cause problems for the administration of justice, the rights of children or in any other way. It is a pity the Minister is reluctant to accept this restrained, limited amendment.</P>

      <P>I can understand the Minister's point of view, but the type of case referred to by Senator Ryan illustrates his argument. How can a child in such a situation take a case at present? Cases are taken by parents on behalf of children and one must reach the court before a guardian <i>ad litem</i> is appointed. The Senator's proposal is that the ombudsman could initiate the case.</P>

      <P>I am very anxious that the voice of the child is heard at all levels. It is preferable that it is done directly rather than through another legal team appearing, which would be the result of this amendment. We would have legal teams, a guardian <i>ad litem</i> and an <i>amicus curiae</i>, which would not add to the proceedings. The Senator's proposal can be viewed in the context of the review of the guardian <i>ad litem</i> system in which the best way to protect children will be considered. However, the ombudsman should not get involved in legal proceedings.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 15, subsection (1), lines 11 to 22, to delete paragraph (<i>e</i>).</P>
      <P>Section 11 deals with exclusions, one of which is an action taken by a public body, school, or voluntary hospital, if taken in relation to the law relating to asylum, immigration, naturalisation or citizenship, or if the action is one involving the exercise of right or power referred to in Article 13.6 of the Constitution or taken in the administration of the prisons or other places of custody or detention of children committed into custody or detention by the courts other than reformatory schools. I do not understand why this is so. Children applying for citizenship, particularly under Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution, have a presumption of citizenship if born on the island of Ireland and, therefore, to suggest that the ombudsman should not have a right to investigate actions which might affect the exercise of that right is extraordinary.</P>
      <P>Children's prisons are a particularly sensitive area. A huge amount of evidence shows that society achieves very little by locking children up in prisons and that by imprisoning children, however infuriating or appalling their behaviour is, the overwhelming consequence is that they offend again. Children's prisons are academies for graduating from a child criminal to an adult criminal. That has always been the case.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to have a rational discussion about issues to do with crime, punishment, etc., but to preclude the ombudsman from investigating issues like that is to make it even more difficult to have rational discussion because of the understandable frenzy that is sometimes whipped up about criminal activities involving children. That type of frenzy makes it impossible for the political system to deal rationally with the issue and, therefore, the role of an independent individual such as an ombudsman is even more important in the case of prisons.</P>
      <P>Also, dare I say it, following some of the comments made by a colleague of the Minister of State on the issue of immigrants and citizenship, it is difficult for politicians in Cork to talk rationally and dispassionately about these issues. There is an urgent need to have some body or individual, independent of the political system, in a position to talk rational common sense because it is particularly scarce in my home city at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>We touched on this issue during the Second Stage debate and I hope the Minister of State will be able to offer some clarification. The amendments propose to delete paragraphs because we are talking about discrimination against two vulnerable groups of children who are given a separate status and denied access to the Ombudsman for Children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="539" />I understand the point about the ombudsman not having a role in the granting of status to asylum seeking children, but there are many areas in which the ombudsman could intervene in terms of provision. Excluding everything in this case is not good enough and I hope the Minister of State will reply to the effect that these children can have redress in regard to certain issues such as official decisions on their treatment, and not necessarily on the granting of citizenship.</P>
    <P>I am particularly concerned about the exclusion of children who find themselves in prison because there are not suitable placements for them. We may be talking about only one or two children, but it is one or two too many. These children have the right to redress, particularly as they are inappropriately placed in the first instance. They should be the first group about which the Minister of State should be concerned. As stated on Second Stage, Mr. Justice Peter Kelly has been the lone voice in terms of the treatment of these children. Where do they end up? They end up in prison. That should not be the case because they are the most vulnerable in terms of redress.</P>
    <P>I note from research that there is a fairly strict regime in terms of the duties of the ombudsman in New Zealand which have been extended to cover children in prison, so there is precedent in other jurisdictions. I hope the Minister of State will come back positively on these issues which we raised on Second Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to understand the reason children in places of detention are being excluded. I have grave concerns about it, but I am even more concerned about children who may be asylum seekers, particularly in view of the fact that more and more unaccompanied minors are coming to this country. It is important, therefore, that they should be in a position to appeal to the ombudsman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>There may have been a misinterpretation of what is provided for the two separate groups in the Bill. In relation to the administration of the law as it affects asylum seekers, the laws we are talking about are the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended by the Immigration Act, 1999, and the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act, 2000, as commenced in full on 20 November 2000, meeting our obligations under the Geneva Convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Act places the procedures for processing applications for refugee status on a statutory footing. There are two independent statutory offices for the processing of asylum applications. The refugee applications commissioner makes recommendations to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform as to whether they should be granted or refused refugee status. There is also the refugee appeals tribunal whose individual independent members deal with appeals against <Col N="540" /> negative recommendations. There is also a chairperson whose role is to allocate work and develop a system of quality control as well as hearings.</P>
    <P>What we are saying in this section is that there should not be any duplication of the appeals process or review of the decisions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>If, however, there are problems in relation to delays, the provision of accommodation, nutrition, housing, etc, those issues are covered. This provision is only to ensure there is not a duplication of the actual process of the administration of the law.</P>
      <P>In relation to the unaccompanied minors, whose numbers are growing substantially, they are immediately placed under the care of the health boards, which are covered specifically as public bodies. I have checked this carefully with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Its intention is that only the final decision is covered, in other words, the administration of the law and not the provision of services surrounding their being in this country.</P>
      <P>In relation to children in prisons, the Senators will know that when the Children Act is enforced, it will be illegal for children to be held in inappropriate places. For example, a non-offender cannot be held in an offender's unit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>That would remove that issue from this section. What would be covered is the type of issue that Senator Jackman spoke about, namely, the failure of the health board which led to the child being placed in prison in the first instance. That is already covered because an action would be taken against a health board for failing to provide the suitable service. However, it would not cover young people between the ages of 16 and 18 who are legitimately in a place like St. Patrick's Institution by virtue of their being offenders, which would come under the prison system. The prison system is outside the remit of the general Ombudsman, as is the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform because there are statutory systems in place for dealing with complaints. There are visiting committees and there is now the inspection of prisons, which is on a statutory basis and covers complaints. That is the reason it was necessary to keep it separate and not have any duplication. That would stop the ombudsman having a strong promotional role in relation to standards or conditions generally for young people who would be in those situations, but it is specifically excluded here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the concerns of people in relation to this area and I am continuing to talk to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform about it. I am not sure what further progress I can make but I will try to come back to <Col N="541" /> the Senators on it. The point on asylum seekers is quite clear, but I will determine if we need further clarification from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform on the remand centres.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to explore a little of the Minister of State's logic. She is a very intelligent woman and she would want to be very wary of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It is not a Department which welcomes scrutiny of any of its activities and it likes to have everything it does within its own compass. Many Departments are not madly keen on the Ombudsman. The evidence of the Ombudsman, and I use this merely as an illustration, on the question of nursing care for elderly people and the extraordinary delays in that regard where the Department of Health and Children effectively ignored the Ombudsman for the best part of 12 months, even though he was perfectly entitled to be involved, suggests that we ought to be careful when Departments express a benevolent reason to keep somebody like an Ombudsman out of their ambit.</P>
      <P>I do not want to suggest that the ombudsman should take over the role of the appeals function. That is not what happened, say, in the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs where there is a large and elaborate appeals procedure. The social welfare appeals system has been dramatically improved by a number of Ministers over the past ten to 15 years. The fact that there is an appeals system within the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, which is a good deal more independent in perception and reality than it was 15 years ago, does not preclude the ombudsman from investigating the way it deals with cases. The ombudsman will continue to investigate matters such as delays which are a major problem. No one is suggesting that the ombudsman in dealing with issues of immigration, naturalisation or citizenship would attempt to second-guess the procedures set down in law for dealing with these matters, which are far too generous to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in terms of accountability.</P>
      <P>A young Japanese man I knew in Cork waited three years to get an application for naturalisation approved and all that time he was told it was being processed and that when his case was reached it would be dealt with. In the meantime he was left hanging in mid air. He was Japanese by extraction &ndash; his first language was English and his second language was Japanese. The immigration service talked to him about his having to go home if he did not get his case sorted out. He would have had to go home to a country where the language spoken was his second language. He had been living in Cork since he was five years old. I am glad to say that he is now an Irish citizen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an issue regarding the delay in dealing with cases. One cannot allow the administration <Col N="542" /> of the law to proceed at the pace that suits public bodies, which is a case of the old cliché of justice delayed. Dealing with this area is an appropriate role for the ombudsman. He or she should not have to second-guess the body that is given the legal obligation to deal with a matter, but the ombudsman should ensure that the pace at which that body does its business is fair to the person awaiting the outcome. That is what the role of the ombudsman for children should be. That is where the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is being disingenuous to the Minister of State.</P>
    <P>Nobody is suggesting that the ombudsman should take over the role of dealing with appeals and other such matters, but he or she should ensure that such matters are dealt with expeditiously and that queues do not lengthen because numbers increase. If that happens, we will end up with a similar situation to the awful scene that horrified the nation, including people of all political persuasions, of a queue of people along St. Stephen's Green on a wet Saturday afternoon. That happened because somebody had not thought about the resource implications involved. It is the role of an ombudsman to make sure that the law is administered fairly, and one of the principles of doing that is to ensure that it is done expeditiously. That bears no relationship to the response the Minister of State gave, which was to do with there not being parallel jurisdictions on which we all agree.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a danger that we may forget we are talking about children. Asylum seekers do not have much of a voice on the issue of the lack of education, which occurs if they are held for a long time. We are talking about their future and they should have access to redress. I am concerned about their status. We are not meant to discriminate against them, but suddenly they are being excluded. Some people who read this Bill thought they were excluded. I know what the Minister of State said, but she admitted the other day that the Bill gave the impression that such a group do not have a means of redress in this regard. Asylum seekers might instantly ask how they could do something to have their application processed, but we are not talking about that. We are talking about the myriad of difficulties to which young asylum seekers are subjected.</P>
      <P>I think the prisoner issue can be dealt with because it involves a specific number of people. The issue of young asylum seekers needs to be addressed, given that the issue of adult asylum seekers is not being addressed. The children of asylum seekers are the vulnerable group in terms of this Bill.</P>

      <P>With regard to what Senator Ryan said, there is a distinction between the social welfare appeals system and the refugee appeals system in that one is an internal process and the other is a statutorily independent process. From <Col N="543" /> my discussions with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, my understanding is that matters such as delays can be examined by the ombudsman. It has specifically said that the delays in the Department arise only due to determining the results and decisions of the process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I say again to the Minister of State that she should beware of the Greeks when they come bearing gifts. She should be wary of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform when it is pretending to be benevolent. Most of us have unfortunate experiences of that. The Department has a view of the world that is different from that of the rest of us. If an action taken in the administration of the law is excluded, an inaction taken in the administration of the law is also excluded. By any logic or understanding of the English language, if actions are excluded, inactions are also excluded. That is what a delay is. It is not doing something that one is supposed to do.</P>
      <P>I do not accept that what the Minister of State has been told by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is a valid interpretation of the matter. I predict that if the Ombudsman for Children tries to get involved in some of these matters, the ombudsman will be sent away with his or her tail between his or her legs by the Department which would say that under this section of the Bill the ombudsman has no function. If the phrase &ldquo;administration of the law&rdquo; was different, we could talk about it, but that is the phrase mentioned. I accept the Minister of State's bona fides. I am aware of her commitment to children, I am not arguing about that, but I do not accept that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is as benevolent as she seems to believe it is.</P>

      <P>In page 16, lines 6 to 19, to delete subsection (3).</P>
      <P>An equivalent paragraph is contained in the Ombudsman Act. That is one line of defence from which we can move on. I did not agree with this in the Ombudsman Act, but there was an argument about the Ombudsman's role generally relating to commercial sensitivity, perhaps, or national security and, therefore, that there could be an arguable case &ndash; although I would not share it &ndash; for a Minister being in a position to direct the Ombudsman to cease an investigation.</P>
      <P>I invite the Minister of State to give an example of where some overwhelming need would demand that a Minister should direct the Ombudsman for Children to cease an investigation. I do not believe one exists. I believe the parliamentary counsel decided to include this section because it was contained in the other Act. I cannot imagine circumstances in which a Government Minister would need to direct the Ombudsman for Children not to carry out an investigation. One can accept there could be circumstances under which a Government Department would not accept the conclusions of an investigation for financial reasons or whatever. However, I cannot accept that an Ombudsman for Children with his or her fairly clear and limited, though important, functions could ever do something which would be so inimical to some public good, such as national security, the public finances or any of the usual ones mentioned, that it could ever be possible that a Minister would give such a directive.</P>
      <P>I invite the Minister of State not to tell me what I know already, which is that a similar provision is contained in the Ombudsman Act, but what circumstances are envisaged where such a directive might be necessary?</P>

      <P>As it is contained in the Ombudsman Act, I checked the reason for it. Apparently its effect is twofold &ndash; to give protection to the Ombudsman and to give protection to the Minister. It provides protection to a Minister to prevent an investigation into any matter for which the Minister would be accountable to the Houses of the Oireachtas so that there would not be interference in the role of the Minister. More particularly, it affords protection to the Ombudsman in the event of a Minister interfering and seeking to have an investigation stopped. Therefore, the Bill has to provide for full and public disclosure about it. Apparently the reason for it in the Ombudsman Act and why it is included in this Bill is to prevent an errant Minister or an errant Ombudsman having unfettered influence in particular matters. Incidentally, it has never been used.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>I could never envisage a situation where I, as a Minister, would ask an Ombudsman not to investigate something. The thinking behind it was that it provided dual protection. In the event of an interfering Minister, by law, the Ombudsman would have to be able to give full disclosure as to who said what to him, who was trying to interfere with his work, who was trying to affect his statutory independence and at the same time protect any Minister of the Government in his relationship with the Oireachtas. Although the safeguard has not been used, the recommendation is that it should be provided for in this Bill also.</P>

      <P>It might be. At the risk of sounding very ancient, I was in the House when the original legislation was introduced, back in the mists of time when, I suspect, the Minister of State had much better things to do with her life than be here. The fact that it has never been used suggests we do not need it. The Bill specifically provides that the ombudsman shall exercise his or her functions independently. Therefore, everybody is precluded from trying to stop the ombudsman carrying out a particular investigation, particularly those in bodies other than Government Departments. For example, where the ombudsman decides to investigate a voluntary hospital, nobody in the voluntary hospital can stop the ombudsman from doing it; only a Government Minister can do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept it is much better that the Minister has to do so in writing. Most people do not think that Ireland should be a country, governed by law, where Ministers could pick up the telephone and tell the Ombudsman to stop investigations because he or she did not like them. This is not the way most of us believe the country operates. <Col N="546" /> The Ombudsmen of whom I have been aware, starting with Michael Mills, are not the type of people who would have taken that from any Minister if the Minister did not have the statutory power to do so. In the case of the Ombudsman of whom I have been aware in my adult life, if any Government Minister attempted to do something like that, the issue would become a matter of public controversy so quickly that the Minister in question would retreat.</P>
    <P>This provision gives power to a Minister which might invite interference on some occasions. This has to be viewed in the context of the almost tooth extracting painfulness of getting information from the Department of Education and Science about files on the abuse of children. The struggles of my former colleague, Pat Gallagher, to get access to Department of Education and Science files on abuse of children in County Offaly did not suggest a huge enthusiasm for investigation by anybody into past history. History is history and I do not blame anybody in Government or the Department of Education and Science for what happened 40 years ago. However, the reluctance to facilitate the investigation is encouraged by sections like this. The Minister of State should look at this again and consider if something much more focused, if anything, should be included. I do not believe there is a need, particularly when dealing with children, for a Government Minister to be able to issue a directive and stop the ombudsman from carrying out his investigation. That is the purpose of the amendment.</P>

      <P>I sympathise with what Senator Ryan said. I could not envisage a situation where it would happen. It is interesting to note that in our discussions with the Office of the Ombudsman, it was suggested that the provision be kept for its protection also. I will certainly go back and discuss the matter with both sides but it was interesting that the Office of the Ombudsman considered its inclusion was a protection for it, which is the reason I am not accepting the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 17:</P>
      <P>In page 16, subsection (3), line 19, after &ldquo;State)&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;unless the Ombudsman for Children determines that to investigate or to continue to investigate an action would be in the best interest of the child&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is similar to the case made by Senator Ryan. It concerns the amount of power given to the Minister to stop investigations. The ombudsman can report directly to the Oireachtas and is independent of the Government. Ministers have a veto over investigations into public bodies, such as schools and voluntary hospitals. He or she need only send a written request to the ombudsman. I would have thought the independence of <Col N="547" /> the ombudsman was the most important aspect. The Minister of State has repeatedly stated that children come first, or put simply, children matter.</P>
    <P>As we are talking about children, should we retain the right to commence or to proceed with an investigation given that the ombudsman has had the time to investigate the particular issue and has brought it through? The Minister could step in and all the work of the ombudsman would be left aside. Since the ombudsman would be aware of the issues involved, he or she should determine whether to proceed and if it would be in the best interests of the child. That is extremely important and I am surprised so much power is vested in Ministers to stop investigations.</P>

The existing Ombudsman deals with public bodies, but this ombudsman's brief extends <Col N="548" /> beyond public bodies. We may run into constitutional difficulties and issues of fairness may be raised. I do not suggest that we should extend this provision to schools or voluntary hospitals, but rather that to put in what looks like a protection for public bodies, while saying that no such protection will apply to schools or voluntary hospitals, amounts to an invitation to litigation.</P>

      <P>Going back to the two reasons I gave, the difference is that while the Minister will be responsible to the Oireachtas for Departments and public bodies, he or she will not be responsible for voluntary bodies and schools. That is why such bodies are excluded. Two protections were mentioned; the protection of the accountability of the Minister to the Oireachtas and the protection of the independence of the Ombudsman for Children. The Minister is not responsible for voluntary hospitals or schools, which is why they are not included in this section of the Bill.

If I want to ask why an assistant teacher has not been appointed to a two-teacher school in a remote part of west Kerry, I can raise the matter on the Adjournment and the Minister for Education and Science, who is accountable, will have to come to the House to discuss it. I do not understand how actions which can be investigated by the ombudsman cannot be, in a similar manner, held to account before the Oireachtas. We have had many discussions in this House about the provision of facilities in voluntary hospitals, especially in relation to how they fit in to the overall provision of health care. I am not convinced we need the distinction the Minister has made. It may be that schools and voluntary hospitals were simply forgotten; it happens more and more often that we are given a <i>post hoc</i> justification in such cases, although I may be wrong.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 18:</P>
      <P>In page 18, between lines 41 and 42, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(9) The Ombudsman for Children may as <i>amicus curiae</i>, on his or her own initiative, refer a case to the High Court, or the Supreme Court when exercising its appellate jurisdiction, in respect of the contravention of a right of a child in so far as it affects the rights of all children.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This quite specific amendment relates to an issue which came up earlier in a different guise. I do not see any difficulty in allowing the Ombudsman for Children to refer a case to the High Court or the Supreme Court if a certain matter arises, for example an important point or principle of law. The Bill should be extended to give the right of court referral to the ombudsman in important cases of policy which may affect child law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is related to a previous one which mentioned the <i>amicus curiae</i> and to the argument we had about protection. I do not see the ombudsman's role as being that of a legal officer and he or she should not have to determine whether or not something should go before the courts, as there are enough bodies and groups performing that function already. I do not envisage the Ombudsman for Children having a legal wing or deciding what should go before the courts. I am content to allow each group follow its own priorities. While the ombudsman will criticise and make recommendations or proposals in relation to those not doing their jobs, he will not take over their jobs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>In many cases, the Ombudsman for Children will take over the jobs because the system has failed up to now. The structures we have put in place should be able to deal with these issues. It is almost as if the Minister of State has cut the powers of the ombudsman at a certain point, which is a shame as he or she will be <i>au fait</i> with the issues. The ombudsman will seek legal advice and will be aware of the legal ramifications; he or she will not refer cases willy-nilly. It may be necessary to give the ombudsman this role. We should constantly underline that we are dealing with the rights of children, who are far more vulnerable than adults who have recourse to various systems. I ask the Minister of State to consider my amendment in the light of the arguments we have made, as each one impinges on the next. The role of the Ombudsman for Children will be far more crucial than that of the current Ombudsman, as he or she will be responsible for human interaction with vulnerable children.</P>

Is that provision widespread in legislation? I am not aware of it. I do not recall seeing the concept of absolute privilege being written down anywhere except in connection with the utterances of Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas.

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yet again we have an example of something that is beginning to arise in legislation in recent years. Section 18 deals with appearances before the Committee of Public Accounts. Subsection (2) states:</P>
      <P>In the performance of his or her duties under this section, the Ombudsman for Children shall not question or express an opinion on the merits of any policy of the Government or a Minister of the Government or on the merits of the objectives of such a policy.</P>
      <P>We have been through this on a succession of Bills and in most cases the Ministers involved have agreed to withdraw that provision. The ombudsman could say that the Opposition's policies were daft or that the policies of professionals in the field were daft, yet would have to remain silent about Government policy. I am not suggesting it would happen but that is what it would mean.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not wise for an ombudsman to put himself into a position of confrontation with the Government of the day. However, we should not silence <Col N="552" /> the ombudsman. Most of our Ombudsmen have been tactful, sensible people who do not get involved in unnecessary politicised confrontations. However, that is different from saying they should be prohibited by law from expressing such an opinion. We went through this in the House with the Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise, Deputy Jacob, who promptly accepted that it was a silly subsection. He withdrew it on the grounds that one could not have somebody responsible for promoting sustainable energy go before a Dáil committee and be told that he or she could say nothing about Government policy.</P>
    <P>I suggest the Minister should think about this between now and Report Stage. What it means is that the ombudsman can criticise the courts, the Opposition, statutory bodies, schools, everybody &ndash; the only body the ombudsman cannot criticise is the Government. How is that reconcilable with the fundamental principle that the ombudsman is independent in the exercise of his functions?</P>

      <P>It is only in his attendance before the Committee of Public Accounts that he cannot criticise. He can do it in his promotional role. I do not believe it is the function of any independent body to criticise Governments or Ministers, or indeed the policies of the Opposition. That is what we have Government and Opposition for in the Houses of the Oireachtas. We are answerable to the Houses of the Oireachtas. It serves no valuable purpose for anybody to use the opportunity to come before the Committee of Public Accounts simply for point scoring against the politicians, be they Government or Opposition. If in his promotional role he finds that there are policies in relation to children which should be criticised outside, let him do that there. However, our committee system is not there for outsiders to come in to criticise Members. That is what we have good Government and Opposition for.</P>

Under this subsection he would not be allowed to point out that it was because the Government would not give him enough money. He or she would have to sit there and sing dumb. This is quite unnecessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of our senior public servants, either in State bodies or otherwise, have enough sense not to get involved in head to head confrontations. One would hope Governments would have the same sense, and they usually do. A ridiculous situation could arise whereby he could issue an <Col N="553" /> inflammatory report outside about public policy, come before the Committee of Public Accounts, but be forced to respond to questions by saying, &ldquo;You can read my report but I cannot talk about it here.&rdquo;  It is pointless and should be withdrawn.</P>

      <P>In page 25, to delete line 3.</P>
      <P>This concerns the bodies which are not regarded as public bodies for the purposes of this Bill. We do not understand why the Garda Síochána should be excluded from this. The way the Garda Síochána deal with children is a matter of genuine concern. I do not mean that in the sense that they are doing something wrong, but it a matter for legitimate concern. Many of the other bodies would only have a marginal role in dealing with children and therefore it is probably fair enough. To exclude the Garda Síochána, however, is to leave a large public body out of the remit.</P>
      <P>I have a strong feeling that the Garda Síochána are excluded from the remit of the Ombudsman but this is an entirely different area. My own party's view is that there ought to be an ombudsman for the Garda. If we cannot have that then we believe there is a good case for extending the brief of the Ombudsman for Children to include the activities of the Garda Síochána. There is a need for a different kind of accountability for the Garda Síochána. A structure that was set up in 1922 and hardly changed since cannot accommodate the sort of understanding of public accountability that most citizens of a 21st century state now have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is up to its tricks again, as usual finding ways to exclude itself from difficult issues and excluding fiefdoms as well, as in the case of the Garda Síochána. Our belief is that there is no real reason for that. There is nothing the Garda Síochána do that would be in any way inhibited by the <Col N="554" /> right of an independent figure to monitor how they do their business.</P>

A number of the issues Senator Ryan may be referring to are the types of things that are covered in the Children Act, 2001. Sections of that Act are due to be commenced about the treatment of children in Garda stations and so on. This specifically refers to maladministration The Ombudsman for Children could still use his promotional role in relation to the conduct of administration in the Garda as it relates to children.

      <P>I expressed my concerns on Second Stage about the fact that children in hospitals, particularly those in psychiatric hospitals, do not seem to be under the remit of the Ombudsman for Children. I know there are difficulties regarding private institutions, although such difficulties do not exist when private facilities are used by a public body, for example the Eastern Regional Health Authority.</P>
      <P>Sometimes patients may be admitted in a private capacity to such hospitals and I have heard complaints made by young adults who were admitted to adult institutions, despite the fact that they were children. These young people felt that they had been treated badly, not in terms of the care that they received, but in terms of their overall treatment as children. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, is encouraging the building of private hospitals and I would like to think that it would be possible to add any newly-constructed hospitals to the list that is given in this Bill.

As things stand at the Department of Health and Children, it is not envisaged that additional hospitals within this category will be established and therefore there will be no need for them to be included in the legislation. It is likely that in the future, the voluntary bodies will be coming back into the State system, rather than remaining as private bodies. Unfortunately, there are no cir<Col N="555" /> cumstances in this legislation that would include the strictly private bodies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed with the Minister's response to this issue. There is nothing of fundamental importance here. The Department of Health and Children is attempting to tell us what will happen in the future, and it appears to be telling us with some certainty that it does not envisage a situation arising wherein new hospitals would need to be added to the list.</P>
      <P>We now have the strange position where the Oireachtas wants to retain flexibility for future administrations and the Department itself is refusing to acknowledge the desirability of such a situation. How can the Department of Health and Children possibly know what will happen if my party gets into Government, as I hope it will? Under a Labour Party Government, there will be a fundamental change in the way in which the health services are run. Therefore, the Department of Health and Children would be wise to consider the possibility of people other than the present incumbents running the health service.</P>
      <P>Apart from this, it seems extraordinary that we could not at least legislate for the possibility that a new institution might need to be added to the list. The possibility of having to return to this House with amended legislation to add in the names of other hospitals would constitute a considerable waste of parliamentary time, when a simple amendment, as proposed by Senator Henry could change all that.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Senator Ryan on his splendid contribution to this debate. The Minister should ask the Department of Health and Children to think again, because art is long and time is fleeting and heaven only knows what will happen. I take seriously the urging by the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, to build private hospitals; great tax incentives have been given to promote such projects. In ten years' time, we might well be in a situation where hospitals exist that are not even dreamt of at this moment by the Department of Health and Children.</P>

      <P>The Schedule refers to the public voluntary hospitals, and I think we would all accept that it is highly unlikely that any new hospitals would be established in that sector. Senator Henry is referring to private hospitals and she will be aware from my Second Stage speech that there were significant challenges involved in legislating for voluntary bodies, never mind legislating for private bodies. Private bodies are not included in this legislation at all. We would still be waiting for the legislation if we were to envisage the situation that the Senator describes, which has not occurred anywhere else in the world. Senator Henry's proposed addition to the Schedule does not enhance it, because she refers to private hospitals and there are only three remaining public voluntary hospitals in the <Col N="556" /> country which are not covered by other legislation.</P>

    <Title>Sellafield Nuclear Plant: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann calls on the Minister for Foreign Affairs to summon the British ambassador to accept a formal protest from the Government on the threat to Irish citizens from Sellafield.</P>
      <P>The basis for this motion is the fact that the Government has not been effective in its opposition to Sellafield. I am dubious about whether it is serious about this issue and I will question whether it has achieved anything in this regard.</P>
      <P>The Government is aware of the dangers posed by Sellafield, as is the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, who has expressed this fact on many occasions. However, the Government's effectiveness in countering those dangers has been zero. Protective measures may or may not be in place in the event of a disaster at Sellafield, but there are no measures to prevent such an occurrence.</P>
      <P>I regret that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, who is referred to in this motion, is not in the House. This is indicative of the Government's lack of seriousness about this problem which it hopes will just go away. This motion seeks to bring an end to the cosmetic and ineffective measures the Government is taking. It is based on the fact that we want a serious diplomatic incident to prove that we are serious on behalf of the Irish people about what is going on at Sellafield.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="557" />The Government's amendment is a clear signal of its unacceptable self-satisfaction at what it is doing. The motion calls for a formal protest by the Government by summoning the British ambassador. However, the suggestion behind the amendment is, &ldquo;We are doing very well, thank you, don't rock the boat&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Government has achieved nothing in 20 years of protest or by various attempts to bring the Sellafield authorities to courts in Europe and around the world. The amendment proposes that the House should not call in the British ambassador because, apparently, that would be embarrassing, but that is what we want. We want to send a message to the world that Ireland is serious, capable and willing to rock the boat on this issue and the Government should not seek to amend the motion in this ineffective way.</P>
    <P>I will examine what has been achieved as regards Sellafield and I am interested in the Minister of State's reply to two questions. I hope he will outline what the Government has achieved in its attempts to close Sellafield. How far has it got in this regard? It has achieved nothing and the situation has worsened. The MOX plant is open. We protested about this plant, but the situation worsened. The Government has been to the courts and is in the middle of a cosmetic court case, but this has achieved nothing. I ask the Minister of State to outline what the Government has achieved.</P>
    <P>Let us not have the usual rebut on how much effort the Minister is making. Let us hear why the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, is not bringing in the British ambassador and publicly dressing him down about the dangers posed by Sellafield to the Irish people. Let us have those two issues addressed. I predict that the Minister of State will read another script outlining how hard he is working, but nothing will have been achieved.</P>
    <P>I wish to outline the reasons Sellafield should be closed and why the situation is much more serious than the Government admits. The history of Sellafield is a disaster for Ireland in particular. The first recorded serious radioactive leak occurred in, I think, 1957, but nothing happened. There was a more serious leak in 1976 which was covered up. The contamination caused by that leak is still in Cumbria, but we were never meant to know that it happened. There was an even worse leak in 1978, the contamination from which remains in unused buildings in Sellafield 22 years later. There was also an unauthorised discharge into the Irish Sea in 1983 and an explosion in 1992.</P>
    <P>However, much more serious than the above incidents was the discovery that the authorities at Sellafield falsified the safety records in 1999. This tells us that we are in danger because of negligence and carelessness and that the lives of Irish people are in danger, but luckily this has not happened yet. It also tells us that the authorities at Sellafield are liars and that they falsify records. It tells us that we do not know how bad the situa<Col N="558" /> tion is. We know the situation is, and has been, bad, but we do not know whether we are being told the truth or the whole truth all the time. All we know is that we have been lied to. This leaves us in the dark and vulnerable, yet we have a Government which is engaged in cosmetic shadow boxing with the British Government on this issue.</P>
    <P>In its annual accounts BNFL uses the phrase &ldquo;decommissioning nuclear waste&rdquo;. This is an appropriate phrase, but the decommissioning which is going on is less effective than that taking place in Northern Ireland. I do not know whether people are aware that it takes at least 100 years for this decommissioning process to render nuclear waste harmless. Therefore, even if we stop now, it would take 100 years to remove the dangers posed by the nuclear waste which has been produced.</P>
    <P>BNFL lost £210 million last year. On its balance sheet it includes costs of £16.1 billion for what it calls &ldquo;nuclear liabilities&rdquo;. That is more than half of Ireland's national debt on BNFL's balance sheet in case it cannot eliminate this menace. Like others, I believed the reason for nuclear energy and BNFL was that it was, in some way, more efficient, economic and made more money. However, that is not the case. BNFL is bust; it is subsidised by the British taxpayer and is continually losing money. The company has the extraordinary habit of paying bonuses to its board members. The chief executive gets £350,000 a year and a safety bonus which he has never failed to collect. The idea of someone at Sellafield being paid a safety bonus is quite extraordinary and unacceptable. It is indicative of the unreal world which surrounds Sellafield.</P>
    <P>Not only is Sellafield losing money but there is no justification for its existence either morally or economically. What is the price of security at Sellafield? We do not know. We know that following 11 September it became a no-fly zone. I am not aware if that remains the position but we know a territorial army was present in the area. We know all sorts of hidden costs paid for by the British Government ought to be in a profit and loss account. It is a most extraordinary fantasy world which exists across the Irish Sea in Cumbria.</P>
    <P>I want to address the reason this matter is so urgent. Many of us have, for many years, rather silently and not loudly enough paid lip-service to the need to dismantle Sellafield. The events of 11 September changed that, as the Minister is aware. The events of 11 September alerted us to the fact that this is a constant imminent danger. It is far more serious than ever.</P>
    <P>I recently spoke about this matter to a spokesman for BNFL. I asked him what would be the consequences if Osama bin Laden or somebody else decided to send a suicide bomber into Sellafield. His response was calm but ruthless; they have budgeted for 4,000 deaths locally. That is their estimate, an extraordinarily macabre and morbid response. We must look at this as a real <Col N="559" /> possibility. We are living in a world filled with terrorism and suicide pilots. Sellafield is a real target. It would be no good saying afterwards there was nothing we could have done. We could easily dismantle the plant.</P>
    <P>The dangers to the environment are indisputable. Greenpeace has proven, quite convincingly, that the Irish Sea is the most contaminated in the world. Eight million litres of waste per day go into the Irish Sea. The incidence of childhood leukaemia in the area has risen by ten times. That does not prove Sellafield causes childhood leukaemia any more than cigarettes cause cancer but the anecdotal evidence is so convincing we should take it seriously.</P>
    <P>This is no anti-British crusade, this is no anti-British sentiment. It is far more serious than that. I find it embarrassing from time to time to find myself on the same side as Sinn Féin on this issue. No doubt they find it embarrassing also.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very serious national problem which, to some extent, unites us. Let us look at what happened in Chernobyl. Scientists tell us if there is an accident at Sellafield the situation will be far worse. We must realise the seriousness of this problem. That is why I find the Government's attitude awry. I do not believe the Government, through its current policy, will achieve anything regarding Sellafied. I do not believe it seriously wants to achieve anything. What it is doing is cosmetic, ineffective and simply and solely playing to its main constituency. I would like to see the Government proving to the world that it is prepared, at least, to embarrass the British nation by calling in the ambassador, making a formal protest and drawing the attention of the world to the menace which threatens our citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Senator Ross on pursuing this matter which we have discussed on a number of occasions. I shared time with him on the last occasion and he has now very graciously asked me to second this very important motion. Like Senator Ross, I deprecate the Government's decision to table an amendment to this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think the Government is embarrassed about calling in the British ambassador, I think it is embarrassed by the fact that the suggestion came from Senator Ross. The Government might well have done so if it had thought about it. It is a pity the Government cannot accept the suggestion in the spirit in which it is meant. It is time we delivered a rebuke. Senator Ross previously suggested that the British ambassador might be invited to come to this House to answer questions from Members on the issue. That was ruled out. He has now suggested that the Government deliver a rebuke directly. It is appropriate that we do so. Ambassadors are required to learn about <Col N="560" /> the strong feelings of the countries to which they are posted.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Ross that no one could describe him as anti-British. I doubt very much if many people would characterise me as anti-British. This motion strongly criticises the British Government and is, for that reason, to be taken as having greater effect. Although I am half English I have to stand up and say they are continually bad neighbours. Foot and mouth disease was almost spread into Ireland as a result of their laxity in terms of safety precautions. Thank God for our efficient Ministers, civil servants and decent farmers who were able to keep the disease out of Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The insidious nature of the nuclear threat is that it is invisible &ndash; we can see animals and take precautions against them coming in but we require a very sophisticated defence in terms of nuclear reaction to deal with the dangers of nuclear plants. There was a story a couple of days ago on &ldquo;Five-Seven Live&rdquo; with Mr. Myles Dungan &ndash; which, unfortunately, I only caught the end of &ndash; regarding another problem at Sellafield within the last week. I understand it also involved a military establishment. This is very worrying.</P>
      <P>Senator Ross has listed a catalogue of information in relation to the very foundation of this establishment. In the 1950s when I was child people thought nuclear energy was the way of the future, that it was clean and would not cause contamination and we would be done with the dirt, filth and back breaking labour of the miners in England. How wrong we were. It is contaminating in a much more sinister way. When I was a child, Sellafield was called Windscale. A fire at the plant blew the roof off, resulting in the escape of radiation which caused contamination on this side of the Irish Sea. The name of the plant was subsequently changed to Calderhall and later to Sellafield. That suggests to me the British are uneasy about this facility if they feel the need to keep changing its name.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ross has put on the record the lies and evasions told by British Nuclear Fuels, which continually employs the most sophisticated spin-masters. Even it cannot conceal the reality of what is happening. Another development took place during the week. The way this material comes out is, if I might say, rather intriguing. It is a bit like Ben Dunne's accident which led to the setting up of the tribunals. On this occasion a senior nuclear physicist took an action against BNFL for constructive dismissal. Mr. Ronald Hanas, who was responsible for monitoring the control of plutonium and uranium at the plant, said radioactive material was often left unsupervised and that inspections by the Environmental Protection Agency were treated as &ldquo;a bit of a joke&rdquo;. It is some joke. The joke will be on all of us if we do not do something about this. He said that there was an unwillingness to disrupt operations or <Col N="561" /> draw attention from the head of the site, and safety issues were therefore slack. He is one of their senior scientists in charge of uranium and plutonium facilities, and that is what he said. They are convicted out of the mouths of their own experts.</P>
    <P>I do not want to rehash all that was said in the last debate on 10 October, but we can learn from it. One very interesting contribution was made by my colleague on the Labour benches, Senator Ryan, who teaches engineering design. He put five criteria on the record of the House: the plant should be technically feasible, it should make economic sense, it should be safe, it should be environmentally acceptable and it should serve some social purpose. How many of those criteria does Sellafield fulfil? The answer is only, and marginally, the first. It is possible to embark on the process, but it does not make economic sense, and I refer anyone who is interested to our contributions in the last debate. Not even the Japanese are going to take MOX because of the record of lying and breaches of safety. They have indicated that. It is not economically viable.</P>
    <P>The third criterion is that it should be safe. Can anyone think that it is safe when their own experts say that it is not? The safety is a joke. The fourth criterion is that it should be environmentally acceptable, and we know that it is not. The fifth is that it should serve some social purpose, which it obviously does not.</P>
    <P>There are seven Seanad Bills with the Dáil. The Radiological Protection (Amendment) Bill, 1998, shows concern in that area. The Containment of Nuclear Weapons Bill, 2000, also shows concern, as does the Dumping at Sea (Amendment) Bill, 2000, and the Law of the Sea (Repression of Piracy) Bill, 2000. These are all germane to our concerns. The people and their representatives are clearly exercising their minds about this.</P>
    <P>It is possible to use this facility in certain ways, rather than waste it &ndash; I put that on the record the last time. These things could be encased in ceramic rods, which have a further economic use. Britain could be a leader in this technology. I referred the last time to turning swords into plough shares. I am afraid I do not always articulate and it emerged as &ldquo;turning sordid plough shares&rdquo;. I have turned a few sordid plough shares in my time, but this is turning swords into plough shares.</P>

      <P>I once more congratulate Senator Ross on putting down this motion. I hope it will strengthen the Government's hand in dealing with the British. There probably will be a vote, but I am sure Senator Ross would not wish this to be construed as an intention to weaken the Government's hand. What we on this side of the House, led by Senator Ross, seek to do is to strengthen the Government's hand by the strength of our feelings.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>Seanad Éireann, concerned at the threat to the health and safety of Irish citizens and to the environment that is posed by the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant in Britain;</P>
      <P>recalling that the Taoiseach has repeatedly raised the concerns of the Government and the Irish people with the British Prime Minister and noting that the Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise and his officials have regular meetings and contact with their United Kingdom counterparts to express Ireland's concerns;</P>
      <P>recalling that the Government has, for the first time, initiated legal proceedings against the UK in relation to the commissioning of the MOX fuel plant at the Sellafield site;</P>
      <P>noting that the issue of Sellafield is being discussed at the British Irish Council;</P>
      <P>endorses the Government's strategy and actions in relation to Sellafield.</P>
      <P>In moving the amendment to the motion, I welcome the Minister of State to the House and compliment him on the huge amount of work he has done in recent years to get some semblance of fairness and reality into the operation of the Sellafield plant. Everybody agrees that in recent years huge emotions have been stirred up by the operation of the Sellafield plant. There is no need to go into the chronological order of the problems that have been associated with Sellafield. Everyone realises that the Irish people have not wanted Sellafield and have argued against it because of the threat to their health and safety caused by its operation. The invitation to the ambassador to ask him to convey our concerns to the British Government is not realistic. We are dealing directly with the British Government and there is no reason to bring in the ambassador.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Norris read from a report. A special report on Britain's nuclear industry by Rob Evans and David Hencke of<i> The Guardian</i> stated that staff at British Nuclear Fuels Limited com<Col N="563" /> plained privately that British diplomats had failed to stand up for the state-owned company against Irish Governments that have persistently campaigned against BNFL's Sellafield plant. Their source was secret papers obtained by <i>The Guardian. </i>BNFL also admitted that the current Irish Government had more success than its predecessors in opposing Sellafield. The frank memoranda by BNFL's public relations branch revealed that the company had struggled to placate the Irish who for years have pressed to close the complex in Cumbria.</P>
    <P>Over the past year BNFL suffered a series of blows, forcing the Government to rethink Sellafield's future. A spate of safety rows, culminating in Japan returning spent fuel, have jeopardised BNFL's lucrative contracts worldwide. In one leaked memorandum, written before the visit to BNFL by Sir Edward Edwards, Britain's ambassador, in May last year, the British Government grumbled that in its dealings with the Irish Government the British Embassy should stand four square behind BNFL. It claimed that this had not always been the case. The clear message was that BNFL is an important exporter within strict UK and international regulations.</P>
    <P>The memorandum also said that since Sellafield was high on the Anglo-Irish political agenda, BNFL has worked to improve its image in Ireland and benefit relations between the two Governments. It admitted that ultimately a realistic objective for their work in Ireland is damage limitation. In terms of the motion, it is good that they are talking about damage limitation. We are not trying to change this. The leaked memorandum stated that the Irish Government had been more successful than any previous Government in dealing with the Sellafield problem. The memorandum acknowledged that the policy of the Fianna Fáil led Government since it came to power in 1997 has been to continue to oppose Sellafield. It has been less vocal than the previous Government, but perhaps more effective, and we must acknowledge this.</P>
    <P>Irish Governments have long been pressing BNFL to stop discharging into the Irish Sea waste that pollutes Ireland's shores. We stand over the work that has been done by the Government since 1997 in its targeting of Sellafield. This is the first Government to take the Sellafield case to the international courts. Although we did not win at the UN Tribunal on the Law of Sea, the tribunal stated that we not only had the right to take the action but that UNCLOS has jurisdiction in relation to Ireland's case and Ireland has rights under UNCLOS to seek to protect the marine environment of the Irish Sea. Fianna Fáil will not bow its head in its efforts to close Sellafield. We have always fought to have Sellafield closed and other Governments continued this fight. The Government has fought strongly by taking cases to court. It is right to get emotional about the damage being done to our citizens. While I do not agree with the motion, I believe the House <Col N="564" /> would unite in supporting a motion condemning the Sellafield plant.</P>
    <P>Neither this House nor the Government wants the Sellafield plant, especially the new MOX facility, to continue in operation. However, there is nothing more we can do other than to express the hope that the plant will be considered in a broader context than the economic benefit it brings to the surrounding area. Most people in Great Britain see only that 40,000 jobs in greater Cumbria depend on it. The British Government could not afford the loss of these jobs, nor could it afford to close down the plant because of the prohibitive cost of decommissioning it. However, if the debate is broadened to consider the impact of the plant on human lives, it will become apparent that it should be closed. All in this House are agreed on that.</P>
    <P>The suggestion that we are more at risk from the Sellafield plant following the events of 11 September will only signal it as a target for terrorists.</P>

      <P>I welcome this debate. It is one of a series that will continue until the Sellafield plant is closed. I wish to concentrate on the question as to whether the plant would be able to withstand a terrorist attack.</P>
      <P>On 11 September, the plane that crashed in Pennsylvania had reduced its height by thousands of feet long before it crashed. It was reported in American newspapers that it was believed to be heading for a dam in the area or the Three Mile Island nuclear plant. We must face the reality that the real threat to the Sellafield plant arises from its inability to withstand a direct hit from the type of plane and aviation fuel that crashed into the twin towers on 11 September.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The United Nations and the International Atomic Energy Authority organised a conference on the threat of nuclear terrorism last November. The authority published a report, a copy of which was given to the Taoiseach some months ago. Will the Minister of State publish the report and will he indicate what the authority has to say about the threat of nuclear terrorism to the world and especially to Europe? I have contacted the authority and it has told me it is for the Govern<Col N="565" /> ment to decide whether to publish the report but the Department of Public Enterprise has advised me differently. I ask the Minister of State to clarify this.</P>
    <P>The danger at the Sellafield plant arises from the radioactive waste contained in the storage tanks on site. The Minister of State is aware that some of the waste has been stored there since 1957. The capacity of the building to withstand a terrorist attack is based on the risk assumed to be in the nuclear industry before 11 September. In non-nuclear industries, action will be taken if the risk of an incident is greater than one in 10,000. In the nuclear industry action will be taken if the risk of an accident is greater than one in 100,000. However, the risk of an attack on the Sellafield plant similar to that on the twin towers on 11 September is one in one million. The plant was not built to withstand such an attack. The risk has not been factored in.</P>
    <P>The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland met with British Nuclear Fuels, not in England but, at BNFL's insistence, in Ireland. Participants at the meeting were sworn to secrecy on the detail they were supplied with. However, nobody was sworn to secrecy on the views of the RPII and the Government following the meeting. Is the Minister of State happy with the result of the meeting and is the Government satisfied that the implementation of security arrangements means that the Sellafield plant is safe? If the Minister of State does not indicate this we can only assume the Government is not satisfied.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the Sellafield plant is safe. Visitors to the plant will see that it is wide open to an attack. Those in al-Qaeda, on which President Bush has spoken so often and acted so promptly, are the world experts on car or truck bombs. It is arguable whether trucks or cars could get into the plant but trains certainly can. They run by it every day and there is no reason why one could not be commandeered by these terrorists, loaded with explosives and brought into the heart of the plant. There is also nothing to stop an attack on the plant from the sea or the overlooking heights.</P>
    <P>These are all very important issues that must be addressed but, even more importantly, we need to know what the Government is doing to ensure that the plant is closed. I acknowledge the Minister of State's work in the law courts, especially on the law of the sea. The court made a very important decision and the Government effectively won its case. For the first time it secured the right to be consulted about what is happening at the plant. The British Government, which argued that the case should be dismissed, effectively lost. I am confident that some progress has been made. I do not wish to turn this debate into an attack on the Government. It is not my way to do business on this issue, nor is it the Minster of State's. However, the inadequacies in the Government's response must be pointed out.</P>
    <P>What is the risk of a plane crashing into the Sellafield plant? The no-fly zone around the plant extends for a radius of two miles to a height of <Col N="566" /> 2,000 feet. It would take a plane only seconds to crash into the plant. It is indefensible that there is not a minimum ten mile no-fly zone around the plant. That is the extent of the zones around nuclear plants in America. The Department of Public Enterprise has informed me it has no record of having made any representations about the no-fly zone around the Sellafield plant. That is unacceptable. Why is the Government not pressing home this point? If one stands at Sellafield and looks up at the sky, one sees dozens of planes passing overhead every day. The Government must press for the extension of the no-fly zone. It is not good enough and I will not accept it.</P>
    <P>There is also the issue of the record of meetings between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister. There is no record arguments made by the Taoiseach since 11 September. The Department told me no such record exists. Why are there no records? Where is the openness and transparency in the Government's approach to Sellafield? We are all in favour of its closure, but where is that consensus? Where is the transparency in the Government's approach? It is not there because there are no records. Therefore, it can be said that no efforts are being made to push these points home.</P>
    <P>I, the Minister of State and others know that within one hour of the Official Report of this debate going onto the computer in Leinster House, a record will be on the desk of the chief executive of BNFL. Every published article and everything that happens in this House is recorded and BNFL and the British Government is very much aware of what we say. That is why this debate is important. We may disagree and criticise the Government for not doing enough, but it is important to have the debate. We should continue to put on record our objections to this plant. There is universal support in the country for its closure and I am delighted the Independent Senators selected this as the most important issue for a Private Members' debate. The country agrees with them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been in the Seanad about six times during my watch to talk about nuclear matters. It has been a pleasure to do so and I am glad to be here again this evening. I fully respect the spirit behind the motion tabled by Senator Ross and Senator Norris but the Government has put down an amendment because the Senators' motion fails to recognise that the Government's campaign against Sellafield, including in particular the current legal action by the Government against the UK regarding the Sellafield MOX plant, has brought matters way beyond the stage of presenting a formal protest to the British ambassador. In common with Senator O'Dowd, I laud the two Senators for putting down this motion because it gives us a chance to air this subject again. I also agree with Senator O'Dowd that it is important to keep <Col N="567" /> debating this issue. I want to persuade Senator Ross, Senator Norris and their colleagues that a great deal has been done in this area and that no more can humanly be done.</P>
      <P>I was delighted when I was given responsibility four and a half years ago for nuclear matters and leading the Government's campaign against Sellafield. I have endeavoured to do all that is humanly possible in that regard. First, I met the most relevant UK Minister, Mr. Michael Meacher, MP, and I outlined Ireland's legitimate concerns to him. I spoke about our concerns regarding the possibility of a major incident or accident, although a terrorist attack was far from our minds at that time. I agree with Senator Ross and others who mentioned the new perspective since 11 September. The level of urgency has soared in that regard and this must be reflected in our ongoing actions.</P>
      <P>I explained to him that the threat of an incident or accident which would affect the health and safety of the people of this island was our uppermost concern, particularly given our proximity. There are also ageing magnox reactors and a high level of waste, as Senator O'Dowd mentioned. This is stored in liquid form and is of major concern to us. The UK authorities are endeavouring to make that safer by a vitrification process but that is too slow &ndash; it is not at the speed the Irish Government wants. We have exhorted them to speed up the process because, as it stands, it will take until 2015 before the current stocks of liquid waste are dealt with. We have exhorted the British authorities to ensure that the process is expedited and to put on additional lines.</P>
      <P>We have reminded them of the contamination of the Irish Sea. The assertion that the Irish Sea is the ocean most contaminated by radioactivity in the world is often quoted, but that is far from the case. However, any level of radioactivity in our waters is totally objectionable and we will not stand for it. Discharges into our marine environment caused by these plants are also objectionable.</P>
      <P>These issues have all been spelt out repeatedly to the UK authorities and Ministers, starting with Michael Meacher, who is still a Minister for the Environment, the Minister for Energy, John Battle, and his successor Helen Liddell. We met all of them in London and they were also good enough to come to Dublin with their officials. We went over this with them <i>ad nauseam</i> but as we went over the detailed facts behind our objections, after about a year and a half, I came to the conclusion that while I was getting a very courteous hearing from and interaction with UK Ministers, we were not getting very far in terms of action. These plants are there since 1946 and successive Irish Governments have voiced their concerns about them, but have got nowhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, although we said we were keeping legal action under review, I decided to be proactive and to put preparatory work in place for such legal action. I sought legal expertise here and <Col N="568" /> abroad &ndash; at QC level in the UK &ndash; and other necessary expertise, such as economic and nuclear advice. That work went on for two years up to last May when I met the Taoiseach, whom I had kept abreast of developments, and told him the preparatory work was done. I told him I was ready to move with legal action on a number of fronts. I wanted the Taoiseach to give his imprimatur and to take that information to Government seeking approval to take legal action. Mere Ministers of State do not sit at the Cabinet table, but I was afforded the opportunity to present the case in the first week of June 2001.</P>
    <P>Before June was out we had embarked on the legal process under the OSPAR treaty. This was not a reactive measure put in place after 11 September. It was a proactive measure and preparatory work and expenditure had been going on over two years. That was a very important action to take.</P>
    <P>In parallel with that, we continued to deal with the UK authorities and voice our disapproval. We also internationalised this campaign. I journeyed to Iceland, Norway, Sweden and Finland and the Danish Minister, Sven Auken, came to Dublin to see me. Ireland is now globally recognised as being in the vanguard of the campaign against nuclear expansion and the expansion of nuclear energy in developing countries. All that work has been done and I appreciate the support I have had from the Oireachtas in the years that I have been involved with this. I notice that the support in the other House has been on the wane in recent times, but being a hardened politico I can appreciate that that is because of another imminent event.</P>
    <P>I fully respect the spirit in which the Senators' motion has been tabled. I hope they accept that the issue has moved on to a point beyond approaching the British ambassador. Senators will recall that the last time I addressed a debate in this House concerning Sellafield was in October 2001. That debate took place following the announcement by the UK Government that it had given the go-ahead to the MOX plant. Since then, the Government has been very active in trying to stop the full commissioning of the MOX plant and in continuing to express its view that operations at the Sellafield site should be ended.</P>
    <P>From the Government's counter motion, Members of the House will see that Ireland's strong views have been expressed at the highest levels to the UK Government. Therefore, to protest to the British ambassador would not add anything to the UK's awareness of our position on the matter. Successive Irish Governments have opposed the continued operation and any expansion of the Sellafield plant. With its multiplicity of operations, Sellafield represents a potentially serious threat to Ireland's public health and environment, as well as to our vital commercial interests such as fishing, agriculture and tourism. The Government remains unrelenting in its campaign to bring about the closure of Sellafield.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="569" />Since assuming the portfolio for nuclear safety and radiological protection, I have met UK Ministers on numerous occasions. After taking office in 1997, I quickly sought a meeting with the UK Environment Minister, Mr. Michael Meacher. At our meeting in Dublin, I conveyed to Minister Meacher the whole range of nuclear safety issues of concern to Ireland. In February 1999, I conveyed in no uncertain terms to Minister Meacher the strong objections of the Government to radioactive discharges from Sellafield to the Irish Sea and about the proposed decision by the UK Environment Agency to give the go-ahead to the Sellafield MOX plant. At that meeting, I emphasised to Minister Meacher the necessity for the UK to take account, in its review of Sellafield radioactive discharges authorisation limits, of the strong commitments made by the UK Ministers at the June 1998 meeting in Portugal of the OSPAR Commission, at which the OSPAR Strategy on Radioactive Discharges to the marine environment was adopted.</P>
    <P>UK Ministers at that meeting gave me an assurance that they would address that matter, and in particular they would address an Irish motion on the rise of levels of technetium 99 in the Irish Sea. It has not been addressed. As Senators will know, the OSPAR strategy provided for the virtual elimination of radioactive discharges to the marine environment by the year 2020 through a programme of progressive and substantial reductions in such discharges.</P>
    <P>In May 1999, I met with the then UK Minister of State for Energy and Industry, Mr. John Battle. At that meeting, I reiterated the Government's concerns about the safety of the storage of high-level radioactive waste in liquid form in tanks at Sellafield and I pressed for the speedy vitrification of this waste. I also raised with him our concerns about the safety of the old Magnox reactors in the UK which continue to operate beyond their original design life. While Minister Battle assured me that these reactors would not be allowed to continue operating unless it was safe to do so, I nevertheless called for the closing down of these reactors.</P>
    <P>It was as a direct result of my sustained representations to Minister Battle around that time that the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland was allowed access to examine, on the BNFL premises, the BNFL safety standards documentation relating to the storage tanks where the high-level liquid waste is kept. The RPII carried out a two week examination of the documentation at Sellafield and published its report in December 2000. In summary, the RPII concluded that the risk of a severe accident associated with the storage arrangements for this liquid waste was low. However, the RPII made a number of recommendations for reducing the risk further and has maintained contact with the UK authorities as to the implementation of those recommendations.</P>
    <P>February 2000, as the House will be aware, saw the publication by the UK's Nuclear Installations <Col N="570" /> Inspectorate of three separate reports relating to the Sellafield plant. One of these reports, relating to the control and supervision of operations at Sellafield, and another relating to the falsification of safety related data for MOX fuel pellets produced at the Sellafield MOX demonstration facility, were highly critical of the safety culture and safety management at the plant. Immediately following the publication of these reports, I met with the then UK Minister of State for Energy, Mrs. Helen Liddell, to convey the Government's serious concerns about the reports and called for the cessation of Sellafield operations. As far as the Government is concerned, these reports dealt a severe body blow to the reputation of BNFL as a safety conscious operation, a body blow from which I am convinced BNFL will find it difficult to recover. Even today, two years later, some of the safety improvement recommendations contained in the report on the control and supervision of operations at the plant have yet to be implemented.</P>
    <P>In all my meetings and correspondence with British Ministers, they were left under no illusions whatsoever as to the depth of opposition in Ireland to the Sellafield plant. The Taoiseach has, on numerous occasions, raised with the British Prime Minister Ireland's opposition to the Sellafield operations, including the MOX plant, and has called for its closure. Only last week, at a meeting between the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister, this issue was raised, among other matters.</P>
    <P>The Government's concerns about Sellafield are regularly followed up by officials of my Department and the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland at meetings of the UK-Ireland contact group on radioactivity matters. This group comprises officials of my Department and the RPII and officials from the relevant UK Government Departments and agencies. It meets twice a year and provides a further opportunity to pursue Ireland's concerns about Sellafield.</P>
    <P>In addition to face to face meetings with UK Ministers and ongoing correspondence with them on Sellafield related issues, I have raised our concerns about the nuclear industry and related activities at every available opportunity on the international stage, in the EU, in Paris at the International Energy Agency, the OSPAR Convention and the United Nations in New York. I have also developed links with like-minded countries in OSPAR, including, in particular, the Nordic countries, as I stated before, which generally share our concerns about nuclear reprocessing activities, such as those carried out at Sellafield, and about discharges of radioactive materials into the marine environment.</P>
    <P>I have built very strong personal relationships with key Ministers in some of these countries. For instance, and most recently on 17 December 2001, following the general election and change of Government in Norway, I met the new Norwegian Minister for the Environment in Dublin and briefed him on our assessment of the <Col N="571" /> issues surrounding Sellafield and the MOX plant with particular focus on the legal aspects.</P>
    <P>This week, I attended a meeting of the British-Irish Council environment sectoral group in Edinburgh. As Senators will be aware, this was established under the Good Friday Agreement as a forum for members to exchange information and to discuss, consult and use best endeavours to reach agreement on matters of mutual interest. The environment group is one of a number of sectoral groups within the BIC and is chaired by Mr. Meacher. Ireland and the Isle of Man have taken the lead within this group on Sellafield and radioactive waste.</P>
    <P>The group, at its meeting this week, held an initial exchange of views on a draft discussion paper on this subject which had been prepared jointly by Ireland and the Isle of Man. It was agreed that the subject would be further discussed at its next meeting in the autumn. The inclusion of Sellafield on the agenda of the BIC is of significant importance to Ireland as it gives us a valuable opportunity to discuss the genuine concerns which Sellafield creates for Ireland and some other BIC members.</P>
    <P>The Government's strong opposition to the Sellafield MOX plant has been repeatedly conveyed to UK Ministers and departmental officials over the years and in its detailed responses to the five separate rounds of public consultations held by British authorities and Ministers since 1997. As I mentioned before, the Taoiseach also raised Ireland's opposition to this project with the British Prime Minister. We were totally dismayed and angered by the UK Government's decision of October last to give the go-ahead to that plant. At a time of heightened tensions around the world arising from terrorist threats, I find the UK Government's decision effectively to expand operations at Sellafield difficult to fathom.</P>
    <P>The Government is determined to prevent the full commissioning of the MOX plant. We see no justification, economic or otherwise, for it. The MOX plant will effectively perpetuate nuclear reprocessing activities at Sellafield and add to the level of radioactive discharges into the marine environment. It will increase the volume of worldwide shipments of nuclear fuels with obvious additional volume of traffic through the Irish Sea, thus pose an unacceptable safety and security risk as well as the potential for a major accident or terrorist attack.</P>
    <P>We have initiated legal action against the UK under the OSPAR Convention in regard to the MOX plant. The legal action began in June 2001 and relates to the fact that the UK, on grounds of commercial confidentiality, withheld pertinent information essential to assessing the economic justification of the MOX plant. This action is proceeding on schedule and an arbitration tribunal is in the process of being established under the OSPAR Convention to consider the case.</P>
    <P>In parallel with the legal action under OSPAR, the Government has also initiated legal pro<Col N="572" /> ceedings against the UK under the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea to stop the operation of the MOX plant. Ireland requested the establishment of an international arbitration tribunal under this UN convention to resolve the dispute.</P>
    <P>As it was not expected that Ireland's case would be heard by the tribunal until the latter part of this year, Ireland requested the International Tribunal on the Law of the Sea, ITLOS, to order a legally binding injunction on the UK to stop the commissioning of the MOX plant and associated shipments of nuclear material. On 3 December 2001, the ITLOS delivered its judgment on the injunction request. While it did not agree to the implementation of the injunction measures requested by Ireland, it imposed obligations of co-operation on the UK <i>vis-à-vis</i> exchange of information and construction of appropriate measures to prevent pollution of the marine environment, pending the hearing of the substantive case by the arbitration tribunal. The Government will also be considering what steps, if any, to take on challenging before the European Court of Justice the UK's decision that the MOX plant is economically justified.</P>
    <P>That is the background to the Government's concerns about Sellafield and the actions being taken by it to end its operations. The Government will continue to pursue every realistic means, diplomatic and legal, to bring about a cessation of operations at Sellafield. Clearly it will not be an easy task, but our actions demonstrate that we are fully committed to the process. As in the past, we will continue to harness the support of like minded countries, which have concerns about the Sellafield operations, to maintain a high level of awareness and understanding across the broadest possible spectrum.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate although I am not an expert. This motion reflects the frustration of our independent colleagues, which is shared by many, that all the diplomatic efforts to register with the British Government the real concerns of the Irish Government and people about Sellafield have not been successful. I acknowledge the Minister's efforts, which he catalogued fully, on this matter, to which he devotes much time and effort. He has met British Ministers, Mr. Meacher, Mr. Battle and Ms Liddell, and I do not doubt that he forcefully put to them Ireland's objections. However, the British Government commissioned the MOX plant in defiance of Irish and international objection. I watched Mr. Blair, the British Prime Minister, being interviewed on BBC News 24, the news channel which is broadcast throughout the world, in which he arrogantly dismissed the objections of the Irish and Scandinavian Governments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree we need to crank up diplomatic activity, which is why we must take a further step whereby the Minister for Foreign Affairs should summon the British ambassador to register the strongest <Col N="573" /> possible protest to him. In the world of diplomacy, that is a major step. When one country takes that step with another friendly country, it registers forcefully the anger in the country which initiates such diplomatic action.</P>
    <P>In defiance of international public opinion, the British Government commissioned the MOX plant at Sellafield only to give Sellafield economic viability. By its own admission, it felt it was no longer a viable plant unless the new MOX plant was commissioned. We protested loudly about it, but our protests were ignored, as were international protests. The statement the British Government made last October on the mixed oxide plant was to the effect that it would give economic viability to Sellafield far into the future. That was like throwing dust in our eyes in terms of our protests and for that reason we need to up the ante in diplomatic terms. We do not need to go to war or create other incidents. The best instrument at our disposal is diplomacy and levels of diplomatic activity.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister of State that the Taoiseach has been active in this area, but the Minister of State has borne the brunt of the work. I understand that when the Taoiseach speaks to the British Prime Minister on this issue, it is only on the margins of a Heads of State and Government meeting in Brussels or in whichever country has the Presidency of the European Union, or on the margins of an Anglo-Irish Summit between the two leaders that would be convened primarily to discuss some other matter. When the meetings are over, I presume the Taoiseach reminds Prime Minister Blair about our objections to Sellafield, but that is not enough on a Heads of Government level. There should be a formal meeting between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister with only one issue on the agenda, namely, Sellafield. If that were sought, it would up the ante on this issue and get across the message to the British authorities that we do not accept this plant on our doorstep.</P>
    <P>Millions of litres of radioactive water, admittedly of a very low level, are discharged into the Irish Sea from this plant on a daily basis. Specimens of grossly deformed fish have been found in the Irish Sea, and many scientists are of the view that is related to the levels of radioactivity in the Irish Sea. In my opinion and in the opinion of many medical scientists, there is a clear connection between childhood leukaemia on the west coast of Britain, for many miles north and south of Sellafield, and the high incidence of leukaemia in areas of County Louth and other areas close to the east coast of Ireland. We do not have definitive proof of that, but the one condition radioactivity causes in all human and animal life is the scourge of cancer. I am one of the people who believe that the incidence of childhood leukaemia in particular is closely related to emissions and discharges from Sellafield.</P>
    <P>This is a real national issue for this country. I do not want to be critical of the Minister of State in any way. I have always admired and acknow<Col N="574" /> ledged the excellent work he has done in this area, but he made the point that real decisions on this issue are taken at senior ministerial or Heads of Government level, and that is where we have to pitch this battle. That is the reason I support this motion. I do not wish to trump the motion put down by my Independent colleagues, but I would have demanded a direct meeting between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister with one issue on the agenda &ndash; Sellafield.</P>
    <P>The issue of terrorism has come very much to the fore since 11 September. If there was a terrorist attack on Sellafield in the morning, there is no doubt that Ireland would suffer just as much as mainland Britain. We have not received any assurances that this very open plant is in any way immune or protected from a suicide bomber in an aircraft. No-fly zones which restrict an aircraft flying within certain distances of or above the plant are useless. The planes that attacked the twin towers in New York had covered 50 or 60 miles within seconds. That is the problem with these aircraft flying at 500 or 600 miles per hour. Terrorists know how to get the maximum velocity out of an aeroplane flying at a relatively low altitude, which is not easy to do. They fly much faster at higher altitude where the resistance is less, but terrorists can do that and they can get around these so-called no-fly zones. &ldquo;No-fly zone&rdquo; is a fine phrase, but 11 September proved that, with ingenuity and the kind of fanaticism we have seen, these so-called measures of protection can be blown to bits.</P>
    <P>Sellafield has fuel tanks out in the open with highly radioactive nuclear materials stored in them. They could not withstand the major impact of a large civil airliner striking them and the huge fire and explosions that would follow such an incident. God forbid that this would ever happen but it is now part of reality because it has already happened in a place we thought it could never happen, a great and densely populated metropolis where one would imagine it would be extremely difficult to manoeuvre a 767 passenger aircraft into such a position that it could pinpoint the two tallest buildings in the city. The Sellafield plant is almost in open countryside and is a very easy target. It is not a moving target. It is a sitting duck for that kind of attack.</P>
    <P>I support the motion. The Minister of State has been very open about his discussions with the various Ministers in the United Kingdom who deal with nuclear issues, but we have not had a full report on the outcome of meetings between Prime Minister Blair and the Taoiseach, although there was a reference to them in the Minister of State's contribution. I want to know what is going on. Does Prime Minister Blair take the same attitude with the Taoiseach that he took with an interviewer who put a question to him on television last October, when the plant was commissioned, for dissemination and broadcast throughout the world? The public would also like to know that. These discussions, and the attitude <Col N="575" /> adopted by the British Prime Minister during them, should be made public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment proposed by Senator Lanigan, not because the motion is not a good one. It is a very good motion but it is not a timely one because we have gone beyond the stage of calling on the ambassador to accept a formal protest from the Government. I appreciate the spirit in which the motion has been tabled, and I do not doubt the good intentions of those who brought it forward. I am sorry they were not here for the Minister of State's contribution but I am sure they heard it on their monitors.</P>
      <P>I want to deal with some of the comments the Minister of State made. The Government has been active on this issue. The amendment was not proposed simply to knock down the motion but because action has been taken. As the Minister of State said, in 1994, when planning permission was granted for the MOX plant, Ireland immediately conveyed its objections to the UK on numerous occasions at official and ministerial level, in private meetings, by letter and so on. Even when the UK authorities held public consultations on five occasions, we sent detailed responses.</P>
      <P>On 3 October last year, the UK Government announced that the manufacture of MOX fuel is justified in accordance with European law. If that is the case, and I have no reason to doubt it is, we should be trying to change that UK law. I will go into the reason I believe that later.</P>
      <P>On 25 October last year, we instituted arbitration proceedings against the UK under the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. It was not expected to hold oral hearings on this matter until the latter part of this year. Because the MOX plant was expected to be commissioned last November, Ireland requested the International Tribunal on the Law of the Sea to order provisional measures, a legally binding injunction on the UK to stop the commissioning of the MOX plant and associated shipments of nuclear material.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 3 December last year, the International Tribunal on the Law of the Sea delivered its judgment, which did not agree to the implementation of the injunction we sought, but it decided that the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea has jurisdiction in relation to Ireland's case and that Ireland has rights to seek to protect the marine environment of the Irish Sea. This is a small but significant step forward. Ireland was pleased with this judgment. It was the first time obligations of co-operation were imposed on the UK <i>vis-à-vis </i>an exchange of information and construction of appropriate measures to prevent pollution of the marine environment. Furthermore, the tribunal recognised that Ireland has a legitimate interest in protecting the Irish Sea against pollution pending the hearing of the substantive case by the arbitral tribunal to be established <Col N="576" /> under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.</P>
    <P>Arbitration under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea is on the grounds that the UK has violated numerous provisions of that convention, which are concerned with the protection of the marine environment. Many Senators spoke of the number of such cases that have occurred. The final elements of this tribunal are being decided. The arbitral tribunal will receive written statements from both parties, the UK and Ireland, to the convening of the oral hearing, but it is not likely to take place before next autumn.</P>
    <P>The Oslo and Paris conventions arbitration is proceeding on schedule. Its purpose is to resolve a dispute between Ireland and the UK relating to the withholding by the UK, on grounds of commercial confidentiality, information essential to assessing the justification for the full commissioning of the proposed MOX plant at Sellafield, which in Ireland's opinion contravenes the provision of article 9 of the convention.</P>
    <P>That is nothing new for the British to do. They are masters at obfuscation. Senator Norris stated that when he was young, Sellafield was called Windscale. The British change the names of things all the time. Once a name becomes unpopular, they change it. The plant was called Windscale, then there was the Windscale disaster and the name of the plant was changed. They also changed the name of Long Kesh to The Maze, which is a much more comfortable name. Changing the name of this plant, however, did not alter the facts.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross stated that a bonus award is given to some workers at Sellafield. I agree wholeheartedly with him that it is ludicrous to give that type of award to people for working there. I believe that most spokespersons for British Nuclear Fuels Limited to whom I have listened tell blatant lies. I heard Mrs. Thatcher's former spin doctor, Sir Bernard Ingham, discuss Sellafield on radio recently and tell Irish people that they had no idea of what was going on and that there was no justification for their fears about the safety of the plant. That is patently ludicrous.</P>
    <P>Sellafield can be compared to holding a grenade in one's hand and taking out the pin. It is not a matter of what will happen, if something will happen, but when it will happen. We are sitting on a grenade, the pin of which is pulled out.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross stated that BNFL has budgeted for 4,000 deaths in England &ndash; it will write them off. That would not be much to the British who wrote off most of Coventry during the war rather than admit they had the enigma machine. They do not mind losing a few bodies here and there, but we mind that here. If Sellafield goes up, we will all suffer.</P>
    <P>How far away is Chernobyl from Dublin? It is 20 times further away than Sellafield. The effects of Chernobyl were felt as far as the west coast of this country. We would not have a hope in hell if a disaster happened at Sellafield.</P>
    <P>Many Senators spoke of the no-fly zone of ten <Col N="577" /> miles around Sellafield. I agree with Senator Connor that is patently crazy. Any terrorist could fly in there. The British airforce is supposed to be on scramble at any time and be able to blow terrorists out of the sky. As Senator Connor said, in a few seconds a pilot could fly 50 miles to 100 miles. How many seconds would it take a pilot to fly ten miles? Such a terrorist attack could happen.</P>
    <P>The Government is doing as much as it can. I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, on doing everything humanly possible to fight this case and I hope he will continue to do so. I do not know what portfolio he will hold in June. It might be the same one and, if so, I am sure he will continue to do the same work. He is doing an excellent job and that is recognised. Many Senators have paid tribute to the work he has done.</P>
    <P>With the typical arrogance that the British portray in most things they do, I wonder if we have a hope in hell of getting this plant closed. I hope we have, but sadly I doubt it.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to say a few words on this important motion. I preface my remarks by stating my appreciation of what the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, has been trying to do in this area. I have been long enough in public life to know that if one starts to measure people by results, one forgets about the inputs. I recognise the inputs. Even though I strongly support the motion, I listened to the Minister of State's argument against it, which made rational sense, but I disagree with it. It is as simple as that. I do not take from the Minister of State's personal commitment on this issue and his attempts to get movement on it.</P>
      <P>I have been less than impressed by attempts in the media now and again to trivialise this very important matter. It concerns a health issue, an environment issue and an issue of national interest. We need to examine this matter that way. People, including the Minister of State, have discussed in great detail the problems regarding Sellafield on which we are all agreed. There is a major interest among people as to what politicians are doing about this matter. The interest in green issues, environment issues, is rooted in a great concern for the world around us.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this motion is not to have an immediate impact on Sellafield because the world knows it will not make such a great difference to Sellafield, but it will allow us to be seen as part of the political consensus, speaking to Government and the Government listening to us, calling in the British ambassador and saying that this position is not good enough, that the health of our citizens is threatened, we expect action and believe what is happening is discourteous, offensive and unacceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We learnt going to school about the importance of a diplomatic note. I did not understood the importance of it, particularly ag déanamh mo chuid ábhar tré Ghaeilge ar scoil sa Daingean na blianta fada ó shin. A diplomatic note did not <Col N="578" /> appear to be a strong measure. Since I have grown older and have come to understand the nuances of the diplomacy, I understand the importance of it. I would like the ambassador to be called in and told not in an offensive way but in no uncertain terms where the Government stands on this matter. He should be handed a note expressing exactly our views on this issue.</P>
    <P>Over the past year I thought the cleverest thing the Government did was decide to take the international case on the basis of environmental law. I felt strongly that was the way forward, on the basis of the laws of the sea and environmental law, the areas on which the case was stated internationally. That impressed many people. This is an environmental issue, an issue concerning the seas and the world around us, and I was disappointed we did not make progress on that basis. It was a clever move that was strategically well thought out and I thought it would bring us over the line given the concerns of the world. I wonder whether there was political interference from important, strong and influential countries towards that decision? Recognising that such a suggestion is unfair when I do not have information, I will not go further than that, but it made me highly sceptical.</P>
    <P>Europe has let us down on this issue. The Minister of State, I and many of us here know that we worry about the decision the country took on the Nice referendum. I am not criticising people's reasons for it, but in terms of the overall strategic importance of the country it is an issue we have to revisit at some stage. It reflected a lack of credibility in the European Union. This is one instance when Europe might stand full square with Ireland to move things forward. I know the Minister of State has been working very hard in that direction. That is a hugely important move that could be made.</P>
    <P>Young people in Ireland, those on the east coast and those concerned about the environment would be impressed by this movement through diplomacy. As stated by Senator Connor, we do not go to war when we fall out with our neighbours, we use the structures to resolve that issue. In any formula we use the structures and work our way through them. In this case the structures are the various international courts which we have tried, the various international relations and the diplomatic channels. It is reasonable to take this motion on board.</P>
    <P>We considered at one time in the Committee on Procedure and Privileges whether we should ask the British ambassador to come in, but the clearly understood view was that it would be a breach of diplomacy to expect an ambassador to be answerable to a national Parliament of another country. It is within the rules of diplomacy to do what is being sought here tonight by Senator Ross. That is something that should be considered. It would be important in terms of its impact and would show concern by the Government. It would also show that environmental, green and health issues are everybody's issues, <Col N="579" /> that they are mainstream issues on which we are prepared to take on our strongest allies. We would have to describe the UK as our strongest ally and our nearest neighbour. It is not something we would do lightly and I do not suggest it be done in any way that would be offensive. It is a matter of us placing on the record formally and firmly that we believe the plant at Sellafield is a danger to us, our safety, our health, our environment and our future, and, therefore, we should take the strongest possible line on it. That is the message we ask the Minister of State to give to the British ambassador so that the British Government is clear on it. I know it is not an easy thing to do.</P>
    <P>I say, with some regret, that I have raised this issue with some of the trade union movements on the other island and I have got less than a supportive response on the issue which revolves around the areas of employment and investment in Cumbria. Both Governments should be prepared to ensure that the neighbourhood which might lose a huge investment if Sellafied were to be closed would be compensated by a different kind of investment. We need to recognise that what we are suggesting here has import beyond what we are talking about. It is important that those living there recognise&mdash;</P>

      <P>Like my colleagues, I welcome the Minister of State to the House and congratulate him on his drive, initiative and persistence in dealing with this issue which has dogged the country, particularly the east coast, since its inception over 40 years ago. In supporting the Government amendment to the motion, I do not disagree fundamentally with the sentiments expressed in the motion. It is a particularly good idea and probably has broad support across the House, but the timing of such an act is inappropriate. In politics as in so many other facets of life, timing is everything.</P>
      <P>A few facts about Sellafield are worthy of repetition and of placing on the record. It is the largest nuclear complex in the United Kingdom. One immediately wonders at the location of such a huge complex in such an isolated part of the United Kingdom, but we are all well aware of the reasons for its location. It is nearer to this building than the homes of a significant number of the Members of these Houses. That is a fact which can sometimes be lost. The Irish Sea tends to be classified in our minds with other great oceans, but we forget that at its narrowest it is less than 13 miles wide and Sellafield is less than 100 miles from where we sit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="580" />Another fact that is worthy of mention is that Sellafield used to be known as Windscale, a matter to which some of my colleagues referred. Some PR man made a fortune out of the change of name, but he would have made more had he designed a new logo. The perceived necessity for a change of title, as Senator Lydon said, is an inherent admission of the difficulties and the negativity surrounding the place. Senator Lydon mentioned Long Kesh, which was changed to The Maze. My slightly mischievous sense of humour thought of the caterpillar of official Sinn Féin metamorphosing into the butterfly of The Workers' Party which, eventually flew away. I do not suppose there is such an easy solution to Windscale-Sellafield.</P>
    <P>I live approximately 80 miles from Sellafield and have lived there all my life. Unfortunately, with a slow burner of a political issue such as this &ndash; no pun is intended in the use of the phrase &ndash; a high degree of immunity usually develops on the part of the suffering victims. This is very much the case with Windscale-Sellafield. Windscale-Sellafield is not a good neighbour, nor is the State which sponsors it. Windscale-Sellafield is a dirty neighbour. It is a bad neighbour in that it shows absolutely no respect for its neighbours and the spokespersons for Windscale-Sellafield have been shown to be liars in the falsification of the records. That is worthy of repetition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Glennon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to think I am not known for intemperate language, but I would use the word again. The management of Windscale and of the State which sponsors it, in being parties to the falsification of records relating to the emissions from the plant, lied. There is no greater insult that one neighbour can throw at another. It shows an absolute lack of respect and can only lead to a negative reaction, such as we are seeing at present and have seen for many years. Under the auspices of the Minister of State, we are seeing a positive reaction to decades of insults and offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The United Kingdom does not appear to have any shame in relation to Windscale-Sellafield, which is no real surprise. The UK authorities are not ashamed of having commissioned the MOX plant in the face of widespread public international pressure. They do not feel shame because of the ludicrous safety bonus paid to Sellafield's chief executive, an obvious admission of inherent danger which is denied by a spin campaign. They are not ashamed of having to spend millions of pounds on public relations and security each year, or of the deception and concealment perpetrated by PR people in response to numerous negative reports produced by countless scientists of international standing from various countries. Heretofore, the principal fear in relation to Windscale-Sellafield has been of leakage or a repeat of the fire which took place some years ago. Since 11 September, however, we have <Col N="581" /> to face the possibility of international terrorist attacks on the power station.</P>
    <P>I wish to briefly mention my experience in the north east of England about a week after the Chernobyl disaster in 1986. I met a friend who worked in a nuclear plant in the region and I asked him his thoughts about the job in the light of the previous week's events. He told me that things had been very simple until the previous week, as he used to be sanitised when he came out of the reactor after his shift. After the Chernobyl incident, however, he was sanitised before he went in, as the radiation levels in the atmosphere outside the reactor were far higher than inside it. A Senator mentioned earlier that the distance to Chernobyl from here is 20 times greater than the distance from Windscale-Sellafield, which puts into perspective the difficulties that would arise on this island if a catastrophe was to occur in Cumbria.</P>
    <P>On 14 June last, I raised the issue of Sellafield and was supported by Senator Maurice Hayes, who referred to &ldquo;criminal mismanagement and disregard for safety precautions&rdquo; on the part of the Sellafield authorities. The reference in the Government's amendment to the fact that &ldquo;the issue of Sellafield is being discussed at the British Irish Council&rdquo; is worthy of consideration. The council has great potential for the future of this island, arising as it does from the Good Friday Agreement. I am very interested to note that Sellafield is under discussion at the council and I am certain that it represents the way forward. The Government has formed an alliance with the Isle of Man and I assume our concerns are shared in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. In normal circumstances, I would agree with the thrust of the motion, but I support the amendment as the timing is inappropriate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Senator Ross on putting this motion before the House. Good business management does not involve explaining why certain targets were not achieved or why success was not forthcoming; it is about getting things done. I have to confess that I am amazed that we are debating the scandal of Sellafield once more in February 2002. Two years have passed since it was revealed that BNFL had deliberately and systematically falsified safety statistics over a long period of time. Senator Glennon and others have used the word &ldquo;lies&rdquo; and I agree that lies were told. The revelations destroyed for me forever the credibility of the company that runs Sellafield and shamed the British Government, which so slavishly protects every move made at Sellafield. The scandal of the falsified figures brought about a radical change in public opinion and attitudes along the east coast, for example, in Newry, the home town of Senator Maurice Hayes who was mentioned by Senator Glennon, Dundalk and Skerries. The deception was the last straw and suddenly people had enough. Those who had listened to people talking for years started to want something to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="582" />I made an accusation in relation to the sincerity of Government policy during a debate in this House at the time. The Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, listened to my points but I know he did not agree when I said the Government was pulling its punches as it did not want to upset its relationship with the British Government on Northern Ireland. The Government was making all the right noises by way of public protest, but its body language transmitted a different message. In effect, I charged the Government at that time with giving the UK the impression that regardless of what it said in public, it was not really all that pushed about Sellafield, a charge which was greeted with shock and horror. The Minister of State said the Government was perfectly sincere and that it appreciated the change in public attitude. From then on, he said, the Government would be tougher and more aggressive than ever and no stone would be left unturned to ensure that Sellafield was closed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I remember Senator Quinn's comments. As we were discussing the matter, the Government was doing the preparatory work for the legal case which we have now embarked upon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not disagree with the Minister of State, but the Government's assurances are beginning to sound a little hollow, two years on, in the light of what has and, particularly, what has not happened in the interim. My accusation is beginning to look even more credible than it did at that time. What has the British Government done since the falsification of the safety records? It did not close Sellafield, which was considered possible, or restrict its scope, which we considered far more likely. The startling thing about the last two years is that Sellafield has been extended by the United Kingdom. The risks, which were unacceptably high anyway, have been greedily multiplied.</P>
      <P>One could understand the tenacity of the British Government's attitude to Sellafield if it had a military or national security dimension, but it has not even attempted to make such an argument. The scope of the facility has been increased for purely commercial purposes; the United Kingdom has equated its national interest with greed. As Senator Glennon and others said, this House is closer to Sellafield than the homes of many Senators. I had not thought of it in that way, but it is a well-worded explanation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people of Ireland and a large part of Europe have been put at risk for the sake of simple greed. As part of its commercial strategy, the UK is prepared to quibble, prevaricate and hide behind every fig leaf it can find and it has searched for many. When all else fails, the British authorities are prepared to renege on every promise that has been made in the past and to cover up every new instance of risk. I suggest that they are prepared to lie through their teeth, if necessary. Like Senators Ross and Glennon, I do <Col N="583" /> not use the word &ldquo;lie&rdquo; too frequently, but it seems to me that the British Government smiles politely as it does exactly that. Would it dare indulge in such brazen behaviour if it was not sure the Irish Government would tolerate it? Would they have dared to take such an arrogant and dismissive attitude as they did at the international tribunal if they had not known in advance that they were fighting against a straw man, someone whose heart was not really in it?</P>
    <P>Much of what has been said here tonight is to do with those legal shenanigans. The past few years have shown the legal moves the Minister has talked about for what they really are, a convenient way of buying time and waiting for public anger to abate. A matter like this will always be settled ultimately by political means rather than by recourse to the courts. That is why I support Senator Ross's motion.</P>
    <P>What is needed now and has been needed all along is a strong political initiative by the Government. The task is very simple, to convince the British Government that the Irish people mean business on this issue and will not take no for an answer. They will demand that something happens. Much will be made of the international allies the Government has gathered and the legal actions of the last couple of years. The reality is that it is only when the Taoiseach leads a delegation of other European Prime Ministers to 10 Downing Street and demands comprehensive and immediate action that this much talked about international alliance will have any real meaning. We need support at the political level, not just at the legal level. The Government has not understood the vehemence, the strength of feeling in the country on this issue. I worry that if they have not understood it and done something about it, they may find that their lack of action will become an important political issue in the general election.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I warmly congratulate Senator Ross on having brought this very important motion before the House. I am a little concerned that the sentiments expressed in the amendment are not being addressed seriously enough by the Government. We can see that a catastrophic accident, so well described by the Minister, would have a terrible effect on all of us and on a very large area of western Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are in a very poor position regarding the effect of low dose radiation, perhaps from Sellafield. Studies carried out in this country have been thoroughly gone over in recent years by Doctor Geoffrey Deane, the former head of the Medical Social Research Board. He found we had no evidence to show that there was an increase in Down's syndrome or anything like that. We are leaving ourselves in a weak position to show any abnormalities because those in Sellafield could point to our own problems regarding pollution and suggest that various conditions are due to the <Col N="584" /> pollution on this island rather pollution from Sellafield.</P>
    <P>When Doctor Margot Wallstrolm, the EU Environment Commissioner, was here recently she pointed out the particular problems we have with water pollution and waste disposal. She commented on the latest report from the Environmental Protection Agency and highlighted in particular the dangers of nitrate pollution. We all know that there is an EU nitrate directive, I think since 1992. We have not brought it into effect in this country yet. Some 38% of our ground water is polluted. Rural supplies are polluted by faeces as well as by nitrates and phosphates. A large proportion of the country is affected by a high proportion of nitrates in the ground water due to the abuse of fertilisers and slurry.</P>
    <P>Radiation can cause an increase in instances of cancer. However, it can also be caused by an increase in the level of nitrates in the ground water. It would be very hard for us to suggest that perhaps the increase in oesophageal cancer in this country is due to our proximity to Sellafield when they might raise the nitrates in our ground water. It is the sort of thing we need to clean up rapidly so that if there are deleterious effects to health on this island, we can demonstrate that they do emanate from an extraneous source, if that it is the case, and are not due to our own problems.</P>
    <P>Another appalling statistic came out recently from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, which conducted research throughout Europe on the incidence of congenital defects in children. We do not get a proper survey of this in Ireland to show the level of congenital defects on a provincial or even more local basis. These surveyors, who looked at 23 landfill sites all over Europe, found that women who gave birth and lived within three kilometres of old landfill sites had a 40% higher risk of chromosome abnormality in pregnancy than mothers who lived between three and seven kilometres from such sites. A previous study showed a 33% increase in the prevalence of non-chromosonal congenital abnormalities such as spina bifida, cleft palate, heart and gastrointestinal anomalies in children born to women who lived within the three kilometre limit.</P>
    <P>We know that the east coast of this country is alive with the most appalling landfill sites. It will be very hard for us to show that the effects of any problem here are due to Sellafield unless we make an effort to clean up our own situation. It is dreadful to think that in County Wicklow, the Minister's county, there is apparently an enormous amount of toxic waste in the landfill sites. In other areas there is hospital waste, which could include radioactive products. In order to demonstrate the damage Sellafield is doing to us we have to be very careful to make sure that we have a baseline here from which we can work. The faster the Government tightens up the regulations regarding landfill and does something about those who flout the laws by bringing them before <Col N="585" /> the courts the better. The nitrate directive should also be introduced as fast as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all the Senators who contributed to this debate. I thank the Minister in particular for departing from his supplied script. I appreciate that. When Ministers come in with a script prepared for them by civil servants it is sometimes very frustrating for those of us who put effort into the debate to be then read back something which is quite obviously not a response to the debate.</P>
      <P>What the Minister had to say was extremely interesting, very novel and convincing to an extent. I have no doubt that we are all on the same side on this issue. There is no political difference about the ultimate objective of this motion. The difference is about the vigour, the enthusiasm, and whether there is a genuine push by the Government to have Sellafield closed down or whether, as Senator Quinn suggested, they were really playing for time. I would put it a little more strongly. The moves the Governments has taken, while they may have limited value in themselves, show less than complete commitment to closing down Sellafield.</P>
      <P>I say that because we have asked in this motion that the Government call in the British ambassador and issue a formal protest but we have had all sorts of excuses as to why that is not a good idea. We are told that the timing is wrong, an old political excuse. The Minister himself said that we had gone beyond the stage of calling in ambassadors, that things had gone so far that we now had the Taoiseach talking to the British Prime Minister on this issue. I wonder, and I will tell the Minister why. We never called in the ambassador before we reached this stage. We have not called in a British ambassador for about 30 years as far as I know. There is a reluctance on behalf of the Government to call in ambassadors because we are frightened of them for other reasons. We do not call in the American ambassador when we disapprove of many of the things the Americans are doing throughout the world. We do not call them in when they execute people, though we disapprove of judicial executions. We do not do that for political reasons, because we have a political alliance with and a political fear of the Americans. For the same reasons, we are reluctant to call in the British ambassador.</P>
      <P>It was, I think, Senator O'Dowd who put his finger on this particular flaw in the argument when he said that the Taoiseach should talk to the British Prime Minister about this issue because it is outside the remit of ambassadors. What do the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister say to each other when they meet? Senator O'Dowd put his finger on it &ndash; we do not know. Nobody ever tells us. Nobody ever gives us transcripts of those conversations, or a video of the Taoiseach thumping the table and saying that Sellafield must close.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government, the Minister of State with responsibility for energy at the Department of <Col N="586" /> Public Enterprise and members of the Opposition know full well what they say. They go through the motions and suggest platitudes. They tell each other that there are political reasons this has to happen, and I understand perfectly why they have to do this. Let us be honest about it, they understand each other's position and they go away having achieved absolutely nothing.</P>
    <P>It would disturb the British Government if we did display our disgust at what is happening in a more public way. I am not talking about court cases. A summons to an ambassador in order to make a protest is a very serious event, and it displays that sentiment throughout the world. That is why it is important that this should be done.</P>
    <P>Of course the Minister of State's efforts are genuine. In some ways, he has been wronged on this issue. He has been genuine, has put a lot of time into it and has been very sincere in his efforts. The reality is that he has achieved absolutely nothing. Due to the MOX plant, the situation is now worse than it was four years ago when the Government came into office. We cannot just sit back and say that we are taking a court case here, or a court case there. We lose all the court cases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise the case of Ballyleague national school, County Roscommon. The school was constructed in 1955 so it is 47 years old. The staff and the board of management of the school have acted in an exemplary fashion, particularly in recent years, in their efforts to maintain the interior and exterior of the building. A building of this age requires an increasing amount of maintenance and this work has been achieved with the assistance of the parents' support group.</P>
      <P>The board of management, the parents' support group, the INTO and anyone who has seen the interior or exterior of the school will agree that the building is seriously substandard and requires complete renovation for several reasons. The school has two special needs pupils who are currently being taught by the resource teacher in a cloakroom which measures 4 sq.m. There is no other facility available in the school for those children or their teacher. The board of management, the parents' support group, the INTO and the Department of Education and Science agree these conditions are totally detrimental to the confidence and self-esteem of special needs pupils.</P>
      <P>The learning support teacher responsible for pupils with normal remediation needs works in the remaining cloakroom which also measures 4 sq. m. The learning support programme and special resource programme are, therefore, based in cloakrooms as the concerned parties said. I consider that an absolute disgrace and no doubt the Minister's officials would concur.</P>
      <P>In addition, children are being educated in an outdated prefabricated building erected in the school yard in 1972, some 30 years ago. This building, which has been patched and repaired over the years, needs complete refurbishment. My belief is that it should be disposed of because it is no longer able to resist rain or wind. It also has very defective wiring, making it a dangerous building. The pupils in the prefabricated building have access only to outside toilets. The existing classrooms in the main building do not comply with primary school guidelines as laid down by the Department of Education and Science. The two main classrooms fall far short of the recommended 76 sq. m. They are completely overcrowded, there is no wet play area, there is a lack of storage space and no conduit wiring for computer networking. The revised school curriculum plan, upon which the Department of Education and Science and all parties interested in primary education placed a great deal of emphasis, cannot be implemented in this school. Its implementation is currently very severely restricted by the manner in which teaching is carried on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The entrance corridor which houses the school library and cloakroom area is a fire safety hazard. The toilet facilities, which are of 1960s vintage, are totally antiquated. The floors are hazardous and slippery. They do not have the type of non-slip flooring which is standard everywhere nowadays. There are no proper hot and cold water facilities. Where there is hot water, there are no anti-scald devices and there are no facilities for <Col N="589" /> the disabled. There is also no shower in the school. All these things are recommended as a minimum by the Department of Education and Science's primary school guidelines. There is no staff room, no administration area, no multi-purpose room and no resource or general purpose room. Teachers have to exist in one of the classrooms.</P>
    <P>Nobody knows the background of Ballyleague better than the Cathaoirleach who has represented that area for many years. Ballyleague is one of the most rapidly growing areas in County Roscommon. It is an area in which Bord na Móna operates peat harvesting for successful peat burning stations. A new power station promised for the area will substantially increase employment. The Minister may say this area has a falling population, but I wish to contradict him. Ballyleague national school is suffering because of a lack of facilities. A nearby school in Clontuskert is already overcrowded because parents are opting to send their children there. There are better facilities in the school in Lanesboro and parents are also opting to send their children there. The average is not falling in the catchment area. Children are simply opting to leave Ballyleague national school.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister of State to give a positive reply in relation to this school. Of the worst 80 schools in the country, this is, according to the INTO, one of the worst as it is number four on that list.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Senator has given me the opportunity to outline to the House the current position of the Department of Education and Science regarding the provision of improved accommodation at Ballyleague national school.</P>
      <P>The school currently has a staffing level of a principal, two mainstream teachers and shared learning support and resource teachers. The enrolment at 30 September 2001 was 45 pupils. Current accommodation at the school consists of two permanent classrooms in the main school building, one temporary classroom and other limited ancillary accommodation. Due to the greatly increased level of activity in the primary buildings areas since the Government came to office, there has been a substantial increase in the number of major and minor building projects in construction which, in turn, has given rise to a record level of building and refurbishment activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The application from Ballyleague national school will be processed as soon as possible under the Government's expanded building programme. In the meantime, the board of management at the school should continue to use the devolved grant to address any health and safety issues. The Department is willing to consider an application for grant aid towards the cost of any proposed works of an emergency nature if they exceed the amount available under the devolved grant. I thank Senator Connor for the oppor<Col N="590" /> tunity to outline the current position to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House to discuss the matter of Mountjoy Prison visitors' centre which has changed remarkably since I had the sad privilege of visiting a number of prisoners there 25 or 30 years ago. The situation was fairly horrible then, although the staff were good humoured, friendly, decent and caring. With the redevelopment of the prison, things have become much more humane.</P>
      <P>I recently attended a remarkable play called &ldquo;Up the Flats&rdquo; written by one of the inmates of Mountjoy Prison. The play was staged by a wonderful group called the Pathways Group. While waiting in the queue I discovered I did not have my ticket and when I asked others in the queue about the routine involved, I was told I might not be allowed in. It turned out that I was talking to the playwright's proud mother. It was nice that she was able to witness her son's achievement. The shame of a prison sentence often reflects on the family and it is very important to treat them in a humane way. They are very vulnerable people. We are lucky to have such a good governor in Mr. Lonergan who makes very humane provision for the inmates.</P>
      <P>A proposal to cutback this service has shaken the families involved and they have organised a petition. A copy of the petition and an accompanying document was sent to me on behalf of the people involved. It makes the point that the services offered in the centre play a crucial role in supporting visitors, many of whom are vulnerable and in need of support. If the planned redundancies go ahead, the impact on the service would have serious consequences on the high standard of care currently offered to visitors. I intend to place some of the families' remarks on the record of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The child care service would be diminished. It is very important to look after the children of families who visit people in prison. This will impact greatly on families, children and their carers and would also have a knock-on effect on all visitors and officers involved in the centre. The children have grown accustomed to using the play facilities. To find them closed would cause great anguish to children and their accompanying carer and would obviously affect the parent they are visiting. To take it away would be similar to taking candy from a child. It would be a desperate thing to do. Serious health and safety risks would ensue if the play areas were closed and children were allowed to run freely around the centre. On the few occasions when the play area has been closed due to staff training, parents who were already under considerable strain found it difficult to keep their children occupied. This resulted in many of the children becoming over excited, running around the centre and, at times, outside. Other visitors' anxieties were seen to increase as <Col N="591" /> they worried about the children's safety, noise levels and the consequences of such behaviour.</P>
    <P>It would be difficult to maintain the current level of care given to people who appear to be under the influence of substances. This is because the focus of staff would be exclusively on issues of child safety. The constant counselling and listening support being engaged in around the centre would be affected and the noise level would be too high for anyone to sustain proper conversation.</P>
    <P>Before the centre was opened, visitors were given little regard in terms of facilities. Visitors and officers often speak about the terrible conditions that existed then and how delighted they are with the centre and the high level of service they receive. There is unanimity between the visitors and the officers on this point.</P>
    <P>One cannot deny the pressures and strains visitors of prisoners experience, no matter what their background. They need support and understanding as they often express how isolated they feel having nobody to turn to with regard to problems associated with having a loved one imprisoned. For many relatives and friends of prisoners, prison visitor centres have become places where they are welcomed with dignity and respect in a non-judgmental, non-hostile environment. The families have done nothing, yet they are punished.</P>
    <P>This imaginative opening up of visitor centres has enormously increased the self-respect of visitors and the comfort of visiting in these sad circumstances. Staff work hard at establishing and, over time, maintaining supportive relationships with all visitors. Many people visiting have described the centres as a home away from home, warm and welcoming, with an emphasis on advice, referrals and professional contact. To maintain the high standard of care to which the visitors have grown accustomed, the staff levels currently provided need to be maintained, yet nine child care workers, three project officers, a receptionist and a personal assistant are to be made redundant at the end of this month. That is dreadful.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by quoting the following remarks made by family members who have visited the prison:</P>
    <P>The staff up here are very helpful, very good humoured and always have a smile.</P>
    <P>The staff here are the nicest staff in all of the places, nice, respectable, good mannered and helpful.</P>
    <P>The staff here are very good, they are very polite, they look after the children very well. The tea bar is great.</P>
    <P>I think the staff are very good and nice and they look after the kids great.</P>
    <P>Well needed for children. Nice and clean area. Friendly staff.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="592" />The improvements here over the past few years have been much appreciated by visiting families and by staff. To reduce the staff would be a backward step. Thank you.</P>
    <P>It is a pleasure to come here and meet such nice, helpful people and to be served tea.</P>
    <P>The staff are great. I have two kids and would be lost without the play area and the support of all the staff.</P>
    <P>The staff are very helpful. I have three kids who love the crèche and would miss it very much. It also gives me a chance to sit and have a cup of tea. I think it was the best idea that was ever thought up. It would be a sin to close down this place. The staff are the best staff in any job and I hope it gets support.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister of State to do what she can to support this remarkable and humane initiative.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Norris for raising this issue and I take this opportunity to answer his concerns on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>At the commencement of the current prisons building and refurbishment programme, initiated by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the facilities available to prison visitors, especially the families and friends of persons detained in the various prisons and places of detention, were identified as an area which had been neglected for many years and which was in need of particular attention. This is borne out by the comments made by Senator Norris. It was, therefore, decided to incorporate purpose-built and designed reception facilities for visitors to prisons. These facilities are equipped with rest rooms, areas for the storage of personal belongings, tea stations, baby changing facilities and areas where children can be kept occupied. Given the comments Senator Norris read into the record of the House, these are very welcome developments. Such centres are in operation at St. Patrick's Institution, Mountjoy Prison, Mountjoy Female Prison, Castlerea Prison, Cloverhill Prison and the Midlands Prison. New waiting rooms on these lines are currently under construction at Limerick Prison and work will be starting shortly on centres at Cork and Portlaoise prisons.</P>
      <P>In 1999, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and the Religious Society of Friends were invited to jointly manage some of the waiting room areas on behalf of the Prisons Service. The importance of having non-prison personnel available to prison visitors was and is fully acknowledged by the Prisons Service. The emphasis at the outset was on volunteer involvement but the volunteer element appears to have disappeared over time and virtually everyone involved is now a paid employee of these charities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="593" />The Prisons Service fully recognises and supports the excellent work being undertaken at the visitor centres and in that context the following funding was or is being provided: in 2000, £250,862; 2001, £275,848, which was later increased to £395,948, and in the current year, &euro;571,382, or £450,000. The House will appreciate that, from these sums, considerable and increasing amounts of money have been made available by the Minister and the Department to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and the Religious Society of Friends to manage the visitor centres.</P>
    <P>However, there is a need to ensure that these centres are properly staffed and managed within realistic and appropriately controlled budgets. A cause of concern at this time are the rapidly escalating costs coupled with the loss to a great extent of the original voluntary ethos of these visitor centres. When they were first opened, a key element of their operation and the understanding with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Prisons Service, was the involvement of voluntary staff. This now appears to have been lost. In fairness, the Child Care Act imposed certain staffing obligations on the centres for which additional funding was arranged by the Department.</P>
    <P>There has been a substantial increase in the money available for the operation of the centres, as outlined in the figures I have provided, representing an increase of over 60%. However, the Director General of the Prisons Service has advised that the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and the Religious Society of Friends are currently reviewing their operations at these centres from a financial and management control perspective. The Prisons Service is contributing towards the financial costs of that review, which it is understood will commence very shortly.</P>
    <P>From what I have said, it is clear there has been a major investment in the provision of these services to visitors, which is welcomed by all the users. Senators will be aware that there are many demands on the resources available to the Prisons Service for the provision of services to prisoners and that many other voluntary groups who provide such services also receive funding directly from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It is, therefore, essential to ensure that all such funding is properly evaluated and that a balanced approach is maintained. Most importantly, it is essential to ensure that, in each and every case, the various grants are evaluated and accounted for having regard to the services involved and the needs which are being met. In this instance, it is important to remember that most visitors spend less than 20 minutes in such centres before they are called to have their visit. The Minister is satisfied that the moneys being provided will be sufficient to continue to ensure the delivery of the services required at prison waiting rooms, including the Mountjoy Prison rooms, at a level which is more than satisfactory.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I call on the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to inform the House of the outcome of his review of the scheme for naturalisation arising from an investigation instituted by him in September 1997 and which he informed the House on 4 March 1998 would shortly be determined by the Government. In March 1998, the House debated the subject of what is now termed the passports for sale scheme. I suggested then that the practice of offering Irish citizenship in return for an investment in an Irish business was no longer acceptable and I received widespread support for my views.</P>
      <P>The scheme reflected no credit on those involved, the country or its reputation abroad. During the debate in the House in March 1998, we were led to believe that the passports for sale scheme had been closed. The Minister told the House that on taking office, the Government had effectively put a stop to the scheme and had instigated a full review of the matter in September 1997. He said he expected to bring the results of the review to the Government imminently and we were given the impression that it would be done within a matter of weeks.</P>
      <P>I am a very trusting person by nature and I assumed it would be the last we would ever hear of Irish passports for sale. However, on a number of occasions in the past four years we have seen press reports which hinted in some form that the practice was still going on. The latest report, which appeared last Saturday in <i>The Irish Times, </i>referred to a number of passports being issued to members of the very wealthy Getty family in return for an investment in an Irish business. These passports seem to have been issued in 1998, at a time when we had been led to believe that the scheme was a thing of the past.</P>
      <P>Obviously it is high time to bring this matter into the open and to clear up matters once and for all. Has the passports for sale scheme definitely and permanently been ended? If it has, will the Minister of State give us the date the last passport was issued under the scheme? Will she outline the procedures in place to prevent a resurrection of this scheme at any time in the future? Is legislation planned to give statutory effect to this prohibition and if not, why? If it is the case that the scheme has not been definitely and permanently ended, the Minister of State has a raft of questions to answer. I await the elucidation of the situation with great interest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who cannot be here tonight, I am pleased to respond to the matters raised by Senator Quinn.</P>
      <P>On 4 March 1998 Senator Quinn put down a motion in this House calling on the Government to introduce legislation to outlaw the issue of Irish passports as a <i>quid pro quo</i> for investment in Irish enterprises. During the course of the debate on that motion, the Minister indicated that he could not accept the motion at a stage when the Government had yet to take decisions on a review which had been made of the scheme. He indicated that to accept the motion in the form in which it was tabled would have been premature and that he preferred to await the Government's consideration of the matter without attempting to prejudge the outcome. He also stated that if the Government decided in due course that the scheme was not to be operated in the future, he saw no need for legislation to implement such a decision.</P>
      <P>The outcome of the Minister's review of the scheme was presented to Government in the form of an <i>aide memoire</i> on 20 April 1998. As Senators will be aware, it is not the practice to publish formal ministerial submissions to Government. However, in the interests of transparency he made available for circulation in the Official Report of 25 June 1998 the substance of what emerged from the review of the scheme, together with all the statistical and other information which was appended to the <i>aide memoire</i>. It has been widely circulated since that date.</P>
      <P>The review, which focused on the operation of the scheme since its introduction, was advocated by successive Ministers for Industry and Commerce in the 1980s. It concluded that the scheme as constituted should not be re-established; failure to re-establish the scheme would not affect the situation of any wealthy individuals who wish to live in Ireland, perhaps invest in business and apply for naturalisation under existing law; and in light of legitimate expectations of those involved and the interests of those employed in the entities concerned, applications accepted for processing by the previous Government should be processed to finality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following consideration of the review, the Government abolished the scheme with effect from 20 April 1998 with outstanding applications which were made in statutory form before 4 September 1996, that being the date on which the scheme was suspended by the previous Government, to be processed to finality. In addition and without prejudice to the decision to abolish the scheme, the Government decided that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform should initiate a separate review of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, to see how it might facilitate investment and if in the course of that <Col N="596" /> review information emerged which would warrant additional legislative measures, he should consider that. The focus of this separate review therefore was to be prospective, although it would of course have to base its recommendations, in part at least, on experience gleaned from operation of the scheme to date.</P>
    <P>To assist him in conducting the review, the Minister established a review group, comprising representatives of his Department, which chaired the group, the Departments of Finance, Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Foreign Affairs, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland together with two outside experts.</P>
    <P>The Minister's stated position on a number of occasions in this matter is that the scheme stands abolished and he has no plans to reintroduce it. Senators will be aware that the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 2001, which was enacted on 6 June 2001, made extensive changes to Irish citizenship law as enunciated in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts, 1956 to 1994, but did not contain provisions which might further facilitate investment. Clearly the Minister does not intend to revisit the issue of investment based naturalisation in the context of legislative change.</P>
    <P>The report of the review group has been circulated to relevant Departments with a view to its submission to Government. As the Minister has stated publicly on numerous occasions, once the report has been considered by Government, he will arrange for its publication.</P>
    <P>Since coming into office, the Minister has naturalised 14 investors, as well as 23 spouses and minor children of investors who had previously been naturalised, bringing the total naturalised under the scheme to 178, including 71 spouses and minor children. It has been the practice of Ministers to accept applications for naturalisation of spouses and minor children of investors once an interval has elapsed following the investor's naturalisation and the Minister has continued with this practice. Of the 14 investors naturalised by the Minister, 11 had submitted applications prior to 4 September 1996, when the scheme was suspended by the previous Government. The remaining three applications were accepted by the previous Government for exceptional reasons after the scheme had been suspended.</P>
    <P>The substance of the review to which the motion refers was published in the Official Report of 25 June 1998 and has been widely publicised. The Minister has accepted no new applications from investors for naturalisation under the investment based scheme since his appointment; and the report of the second review group has been circulated to Departments with a view to its submission to Government and publication thereafter.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.45 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 28 February 2002.</P>
