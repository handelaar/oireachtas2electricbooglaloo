      <P>I have received notice from Senator Taylor-Quinn that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development to address the delays that exist in his Department relating to payments to farmers, including headage, ten and 22-month premia, suckler cow and extensification grants, the reasons for those delays and whether he is aware of the financial hardship experienced by farmers as a result of such delays.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by the Senator as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is No. 1, Residential Institutions Redress Bill, 2001 &ndash; Committee and Remaining Stages; No. 2, Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 2002 &ndash; Second Stage, to be taken not earlier than 1 p.m. with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes and of all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes and on which Senators may share time; No. 3, Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 2002 &ndash; all Stages, with the contributions of spokespersons at Second Stage not to exceed 12 minutes and of all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes. Senators may share time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreed. Again I ask the Leader whether the Government intends to incorporate the Convention on Human Rights into Irish law during this session. The Leader will be aware that it has been at Committee Stage since October 2000 and I think it unlikely that the Government wishes to progress this legislation, given the length of time for which it has been neglected.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1022" />Yesterday, Senator Coghlan raised the issue of the controversy surrounding the construction cost of the national aquatic centre. At the time, he cannot have known how far off the mark the projected costs were going to be, but it has since become evident that they are exorbitant. Such high costs will be an additional burden for the taxpayer. It is time the Taoiseach stopped passing the buck on this issue and took responsibility for it. He must tell the Oireachtas what is happening to public funds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to express my concern about taking all Stages of the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 2002, today. Throughout this week, I have said that this is not a good way to do business in this House. I recognise the urgency of the matter and do not object to its being dealt with, but I do not think there has been sufficient debate on it. My understanding was that the Leader had indicated he would introduce the Bill today, but that it would not be concluded until 26 March. I would like to hear what the Leader has to say about this.</P>
      <P>I too want to raise the issue of the national aquatic centre. We need a debate on this issue and I ask the Leader to make a commitment to organising it. The Committee of Public Accounts is one of the few committees that is not a joint committee and Members of this House need an opportunity to discuss the issue. We need to consider the impact on the taxpayer and public tendering, to assess the extent to which things have gone wrong, if indeed they have, and to be able to inform the public. There is no information available on this at the moment, just a lot of speculation.</P>
      <P>Would it be possible for the Leader, if the report of the Attorney General becomes available today, to allow the House to be adjourned, under the rules as appropriate, to facilitate a discussion in the Seanad today? We need openness, participation and engagement with these issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to confirm that we will take only Second Stage of the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 2002. Otherwise we will oppose the Order of Business. I also ask for a debate on the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution, which has made recommendations on certain matters that I consider very strange indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation regarding the national aquatic centre becomes more and more curious. Every time questions are asked more questions are generated that need to be answered. In addition to concerns about the allocation of the contract, there are now concerns regarding the exponentially increasing fees. This House has had no opportunity to address this matter, and it is not sufficient that it be addressed by a committee into which this House has no input. I agree entirely with Senator O'Toole and ask that if the <Col N="1023" /> Attorney General's report is available today, it be made available to Senators and that the Leader agree to put it on the agenda.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no reason why the House should not debate the national aquatic centre, but it is highly unlikely we will be able to do so today. Mr. Teahon has indicated, on the grounds of natural justice, that he requires more time to respond to the Attorney General's report. It was expected he would respond by noon, but that apparently shall not be the case. Otherwise I would see no reason for us not to debate the issue because it is the intention to make the report public subsequent to Mr. Teahon's reply.</P>
      <P>Issues arise from the deliberations of the Committee of Public Accounts that the House could consider, particularly the remarks of the Comptroller and Auditor General in regard to aspects of the deal. I take Senator O'Toole's point that it this is not a joint committee. It is a matter we might return to.</P>
      <P>We should debate the report of the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution, of which I and other Senators are members. There are aspects of its report that are worthy of comment. The report itself, however, is at least partially based upon observations made in previous debates in this House, so the Seanad has had an input. It should nevertheless be debated, particularly given that it impinges directly upon the manner of electing this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not disagree with the need to examine in detail the issue of the national aquatic centre, but we should be careful. The debate so far has been highly politically partisan. I was very disturbed to see what was happening at the Committee of Public Accounts yesterday. I do not know the truth of what is happening in regard to this matter, but I did see the spectre of certain witnesses being brought in and subjected to questions which were obviously directed at making political capital rather than ascertaining evidence&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that. I shall just comment on the process without referring to how the Committee of Public Accounts conducts its business. There are real dangers in a process which allows us to fling mud across the floor, in what is now a highly charged general election atmosphere, with individuals possibly suffering as a result and not receiving a fair consideration of their case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the point made by Senators O'Toole and Costello about taking all Stages of the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 2002, today. My colleagues opposed this in the House <Col N="1024" /> two days ago, when a vote was taken. I would like an indication as to what is on the agenda next week that would preclude us taking subsequent Stages next week after Second Stage today. I ask that this side of the House be facilitated in its request on that.</P>
      <P>I was trying to recall a phrase. Was it &ldquo;the most cunning, the most devious of them all&rdquo;? Could I&mdash;</P>

I ask that this House be allowed to debate this issue at the appropriate time and that we target our concerns and questions at the correct people. The Taoiseach should be number one on the list. He cannot continue to hide on this issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been asked on the Order of Business during the week about the European Convention on Human Rights Bill, 2001. The Bill was referred by the Dáil to committee on Wednesday of this week, and I will inform the House of developments on next Tuesday's Order of Business.</P>
      <P>In response to Senator Coghlan's query yesterday, the Court and Court Officers Bill, 2001, will be taken in the House next Thursday. Senators Coogan, O'Toole, Costello, Dardis and Avril Doyle expressed views about Sports Campus Ireland. The Deputy Leader of the House has correctly pointed out the necessity for natural justice. However, I will consult with the leaders and the Whips next week to arrange for a debate on this before the Easter recess. If necessary I will forgo Fianna Fáil Private Members' time on Wednesday night. There is no free time next Tuesday and Wednesday from 10.30 a.m. until 12 midnight. We may be able to conclude by 8 p.m. or 8.30 p.m. on Thursday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1025" />Next week is devoted to legislation that has already been initiated. For the benefit of those Senators who may not have been here for the Order of Business over the last few days, for one reason or the other, the position next week, as everyone knows, is that it is a week for finalising legislation. Regarding this proposal, there is nothing more important and if time is not available I will forgo the Fianna Fáil Private Members' time on Wednesday evening for it.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle and Senator O'Toole mentioned the Electoral (Amendment) Bill. This was placed on the Order Paper in the usual way and dispatched to the Whips from my office on Thursday last week. It was clearly stated that all Stages were to be taken today. It is a very short Bill and I ask those Senators, and Senator Costello, to bear with us regarding its passage through the House. It went through the Dáil in one evening.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis called for a debate on the report of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution. There is much food for thought in the report, although I do not agree with many of its remarks about this House and what it has stood for and achieved. Since 1997 the Seanad has transformed its way of doing business and we have initiated <Col N="1026" /> over 60 Bills here since then. That means we have had a major role in the successful processing and implementation of legislation and reports by the Government. I thank all parties for their wonderful contributions and for the businesslike way in which affairs in this House are conducted. I hope that will be enhanced.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with certain statements in the report of the constitutional committee. In addition, I, as Leader of the Seanad, was not invited to make a submission to the committee before the report was published.</P>

    <P>SECTION 1.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Government amendment No. 1:</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a technical correction. The reference to a Minister of State is not necessary. A Minister of State holds his or her authority in the first instance through his or her Minister. Accordingly, the inclusion of the word &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; in the category of public body, by extension, covers a Minister of State. The amendment has no substantive effect on the Bill and is included in the interests of precision. It is purely technical.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 5, line 45, to delete &ldquo;a hospital&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;an institution&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The word &ldquo;hospital&rdquo; gives the impression of a caring service. In the context of this legislation, there were institutions which did not provide a caring service. The broader category of &ldquo;institution&rdquo; would cover all of them. It would be in keeping with the legislation that it be referred to as an institution. The psychiatric hospitals and institutions dealt with services which very often were not in keeping with what one would expect from a caring hospital. They very often did what one would expect the most crude institutional establishments to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The section states:</P>
      <P>The Minister may, by order, provide for the insertion in the <i>Schedule</i> of any industrial school, reformatory school, orphanage, children's home, special school which was established for the purpose of providing education services to children with a physical or intellectual disability or a hospital providing medical or psychiatric services to people with a physical or mental disability in which children were placed and resident and in respect of which a public body had a regulatory or inspection function.</P>
      <P>The reference to hospital relates only to the provision of medical or psychiatric services and I believe the change is not necessary. By definition, a residential institution which provides such services is a hospital irrespective of whether it bears the name. I am satisfied that the broadest range of facilities is now available for inclusion by order if they have not appeared in the Schedule, including orthopaedic hospitals, sanatoria and psychiatric care facilities. The Bill is adequate as it stands and the amendment is not necessary.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (1), line 46, after &ldquo;disability&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;or mental illness&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. I also welcome the Bill which has been greatly improved since it was first drafted. The Minister has made considerable efforts to accommodate all the people who have been damaged by the residential institutions. I would be very glad if he would accept my amendment. I am sure it was accidental that mental illness was not included. While hospitals providing psychiatric services may provide them for people with mental disability, they are much more likely to provide them for people with mental illness. Mental illness is not as common in children as it is in adults but it exists. One of the problems we have had is very poor facilities for giving residential care to children with mental illnesses. They frequently have had to be placed in adult units. Unfortunately, this is where some of the people who have spoken to me were subjected to abuse.</P>
      <P>This continues even today. I am in correspondence with the Minister for Health and Children about a 12 year old child who has had serious mental illness for the past four years. Despite receiving good out-patient care the consultant psychiatrist involved feels she needs in-patient care. There are only six beds available for children in this region. The consultant psychiatrist is loath to place such a child in an adult psychiatric institution. Unfortunately, that had to happen. I would be glad if the Minister would accept this amendment which includes the people who are most likely to go to psychiatric hospitals, namely, those with mental illness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Senator's point regarding children who suffered from mental illness as opposed to those with a mental disability. In this instance, disability is to be understood in its legal sense. To be under a disability includes suffering from a mental illness as well as being under an intellectual disability. I am satisfied that the Bill as it stands provides redress for victims of abuse in a wide variety of residential institutions, including hospitals for people suffering from mental illness. I do not have an objection to adding the words &ldquo;or mental illness&rdquo;, but from a legal and drafting perspective, it is not necessary. I do not think it will do any damage to the Bill and I am prepared to accept the amendment if the Senator presses it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be most grateful if the Minister accepted it. Whatever may be said about legal terms, in common parlance there is a difference between mental disability and mental illness. It will make a big difference to those who feel they suffered from a mental illness and were put in such an institution. Those who were put in such institutions are of greater importance than how the section may read legally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to someone who has already received an award from a court or a settlement of an application relating to abuse which occurred in an institution listed in the Schedule. There is concern that the matter may have been dealt with earlier without full information being available or that a person might have accepted an award from a court out of keeping with what the proposed board might grant. Much information, such as files which were not available, has come into the public domain and a new attitude is abroad, all of which colours the manner in which decisions are made and awards granted in compensation by the board. It is inappropriate that anyone, who appeared before a court or accepted a settlement in different circumstances, should be excluded from access to the board.</P>
      <P>I want to see the section which prevents people, who have been before a court or accepted a settlement, from appearing before the board deleted. All of the 30,000 young people in institutional care from the 1930s to 1970 should be entitled to appear before the board if they have grounds for doing so. We should be open and generous because we want to put this matter to rest, give people the opportunity to make their case and not leave anyone outside with a grievance. Certain people will feel aggrieved if this section stands as they will not have the opportunity to access the board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

      <P>The Senator proposes that section 7(3) be removed which would permit people to make an application to the redress board when the case had already been the subject of a determination preceded by a hearing in the courts. To allow this would provide that a case, which was not established in court, could receive compensation from the redress board. This would greatly discredit the compensation scheme and encourage unmeritorious claims. It would also be undesirable that the redress board should second guess the judicial process. It is a fundamental principle of our democracy that courts provide the ultimate route to redress. The purpose of the Bill is to provide an intermediate route which will meet the needs of the vast majority in order that they are not put to the expense and worry of litigation.</P>
      <P>I am conscious, however, that this process is subordinate to the courts, not the other way round. Potential litigants have nothing to fear in turning to the redress board as a first route and nothing in the Bill could remove his or her right to redress through the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not addressed the point. He said the court is the ultimate process through which to deal with matters, but, if that were so, that would be the way forward rather than passing this legislation. I thought the <Col N="1031" /> whole purpose of the legislation was to get away from the adversarial nature of the court because, very often, a court is not about justice but about arguments, put-downs and money, and access is enabled because of financial means rather than open access. It is not accurate to say that the legal process is the ideal or ultimate one.</P>
      <P>If the Bill is to work, it must be concerned with getting to the truth, not involve an adversarial contest. That is what occurred in previous cases that went through the courts when people presenting their cases may not have had the necessary but expensive legal expertise at their disposal. We are presenting a forum in which a person has a level playing field to get to the truth about what happened to him or her. Therefore, if someone has already gone to the courts, whether the case was upheld, it is irrelevant. The point is that someone may believe that he or she has a case to bring to the board. The amendment proposes that, irrespective of what may have happened before, such a person should be able to access the board. The Minister should not put a barrier, for whatever reason, in front of such people or talk about the ultimate legal process as a way of addressing matters. He should agree that subsections (2) and (3) should be deleted, although the former is not specifically mentioned in the amendment.</P>

      <P>This section refers to a case which has been argued fully in court. It deals with the instance of a case which might not have been fully argued in court and states in subsection (7) that a determination referred to in subsection (3) shall not include a determination concerning the Statute of Limitations or an interlocutory matter, that is, where a case was not fully argued. The Senator's concerns, therefore, are covered in part. The danger is that we would create a situation where a person could go to court in the first instance and then go to the redress board if he or she was unhappy with the court. There is also the matter of second guessing the courts.</P>
      <P>We are trying, however, to establish circumstances in which the cases in question would be dealt with in an effective, speedy way. Any change in circumstances would be considered and people would be open to make a case should that emerge. As it stands, the section meets the principal requirements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not labour the point but I am disappointed with the Minister's response. I know what he is referring to in section 7(7) of the Statute of Limitations, which allows much leeway in respect of people going to the courts, but I am referring to cases on which a court has already made a determination. An entirely different atmosphere and set of circumstances pertained in the past, as well as a major denial of responsibility. Until recently, there was a view abroad that this type of criminal behaviour did not take place in these institutions. Few people believed it did because everything was swept under the carpet. They did not believe that politicians could be corrupt, that banks could steal money from their own customers or that there could be corruption within the church. They did not believe that Christian Brothers, priests or other people charged with the care of children could perpetrate terrible cruelty on them. A number of cases would have been taken in that atmosphere when a court of law and the whole adversarial system would not have been sympathetic in any circumstances.</P>
      <P>The amendment does not compel anybody who has been before a court to go before the board, but it leaves the way open for them to do so if they still have a grievance or believe they did not get adequate compensation. A small number of people have already done that because they have written to me. I tabled this amendment because a small number of people believe they got a raw deal when they went through the legal process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has made a number of amendments to date in the spirit of the legislation. He was kind enough to accept Senator Henry's amendment, which I agree has improved the <Col N="1033" /> legislation, and I ask him now to allow anybody who wishes to come before this tribunal to put a case to the board on the manner in which they were treated to do so. I am not saying many people will take up the offer but the people who have written to me would be anxious to do that.</P>

      <P>While I realise the earlier amendments were ruled out of order because the House cannot impose a charge on the Exchequer, this issue is pivotal in terms of the legislation. Everyone here is in agreement with the thrust of the legislation but I hope the Minister will be as open to my proposals as he was to Senator's Henry's earlier.</P>
      <P>I remind the Minister that on 11 May 1999, the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, apologised on behalf of the State for the non-intervention in cases of childhood abuse. He did not apologise only to those who were abused between 7 p.m. and 7 a.m. but to everybody who suffered such abuse. That is the principle underlying my amendment. On 8 March this year the Minister stated: &ldquo;A way must be found to deal with day school cases.&rdquo; A great deal of time has passed since then but there has been no move forward in that respect.</P>
      <P>I want to outline the reasons behind the thrust of the amendments that were ruled out of order. The victims were abused by persons whose position in the school had been sanctioned by the State which has given the apology. The abusers were paid by the State and the teachers and principals in the day schools operated under national school rules established by the Department of Education and Science. School attendance is mandatory and during the hours a child is required to remain at school the principals and teachers act <i>in loco parentis</i> and are, therefore, an extension of the State, be they day or residential pupils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The argument the Minister puts forward against including day school victims in the Bill is based on the fact that a child at school has the opportunity to complain about the abuse when they get home, but the majority of children who were abused would have felt they had done some<Col N="1034" /> thing wrong and, in the majority of cases, would not have raised the issue at home. Many cases went unreported, yet the Minister wants to exclude these victims from the legislation. Having regard to the respect with which authority figures were held at the time, a child making an allegation against a teacher would not have been believed and, in all probability, would have been punished.</P>
    <P>Pursuant to the new comprehensive approach announced by the Taoiseach on 11 May 1999, the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act, 2000, established a commission to investigate child abuse in institutions and to enable persons who suffered such abuse to give evidence to the committees of the commission. Included in the definition of &ldquo;institution&rdquo; in that Act is &ldquo;a school&rdquo;. In the context of the apology made by the Taoiseach, the new comprehensive approach to the victims of sexual abuse and the presentation of the 2001 Bill, it is irrational, unjust and discriminatory to exclude victims of sex abuse in any day schools from provisions and benefits that would accrue to residential pupils in the Bill. At all times the conduct was criminal and the victims of crime should not be discriminated against in the manner envisaged by the provisions of the Bill. If one was attacked on the street and sought redress, would that redress be based on the income one earned, one's occupation, the school one attended or whether one was a day or residential pupil? Surely the law is intended to be equitable to everybody in the State, irrespective of those factors. The State is vicariously liable for the tortuous acts of the teachers and is liable to victims of such abuse.</P>
    <P>I want to quote from a debate on Lister &amp; Others <i>v.</i> Hesley Hall in the House of Lords on 3 May 2001 which states that the argument that the state is not vicariously liable for the acts of the teacher is rejected. It further states that the state paid for the salary of the teacher, created and monitored the rules and regulations under which the teacher performed his duties and exercised a fundamental control over the school and teachers, the manager of the school being placed in the position of a trustee of an educational trust. In another case, McEneaney <i>v.</i> Minister for Education 1941, the Department of Education was the <i>de facto</i> employer. The perpetrators of abuse in day schools were, as in the case of children in residential care, subject to inspection and regulations by a public body. Due to its negligence and a breach of duty, the State failed the victims while they were in school and now the State is failing the victims again.</P>
    <P>The only avenue open to day pupils who are excluded from this Bill will be to seek redress in the civil courts. This is not the route they should have to take. They are equal in the eyes of the State to everybody else and should be treated equally. However, the lack of provision in this Bill for those day pupils indicates there is one law for some people and another law for others.</P>

      <P>Senator Coogan put the case very well for including day pupils in this legislation. The Minister agreed to sympathetically examine this matter. I cannot understand why he has not agreed to include day pupils in the final legislation. Ironically, the last point made by Senator Coogan &ndash; the Minister also made a point about the civil courts &ndash; is that the civil courts will be the only form of redress for the people in this category. They will have to go through the full gamut of the legislation and the time and expense involved in going through the adversarial system, if they are to get redress. This is discriminatory. The Minister is treating one category of victim differently from another, although they were in the same institutions under the same administration and management and abused by the same people. How can he put through legislation of this nature? It is a disgrace.</P>
      <P>Day pupils would perhaps have known the residential pupils, but the day pupils will have no access to this board. The Minister has gone through this legislation in the Dáil and it is now in the Seanad, but he is not prepared to accept an amendment on this matter. It is my firm belief that the legislation is unconstitutional unless the Minister accepts an amendment to this effect. The Minister cannot discriminate in this fashion. The day pupils were victims in exactly the same way as the residential pupils. The Minister, in saying he will deal with the residential pupils but not the day pupils, is drawing a line on the paper and not doing anything in a legal context. What advice did the Minister get from his legal draftsmen and the Attorney General on this matter? Did the Attorney General say he believed that it was constitutional to do something of this nature? How could the Minister justify leaving out the day pupils from the legislation? It is a disgrace to do this and to consign them to the existing process of having to go through the civil courts to get redress.</P>
      <P>I will oppose this section unless the Minister introduces an amendment. Ruling out our amendment &ndash; to which I added an amendment that was in the name of Senator Burke &ndash; to this section on the grounds that it would impose a charge on the Exchequer is against the principle of what we are seeking to do. That is to ensure this legislation will do the job the Minister stated on Second Stage was its purpose, to air grievances, deal with the abuse that took place and provide a forum which would be different from the court forum which was the only one that existed hitherto. I hope the Minister will accept his principles and the thrust of his argument and include the day pupils in the legislation, which would improve it no end.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>We listened to Senator Coogan's quotations from learned legal people who made a big story about this, but they missed one basic point. There is a substantial difference between the position in Britain and the position in Ireland as regards day schools. The Taoiseach spoke of the residential institutions controlled by the State. That is to what he was referring. He made those quotes on that occasion in relation to those reports that were brought to him.</P>
      <P>In preparing a compensation scheme for victims of abuse in childhood, the Government considered a range of issues such as the legal liability of the institutions, their owners and public bodies, society's wider moral responsibilities, the nature of the institutions where children were cared for, the circumstances of the children and their vulnerability.</P>
      <P>In the case of residential institutions, publicly funded authorities had formal and, in most cases, statutory responsibility for placing the children and for regulating the institutions. These public bodies, in a sense, jointly with the owners of the institutions replaced parents as the natural protector and the care giver of the children concerned. This conferred on the State a special legal and moral responsibility of a kind which did not apply in the case of children who continued to live in their homes and in the community.</P>
      <P>The residential institutions, in their ethos and purpose, were also very different from ordinary schools. Unlike ordinary schools, they controlled every aspect of the life of the children living in them from waking up in the morning to going to sleep at night. This included food, clothes, education, play, health and moral development. Many of the children had no parents or were removed from their parents. Therefore, the parents and the children had no say whatsoever in the children's lives. The situation could not be more different for children in day schools who spent only a few hours each day in school and who had the care and protection of their parents before each school day began and when it ended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is now well known that residential institutions require careful regulation by independent outside agencies. For much of the period up to the 1960s this fact was not realised by those with authority or their powers were poorly exercised. Given the weakness and vulnerability of the child <Col N="1037" /> who has been deprived of parental care in such a situation, failure on the part of the authorities has very serious consequences for the children who were otherwise alone in the world. In these circumstances, there is a moral duty on the State to provide redress and support where injury consistent with abuse is established.</P>
    <P>In the case of ordinary schools, public authorities did not have this level of responsibility and did not have the powers to intervene which they had in the case of residential institutions. The schools, to a very significant degree, were highly autonomous institutions for which the State had functions in respect of academic standards and professional teacher qualifications.</P>
    <P>There are also practical reasons day schools are not included in this particular kind of compensation scheme. The scheme deliberately has a very low validation threshold for claims of abuse &ndash; this was discussed in both Houses &ndash; precisely because of the general condemnation of conditions in the residential institutions concerned.</P>
    <P>The Kennedy report into reformatories and industrial schools, published in 1970, confirmed that the institutions were often harsh beyond acceptable standards, as many people knew or suspected. We have heard since then many accounts of abuse in institutions, with particular public attention paid to them in the last four years. All accounts paint a picture of almost universally bleak conditions in the institutions, leaving people injured and in pain. The Government took account of this when drawing up a scheme of compensation and decided not to put claimants through the stress and pain of having to prove abuse took place. This has been criticised by some as a charter for cheats.</P>
    <P>A great deal remains to be uncovered by the commission inquiring into child abuse, but enough is known about the conditions in the institutions for us to accept that there were serious shortcomings. It is appropriate that without further delay we should provide reasonable compensation to those who can show they suffered injury consistent with institutional abuse in childhood. Although corporal punishment was the daily experience of many in day schools, it was not comparable to the regime which appears to have applied in residential schools. If issues about responsibility for abuse in day schools did not exist, there would be concerns about validation of claims. If a scheme of compensation is developed for victims of abuse in day schools, there will have to be a much more searching inquiry into abuse before compensation is paid from public funds. Such an inquiry and the determination of responsibility can be more effectively carried out by the courts.</P>
    <P>The Government has facilitated this by amending the Statute of Limitations following meetings with legal representatives of those allegedly abused in day schools. Although those who suf<Col N="1038" /> fered abuse as children in day schools are not included in this compensation scheme, the Government fully accepts that they have needs which society is obliged to meet and, for that reason, other measures put in place by the Government to address past abuse are available to them. They may avail of counselling services which have been established by the health boards for victims of abuse in childhood and the services of the commission inquiring into child abuse. One of the commission's functions is to recommend how issues of past abuse can be addressed in the interests of victims. I set out to deal with a specific and clear-cut issue, which we have broadened and which has been debated in both Houses, and a scheme to deal with it has been established.</P>
    <P>I will look to the commission to recommend how further issues should be addressed. I have said on several occasions in both Houses that the logical thing to do is to wait until the commission's work is complete and recommendations are made, which is what happens with all commissions, before deciding what is to be done. That is still the case, except in relation to former pupils of residential institutions controlled by the State. I jumped the gun in that instance by saying we should try to address those specific cases as soon as possible, as I believed a clear-cut case could be made. As Senators will know from our debates on the matter, it was not easy to make such a case, but it has been done extensively. The commission's interim or final report may make recommendations about how other cases can be dealt with. We have facilitated former day school pupils' attendance at the commission, which will consider the relevant points before making recommendations to the Government. We set out to deal, in a tight timescale, with the direct issues arising from extensive abuse in residential institutions for which the State had a high level of responsibility, in a moral sense and in the sense of its regulatory control and its involvement in placing children in the institutions.</P>

      <P>I expressed concern on Second Stage about provisions for day students who were abused. Having listened to the Minister for Education and Science today, however, I am happy that counselling services have been established and that the matter can be reconsidered following the report of the commission dealing with issues relating to child abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has made a clear distinction between the State's total responsibility for children's social, emotional and physical well-being in the 1930s and 1940s and the autonomous institutions owned by religious orders. Having thought this distinction through, I accept what the Minister says and I believe the House should do likewise. We should look at this issue again in the light of the Minister's swift acceptance of the State's responsibility for those who were abused <Col N="1039" /> in institutions. The commission inquiring into child abuse can address the concerns of day students. It is important that we make a distinction in the case of the latter group, as parents had control of students who attended between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. While I accept that this group suffered abuse, it was primarily physical. I accept the Minister's point of view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can distinguish between public and private schools, but more importantly I can see that the Minister is trying to dilute the State's responsibility. The Department of Education and Science pays teachers' salaries and sets qualification guidelines which include moral standards. As there is a strong relationship between the Department and teachers, the State is closely linked to what happens in day schools. The Department is often quick to interfere in day school matters, thereby stressing its role. The Minister is attempting to minimise the role, however, because of difficulties faced in this Bill. Neither the Minister nor I know what the commission will say as regards day pupils, nor indeed do I know what the Minister is likely to do. I can only deal with the Bill as it stands and I will do so.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, the Minister's comments today suggest that he is abjuring his responsibility, a little like Pontius Pilate. He has said the matter is out of his hands and there is nothing he can do, which suggests that he wants to wash his hands of the issue. I regret deeply that the Minister has not found a means of resolving this problem instead of splitting hairs. Former day students will not enjoy legal equality under this Bill. The Minister should review his position and take this opportunity to include day pupils in the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not convinced by the Minister's argument, as he seems to be consigning day pupils who were abused while attending school as day students to counselling services and the courts. He has nothing else to offer and is prepared to relinquish responsibility to the commission rather than dealing with the issue. It is untrue to suggest that the Minister has responded adequately to this problem, as he has put it on the long finger.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said he is dealing with the straightforward aspects of this issue and making the distinction between day and residential pupils. The distinction exists only in terms of time and living in an institution. However, in reality the abuse which occurred was the same. Those who perpetrated it were <i>in loco parentis</i>&ndash; they had control of, and were responsible for, day pupils as well as residential pupils for the period of time in which they attended the institutions. It is unacceptable for the Minister to suggest that there is a significant difference. He cannot wash his hands in this <Col N="1040" /> fashion. The principle, the victimisation, the people, the institutions, the role of the State and the role of the religious orders are all the same. How can the Minister suggest they are not comparable? They are. There is no substantial distinction.</P>
    <P>The Minister is doing a major injustice to this legislation and young, innocent children who suffered the cruellest of crimes and did not know what was happening. The Minister is suggesting that we will provide them with counselling, tell them to go to the courts and send the matter to the commission, but that is it. That is not good enough and I am not accepting it. Any argument which the Minister makes is unacceptable given the seriousness of the matter.</P>

      <P>I reject the comments of Senators Coogan and Costello and the language they have used. This has been a genuine debate up to now. We discussed this issue earlier in a logical manner.</P>
      <P>With regard to primary and day schools, we have something which we can define and on which we can act. The Senators wish to go back 40 years or more, as we are doing in the other cases, and include day schools. There were a minimum of 500,000 pupils per year in day schools over which the State did not have any direct control and did not employ those about whom we are speaking.</P>

      <P>The Senator should let me finish. If we limit the period to 40 years, that would involve 20 million children and 20 million potential cases which the Senator wishes to include. The figure may only be ten million, but we have to be realistic. The Senator suggested that we are just providing counselling and consigning the matters to the courts. We established the commission to deal with these issues, including matters involving residential institutions. It is anxious to carry out that work and has done a fine job.</P>
      <P>I stated, however, that the people concerned need to be looked after immediately and asked whether we could define the group and move ahead with the matter. The State had control over this group. Senator Coogan is incorrect in his comments about the degree of control which the State had in other schools. It is obvious it did not have that control.</P>

      <P>One would have to change the entire Bill to deal with the degrees of responsibility, authority, involvement and compensation. For this specific purpose we have changed the thresholds on which compensation will operate in order that they are very low. I have explained all this, but I am then told that I am talking rubbish. I am not &ndash; I know what I am talking about. We have provided for a low level of validation specifically because of the circumstances and the residential nature of the institutions and because, in conjunction with the groups which ran them, the State had control over the pupils 24 hours every day during which time the parents had no involvement. We have introduced a low level of validation. We would have to change the levels of validation in order that the entire legislation would have to change. We must make up our minds whether we wish the Bill to go through or to put the issue back until after the general election and see if the next Minister &ndash; it could be <Col N="1042" /> me &ndash; can start work on a new Bill and start the entire process again. In the Dáil we decided that we were not going to do that as we believed that what was being proposed was valuable and helpful to those who were seriously abused.</P>
      <P>I stated I considered cases involving young people at school which had gone to, and been proved in, court. However, the point raised in that regard was that it was unfair and inequitable to those who did not have evidence and could not make a case in court. This issue needs to be further examined to extend the provisions to that group in total. One cannot just extend it to one or two cases. That matter will require further and deeper consideration.</P>
      <P>The commission is examining all aspects of the matter and has been given all the evidence and information. It is open to it to come up with proposals as to how the matter should be dealt with in an interim or full report. However, if we open up the Bill and go back into this issue, it would put the legislation back by quite some time.</P>

We have repeatedly pointed out that the Department is not an ATM machine from which principals take money without having to decide how it will be spent. The relationship between schools and the Department is much stronger. The Minister is washing out that relationship and suggesting that his responsibility is nil or very minor. There is an implied morality in the relationship between the State, the standards of teachers and what goes on in schools.</P>

    <P>Sections 8 and 9 agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 10.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 8, between lines 34 and 35, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) Notwithstanding <i>subsection (2),</i> an applicant may apply to have his or her application heard in public and shall for that purpose waive all privilege attaching to his or her utterances to the Board under this Act or otherwise and in such circumstances no privilege shall attach under this Act or otherwise to the reporting of the utterances of the applicant in so far as they relate to an identified or identifiable person or institution.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 10(2) states that the board &ldquo;shall conduct its hearings otherwise than in public&rdquo;. The amendment provides for hearings to be held either in public or in private. I understand the Minister's concern about holding hearings in public in so far as false allegations may be made, with the result that a person's character could be called into question. As absolute privilege is granted under the legislation, no redress would be possible. The amendment provides that if people opt for a hearing in public they would waive all privilege, which means they would be subject to the sanction of the criminal law if their allegations are false or libellous. A number of people who have been abused have expressed concern that the provision requiring all hearings to be held in private amounts to a cover up.</P>
      <P>The legislation is drafted to allow people state their case, express their grievance, deal with the matter openly and put it behind them. However, allowing proceedings to be conducted only behind closed doors and for cross examination by legal teams of the church and the State creates the perception that the exercise will become one sided in favour of the perpetrator and against the victim getting a full, fair, frank and open hearing. The current provision on the conduct of hearings only in private is not in keeping with the spirit of the legislation and it does not satisfy the victims.</P>
      <P>This amendment allows people to exercise the option of having their cases heard in public provided they forgo privilege. It means they would have to tell the truth, otherwise they would be subject to the full rigours of the law. In that context false allegations could not be made. This would satisfy the needs of many who have been abused to ensure there is no cover up behind closed doors, preventing full disclosure of their case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be possible to provide that some victims could elect to have their cases heard in public while others could elect for <Col N="1043" /><Col N="1044" /> private hearings. This compensation scheme is not concerned with the administration of justice. It is not the function of the redress board to establish any fault or blame and this is specifically stated in the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Bill focuses on establishing injury consistent with abuse as alleged as a basis for an award. It does not seek to establish the facts of the alleged abuse. This allows the board to avoid making the kind of detailed inquiries which would remove the benefits of the legislation from a very large number of applicants. It also ensures that the board does not have to adhere to the very strict rules of natural justice mandated by the Constitution. In these circumstances it is essential, in the interests of fairness, that proceedings are held in private so that allegations which, to a considerable extent, will not be tested do not damage the reputation of people.</P>
      <P>I appreciate there are requirements of accountability to be met regarding past abuse and that many victims wish to confront their abusers. There are other fora for that, including the commission of inquiry into child abuse, criminal prosecution and civil litigation. It is not appropriate that this Bill should seek to create a forum where accusation, which would be impossible to prove to the requisite high degree of proof, would be made in public and where both applicant and alleged abuser could be gravely damaged and compromised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not addressed my point. He stated that the redress board is not a court of law, that there are other fora where allegations can be made. He has said that the purpose of this board will be to establish the facts regarding allegations. However, if this board is to be as sympathetic to the victims as the Minister suggests, why does section 11 give the board the authority to cross-examine the applicant? He has stated that the purpose of cross-examination is to correct any error of fact or misstatement on the part of the applicant. However, the Minister cannot have it both ways &ndash; the board is either a court of law or it is not. The board should be a forum to allow for the issue of compensation to be dealt with. Why then is the Minister introducing court of law procedures for the board? </P>
      <P>Such circumspect limitations will curtail the ability of victims to have access to a fair hearing. In this Bill, there is an over-compensation in favour of protecting the abuser and that is what concerns me most. The Minister should allow for the option of a public or private hearing and grant privilege only in the case of the latter. This would solve the problem. No abuse of privilege could take place in those circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I have tried to explain the reasoning behind this legislation, which I think is valid. Public hearings of abuse cases can be held in the courts if that is what the victims choose. Such a <Col N="1045" /> course of action is open to anybody. No one is trying to hide anything. The only intention of this legislation is to help people.</P>
      <P>My Department has attempted to address the various concerns that have been raised at all Stages of this Bill. I am legislating for the option of cross-examination in order to combat any questions regarding the constitutionality of the Bill. The board is not a court of law. It will exist purely to facilitate the granting of compensation to victims of abuse and there will be a very low level of proof. All the administrative arrangements that we have put in place are sensitive ones.</P>
      <P>When Senator Costello has had more time to consider what I have said about the functions of the board, I am sure he will agree that his concerns have been adequately addressed by the legislation.</P>

      <P>This section raises issues that are closely connected with my concerns regarding section 10. Section 11, subsection (c) states:</P>
      <P>the relevant person may, in person or through a legal or other representative, and, with the consent of the Board, cross-examine the applicant</P>
      <P>The words &ldquo;cross-examine&rdquo; are legal jargon. Either we are going to have a court of law in the board hearings, or we are not. Surely the Minister could amend this section to delete &ldquo;cross-examine&rdquo; and replace it with a word such as &ldquo;query&rdquo;. Is the Minister prepared to do this?</P>

      <P>The point I am making is that section 11 is framed in legal jargon. It appears that the legal right to cross-examine will be available only to the defendant. A person who stands accused of abuse will have the right to cross-examine a victim and both the church and the State will be able to use legal teams at these hearings, if they so wish. All of the wording in this section is geared towards the protection of the person who stands accused of abuse. One simple amendment to this section would remove the adversarial legal aspects of it &ndash; the insertion of the word &ldquo;query&rdquo; to replace &ldquo;cross-examine&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I have explained to the Senator why my Department felt it was necessary to have this clause so that we would not run into difficulty with any constitutional provisions. Anyone who wants go to the courts can do so. That is the basic position.</P>
      <P>This is a special, highly administrative method we are using. We have tried to maintain balance and address queries. For every item that comes up here some legal person indicates afterwards that they are going to do this or that, object to this or that. So we gave the right to the relevant person, if such a relevant person exists or wishes to come forward, to say, &ldquo;I did not do that, I was not involved at the time&rdquo;. On the other hand, the clause gives the right to the applicant to assert the case.</P>
      <P>This will be the exception. By covering the exception, we prevent difficulty arising for the whole redress mechanism. It is not a case of anybody trying to cover up anything, and the Senator should stop saying that. It is out of the context of the debates and discussions we have had.</P>

      <P>I understand the need for the amendment. The wording prior to this amendment meant the Minister could in theory act 12 months later, or whenever. Why one month, however? Surely seven days would be sufficient. Given the agony these people have gone through before they could summon the strength to bring their cases under this Bill, why make them wait even for another month? It is far more reasonable than what might have been interpreted, but I suggest a period of seven days. The procedure will have been followed meticulously right through. Surely, if the claim is settled and people feel it has gone some small way towards redressing their pain and hurt, a seven-day period would be more reasonable.</P>
      <P>The Minister will know exactly what has taken place, and there will no need for a lot of deliberation. I do not want Members of this House to be seen to be prolonging people's pain or the uncertainty of the outcome any longer than necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>No, most of it. There are a number of extra institutions, the difficulty is that some of them have been closed for some time. We will include them by order as they must be specified correctly. We have a system for including by order any institution not included at present. That is how they can be added.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Interestingly, as I came in, I had a note to question the Minister as to the reason Mary Immaculate School for Deaf Boys, Beechpark, had not been included in the Schedule while St. Joseph's school for boys and St. Mary's school for girls had been. When I picked up the list of <Col N="1050" /> amendments I found that the one about which I was concerned had been included, with many others not in the Bill as published. The Minister should explain what the procedure will be for any institution that is discovered subsequently not to have been included. I understand he is withdrawing the amendment because others need to be added which have been closed for some time and he will do so by order. If there are others which are not closed and need to be added subsequently&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I should explain the matter fully first. Amendment No. 17 would add an additional institution to the Schedule while I proposed to amend the Schedule generally by way of amendment No. 16.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to amendment No. 16 which I am not moving. The purpose of the Schedule is to ensure certainty as to which institutions are covered by the compensation scheme. This has presented a difficulty in view of the length of time which has passed since some of the institutions were closed down. In the case of reformatories and industrial schools, records might be substantially complete, but in the case of hospitals and special schools, the same cannot be said. Many were small institutions and their history is now obscure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill provides that the Minister may add other institutions to the scheme where they were regulated by public bodies. Even in recent days my Department has been informed of institutions which potentially come within the remit of the Bill. As I do not want to do an injustice to any potential claimant by appearing to exclude a qualifying institution, I intend, after careful research of the history of the institutions in question, to make an order listing those which should be included. In the circumstances, rather than making a further piecemeal amendment to the Schedule now, I am not moving amendment <Col N="1051" /> No. 16 and will deal with the issue comprehensively by order. In that way I can also deal with Senator Costello's amendment. As the Bill provides for affirmation of any order by both Houses, the Seanad will have an opportunity to debate any proposed revisions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 17:</P>
      <P>In page 25, between lines 5 and 6, to insert &ldquo;Bethany House, Dublin&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I was pleased to see what the Minister had presented to us in the Bill, a list running to two and a half pages of reformatories and various institutions, which had grown to seven pages when it came to the final series of amendments. It indicated that he was trawling much wider than he had done initially. The implication was that other institutions needed to be added to the list.</P>
      <P>My concern is that we can add institutions to the list under section 6(4), which allows the Minister to make additions at any time. I would still have thought it would be better to keep the present Schedule, as I am sure it contains a substantial number of the institutions involved. We will be adding some more, which the Minister can do from time to time, but surely it would facilitate the operation of the legislation if we had the main body of institutions with which we will be dealing listed in it. We could then get on with the job in hand rather than leave the list out entirely. We have no idea when the Minister will make an order and he may not be Minister in a month's time; another Minister may not be impressed by what we have dealt with and may decide to do something different.</P>
      <P>We cannot wait. We have a very impressive list of reformatories, industrial schools, Magdalen homes, orphanages and various homes with which we should go now. I have an amendment relating to Bethany House, which is closed at present, but should be in the list as serious allegations of abuse have been made. While the Minister or a future Minister can add to it, please let us have the existing list in writing in order that we have something in black and white to be going on with in relation to the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Costello asked the Minister to move his amendment rather than withdraw it, in order that we can at least start with a list. If that is so, I ask the Minister to consider Senator Costello's request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the fact that an institution, whether extant or extinct, is included in the list mean there has been an allegation of abuse against it or is it just an effort to have a complete list of every institution which may at some stage face an allegation of abuse? I need to know whether it is an indication that an institution has already had an allegation of abuse made against it. Being named on the list in the Bill &ndash; a redress Bill &ndash; means there is an <Col N="1052" /> assumption there is a case to be addressed. There is a status associated with naming an institution. We need to be clear about including institutions on the list.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is &ldquo;No&rdquo;&ndash; it does not mean there is any allegation of abuse. It means that these are the institutions which come under the terms of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Unless there has already been an allegation of abuse, is it not dangerous to include them in a redress Bill as there is an implication there is something to be addressed? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a total list. Those who may want to make a claim have to know what bodies are included under the ambit of the legislation. The list has been included for that reason. Amendment No. 16 was an addition, adding to some of the ones&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Should we name any of them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty was that it did not prove possible to get all the detail on some of the ones mentioned in time. One of the dangers is that there could be a challenge to the legislation if everything is not right. For instance, Marlborough House Remand Centre, Washer Woman's Hill, Glasnevin, Dublin 11, has been closed for a long time. If one went out to look for it, one would have difficulty finding where it was located. It is question of the health boards getting all the detail on what actually happened at the time in relation to the controls in place given the fact that it was a residential centre with a degree of State control. We are not moving amendment No. 16 now. Most of the institutions mentioned will be included by order. We can do this virtually straightaway, but there are a few in respect of which all the detail has still not been clarified entirely. It can all be done very quickly. There is no question of a delay in relation to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>We have hit on an important point. I appreciate what Senator Doyle has said in that if an institution is included in the list, is there not a presumption that an allegation has been made that abuse took place there? The Minister is going about it in this way to have a total list of institutions, but an allegation could be made against an institution at any time in the future not already included. I am concerned that the list is as comprehensive as possible. Presumably, the original list contained in the Bill has been checked and is valid. We should include the rest of those the Minister has been able to check. This legislation has to be referred back to the Dáil because we have made amendments to it. Between now and its passage through the Dáil, the Minister should check as many of the others as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The details on some of the ones included in the list are valid and I am sure have been checked already. For example, the details on the institution I have named in my amendment are valid. It should, therefore, be included in the list. There have been allegations of abuse, even though it has closed down. The Minister should include as many institutions as he can in the Schedule and the rest by order in as short a time as possible. Is it his intention to put together the final Schedule before the Government dissolves? At least, we have the Easter recess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have major concerns. I fully support what the Minister is trying to do. We are all<i> ad idem </i>in terms of what we are trying to get at. I have serious concerns, however, about a finite list of institutions, whether included now or added to by order in the coming weeks, months or whenever the Minister has in mind, being a definitive one. Will the Minister explain to me &ndash; I genuinely ask this question &ndash; the reason we cannot include in the Bill a statement referring to all residential premises and list them, that is, schools, hospitals and religious institutions? Why should we include a comprehensive list of the institutions which come within the ambit of the Bill if there is a claim or an allegation of abuse against any one of them? Why do we have to specifically name all of them? Can it not be taken that any residential institution which allowed a regime of abuse against minors in its care automatically comes within the ambit of the Bill? Why name all of the institutions? I hope the majority of institutions conducted their regimes in such a way that youngsters could flourish and grow, albeit with the handicap of having to start their lives in such institutions. Why tar them all because of the few at which we want to get? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have certain ethical problems about the approach being adopted. I know the reason the Minister is doing this &ndash; he wants to be sure that if there is a claim or allegation of sexual abuse, no institution can get out of defending its case. The rules of natural justice will apply and there will be records and so on. Would it not have been much simpler and avoided the point my colleague, Senator Costello, made in regard to the trouble to which the Minister has to go in not moving his amendment and coming back with an order, to name the generic type of institution covered and stipulate that any residential institution charged with the care of minors will come under the remit of the Bill if there is an allegation which stands up in terms of the abuse of a child in the care of the said institution? Would this not be more balanced, more all encompassing, less open to people escaping, if they happen to avoid being named, and fairer to those institutions which did their best to ensure the children they <Col N="1054" /> were charged to raise got the best possible start in difficult circumstances? A list like this is fraught with dangers. Will it ever be comprehensive?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It will have to be done at some stage and must be transparent and open in order that those who might have been residents will know it will apply to them. The major institutions concerned are already covered. There is no difficulty with them. There is a generic term within the terms of the Bill. Somebody has to include a list which has to be transparent. The rest of the institutions concerned will be included by order which will be available.</P>

There may be subsequent orders. We are talking about something which happened 40 or 50 years ago, which is the problem. There were many small operations which were used in the same way to which the Bill will also apply. I ask Senators to let us proceed on this basis. We will try to have the list, by order, well in advance of the general election, never mind the departure of the Minister which will happen at least three weeks after the election.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister, his officials and the staff of the House for their contribution to this most important Bill. In one sense the Bill has been a long time coming. Important as it is, it is only the tip of the iceberg in terms of the enormous amount of work that needs to be done to try to heal the hurt and damage that adults in different guises, be they clerical or lay, in institutions or otherwise perpetrated on young people. A frightening reminder of the extent of that damage was portrayed on a BBC television programme this week which outlined cases in County Wexford. We can never turn the clock back and completely heal the hurt or redress the damage.</P>
      <P>Some attempt must be made to help those damaged by adults in authority and charged with their care. This might be part of a public apology, on behalf of us as legislators, for the damage that was done over the years. Everyone who had authority or who was directly responsible either for those who perpetrated such crimes or perpetrated the crimes themselves must not be afraid to apologise. It should never have happened. This is a small but important step on the road to making good some of the damage that was done. Let us establish what else needs to be done. Of all types of abuse, clerical abuse is one of the greatest betrayals of trust. Let nobody be afraid to apologise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">

      <P>I too compliment the Minister and his staff on bringing this legislation forward. Any arguments that might have been seen as robust were put forward with the intention of improving the legislation and not as a criticism of what the Minister is doing. We have found one mechanism to deal with the awful damage that was done to so many innocent young people. It has taken us a very long time to do it. The State and society have been negligent in facing up to their responsibilities in this respect. I hope this goes some way towards redressing the damage that has been done. The State should be vigilant when it has a duty of care and responsibility. We must learn our lesson so that nothing of this nature ever happens again in this society.</P>

      <P>The Bill has its genesis in the findings of the High Court in a case entitled Thomas Redmond <i>v.</i> Minister for the Environment, Ireland and the Attorney General. In that case, the High Court held that the provisions of sections 47 and 48 of the Electoral Act, 1992, and section 13 and rules 8 and 9 of the Second Schedule of the European Parliament Elections Act, 1997, which required candidates to pay a deposit to be placed on the ballot paper for elections to the Dáil and European Parliament, were repugnant to the provisions of Article 40.1 of the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1057" />The net impact of that judgment is that the requirements for deposits at Dáil and European elections are no longer valid and there is, in effect, no test of the bona fides of a prospective candidate in existence in terms of their entry onto the ballot paper. The Bill before the House today seeks to address this issue, post Redmond, by providing for alternative arrangements.</P>
    <P>Before outlining the details of the Bill, it might be useful if I briefly sketch the historical background to deposits. The deposit requirement followed the practice in the UK where a deposit of £150 was first introduced as part of the Representation of the People Act, 1918. It was intended as a means of restoring the cost of candidature which had been eroded since the middle of the 19th century and to reduce the number of &ldquo;freak or propaganda&rdquo; candidates, as they were referred to, which had emerged during the war years&mdash;</P>

The deposit in the UK was increased to £500 in 1985.</P>
      <P>The deposit provision has been part of our electoral law since 1923 when the Electoral Act, 1923, provided for an amount of £100 for Dáil elections and that figure was increased to £300 under the Electoral Act, 1992. It is interesting to reread the debates when that Act was making its way through the Houses. The original proposal was for an increase in the deposit from £100 to £500 and there was a variety of views expressed including some interesting opinions in the Upper House. These ranged from maintaining the requirement at £100, requiring a deposit of £100 plus 30 signatures to having no deposit at all and 1,000 signatures. Eventually, the deposit was set at £300 and has remained at that level up to the High Court judgment last year while the deposit for European elections was set at £1,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The arguments for and against deposits are well rehearsed by this stage and were examined in detail in the Redmond case. In essence they are that, on the one hand, deposits are a necessary restraint to protect the integrity of the electoral system from non-serious candidates and, on the other, the need to have an open democracy with no financial penalty on any person wishing to stand as a candidate. Whatever the arguments and their respective merits, the deposit, up to the <Col N="1058" /> Redmond case, was a well established and accepted feature of our electoral system. It appeared to be the simplest and, at the same time, most satisfactory way of establishing the serious intent of a candidate.</P>
    <P>However, while it may well have established the earnest of a candidate, there is no evidence that the deposit requirement deterred many would-be candidates at Dáil elections. The lack of increase in the amount means that the real value has fallen dramatically since it was originally introduced and the statistics on the number of candidates standing at elections would seem to support that contention. At the last three general elections 370, 481 and 484 independent candidates respectively were nominated. The number of candidates increased by 30% in 1992 after the deposit was increased from £100 to £300. Interestingly, the constitutionality of deposits was questioned as far back as the 1980s in the late John Kelly's book, <i>The Irish Constitution</i>, when he remarked that &ldquo;the constitutional permissibility of the requirement must be in doubt&rdquo;. The judgment in the Redmond case has now confirmed that view.</P>
    <P>Limiting access to a ballot paper is a common feature of most parliamentary democracies to prevent an overly large number of candidates from contesting an election. Members of this House could be forgiven for feeling that the Seanad nomination procedures must be one of the more elaborate in existence. In Ireland, the purpose of any general election is to elect members to Dáil Éireann in accordance with the Constitution and, subsequently, to form a Government. It follows that for such a process to take place, there must be a consensus among a majority of the members of the Dáil. General elections must have some structure and predictability in the sense that a voter must reasonably foresee what the impact of his or her vote will be on the eventual composition of the Dáil if he or she is to exercise a meaningful choice. Where there is a very large number of candidates in a constituency, the outcome could depend more upon chance than a reflection of voters' preferences. Having an overly large number of candidates could impact on the democratic right of voters to play a meaningful part in the political process.</P>
    <P>There are generally three procedures used to limit access to a ballot paper. The first is the cash deposit system as used in the United Kingdom and, up to now, in Ireland. The second is one where a candidate is required to obtain the signature of a number of registered electors and the third system of filtering candidates applies in countries with PR-list electoral systems. In those countries, there is generally a requirement to be a candidate of a registered political party and to be included on the party list to get on the ballot paper. While it is possible for independent candidates to stand, there is a requirement for signa<Col N="1059" /> tures, which can be as many as 500 in some cases. This is a serious restriction on independent candidates and one which, in practice, results in a small number of them contesting elections. Where the number of signatures is set as high as 500, the impact will vary depending on the type of candidate. For example, it would be easier for an organised political party to obtain 500 signatures and this could discriminate against independent candidates. Disabled candidates would also find it harder than the payment of a deposit, while wealthier candidates may find it easier to obtain 500 signatures.</P>
    <P>In this country, there is no national ID system unlike mainland Europe where the system of obtaining the support of registered electors is commonly applied. The absence of an ID system and a requirement for a very large number of signatures raises the issue of verification and the possibility of corruption. Furthermore, the entire electoral process would become much more cumbersome if a period was required, after nominations had been received, to allow for the verification of large numbers of nominators' signatures. As always in these matters, there is a balance to be struck between providing for a reasonable test of the earnest of a prospective candidate and setting that test so high as to unduly restrict people from seeking election or creating administrative difficulties.</P>
    <P>Having considered the issues, the Government has proposed the measures provided for in the Bill. Candidates at a Dáil election, not in possession of a certificate of political affiliation, will have to have their nomination papers assented to by 30 Dáil electors registered in the constituency. As Senators will be aware, a certificate of political affiliation confirms that a candidature is authenticated by the relevant officer of a political party registered in the register of political parties. The reason such candidates should not require 30 assentors is clear. First, it can be safely assumed that if a political party authenticates a candidate, he or she will have the support of at least 30 people. In the revised section 25 of the Electoral Act, 1992, which became operative from 1 January 2002, new political parties will be required to have at least 300 registered members. Second, a party candidate will normally have to undergo a selection procedure at the local branch level which also would normally involve more than 30 members, most of whom would be from the constituency concerned.</P>
    <P>Support for the approach being adopted in the Bill came from the expert witness for the plaintiff in the Redmond case who made the points that a system of nomination with additional assessors or supporting signatures would be just as effective as a deposit, if not more so; no European or other accepted democratic system permitted an entirely open access to the ballot paper as all had some provisions designed to protect the system from <Col N="1060" /> abuse; apart from the deposit requirement, the Irish system was exceptionally open; and some form of deterrent to abuse was desirable.</P>
    <P>The Bill is short and contains six sections. Senators should note that a number of amendments were also made to it in the Dáil to which I will refer in my comments. Section 1 provides in paragraph (<i>d</i>) that the nomination form for a candidate without a certificate of political affiliation will have to be assented to by 30 registered electors for the constituency excluding the candidate or the proposer. Paragraphs (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>) contain consequential amendments relating to the procedures for details to be entered in the notice of election and in the notes on the nomination form.</P>
    <P>The new section 46(4B) sets out the procedures for the assentors to assent in a nomination form. Each candidate without a certificate of political affiliation, or the proposer, will lodge a nomination paper in the prescribed local authority offices, generally the principal offices of the local authority, for assenting to by 30 electors. Each assentor will be required to sign the nomination form in the presence of a local authority official and produce one of the prescribed photographic identification documents. The local authority official will then enter on the nomination paper the elector's number on the register of electors, the nature of the identification document produced, including any number on it, the time and date of the assentor's signature and the official's signature.</P>
    <P>Where constituencies extend over more than one county or in the case of Dublin and Cork, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government will prescribe more than one local authority office where the nomination paper can be lodged. Local authority offices, rather than the office of the returning officer, are a more suitable location as they are generally better known and the persons involved will have ready access to the register of electors details. This will be important where an assentor may not be on the published register but has applied for entry in the supplement; such information may only be available at the local authority office. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government will also prescribe the acceptable photographic identification in regulations after the Bill is enacted. The documents under consideration include a passport, driving licence, travel pass, work or student identification. If Senators have other documents in mind, I am open to considering suggestions.</P>
    <P>The candidate or proposer will be responsible for ensuring that the completed nomination paper, with the 30 signatures, is delivered to the returning officer before the closing time for receipt of nominations at the election concerned. Section 18 of the Electoral (Amendment) Act, 2001, reduced the nomination period from nine to seven days after the issue of the writs to provide necessary additional time for the printing of photographs and party emblems on ballot papers. <Col N="1061" /> I am not aware if there are any prospective Dáil candidates in the House today but, if so, they can take careful note of the reduced time period. There is no statutory or other responsibility on the local authority in this matter; the responsibility is entirely that of the candidate or the proposer to deliver the nomination paper in time to the returning officer.</P>
    <P>The procedures I have outlined may appear bureaucratic but if the system is to have any credibility, it must be thorough and certifiable. The extra work for local authorities should not be too onerous as the average number of non-party candidates per constituency at the 1997 general election was 2.5. The average per constituency in the Dublin area, where there are four major local authorities, was just over four.</P>
    <P>A further change in the law is contained in paragraph (<i>f</i>), which provides that a returning officer will not accept as a valid nomination a nomination paper which is not accompanied by a certificate of political affiliation, without the 30 signatures correctly witnessed by the local authority. Again, it is important for candidates or their proposers to allow sufficient time to have the 30 assentors sign the nomination form and have it delivered to the returning officer. Paragraphs (<i>e</i>), (<i>g</i>) and (<i>h</i>) are consequential amendments.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to an issue which has been causing concern generally, that is, the question of electoral abuse. In particular, the procedure for applying for entry in the supplement to the register of electors may be open to abuse arising from the lack of a minimum residential period for entry, that is, any person over 18 years of age who is ordinarily resident can apply. Despite the fact that a registration authority can seek supporting evidence of information contained on the application form, it is difficult to disprove that a person is not &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; even if only for a few hours. A person could claim that they are residing with another person while seeking accommodation and employment. In addition, in some cases, bulk applications are received by registration authorities close to the closing time for receipt of applications, thus making it extremely difficult, if not impossible, for the registration authority to properly consider the application forms in time for the poll in question. In such circumstances, there is extreme pressure on the registration authority to approve the applications for the poll, which may lead to unqualified applicants being included in the supplement. In response to these concerns, the Government moved an amendment on Committee Stage in the Dáil to amend the provisions of the Electoral Act, 1992, in relation to the supplement.</P>
    <P>Section 1(<i>i</i>) provides that each applicant for entry in the supplement must in future be signed in the applicant's local Garda station in the presence of a member of the Garda Síochána. The garda will have to be satisfied of the person's <Col N="1062" /> identity and then sign, date and stamp the form. Similar procedures apply to other official forms such as a passport application, certain road vehicle forms relating to motor taxation and licensing of trailers and voting by certain postal voters. In view of the importance of maintaining the integrity of the electoral system, and notwithstanding the extra work that may be created in Garda stations in the run up to the poll, the Government considers that the supplement application procedure should be strengthened. The closing date for receipt of an application for entry to the supplement is 15 days before polling day.</P>
    <P>Where an applicant for entry to the supplement cannot attend their local Garda station, the amendment provides that the application form can be signed in the presence of an official of the registration authority if the applicant states in writing the reason they are unable to get the form witnessed in the local Garda station. If a person, because of physical illness or disability, cannot attend their local Garda station or registration authority offices, the application form can be accompanied by a medical certificate in the same way that an application for entry to the postal voters or special voters lists is accompanied by a medical certificate.</P>
    <P>The amendment also provides that an application for entry in the supplement must be made directly by the applicant to the registration authority. There has been some concern in recent years about canvassers and others collecting supplement application forms and delivering them in bulk to the registration authority. This will no longer be permitted.</P>
    <P>Sections 2 and 3 provide for similar new regimes for nominations for European and local elections except that the number of assentors required will be 60 and 15 respectively, reflecting the different types and scale of elections involved. The provision for direct elections for local authority cathaoirligh will be dealt with in regulations to be made under the Local Government Act, 2001. A draft of those regulations will have to be approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Section 4 makes four amendments to the Electoral Act, 1997, which sets out the expenditure and donation regime for election candidates and public representatives. Paragraph (<i>d</i>) provides that the travelling expenses incurred by a candidate or an assentor in meeting the requirements of the Bill at Dáil or European elections will not be regarded as an election expense in the same way that the cost of an election deposit was deemed not to be an election expense.</P>
    <P>The amendments in paragraphs (<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>) were introduced on Committee Stage in the Dáil and they provide for a number of clarifications. Paragraph (<i>a</i>) clarifies that if a political party raises funds at an event, such funds or part of them can be used for supporting that party's candidates at an election, notwithstanding that this may not have been referred to in the notice of <Col N="1063" /> the event. This can arise if the fund-raising is held before the candidates are selected and some concern has been expressed that the total sum raised might be regarded as the amount for donation purposes rather than the individual net contributions.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (<i>b</i>) clarifies that expenses, other than money, by a political party on behalf of a candidate of the party at a Dáil or European election, a Member of either House of the Oireachtas or MEP will not be a donation. The source of funding for such expenses will have to be disclosed by the political party if a donation is over the specified limit and any individual donation to the political party must not exceed the limit set out in the Electoral (Amendment) Act, 2001.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (<i>c</i>) provides that the appropriate officer of a political party or the responsible person in relation to a third party or an accounting unit will have a defence to a prosecution for the receipt of a prohibited donation or a donation exceeding the disclosure limit if they did not know and could not reasonably have known of the receipt of such a donation. Similar provisions are already provided for election agents in parts 5 and 6 of the Act. The need for this amendment arises from the new provisions on the prohibition of certain donations provided in the Electoral (Amendment) Act, 2001.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides that the travelling expenses incurred by a candidate or an assentor in meeting the requirements of the Bill at local elections will not be regarded as an election expense. This mirrors the change made in section 4(<i>d</i>) for general and European elections. Section 6 provides for the normal Short Title, collective citation and construction of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Elections are fundamental to the operation of our democracy and it is incumbent on us, as legislators, to ensure they are conducted in a fair, orderly and open way. During the High Court case that gave rise to the Bill, the distinguished expert witnesses who gave evidence for the plaintiff and the defendant agreed that a test of bona fides, provided it is fair and reasonable, should be imposed on prospective candidates at elections. They also agreed that a nomination and signatures system could provide an alternative to the deposits system. This Bill provides for such a system. The requirements provided in the Bill are not onerous and represent a reasonable and proportional response to the High Court judgment.</P>
    <P>The additional requirements for applying for entry in the supplement of the register will strengthen the security aspects of the supplement procedures and are a necessary change to assist in deterring bogus applications. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government is also reviewing the list of specified identification documents which can be produced by voters at the polling stations and the number of electors who may be asked to produce an identification docu<Col N="1064" /> ment. A revised list will be included in the regulations which will be required following the enactment of the Bill. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. My party will support this legislation which arose from a High Court case. I do not believe too many people were prevented from running for election because of the monetary requirement that applied in the past. Under the old system, a candidate submitted a cheque or cash and a few weeks after the election, if elected, would find a £20 note in his or her suit, if he or she got back the deposit. The elected candidate would feel on good terms with himself or herself, having held not only on to the deposit but also the seat.</P>
      <P>A proper balance has been struck on the number of electors required to assent to an independent candidate's nomination. Independent candidates are as entitled as the member of any political party to run for election and it is important that they should be facilitated as far as possible in so doing. I take it from what the Minister of State said that a person can assent to only one candidate's nomination, that the same 30 electors cannot nominate three or four candidates. The Minister of State might clarify this. I also note the provision for the number of assentors required for a candidate's nomination for local elections.</P>
      <P>I presume that regulations to be brought forward will be in force for the forthcoming general election. Are they well advanced, given that there are various other rules and regulations governing spending, donations etc. to which candidates must adhere?</P>
      <P>Will candidates' photographs appear on the ballot paper? If so, what type of photograph will the returning officer require? I have heard everything from a disc to a few hard copies being mentioned. We would not want the name of Senator Dardis to appear on the ballot paper with my mugshot or that of Senator Doyle opposite his name.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly. How far advanced is the work on this provision? Can one produce one's first communion or confirmation photograph to improve one's looks or give the impression of eternal youth? Will the Minister of State indicate the regulations that will be introduced and when, bearing in mind that a general election will probably be called within the next month or sooner?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I presume that access to polling stations is being made as user friendly as possible, whether <Col N="1065" /> for those in wheelchairs or the elderly. There used to be a polling station in the Dún Laoghaire area where voters had to climb a flight of stairs, that was before they could apply for a special vote. It was crazy in that some had to be carried up the stairs.</P>
    <P>Difficulties concerning certain polling stations came to light in the recent referendum. I am sure the difficulty that arose concerning two polling stations in my consistency was an innocent mistake. There are two schools in the constituency with the name St. Brigid's, one in Foxrock and the other in Stillorgan, a little more than one mile apart, polling cards for one of which were incorrectly described as being for the other. It might not be possible for people having gone to one polling station to then have to travel to the other. I ask the Minister of State to ensure this matter is brought to the attention of the respective returning officers. The forthcoming general election has been posted well in advance and it should be possible to have the list of polling stations drawn up at this stage in order to avoid such errors. I am pretty certain that the difficulty to which I referred was a genuine mistake, but there was a mix up.</P>
    <P>I agree with what the Minister of State said about the supplementary register, but care must be taken in drawing up the main register. A case was brought to my attention recently where the register showed that two members of the one family were named Michael, but one of the names should have read Michelle. We should encourage people to ensure their names are correctly recorded on the register. We could tell them to make such a change by calling to their local Garda station or local authority office and provide identification. This is an important aspect, particularly now that people are changing jobs and addresses more frequently than in the past.</P>
    <P>I support the Bill, which deals with an important aspect of our democratic system. While there is a need for care and scrutiny regarding the register and precautions must be taken to guard against fraud, there should be some flexibility in regard to it. The Minister of State might address the points I raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Glacaim leis an fháilte roimh an Aire Stáit. Is Bille beag é seo, ach tá sé tábhachtach. I join Senator Cosgrave in welcoming this short Bill, which regulates the position following the High Court decision on election deposits. The system which was found to be unconstitutional was reasonably effective, but, as the Minister outlined, it did not act as a deterrent. It is important that our democracy strikes a balance between ensuring access to the democratic process for those who wish to participate and preventing frivolous candidates who may distort the outcome of an election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I appreciate that the number of candidates may be limited by the fact that not much <Col N="1066" /> time is available before an election for 30 assentors to go to their local authority, I am conscious that previous Bills have made provision for candidates to receive State subventions in respect of electoral expenses. As such expenses may include hospitality and food and drink for canvassers, I wonder if the subvention will induce people to stand in an election without being serious about participating in the political process. I realise that the system may be regulated by the fact that one has to receive a number of votes equivalent to a proportion of the quota to qualify for the subvention.</P>
    <P>The number of electors whose assent is needed should be kept under review, while retaining a balance between ensuring accessibility and preventing a proliferation of candidates who are not serious. As the Minister of State said, the outcome of an election should not be influenced by candidates who may undermine the political process. Our system of proportional representation means those seeking election may be successful by chance rather than as a reflection of the electorate's preference if we are not careful. It may be that the number of assentors will have to be set at a proportion, for example 0.1%, of the number on the register of electors in a constituency if the provisions of the Bill transpire not be adequate.</P>
    <P>Under the proportional representation system, someone may be elected by chance if there is a large number of candidates as voters may not consider their votes as extensively as they go down the order of preference. The introduction of the single seat constituency, which has been discussed in the House on many occasions, would make enormous sense if combined with proportionality. A candidate would be successful if he achieved over 50% of the vote after the distribution of transfers. Smaller constituencies may be preferable to the large multi-seat constituencies we have at present, where local affiliations are sometimes seen as more important than electing people to formulate legislation in parliament and govern the country. Local considerations should be addressed in local authorities rather than being a matter for central government.</P>
    <P>The Bill deals with some minor matters, such as the supplementary register of electors. While it is important that people are not excluded from the register, we must ensure it is not abused, as has happened in a neighbouring jurisdiction where there has been anecdotal evidence of personation. The provision in section 3, that those wishing to be placed on the register will have to identify themselves at a Garda station and satisfy a garda that they are entitled to be on the register in order that the form can be countersigned, represents a sensible approach to the problem. Similarly, the proposal that moneys collected through party fundraising can be spent equally on candidates is logical and removes doubt.</P>
    <P>I welcome the defence of party officers found not to be in possession of certain information, as <Col N="1067" /> it can be difficult to efficiently administer large parties with many branches and the relevant officer may not be aware of any offence. While we need to protect the integrity of elections, we have gone overboard in that regard, as I predicted in the House. It may happen that people of the highest integrity will be accused of having made administrative errors. It is too close to a general election to make changes now, but I hope these provisions will be examined and simplified. If candidates' spending is to be limited, the amounts should be specified and the areas in which money can be spent narrowed. We have gone too far if expenditure on meals for canvassers, for example, should be a factor in election expenses. The provision of a set amount of expenditure during the election should be reconsidered and simplified. This short Bill makes sense as we approach an election, as it tidies up affairs. Its thrust is in the right direction in most of the areas I have mentioned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and, having listened to his speech and examined the Bill, I agree with its thrust. I was quite dismayed by the High Court decision on this issue, as it may facilitate those who wish to abuse the political system. We may invite candidates similar to Screaming Lord Sutch, who was a feature of political life on the other island, to stand in many constituencies, including Kildare South and Kildare North.</P>
      <P>I would like to raise a few issues. I agree strongly with Senator Walsh's argument that we are tying ourselves in knots regarding electoral legislation, although few Senators made such an point when previous Bills were going through the House. I may have been the only Senator to question the ideas of openness and transparency and point out that accountability is more important. It has become impossible to ensure one meets all the regulations.</P>
      <P>I would appreciate a comment from the Minister of State on the section of the Bill which states that expenses incurred by a political party on behalf of a candidate authenticated by the political party shall not be counted as a donation of money. I am not opposed to this provision, as it has a variety of possible interpretations, but I am not sure what it means and would like to hear an explanation. As the election approaches, many of us are rereading Acts to examine how they apply to our campaigns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the questions that has emerged relates to expenses incurred on behalf of a candidate. Could such expenses be considered as a donation other than money? I will give an example. Under the Electoral Act, so-called office support in a constituency is not considered a donation. I contacted the Public Offices Commission and asked for an explanation of what is meant by an &ldquo;office&rdquo;. The Act does not refer to a room or a <Col N="1068" /> space, but an office. There must be a difference, but it is not defined.</P>
    <P>This arises for me, but it could also arise for others in many different ways. Half the Members of this House have another office associated with their business, profession or whatever. Perhaps to a large extent, we all do the same business in both places in order to manage our time. One might be sitting in the office associated with one's business or profession or at home, rather than one's office in Leinster House, and deal with a political query. One might get someone who is part of one's business or profession to type a letter. In the strictest interpretation that constitutes a benefit-in-kind of some description. We need to clarify these issues. This is no reflection on the Public Offices Commission which has to interpret the legislation. However, there are difficulties of interpretation regarding the word &ldquo;office&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>My initial reading of section 4 is that if one is a member of a political party which provides some assistance, this does not have to be declared as a donation of money. I do not oppose this measure, but where is the converse or the balance regarding an independent candidate? I have raised the issue of the Trade Union Act, 1913, which allows unions to operate a political fund of which they have to keep account. Many trade unions or bodies have an interest in doing something. A nominating body for the Seanad might find it important to nominate someone who would win the election. Would they also be allowed to help someone and to have that help regarded as something other than a donation of money? I have a problem with that and any fair-minded person would argue that this issue needs to be examined.</P>
    <P>I am not trying to reopen the discussion on the Bill, but I take Senator Walsh's points. There are issues which we should examine. The last thing we want is honest people to be caught out by the legislation. That can easily happen. Those of us who have examined this issue carefully can see that if people do not organise themselves for this election, they will be quickly in breach of the legislation. That can easily happen and we in the House, perhaps through the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, need to remind people standing for the Dáil or the Seanad by way of simple advice of what they should do and the checks they need to make. There is an issue in this regard.</P>
    <P>I am not being pedantic, but I am seeking reassurance from the Minister of State. He referred to a candidate &ldquo;without a certificate of political affiliation&rdquo;. This means someone being a member of a political party. Section 2(<i>a</i>) of the Bill refers to &ldquo;a candidate whose candidature is not authenticated by a certificate of political affiliation&rdquo;. That is clear. I have no difficulty with the provision in the Bill and I see the thinking behind it. As an Independent I feel somewhat left out, but I see the logic of the position and I do not object to it. However, will the Minister of State <Col N="1069" /> reassure me that the phrase in his speech is short-hand and that it will not appear in the legislation? I would not be happy if that were to happen. Someone could produce a certificate of political affiliation who might not have had his or her candidature endorsed by that party and could be a member of a different party. All sorts of things could happen in this regard.</P>
    <P>I wish to draw the Minister of State's attention to section 2(<i>f</i>)(<i>a</i>)(ii) which states: &ldquo;in the case of the nomination paper of any candidate, the paper is for any other reason not properly made out or signed.&rdquo;  The Minister of State did not deal with this issue in his speech. This provision may be sensible, but I am worried about the phrase &ldquo;for any other reason&rdquo;. This section deals with a returning officer ruling out a nomination paper. It would be simpler if the Bill stipulated that a returning officer could rule out a nomination paper because it is not properly made out or signed. However, I do not understand the use of the phrase &ldquo;for any other reason it is not properly made out or signed&rdquo;. It does not matter if there is another reason. If a nomination paper is not properly made out or signed, it should be ruled out. I do not know why the phrase &ldquo;for any other reason&rdquo; is included. Who cares about the reason?</P>
    <P>I am seeking clarification. For example, the paper might be illegible or indeterminate. I agree that the returning officer should have discretion, but the phrase &ldquo;for any other reason&rdquo; creates confusion and there might be a difficulty if the matter came before a judge. It is a matter of a returning officer looking at a paper and ruling it out because it is not properly made out or signed. The reason is the conclusion. I ask the Minister of State to deal with the two points I raised. I am not trying to be picky, but I wish to tighten the Bill. I do not intend to table an amendment, but I ask the Minister of State to go on the record regarding these issues so we will know what is intended.</P>
    <P>I note, and agree with, Senator Cosgrave's points about photographic evidence. I wondered whether I should get my hair coloured or add hair extensions and considered what would be needed to make a proper impact on the electorate. I wish to be assured that the photograph has to constitute a likeness and be reasonably accurate in terms of reflecting the age and state of the person at the given time. As a medical doctor, I am sure the Minister of State will go along with my comments. People can do all sorts of things with photographs and, worse still, they can do all sorts of things with their bodies.</P>
    <P>Senator Cosgrave referred to disks. I accept that he was not talking about himself, but some people might use an expert to touch up a photograph which is held on disk. We would like to be reassured that we are playing on a level field and that 52 year olds look like 52 year olds. We do not want any Oisíns coming back from Tír na nÓg with their confirmation photographs or <Col N="1070" /> photographs from the attic. I ask the Minister of State to respond to this issue.</P>
    <P>I note the requirements regarding the supplement. I agree with the reasoning behind this measure, but it is a little difficult for people to go to a Garda station. However, I accept that this measure is probably sensible. I have said for years that the phrase &ldquo;normally resident&rdquo; could mean anything to anybody. The legislation refers to a constituency in which the person is normally resident. A person could be normally resident in a number of constituencies. One cannot legally cast one's vote in more than one constituency, but one could make a choice as to in which constituency one wished to vote. It would seem to be legal to have one's name included on a number of registers so long as one only voted in one constituency.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State to again consider the issue of on-line voting. We can now do all sorts of things on-line. It is possible to buy property, book holidays and flights, check bank balances and pay bills by entering the appropriate number and the system is foolproof because only the person with access to the information can do it. There is no problem with counting afterwards. The holding of elections in the middle of the week, when people cannot always vote, and the casting of votes in one place reflect an age in which people lived locally and did not have to travel to vote. Now students and businessmen might find it impossible to get home to vote. Will the Minister of State have a word with the Taoiseach about the day of the week on which the next election is held?</P>
    <P>The Government should consider introducing a participatory quota before the outcome of a referendum is accepted. If less than 40% of the electorate participate in a referendum, its outcome should not be accepted. If things continue in the current fashion, we will end up with a situation where one person will vote in a referendum and change all our lives forever.</P>
    <P>I support this legislation and recognise the Government is under pressure to pass it. For that reason, I will not cause any delays.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. In the dying days of this Administration, I recognise the fact that he has been an assiduous attendee in the Seanad and has always been available to us. We thank him for that.</P>
      <P>When Senator O'Toole was speaking, I had a surreal notion of him being airbrushed. When this legislation was introduced, I had the even more bizarre idea of using the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell's or the Tánaiste's picture opposite my name on the ballot paper. That would improve my chances of being elected. Perhaps a loophole in the legislation would allow me to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The democratic process should be as inclusive as possible. I have been a Member of the House for 12 years and on each occasion a Bill of this <Col N="1071" /> nature has been introduced, I have argued that point. I have tabled amendments about putting pictures and party logos on the ballot papers, but each time I was told, in no uncertain terms, that it would not be tolerated because it would lead to a beauty contest. I tabled those amendments because it is invidious that someone who might be illiterate should have to &ldquo;shout&rdquo; a vote. The secrecy of the ballot box should be protected to the greatest possible degree and people with disabilities should not be excluded from voting. The first South African election, which had such a huge turn out, had pictures and party logos on the ballot papers.</P>
    <P>The Representation of the People Act, 1918, stipulated a deposit of £150, a substantial amount that is probably a relic of the English rotten boroughs because it would exclude many people. There should not be a deposit. I welcome the court's ruling because I disagree with Senator O'Toole &ndash; no one should be excluded. If the Monster Raving Looney Party, as Gaeilge, wants to contest an election, it should be able to do so. The Minister of State mentioned the multiplicity of candidates upsetting the balance of the outcome of an election. I do not share that view. The electorate is sophisticated and able to make choices; people should not be aggrieved because it is not possible for them to have their name on the ballot. I agree that there must be regulation to protect the integrity of the ballot box and the outcome of the election, but that is a different issue from participation. Those who want to participate should be able to do so. It might even lead to increased voter turn out.</P>
    <P>I welcome the recommendation of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution, which published its seventh progress report on Parliament yesterday. I welcome its recommendation that the age at which people could stand for the Dáil or the Presidency should be reduced to 18 years. Some of the regulations go back to a precious view of life that only those who are grey can be trusted to run the State. Some of those in very senior positions at the foundation of the State, however, were very young by today's standards. If a person is old enough to vote, he or she is old enough to stand and be elected to Parliament. There would be no harm in younger people coming through these hallowed portals.</P>
    <P>With modern technology, it should be possible for someone holidaying in Donegal to cast his or her vote in Kildare South. It can be done securely and with confidence. I do not underestimate the cost involved, but I commend the work being done by some of the officials in the Department of the Environment and Local Government who are endeavouring to bring forward an electronic system that is workable and user friendly. I recognise the nostalgia about the free-for-all outside polling stations which has since extended to nostalgia for the merits of the tallying system. There <Col N="1072" /> is a certain excitement, except for candidates like the Attorney General and Deputy Gormley in the last election. They would have welcomed an electronic system that would have shown an outcome several days earlier than was the case.</P>
    <P>I was privileged to attend the first election in the Palestinian Territories. At 4 p.m. in a polling station in Gaza, the ballot box was so full that we had to empty it into plastic bags that we sealed with candle wax in front of those supervising the election. It was so full because the ballot paper was three feet long. Conventional ballot boxes had been brought in by people used to European elections who did not know the ballot paper would be so enormous that it would cause problems. That suggests that large numbers of candidates can be handled. On that occasion I saw a very elderly lady who was illiterate. She was accompanied by her grandson or great grandson who read the ballot paper to her and she indicated how she wanted it marked. I see nothing wrong with this. We can be too precious in our attitude.</P>
    <P>I accept the need for regulations regarding the voting register and have sympathy with the view that the supplementary register must be compiled in a certain manner. However, consideration must be given to the anxiety caused to voters who, believing they are on the electoral register, attend a polling station and are then told they are not on it. At the last general election I saw a lady crying because she could not vote. That contrasts sharply with those who do not bother to vote.</P>
    <P>Everything possible must be done to ensure the right to vote of those who wish to participate in democracy is vindicated. The prevalent view is that the onus is on voters to ensure they are on the register. I disagree with this. The onus should be on the State to ensure that those eligible to vote are on it. In the days when there were rate collectors in rural areas there was no difficulty in compiling the register because they did it in the course of their work. However, during the last general election I encountered several cases involving people who had not moved house, but whose names had disappeared from the register after being on it for many years. This is an example where computers, which could assist in the use of electronic voting, could be a hindrance in compiling the register. If an operator presses the wrong button, people's names could be removed from it.</P>
    <P>It is reasonable that democratic systems do not allow total open access to the ballot paper. There must be some degree of control, but in all cases there is a need to strike a balance. Senators Walsh and O'Toole referred to the legislative provisions regarding expenditure. Those who wish to be compliant with the legislation and make every effort in that regard will still, after an election, be subject to objections to the returns they make by vexatious individuals. Complying with the regulations has become even more com<Col N="1073" /> plex than filling in the very complex application forms used by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. There are numerous guidelines, but in the hurly-burly of a campaign, when candidates do not know if they are on their head or their heels, they are likely to consult them only on rare occasions. Errors will be made which might make candidates liable to prosecution &ndash; I suspect the authorities would not prosecute &ndash; and open to accusations of impropriety. Frequently, only accusations are required to damage them.</P>
    <P>While it is correct to impose limits on spending, to have regulations on contributions and to impose a cap on corporate donations, there is a need to strike a balance. Senator Walsh asked if buying drinks for a few people should be disclosed. Having read the regulations I do not consider it to be necessary, but a candidate could overlook disclosing it and find himself or herself in trouble.</P>
    <P>I have previously advocated that provision should be made to allow for voting on Saturdays and Sundays, although at the time it was considered to be undesirable. Provision should be made to allow for voting over two days. Why should people not be allowed to vote on a Friday and Saturday? In the case of the recent abortion referendum, it was wrong that the polling stations opened at 9 a.m. when most people travelling to Dublin from the constituency of Kildare and elsewhere leave home at 7 a.m. and do not return until 8 p.m. If we want people to vote, we should ensure they have the facility to do so. Too many provisions in this area date back to the last century and 25 years ago. They need to be changed.</P>

      <P>I thank Senators for their fine contributions and consensus regarding the status of the legislation. Senator Cosgrave referred to the question of assent. A person can only assent to the nomination of one candidate at an election. The regulations on identification documents are being drafted and should be ready for signing next week.</P>
      <P>With regard to polling stations, returning officers are advised to provide ramps. Alternatively, a voter can apply to vote at a different polling station if they cannot access their usual station. If there are difficulties in this area, advertisements will be placed in newspapers to alert voters on the location of stations.</P>
      <P>The Minister has made regulations on the question of photographs on ballot papers which set out the conditions that prospective candidates must fulfil. Photographs must be in full colour and taken recently, that is, within 12 months of the poll. They should be supplied on disc or in the form of two hard copies. However, I understand the provision of photographs is not mandatory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1074" />Senator Walsh referred to the question of assent. The number required is subjective and can be revised, but there must be a balance between accessibility and maintaining the integrity of the electoral system. The assenters must be registered in the constituency. The Senator also referred to the electoral system. This question has been raised with the Minister in recent years and needs to be further debated.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole referred to the requirements of the Electoral Act, as amended. If any candidate has doubts, he or she should contact the Standards in Public Office Commission for guidance. The guidelines issued by the commission should be of assistance.</P>
    <P>Senator Cosgrave referred to errors on the register. If there is an error, a person can, if necessary, apply to be included on the supplementary register.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole raised a number of other matters which I will refer to the Minister for consideration. The Senator asked about the meaning of section 4(<i>b</i>) which provides that any expenses incurred by a political party on behalf of a candidate authenticated by it at Dáil or European elections, Member of either House of the Oireachtas or representatives in the European Parliament, other than a donation of money, is not regarded as a political donation. However, the political party will be required to disclose the source of funding if the donation is over the limit and will be subject to the donation limits as set out in the 2001 Act. The provisions also apply to expenses incurred by a political party on behalf of its members.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis referred to some of the recommendation of the Oireachtas all-party committee on the Constitution. Its report was only issued yesterday and I am sure the Senator will excuse me for not replying in detail as the recommendations will need consideration. In some cases a referendum may be necessary, especially regarding the proposal to reduce the age requirement for Dáil candidates. The Senator also raised questions on the issue of electronic voting, which will have to be carefully considered in the future. He welcomed the proposal to replace the deposit with a better system. He did not appear to be too concerned about the question of the number of candidates.</P>
    <P>On the question of polling over two days, flexibility will be the norm in the future. We will have to explore all the options. It has been proposed that polling could begin earlier in the morning, running from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. Polling over two days has also been suggested as an option.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to introduce the second of two Bills implementing the £850 million social welfare package under budget 2002 to the House. Senators will recall that a separate Bill was enacted in December 2001, giving effect to the substantial increases in weekly social welfare payments from the beginning of January 2002 and to PRSI payments from 1 March this year. This Bill implements a number of key improvements in the social welfare scheme, such as increases in child benefit, improvement in payments for carers and also includes a range of other measures.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to social inclusion and I am proud to say that, since 1997, we have more than fulfilled our commitments in this respect. It is worth reflecting on some of the key achievements in the area of social welfare over the past five years. Overall social welfare spending has increased from £4.5 billion in 1997 to £7.4 billion this year; pensions have increased by 49% for a single person and by 54% for a couple, well ahead of the £100 per week target that was originally set in the action programme; the lowest social welfare rates have increased by 43% for a single person and 48% for a couple; there have been substantial increases in child benefit rates, more than treble what was paid in 1997; significant improvement for carers will result in over 22,000 carers receiving payment in 2002, compared to 9,700 in 1997; and new family services to protect the family and support the stability of family life have also been introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been many other improvements in the area of social welfare, such as the relaxation of means tests rules, new <i>pro rata</i> pensions, accelerated increases in qualified adult allowances, extension of the free schemes to the over-70s, introduction of new employment supports and earlier implementation of the social welfare increases to 1 January. All these combine to enhance the position of elderly people, carers, disabled people and other vulnerable groups in <Col N="1077" /> our society. The success of these measures in improving the standard of living of the most marginalised sections of our community is borne out by the latest research data, published by the ESRI. This report shows that the level of consistent poverty, as targeted by the national anti-poverty strategy, has been significantly reduced from 10% in 1997 to 6.2% in 2000, which is the last year for which figures are available. Obviously, these figures have come down even more substantially since then. In practical terms, this means that 200,000 people have been lifted out of poverty. In addition, consistent poverty among children has halved from 17% in 1997 to 8% in 2000. Again, this figure will have been substantially reduced by 2002.</P>
    <P>The Government recognises that considerable challenges remain and we are determined to build on our achievements. The revised national anti-poverty strategy, Building an Inclusive Society, was formally launched by the Taoiseach and myself earlier this month. This publication is the outcome of a process committed to under the PPF. It involved a review of the methodology underlying the strategy, as well as a review and revision, where appropriate, of the existing targets. New targets in the areas of health and housing accommodation, as well as specific targets relating to vulnerable groups, are included in the revised strategy. Commitments in the new strategy have been welcomed by all sectors.</P>
    <P>The key targets include the reduction of the numbers of those who are consistently poor to below 3% and, if possible, to eliminate consistent poverty. It is hoped that this will take place over the lifetime of the review, up to 2007. Specific attention will be paid to vulnerable groups in this objective. One of the key targets is to achieve a rate of the 2002-equivalent of &euro;150 per week for the lowest social welfare rate by 2007. The appropriate equivalence level of basic child income support is to be set at 33% to 35% of the minimum adult social welfare rate. Long-term unemployment is to be eliminated as soon as circumstances permit, but in any event not later than 2007, while the proportion of pupils with serious literacy difficulties is to be halved by 2006.</P>
    <P>Building an Inclusive Society represents a new and strengthened anti-poverty strategy which proposes new and enhanced institutional structures, which will underpin the implementation and monitoring of the revised strategy. Most importantly, as I have outlined, it establishes new and ambitious targets to which the Government has pledged its full commitment.</P>
    <P>The NAPS review process will now merge with the EU process that requires each member state to produce national action plans against poverty and social exclusion on a biannual basis. This will ensure that the strategy, while subject to ongoing monitoring and evaluation, will also be comprehensively reviewed every two years. This continuous reappraisal of the strategy will ensure it <Col N="1078" /> retains focus and relevance in the years ahead and allows us to continue to realise our ambition of eliminating consistent poverty in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I will now outline the provisions contained in the Bill. As Senators will already have considered it in detail, I will focus on a number of key provisions. Child benefit is a universal payment made directly to families. As such it is the most efficient and effective way in which the Government can channel help to children. Before we took office expenditure on child benefit was £397 million annually. The increases announced in budget 2002 and provided for in section 2 of the Bill bring investment in 2002 to &euro;1.44 billion or £1.14 billion approximately &ndash; almost three times the 1997 figure.</P>
    <P>The monthly rate for the first two children is being increased by &euro;31.80 or £25.04 per month while the monthly rate for the third and subsequent children is being increased by &euro;38.10 or £30.01 per month. These increases bring the monthly rates to &euro;117.60 or £92.60 and &euro;147.30 or £116.01 respectively. From April, a family with three children will receive &euro;382.50 or £301.24 compared to £221 at present, an increase of &euro;101.70 or £80 or 36% per month. These substantial increases fulfil the Government's commitment set out in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to move towards £100 or &euro;126.97 for the third and subsequent children and will be fully implemented from April. If returned to office, we will continue to give record increases in child benefit.</P>
    <P>Since 1997 the monthly rates of child benefit have increased threefold from £30 per month to £92.60 per month for the lower rate and from £39 to £116 for the higher rate of payment. In 1997 the child benefit increase for a family with three children was £7 per month; last year and this the same family will get an increase of £80 per month in each year.</P>
    <P>The Bill brings forward the effective date for the 2002 increase to April. However, the first pay day in May is the earliest date from which it is possible for my Department to pay the increased rates. The majority of child benefit payments are made by means of books of payable orders which run from June to May. The new books from June next will contain orders at the increased rate in the normal course. The increase for April and May has, therefore, to be paid separately and May is the earliest date from which it is administratively possible to make this payment to these families.</P>
    <P>I am also introducing changes in the arrangements for entitlement to child dependant increases payable with short-term social welfare payments such as disability and unemployment benefit. At present such increases cease to be payable once the child reaches his or her 18th birthday. Section 7 of the Bill provides that from April, where the child is receiving full-time education, these increases will continue to paid until <Col N="1079" /> the following 30 June. This is a first step in implementing the commitment in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness towards increasing the age limit to 22 years, in line with the current arrangements for long-term payments.</P>
    <P>The Government, over successive budgets, has introduced measures to develop the types of services and supports which provide practical assistance for carers. As a result of changes introduced over the last five budgets, the number of carers receiving carer's allowance and carer's benefit has more than doubled from 9,700 to over 19,500 while expenditure has increased by over 180%.</P>
    <P>In the Bill we are continuing to honour our commitment to supporting the valuable work undertaken by carers. In previous budgets I promised to move towards the stage whereby all carers, whose joint family income is at average industrial earnings, will qualify for carer's allowance at the maximum rate. In line with this commitment I have again increased the disregards this year in order that from April, a couple can have a joint income disregard of &euro;382 per week. This measure will increase the payment of 2,300 carers. It will also ensure an estimated additional 3,400 carers will qualify for a payment. This measure will be implemented by way of regulations with effect from April.</P>
    <P>One of the many measures I introduced in 1999 was a new annual respite care grant payable to all carers in receipt of carer's allowance and carers caring for recipients of a constant attendance or prescribed relative's allowance. Section 3 of the Bill provides for a further enhancement of this payment by an increase in the amount of the grant from £400 to &euro;635 or £500. In addition, carers caring for more than one care recipient will be entitled to a double respite care grant of &euro;1,270 or £1,000. These increases will become effective in June 2002, when the grant is next due.</P>
    <P>Section 15 relaxes the conditions for entitlement to carer's benefit for certain job-sharers and part-time workers. At present, persons claiming carer's benefit must work 38 hours in each period of a fortnight during the 13 weeks preceding their claim. This condition disqualifies some job-sharers and part-time workers from the scheme. Following representations from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, I have decided to reduce the number of hours of employment required to 17 hours per week or 34 per fortnight.</P>
    <P>The health strategy recently launched by my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, also bears out our commitment to improving services for older people, people with disabilities and their carers. The document proposes to reform existing arrangements, including carer's allowance, in order to introduce an integrated care subvention scheme which maximises support for home care. The Department of Health and Children is working with my Department to develop proposals in this area. In addition, the strategy <Col N="1080" /> proposes that a co-ordinated action plan to meet the needs of ageing and older people be developed by the Department of Health and Children in conjunction with my Department, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Department of the Environment and Local Government. The strategy makes a number of other proposals in relation to care planning, greater availability of short-term respite care and the development of primary care services such as domiciliary and day care services. I look forward to being a part of this integrated approach to developing better services for carers and the people for whom they care. I would like to think this will continue after the general election regardless of who is in office.</P>
    <P>In late 2000 I initiated a study into the whole area of long-term care funding, both in the private and public sector with a view to developing a strategy for future action. This report will be published shortly after Easter. The study will examine the strategic issues involved in financing long-term care. This involves an assessment of alternative financing or funding approaches and their feasibility in the Irish context. The study will encompass the financing of personal long-term care needs, both in the community and institutional care, and the potential of the private sector or a combined public-private sector approach to develop new initiatives in this area. Again, we have adopted a cross-cutting approach in this regard &ndash; the study is being undertaken in consultation with the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Finance and any policy proposals arising from the report will be developed in conjunction with these Departments.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill updates the rate of widowed parent grant in primary legislation, which was increased by regulations from £1,000 to &euro;2,500 &ndash; £1,968 &ndash; with effect from budget day, 5 December last. Sections 5 and 6 give effect to two other budget improvements aimed at assisting people who returned to the workforce, but who were subsequently forced to re-apply for their original social welfare payments. Section 5 provides for the linking of disability benefit claims of five years' duration or more for up to 13 weeks in relation to periods of incapacity for work. This measure will ensure that people who, following a prolonged illness, return to employment but find after a short time that they are unable to continue can re-apply for disability benefit without the need to satisfy the conditions for re-qualification.</P>
    <P>Section 6 disregards periods spent on pre-retirement allowance for the purpose of linking two claims to unemployment assistance and for linking two claims to pre-retirement allowance which occur within 52 weeks. Cases have arisen where people on pre-retirement allowance have resumed employment but who subsequently became unemployed. Under existing arrange<Col N="1081" /> ments they must claim unemployment assistance and serve three waiting days before receiving payment. To avoid this disincentive, it is now intended to allow such people to resume claiming pre-retirement allowance where the period spent in employment is less than 52 weeks.</P>
    <P>Section 9 changes the qualifying conditions for entitlement to maternity and adoptive benefits by self-employed people. The main effect of the changes is to allow self-employed women greater flexibility in satisfying the PRSI contribution conditions for the benefits concerned and to bring them more into line with those applicable to employees.</P>
    <P>Section 11 deals with the PRSI arrangements for the proposed new personal retirement savings accounts or PRSAs being introduced under the Pensions Bill currently before the other House and for other personal pension plans. The PRSA will be a low cost, easy access, long-term personal investment account designed to allow people save for their retirement in a flexible manner.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that payments towards such pensions will be treated in a similar manner to contributions made to existing occupational pensions for PRSI purposes, that is, they will be exempt from PRSI. Where payments to such pensions are made through the payroll system, the necessary exemptions will be provided for under regulations governing the PAYE system. Section 11 deals with cases where the premium payments are made outside the payroll system. It provides for a refund of the PRSI contributions deducted from such payments over the course of a tax year.</P>
    <P>Section 12 provides for the introduction of a public service identity to enhance the effectiveness of the personal public service number as a public service identifier. In our action programme for Government, we promised to modernise public services to make them more relevant to the citizen. We promised to improve access to public services by providing them electronically and this is a key element of our e-government strategy. Our aim is to put the customer first rather than the supplier of the service and to integrate services to make access as easy as possible for the people who use them. People want to be able to contact public services in the manner most appropriate to their needs whether in person, by telephone or letter, or, increasingly, on-line. They want to be able to transact their business seamlessly and not have to go from one agency to another repeating the same information.</P>
    <P>To achieve this, the Government has approved a new model known as the public service broker for the delivery of public services electronically. The broker is being developed by the REACH agency, which operates under the aegis of my Department, and it will co-ordinate access to the full range of public services in a variety of ways, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</P>
    <P>The building blocks for this new service were put in place with the legislation I introduced in <Col N="1082" /> 1998 providing for the personal public service number as a public service identifier and as a framework for the sharing of information between agencies for specified services. In section 12 of the Bill I am introducing a further building block for this process with the introduction of a public service identity which will act as a unique and secure identifier for public service customers.</P>
    <P>From the customer's point of view, the public service identity will be a speedy, efficient method of establishing who they are for the purposes of access to and dealing with public service agencies. It will also mean that their identity can be better protected against inadvertent disclosure or against theft or misuse by other persons.</P>
    <P>Section 12 defines the elements of the identity, which will include, <i>inter alia</i>, the person's name, address, date of birth, sex, nationality and his or her PPS number. Where this data is collected from customers in their dealings with public service agencies, it will be used to maintain their identity in the event of a change, for example, a change of address. In addition, it is proposed that personal data collected at birth registration will also be used for this purpose. My Department will be responsible for managing the access by public service agencies to a person's public service identity as part of its management of the existing PPS database. This measure will lead to improved administrative efficiency and effectiveness across all public service agencies. It will help reduce bureaucracy and begin the process of eliminating red tape.</P>
    <P>Section 14 strengthens the powers of the Revenue Commissioners in relation to the collection of PRSI contributions. It allows the Revenue Commissioners to offset repayment of taxes against outstanding liabilities for PRSI. Second, it extends the provisions of the Taxes Acts regarding publication of the names of tax defaulters where the settlement is greater than &euro;12,700 to PRSI contributions.</P>
    <P>Section 16 and Part 2 of the Schedule to the Bill provide for an amendment to the Charities Acts removing the financial limit attached to the use of <i>cy-près</i>. In the White Paper on Supporting Voluntary Activity published in September 2000, the Government announced that responsibility for charity regulatory matters and the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests would transfer from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to my Department. This transfer of responsibilities was effected last July. The White Paper also recognised the need for a more modern legal framework for the charity sector and stated the Government's commitment to ensuring the introduction of comprehensive legislation on regulation of charities and charitable fund-raising. The work of reviewing the legislation which is currently underway in my Department will be accompanied by broad public consultation on the appropriate regulatory frame<Col N="1083" /> work and the nature and extent of the legislative reform required.</P>
    <P>Pending completion of this process of reform, I take the opportunity in this Bill to make two important changes to the Charities Acts. The Charities Acts allows the commissioners to frame so-called &ldquo;<i>cy-près</i>&rdquo; schemes which allow the original objects of a charity to be altered, usually because these objects can no longer be carried out. This may arise, for example, in the case of funds left to an orphanage which no longer exists. In such circumstances the commissioners could use the &ldquo;<i>cy-près</i>&rdquo; provisions to divert these funds to the nearest contemporary use, such as the children's ward of a local hospital. This is a very valuable service for charities which is provided free of charge by the commissioners; however, there is currently a monetary limit of £250,000 on the commissioners' discretion. In cases above this limit, charities are obliged to take the matter to the High Court and bear the considerable costs that can be associated with this course of action.</P>
    <P>Part 2 of the Schedule to the Bill increases the powers of the commissioners by abolishing the current monetary limit on their determination of such applications. It also provides that the commissioners will have power to authorise a lease rather than a disposition of land held on charitable trust where a power of sale was not provided in the original gift. These two amendments were sought by the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests in my discussions with them.</P>
    <P>Parts 4 to 9, inclusive, of the Schedule to the Bill amend the Births, Deaths and Marriages Acts to facilitate the initial implementation of a new computerised system of registering life events. Civil registration touches on each and every one of us at important stages in our lives, beginning with the registration of our births and ending when our deaths are registered. In between those events, civil registration affects us during our lives both directly, as in the case of getting married, or indirectly, when certificates are required for many of the services that are available in our society, such as enrolling a child in school, getting a passport, taking up employment or claiming a social welfare payment. Due to the importance of civil registration and recognising the changing needs of customers, the Government gave approval for expenditure of some £7.3 million on a programme to modernise the Civil Registration Service.</P>
    <P>While there has been little change to the basic registration procedures since 1864, there have been many changes in our society, major developments in technology and increased expectations by citizens of how public services should be delivered. My Department, in conjunction with the Department of Health and Children, has been engaged in the review of the entire registration system including registration law. The <Col N="1084" /> review also examined the structure of registration on a national basis in order to identify the changes needed to capitalise on the use of modern computer technology to capture registration information in an electronic format at the point of registration. The objective is to implement a modern and customer focused service geared to the needs of the 21st century. The modernisation of the registration service will benefit all citizens by providing increased flexibility, in accessing and delivering the service.</P>
    <P>I intend to publish a comprehensive Civil Registration Bill later this year which will provide a framework for new administrative structures for the General Registrar Office, the introduction of new registers of divorce and civil nullity and changes in the procedures for registering the events &ndash; births, stillbirths, adoptions, marriages and deaths. Approximately 104,000 events are registered each year &ndash; 52,000 births, 500 stillbirths, 16,000 marriages, 31,000 deaths, 500 adoptions, 2,000 re-registrations and 2,000 amendments. In addition, 400,000 certificates are produced and 1.2 million searches or inquiries are carried out each year.</P>
    <P>The Registration of Births and Deaths Acts, 1863 to 1996, and the Marriages Acts, 1844 and 1863, provide for the manner in which births, deaths and marriages may be registered and also for the maintenance of a permanent record of vital events by An tArd Chlaraitheoir. These Acts also set out the manner in which the public may access the records and obtain certified copies of individual records. Parts 4 to 9, inclusive, of the Schedule to the Bill provide for the amendment of the relevant Acts to facilitate the introduction of the electronic registration of births and deaths later this year which will represent the first phase of the modernisation programme.</P>
    <P>The Bill also includes provisions to allow for the capture and storing in electronic format of all registration records created since 1845 &ndash; about 20 million records in all. The electronic capture of historical data is of fundamental importance to the success of the modernisation programme. Currently, a person can only get a certificate in the district in which the event was registered or from the GRO. When the records are computerised it will be possible to get a certificate at any registrar's office around the country for any event registered in the State. For example, if one was born in Donegal and currently living in Cork, one would have to write or call to the registrar in Donegal or the GRO in Dublin for a birth certificate. When the records are computerised, one will be able to call to the local registrar in Cork.</P>
    <P>I would like to think one will be able to buy one's certificate on-line or on the high street. I envisage the GRO project &ndash; the computerisation of the births, marriages, deaths, etc. &ndash; will feed into what is called the REACH project which I mentioned earlier. When somebody is born and an application in relation to registration is made <Col N="1085" /> to social welfare, all the information will be on computer. Therefore, when somebody applies for a social welfare payment, it will not be necessary for him or her to produce his or her birth and marriage certificates and so on because it will be available on-line in our Department.</P>
    <P>Part 6 of the Schedule provides for a change in the arrangements for re-registration of a birth. At present, there are two types of re-registration. Under the Legitimacy Act, 1931, where the parents of the child subsequently marry after the birth of the child, they are required to have the birth re-registered. The second type of re-registration was introduced by the Status of Children Act, 1987, to allow the father's details to be added to the register where the parents are not married to each other and the father's details are not shown in the original register entry.</P>
    <P>The current legislation provides that where a birth is re-registered under these Acts, the surname of the child to be recorded is that which appears on the original entry &ndash; usually the mother's surname. In such cases where a couple marry after the registration of the birth of their child there is no means at present to confer the father's surname on the child. This restriction has obviously caused difficulty and embarrassment for both parents and children where following marriage, the parents have the husband's &ndash; the father's &ndash; surname and the child on his or her birth certificate is known by the mother's name. The effect of the amendment included in Part 6 of the Schedule is that in such cases a child's surname can be re-registered at the joint request of both parents.</P>
    <P>I am also taking the opportunity in the Bill to amend the law dealing with the commencement of maintenance orders which is contained in section 4 of the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976. This Act was one of the first of the modern pieces of family law legislation repealing the Married Women (Maintenance in case of Desertion) Act, 1886. It allows for stand alone applications for maintenance. Most applications under the Act are brought in the District Court. Section 4 provides that a periodical payment order under the Act shall commence on the date specified in the order not being a date earlier than that on which the order is made. However, problems have been identified with the operation of this provision which allows the maintenance payer to effectively delay the date from which payments must be made.</P>
    <P>The first of these is that payment under the order cannot be commenced earlier than the date of the order to the original court &ndash; usually the District Court. This gives the maintenance payer the incentive to delay the original court hearing as much as possible. Second, in the case of an appeal, usually from the District Court to the Circuit Court, while the appeal does not automatically act as a stay on the order, nonetheless <Col N="1086" /> as a matter of practice a stay is usually granted. Thus the maintenance award usually has effect only from the date of the grant of maintenance, that is, in the Circuit Court on appeal. This provides an incentive for the maintenance payer to appeal.</P>
    <P>This contrasts with the provisions of the Family Law Act, 1995, and the Family Law (Divorce) Act, 1996, under which the court can specify that the order may take effect earlier than the date of the order although not earlier than the date of application for the order. This, in effect, allows the court to back date the maintenance order to the date of the commencement of the proceedings or at any time during the intervening period. This provides some encouragement to the parties to process the litigation in a speedy fashion. The proposed amendment to section 4 is designed to introduce similar arrangements for applications for maintenance under the 1976 Act by providing that a court could order that the periodical payments commence at any time from the date of the original application.</P>
    <P>I hope Senators have benefited from this outline of the key provisions of the Bill. I look forward to the debate on it and commend it to Seanad Éireann.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister. It was particularly interesting that the earlier part of his speech dealt specifically with the new strategy being put in place to exclude poverty, create a more balanced society and build an inclusive society. The fact that he spent so much time dealing with this issue and highlighting what it is proposed to do over the next five years is conclusive evidence that over the last five years, the Minister failed to be effective in doing what was required. The most obvious failure in reducing poverty is the lack of communication, co-operation and knowledge between the Departments of Social, Community and Family Affairs, Health and Children and the Environment and Local Government. Many people have become the victims of poverty and are increasingly victimised because of the lack of co-operation. There are three bureaucracies with eight health boards thrown in for good measure. The really poor in our society have been very badly discriminated against.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has given substantial monetary increases in many of the social welfare payments. That is on the record and there is evidence to prove it. However, evidence from all the surveys carried out shows that the gap between the very wealthy and the poor has widened over the past five years. Despite the monetary increases and so on, the gap has widened in real terms. I do not blame the Minister specifically for that because it is overall Government strategy and policy. The Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the Tánaiste, in particular, have taken a very proactive line in relation to big business and the wealthy in our community and society. A variety <Col N="1087" /> of studies and examinations that have been carried out prove conclusively that the gap has widened.</P>
    <P>Everything in the revised anti-poverty strategy, Building an Inclusive Society, is evidence of the Government's failure to do anything over the past five years. All that was needed was a little common sense. One would swear to God that dealing with poor people and the critical situations that face them and addressing those issues was a weird science and that it was something rare and very unusual. Instead of doing anything, we have to have reports and examinations. I often wonder if common sense has gone out the window in this country. We are talking about providing for the most vulnerable people in our society and about communication between Departments. That involves Ministers having a chat, identifying the problem and telling their officials to get on with it. It is as simple as that, but instead we have bureaucracies standing on their lofty high horses, each holding court within their framework. These barriers and bureaucratic walls will not be easily broken down. I wish whatever Minister next holds the office good luck in breaking down the barriers and increasing co-operation. A Minister covering all areas of poverty across the three Departments involved is required.</P>
    <P>The Minister has elaborated on the child benefit aspects of the Bill. I commend him on the financial increases in child benefit he has provided for in the Bill which have been helpful. However, the reality is that children have become increasingly impoverished in other areas. Those who come from impoverished and deprived backgrounds need more support, whether it is within the school system or after school hours. Such a back-up system is very rare. Poor communities are becoming poorer. There is a real need for the Minister, with the Ministers for Health and Children and Education and Science, to address these issues. Real poverty begins in deprived and poor communities throughout the country. There are examples in every city, town and parish. The people concerned need to be given priority and consideration to help them deal with their circumstances.</P>
    <P>As a teacher I taught in the heart of Dublin city. One of the most basic things a child would expect before going to school is a decent breakfast. Tens of thousands of children go to school without having breakfast. It is very important that these children and their schools are targeted. The Minister, with the Minister for Education and Science, should try to identify the children concerned and ensure they have the basics such as healthy food. If they get this, they will be able to concentrate and avail of the education being provided. If they do not, they will have nothing. There is a need for more support for children with learning difficulties, although this might be more properly addressed to the Minister for Education and Science as it has not been forthcoming.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1088" />Reports have been completed at European Union level where the evidence shows that Ireland has one of the greatest gaps between rich and poor. It has also been shown that Irish children are among the poorest and most impoverished in the European Union. Despite having an economy whose indicators are at the top of the European league, we have not balanced this with the needs of our poorest citizens. The wealthy have become wealthier while the gap between rich and poor has widened. That is the litmus test which the Government has failed dramatically.</P>
    <P>The St. Vincent de Paul Society has carried out an analysis which demonstrates that the gap between rich and poor has become wider. Many families are living in appalling conditions. There are hundreds of people in my area who need a disabled person's grant, but adequate funding cannot be provided by the Government this year. Disabled people are hugely disadvantaged regarding basic accommodation and facilities. I am dealing with the case of an 80 year old woman who lives with her 48 year old daughter and has severe arthritis. She has had four hip operations and several ankle and knee operations. She does not have a bathroom or shower in her house which is very damp and of Third World standard. The Mid-Western Health Board and Clare County Council do not have funding to provide her with a disabled person's grant which would provide her with basic living conditions.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the Minister has wonderful programmes on paper. The disabled person's grant is an issue that must be addressed immediately by him in conjunction with the Ministers for Health and Children and the Environment and Local Government. This is the hidden Ireland about which we do not hear. These issues are not being addressed, rather they are being fobbed off through bureaucracy. We know that 50,000 households do not have a proper heating system. There are old people who require essential repairs to be carried out on their homes, but cannot afford them. The local authorities do not have enough funding to meet such demands. As a result, people are becoming increasingly impoverished.</P>
    <P>The household budget survey conducted between 1990 and 2000 shows a widening gap between rich and poor. Disposable income in the poorest 10% of households has increased by only 33% compared to 62% for the richest 10%. In 1997-98 30% of pensioners were in the poorest 20% of households, in the year 2000 this figure had increased to 38%. The gap is constantly widening.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and, if he does not mind, will discuss the reality of the Bill, which is that for the second year running, despite what Senator Taylor-Quinn claims, £850 million will be spent on the social welfare package. We have a short Bill today <Col N="1091" /> because of the Government's commitment to social welfare. When Senator Taylor-Quinn's party was in government it did nothing on payments for groups on social welfare.</P>

Child benefit is the fairest way as it treats all children equally. I congratulate the Government on delivering on its commitment to increase it.</P>
      <P>Concern was expressed in recent weeks about a downturn in the economy, but I hope that, whatever the case, our family first policy continues regardless of what party is in government, although I am certain that Fianna Fáil will continue it after the next general election.</P>

      <P>I am sure the electorate will appreciate what a Fianna Fáil led Government has done in the last five years. I can speak of my friends who appreciate the changes in child benefit and as their representative, relay their appreciation to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to enlighten and educate Senator Taylor-Quinn because I am also from a rural constituency, where many community crèches and child care facilities were established in recent years courtesy of funding from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform under its equal opportunities child care programme. The Senator referred to areas which were forgotten when it came to child care. I live in a very rural area of County Monaghan where we have a school of 57 children, and 22 more in a pre-school service, which shows that such services are provided and funded. I do not know what has happened in the <Col N="1093" /> Senator's constituency, but can speak of many private and community child care services which have benefited from Government funding. As Senator Quinn&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I remind the Senator that my name is Taylor-Quinn. I do not wish to be confused with Senator Quinn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnLeonard" hpid="Ms Leonard Ms Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Ms Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise, but as I did not wish to run out of time as Senator Taylor-Quinn did, I cut a few corners. I am sure she was aware that I was referring to her. Private providers of child care in rural areas find it difficult because they cannot charge the same exorbitant prices as those in large urban areas. We will have to return to the issue of grants towards staff costs for these providers.</P>
      <P>Senator Taylor-Quinn referred to poverty proofing. It is a long held conviction of many that providing individuals with a job is the best way to eliminate poverty. During the Government's term of office over 100,000 were removed from the live register. That is hugely significant to those who were effectively taken out of the poverty trap. The availability of educational opportunities and the increase in the number of training places combined with the increase in child care places, courtesy of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, means there are now greater opportunities for individuals, but particularly mothers who are the primary carers, to get out of the poverty trap.</P>
      <P>I welcome wholeheartedly the improvements for carers, an issue I discussed with the Minister on many occasions and raised in debates on the Social Welfare Bill, because we can never do enough for people who care for family members or relatives in the home. If carers do not receive support, however, they cannot give support to those for whom they are caring.</P>
      <P>I welcome the increase in the respite care grant which was first introduced in 1999 and has been increased on an annual basis by £100. We talk about maximising support for home care and the Minister said there would be co-ordination between the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs in that regard, but I hope some means will be devised whereby people who are ineligible for carer's allowance can be assessed with a view to them being entitled to respite care grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I totally oppose the elimination of the means test for carers. Senator Taylor-Quinn will agree that people who are extremely wealthy should not be entitled to the carer's allowance. She talked about wealth and poverty in her contribution so I am sure she will agree that very wealthy people should not take some of the cake <Col N="1094" /> which is to be divided among those who are less well off.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnLeonard" hpid="Ms Leonard Ms Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Ms Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Respite care is a different matter, however, regardless of a person's wealth. Carers need a break from the individual for whom they are caring and, similarly, a change is as good as a rest for the individual being cared for. Respite care can be extremely helpful from both points of view.</P>
      <P>I welcome the increase in the income disregard. The Minister gave a commitment two years ago that he would examine this area with a view to allowing more people to become eligible for the carer's allowance. The increase is welcome because people are living longer and will require care into the future.</P>
      <P>The changes in disability benefit are welcome. Individuals who have been off work due to sickness often want to return to work, but tend to delay doing that because of the restraints on them. I welcome the changes the Minister has made in relation to disability benefit.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to two minor details in the Bill. We all welcome the personal public service number introduced some years ago, but it appears that bureaucracy is still the order of the day because, regardless of the agency with which one is dealing, one has to repeat all the same details. I would welcome any change that would eliminate such red tape, which is a waste of time and paper in this age of modern technology. That is an area we have to examine.</P>
      <P>On that matter, Senator Taylor-Quinn might ask what we did when we were in office. We have dealt with the registration of births, marriages and deaths in the same way since 1864 and it took a Fianna Fáil Minister to introduce changes in this Bill. One should no longer have to stand in a queue for two or three hours to register when it may not be convenient to do so. I realise the job of those in Opposition is to criticise and Senator Taylor-Quinn spoke about me being honest, but if she was being honest she would admit that this Minister has done more in the past number of years across the board. Some of those improvements did not get the coverage they deserved, although we can shout from the rooftops about increases in old age pensions and child benefit which affect so many people. Many other changes have taken place in the past number of years, including that related to the pre-1963 benefit, additional training places, back to work and back to education allowances, etc. The increases in these areas may not be on a broad scale but they are hugely significant to the people they affect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on the changes he has made over the past five years and I look forward to increases in the future because the Government knows where it is heading in that respect. Our main aim over the past five years was to look after the elderly and carers, which we have done adequately, but I have no doubt that <Col N="1095" /> the commitments given by the Minister on child benefit and a number of other areas will be honoured after the next election.</P>

We could not believe our ears when we heard the rumour that afternoon that the Government was only giving a measly increase of £1.80 per week to old age pensioners. It gave an increase of 2.5% on all social welfare benefits at a time when the rate of inflation was 2.5%, which meant, in effect, that social welfare recipients did not get any real increase in benefit. We could not believe only those rates of increase were given at the time, particularly when there was a Labour Minister for Finance and a Democratic Left Minister for Social Welfare in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government promised to do a number of things when it took office, which it has more than fulfilled. In relation to child benefit, I remind the House that in 1997 a family with three children got the princely increase of £7 per month. Last year they got an increase of £80 per month and this year an increase of another £80 per month. If the Government is returned to office, they will <Col N="1098" /> get an increase of another £80 per month next year.</P>
    <P>Senator Leonard was correct in saying that the people are very appreciative and saying the move in relation to child benefit was one of the most significant apart from the increases in old age pension.

      <P>Apart from the increases, there were dramatic strategic moves, one being the Reach project and another being the Grow project. It is a source of disappointment that, while these projects will definitely come onstream in the latter half of this year, I may not be in this ministry.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to have worked with my officials on bringing forward the modernisation of delivery of services to the general public, something way beyond the remit of my Department, yet one which it is spearheading.</P>
      <P>Similarly, in relation to the national anti-poverty strategy, I do not accept what critics of the Government say about the rich getting richer and the poor not getting as rich. The discussion is about relative equity. It can be compared to saying, for example, that every income earner in a midlands town is on a salary of £10,000 and one person in the town wins the lotto. From a relative income point of view, those on a salary of £10,000 are much worse off the day after the person concerned wins the lotto, but are not any worse off in their personal circumstances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an economic fact that at a time of economic boom the issue of relativity becomes more skewed and at a time of an economic downturn relative income differences are not as stark. The Government's initiatives have raised all boats. I am sure the Senator would accept that people living in her constituency are much better off than they were five years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the strategic point of the national anti-poverty strategy, when we took office we accepted the previous Government's national anti-poverty strategy which it had just put in place. It contained certain commitments which were supposed to be reached by 2007. With the progress of the economy, virtually all of the targets set to be reached by 2007 were reached in the first few years of this Government's term of office. It was then necessary to sit down with the social partners to review progress on the national <Col N="1099" /> anti-poverty strategy, to review the old targets and set new ones. That is what we have done. No less a person than David Hanly on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; said he was 20 years doing the programme and he had never heard CORI come out and welcome such a document, which is what it did. It was the first time it had welcomed such a document. It did so because we gave specific commitments, which I hope, in the unlikely event of Senator Taylor-Quinn's party being in government after the next general election, it would continue, particularly the commitment to achieve the rate of &euro;150 per week in 2002 terms by 2007.</P>

      <P>Other groups welcomed the strategy. I have been lucky to be a Minister during the last five years. There was a social welfare budget increase of about £200 million the year before I took office; the Government increased it substantially in my first year and by £400 million the following year. The social welfare budget has increased by £850 million in each of the last two years. I am lucky to have worked with the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, who has been criticised by many. He has been the best Minister for Finance for many years.</P>

Each year has been better than the previous one. The social welfare budget has increased from £4.5 billion in 1997 to £7.5 billion in 2002, a magnificent achievement. As the Government prepares for the general election, it will ask the people to decide whether it has done a good job, based on its record.</P>

      <P>I thank the Chair for affording me the opportunity to raise the issue of delays in payments to farmers for various schemes and the difficulties arising as a result. I understand many payments have been delayed as a result of complications in the computer systems used in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. It appears that the system used in one section of the Department is incompatible with that used in another, meaning that many farmers who should have received payments by November 2001, at the latest, are still waiting. There are reports that some of those affected received payments this week.</P>
      <P>It appears that the computer systems in the Department leave much to be desired, at a time when the Minister for Public Enterprise is telling us what a wonderful country Ireland is as regards information technology. The ineffectiveness of technological systems in Departments is resulting in serious problems for many. The computer system which maps the acreage of each farm seems to be separate from that containing statistics for each farm's livestock, tag and herd numbers. The systems do not link with each other. The Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs has referred to his Department's computer network which ensures statistics relating to birth, death or marriage certificates can be accessed together at the press of a button. It appears that the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development is ten years behind as its computer system is incapable of providing an effective system for its customers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many farmers in my constituency of Clare have suffered hardship in recent months because they have not received their payments, as I am sure the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy de Valera, can testify. It is prob<Col N="1101" /> able that she has received representations in her constituency office from farmers with small and medium farms, whose margins have become tighter in recent years and for whose survival premium payments are quite important. I ask her to do all she can to ensure this error is rectified as soon as possible, as it is unacceptable that payments which should have been made in October or November 2001 should remain unpaid in March 2002. The Department used to have a standard practice of making all payments to farmers before Christmas, but it seems to have gone by the board.</P>
    <P>I am sorry the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh, is not present to comment on the decline in the numbers making certain applications, which shows that his record leaves much to be desired. The number of applications for suckler cow premium decreased by over 10,000 between 1998 and 2001 while applications for special beef premium dropped by 19,000 between 1999 and 2001. The number of ewe premium applications dropped by over 6,000 between 1998 and 2001 while the reduction in slaughter premium applications between 2000 and 2001 was about 600. A considerable drop of almost 20,000 in applications under disadvantaged area schemes was recorded between 1998 and 2001. These statistics speak volumes for the record of the Minister in relation to farms and farming families during his time as custodian of our agriculture industry. There is conclusive evidence that the numbers of farmers and herds have decreased, which is extremely serious.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to ensure this crisis does not continue. The outstanding payments I have mentioned should be given priority attention. Departmental staff should do the work needed to expedite the payments manually if the technology section is unable to make computer systems compatible. As I am sure one does not need to have the scientific ability of Einstein to do it manually, a few civil servants should be employed to reduce the levels of stress, hardship and concern among farmers. I thank the Cathaoirleach for permitting me to discuss this subject.</P>

      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to speak and Senator Taylor-Quinn for raising this matter. I apologise on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh, who asked me to speak in this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the past four years the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development has made huge strides in the timely and efficient delivery of payments to farmers. Quality of service is an integral part of its operations and it acknowledges the importance of providing services in an efficient, effective and user friendly manner. Since 1 January 2001 over &euro;1.243 billion <Col N="1102" /> has been issued to farmers under the various premium and area based compensatory allowance schemes, of which over &euro;830 million relates to payments made under the 2001 schemes. In the last month over 80,000 payments totalling almost &euro;68 million have been made. The process of introducing a new mapping and area aid processing system has raised some issues in clearing a small number of payments. The first and main phase of the redevelopment has been completed and every effort has been made to keep delay to a minimum, including the use of manual payments.</P>
    <P>The target dates for paying eligible applicants under the various schemes are set out in the protocol on direct payments to farmers. Ewe premium scheme payments are normally made in three instalments. Payment of the first instalment was delayed somewhat due to the need for enhanced controls following from discrepancies highlighted in the Cooley Peninsula during the foot and mouth disease cull, but payments commenced on 20 July on which day 74% of applicants were paid. Payment of the second and third instalments commenced in line with the protocol targets and 95% of applicants were paid within one day.</P>
    <P>In so far as the special beef premium and suckler cow premium schemes are concerned, EU regulations provide that an advance payment of 60% entitlement can commence on 16 October each year. Given the problems for farmers which arose as a result of the foot and mouth disease crisis last year, the Minister was instrumental in securing an increase in the rate of advance payment under these schemes from 60% to 80%. To date, some 96% of suckler cow applicants have received their advance payments while almost 92% have received their balancing payments.</P>
    <P>In the case of the special beef premium scheme, 95% of January-November 2001 applicants have received their advance payments while those who applied in December 2001 will be paid their advances during next week. It is intended that balancing payments under this scheme will commence in April when the national quota usage for 2001 has been fully established. EU regulations and the protocol arrangements provide that all balancing payments under these two schemes must be made by 30 June 2002. Payment of 2001 extensification premium is not due to commence until June 2002 in line with protocol commitments.</P>
    <P>The move from an animal based payment system to an area based payment under the disadvantaged areas compensatory allowance scheme greatly facilitated simplification of the scheme with the result that payment of full entitlements commenced on 21 September 2001 on which day 80% of applicants were paid. The current position is that in excess of &euro;214 million has been paid to 97% of applicants under the scheme.</P>
    <P>Payments under the arable aid scheme commenced on 16 November in line with EU regulations and protocol commitments on which day 95% of applicants were paid. By the end of 2001 <Col N="1103" /> over &euro;128 million was paid to 98% of all applicants.</P>
    <P>The agriculture and food industry is vital to our economy. The key to maintaining an industry that is vibrant and economically sustainable is through market access. This requires a system that respects the consumer's need for transparency and traceability through each link of the chain right back to production. Farmers are the first link in this chain. That is the reason the European Union insists that livestock premia payments are made in respect of animals that are traceable in accordance with a well developed and reliable system for identification and registration of animals. Not alone must cattle on which premium is being claimed be compliant with identification and registration requirements, so too must all other bovine animals on the holding.</P>
    <P>In Ireland the system for identification and registration of cattle is called CMMS. The Department has been making progressive use of the CMMS database in processing applications since 1997-98. In line with EU requirements cross-checks against the CMMS have been intensified since January 2000. The relevant regulation stipulates that premium can only be paid in respect of an animal properly recorded on the <Col N="1104" /> CMMS. For example, under the 2001 suckler cow premium scheme, over 1.1 million animal tag numbers have been cross-checked in this manner and difficulties initially arose in respect of about 30,000 tags, or 2.7% of animals. These difficulties mainly relate to farm-to-farm movements where, unfortunately, either the seller or buyer, or both, fails to notify the movement to the CMMS. We are also experiencing difficulties with birth and death notifications to the database.</P>
    <P>In quite a number of cases, according to the CMMS, animals being applied on as cows were heifers at the time of application. A further difficulty arises when farmers dispose of animals on which they have applied for premium during the retention period. The Department, through contact with individual farmers, is making every effort to have all these outstanding problems cleared as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The Department's fundamental purpose is to serve the citizen in a proper, fair and impartial manner which will ensure a high degree of farmer and public confidence. Raising the quality of services and responding positively to customer needs are, and will continue to be, operational priorities in all the Department's activities.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 4.05 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Tuesday, 26 March 2002.</P>
