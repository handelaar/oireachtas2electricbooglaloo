      <P>There is a formal Bill on our Agenda, No. 7, and the Minister for Local Government has asked the Seanad as a favour to take that Bill and dispose of it first, inasmuch as it is required for other legislation pending.  It is a short Bill, and there is no objection to it.  That Bill is the Acquisition of Land (Reference Committee) Bill, 1925.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasLinehan" hpid="Mr. LINEHAN Mr. LINEHAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LINEHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that this Bill requires a little discussion and a little explanation from the Minister, particularly as regards its effect on the debt owed by the 70,000 farmers who have purchased under the Act of 1923.  When the 1923 Act was being passed it was understood that their liability would be for the repayment of the land bonds mentioned in that Act.  It was, of course, understood then that these land bonds would be bonds that would bear the same value as any other Free State securities.  It is proposed now to inflate the value of those bonds, and, in that way, increase the liability of the 70,000 farmers who purchased under the 1923 Act by at least three million pounds. Those bonds must be redeemed within eighty years.  The holders will have a chance by periodical drawings of having their money paid at par at a much earlier period.  The bonds, when this Bill becomes law, will be even a more gilt-edged security than the two and three-quarter per cent.  Irish Land Stock under the 1903 Act, and even a more valuable security than Consols, because in neither of these cases is there any provision compelling the Government to redeem them at any period at par.  It is computed that the entire purchase money under the 1923 Act will amount in bonds to about £30,000,000.  In the ordinary way, if the bonds are not inflated, they will probably work out at present at a price of about 84, that is, comparing them with the price of the National Loan and making allowances for the difference in interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we calculate that they will be at least as valuable as the 2¾ per cent. Irish Land Stock, their value will be 95 so that the inflation in the value of <Col N="547" /> the stock will be at least eleven points. If the £30,000,000 of Land Bonds were calculated at 84, the price would be about £25,200,000, whereas at 95 the amount would be £28,500,000, representing an increase of £3,300,000 as a result of this Bill, in the value of the Land Bonds.  The 1923 Act was more or less a bargain between the landlords and the tenants.  The landlords did not think, in the discussions on the Bill, that they got enough while the tenants thought that they were paying enough, but I think it will be recognised that a fairly equitable arrangement was come to in the end.  That was on the assumption that the bonds would bear only their normal value in the money market of the day.  It was never stated while the 1923 Act was going through this House that a British guarantee would be given to increase the value of these bonds.  I have no objection whatever to the landlords getting the best price they could for the Bonds they have to take for the lands, but I do hold that if there is any change to be made in the 1923 Act, either by the inflation of the bonds or in any other way, that might be said to be for the benefit of the State, that the State ought to come forward and pay the amounts that would be added on to the tenants' liability under this Bill.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the 1923 Act provide that the annuitant purchasers will have to pay until the entire sum is redeemed.  There is no limit of years as in other Acts.  In other Acts a limit of years was put to the period in which the annuities are to be paid, but in the 1923 Act there is no limit.  It merely says that the annuities will have to be paid until the principal is paid.  It is quite evident that it will take a much longer period to pay off £28,000,000 than it would take to pay £25,000,000. I should be glad to hear the explanation of the Minister on this point, as to whether there really will be any addition to the liabilities of the tenants under this Bill, and if there is, if it is good State policy to do what is proposed under the Bill, and why it is that all this burden of £3,000,000 should be <Col N="548" /> placed on 70,000 tenants and not be borne by the State?</P>

      <P>I would like to ask what the Senator meant by the inflation of the bonds?  Is the improvement of the security held to be an inflation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is what the Senator meant; in other words, that by enhancing the security it would naturally raise the value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasBennett" hpid="Mr. BENNETT Mr. BENNETT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BENNETT</NameTxt>
      <P>I have tried to study the Land Bond Bill as closely as I possibly could and I listened with the greatest care to Senator Linehan's argument.  As far as I can see, the fundamental argument which he raised&mdash;and it is a reasonable argument &mdash;is that any advantage to be derived under the redemption or otherwise of these Bonds ought to be secured to the farmers.  I think the suggestion that the inflation or the deflation of the security would have any effect on the amount of interest the farmer would have to pay, on the period during which the redemption would accrue, is untenable.  The question whether the security is worth a certain amount is due purely to external matters&mdash;confidence of people in the security offered and various other considerations. The Saorstát according to the opinion of outsiders is being run in an honourable and straightforward way and with due regard to the interests of everybody and with due regard to the integrity and security of the country as a whole.  A bargain was made.  It is the essence of a bargain that it should be as equitable as possible.  Yet no bargain leaves all people equally satisfied. I take it that neither the landlords nor tenants were perfectly satisfied under the arrangement of the 1923 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The suggestion that because an external authority wishes of its own free will and initiative to keep the character of a certain security at a certain level, it is injurious to the shareholders of the company, is to me a suggestion which is not tenable.  To my mind the higher the security is in the market <Col N="549" /> the more likely a shareholder in the security is to get a good return, so to speak, for his capital.  In this case the security is the land of Ireland; the security is the people of Ireland and the security is the power and determination of the State to act equitably. This Land Bond Bill, to my mind, makes an additional security but that in no way affects the interests of the tenants of Ireland.  It in no way prejudicially affects the interests of the tenants, but in some measure it affects the interests of the people as a whole. I think that it will not affect in a larger way the interests of the people here because I take it that they have been properly treated.  They feel that the security they have got is a good one, and that they will not be treated inequitably.  More and more will they decide to stay in this country and to leave their money in this country when they feel that their interests will be honourably and faithfully protected. For that reason I welcome cordially this Land Bond Bill.  I welcome the greater value of the security which I feel confident after a good deal of thought will in no way prejudice us and will not, in any way, affect the interests of the tenants who bought under the 1923 Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. GOGARTY</NameTxt>
      <P>When I realise the seriousness of the proposal that has been made by Senator Linehan, I am prepared to say that it is not at all extravagant to denounce it as a monstrous one.  The idea is to debase security in order that the tenants who are past masters in causing insecurity should take advantage of this fall in credit.  Now, merely because the British Treasury, the greatest pillar of security in the world, is backing the Irish Land Bonds, we are asked to believe that this is prejudicing the tenants.  What is to prevent the tenant making the security bad?  We had instances of that before.  There are certain methods by which local people can make any security unsafe and local people can make any farm unsaleable. I think these proposals that we have listened to are nothing less than discreditable to this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel MOORE Colonel MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot follow <Col N="550" /> Senator Linehan's idea that by depreciating the value of the Land Bonds or allowing the value of the Land Bonds to be depreciated that the tenant will be in a better position than he otherwise would be.  Suppose the Land Bonds are depreciated in price and that instead of being worth £90 they are worth only £50, this, in my opinion, will only enable the speculators from across the Channel or any one else to come in and buy them up at £50.  The tenants will have to go on paying their annuities and paying them as they are paying them now.  I do not believe that Senator Linehan can have given very much thought to this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelODea" hpid="Mr. O'DEA Mr. O'DEA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'DEA</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Act of 1923 the tenants purchased their lands at 16½ years' purchase.  Under the old Act of 1903, the British Act, they purchased their land at something like 24 years' purchase.  The result is that the tenants buying to-day are getting their lands extremely cheap, compared with the men who bought in 1904 and 1905.  I was fortunate enough to have a very small property&mdash;I do not want to be personal&mdash;a place out near Bray.  It was in a very good position for building land, and it was convenient to the town of Bray.  The net rent, fee-simple title, was £120.  Under the Act of 1923 I got for that £90 in bonds.  If these bonds do appreciate for the reason that they have very substantial security behind them, I think I have a right to get any advantage that may arise from that.  My income was cut down £30 on a small property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think, through the fact that the British Government is backing those bonds, I should have a right to get something for the very serious loss I suffered.  The tenant, so far as I can see, will not lose anything.  I do not want in any way to be against the tenant farmers, for I realise that they are the main support of this country. I would like to see them all well-off and independent men.  I would like to see the tenant farmers of the country in the very best position, but I do not think they can profit, by depreciating the Land Bonds.  They could not profit.  If they pay 16½ years' purchase, no matter what price <Col N="551" /> the bonds are in the market, that would not affect the annuity they have to pay.  The annuity they have to pay to the Land Commission would be the same figure as it is now.  It would not matter whether the bonds were 84 or 54.  It would make no difference, as far as I know, in the moneys these farmers would have to pay.  If Senator Linehan can explain to me that the tenant farmers can get relief by depreciating the value of the bonds in the public market, I would consider the matter.  Under the present circumstances, I do not think they would gain a penny.  Therefore, I will vote for the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMacLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLOUGHLIN Mr. McLOUGHLIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLOUGHLIN</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite plain that, whether the bonds go up or down the ordinary tenant purchaser will not get any relief at all in his annuities. The rich farmer, who has plenty of money in the bank, will, if the bonds get depreciated, be in a position to buy them in to redeem the stock at a depreciated figure, and save himself the difference.  I do not think that this is a matter that affects the bulk of the tenant purchasers in Ireland at all.  I do not think we should entertain it for a moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CorneliusIrwin" hpid="Mr. IRWIN Mr. IRWIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. IRWIN</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I can understand the proposal of Senator Linehan is this: If the Land Bonds stand in the market at 84, and if the Treasury redeem them at 84, that is, if they are able by the Sinking Fund to buy up all the bonds in the market at 84, the bulk of the tenants at the redemption period would be credited with £100 for the £84 that the Treasury had paid in the purchase of the bonds, and that therefore the redemption period would not have to run as long as it would if the bonds had all to be bought up at £100.  To illustrate this let us go back to another Act.  Under the Ashbourne Act the British Treasury applied the Sinking Fund to buy up their own bonds.  These bonds were issued at £100.  They purchased them at an average price of between £50 and £60. The question arises: do the tenants get the benefit of this £40 or £50, the difference in the issue price of the bonds and the price at which they stood in the <Col N="552" /> market when they were purchased? Senator Linehan's point is twofold, first of all&mdash;if the Treasury buy in the market at 84 will the tenants or the Treasury get the benefit of it?&mdash; Senator Linehan appears to think that the tenants would get an advantage, and that if that were the case there would be something to be said why additional security should not be given. That would bolster up the bonds to £100, when that was not part of the bargain at the time it was made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>How can the tenants' liability be any greater or less by any reference to the prices at which the bonds stood in the market?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CorneliusIrwin" hpid="Mr. IRWIN Mr. IRWIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. IRWIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I will endeavour to illustrate it.  If the tenants' agreement was for £100, and there was £2 a year Sinking Fund, and that £2 is applied every year to buying one-fiftieth of the bonds, ultimately the £100 would be purchased for £84, whereas if the market fell these could be purchased for less, and the period of redemption would be shorter.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Linehan seems to be under a misapprehension in regard-to the terms of the 1923 Act. That Act provides in Section 1, sub-section (3), that the bonds shall be redeemable at par, and further down, that after thirty years they shall also be redeemable at par in another way.  All the bonds, as the Land Act of 1923 stands, will be redeemable at par.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasLinehan" hpid="Mr. LINEHAN Mr. LINEHAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LINEHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is not bound to redeem at any period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but they are bound to apply the Sinking Fund for redemption.  It will work out at a period of less than eighty years.  If the bonds were on the market at 84, strictly speaking, neither the Treasury nor the tenants would get any advantage, because the Treasury cannot expend the ordinary money of the Exchequer on investments.  We control certain funds like the Savings Bank <Col N="553" /> money, teachers' pension funds, and various other funds.  We can invest the money that is in those funds.  There is no doubt that if we bought these Land Bonds on the market at 84, and afterwards redeemed at par under the 1923 Act, the funds would benefit, but the tenants' repayment of capital would not diminish in any way by the depreciation of the bonds.  The annual payment, and the length of time of the annual payments, would be the same all the time, whether we redeemed at 100, or at 50.  My answer to Senator Linehan's question is that there is no additional burden thrown on the tenant by this Bill.  His liability in amount and in period stands as it was.  What is gained by this Bill is that we are preventing a serious, and, I believe, an undue strain, on the credit of the State. We must borrow for various State purposes and for development.  The state of our credit will regulate the amount of interest we will have to pay.  The price of our securities already in existence will decide the issue price of new securities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that if we have a continuing issue of Land Bonds, and that there is a big issue, the prices will sink considerably.  For instance, look at the Compensation Bonds and the National Loan.  The Compensation Bonds are really more valuable than the National Loan.  They are a better investment at the same price.  Yet, because a large issue of Compensation Bonds is taking place from day to day, and month to month, they are decidedly lower in the market than the National Loan.  If we are to proceed with the issue of £30,000,000 Land Bonds, throwing them on the market from month to month, the prices would sink very low.  People would have to realise for one purpose and another, as bonds would be constantly thrown on the market, and the price would, I believe, sink much lower than 84.  The result would be that the national security, resting on the same security, would be dragged down from 94 to 84, or perhaps less than 84.  If we proceed to borrow money for new projects we would have to issue at 84, or perhaps 80, and projects like the Shannon <Col N="554" /> scheme would have an entirely new complexion thrown on them by reason of the rate of interest being increased so substantially.  The tenants will lose nothing whatever by this Bill.  The State, I believe, will gain very substantially by relieving itself of a burden and, as I have explained in the Dáil, everything in connection with this bargain with the British Government is open and above board.  The terms of the British Act are on the face of it. There is nothing behind it.  The British Government promoted their Bill because of an agreement made with the landlords.</P>

      <P>The sum set aside under the old Act and continued by this Bill, is £1,000,000, divided in certain ways between the two types of guarantees that may be given.  It is very difficult from day to day to state what is the amount of money involved, for there are four stages.  The application has to be passed by the Advisory Committee.  After that it has to be passed by my own Department; then it is further considered and has to be passed by the Minister for Finance, and finally an arrangement is made that the money is forthcoming on foot of a guarantee.  Applications are received and recommended by the Advisory Committee.  So many applications have been received that they will involve, if they pass the remaining stages, a guarantee by the State of £494,000, that is, nearly half the sum allocated under the old Act has been utilised.  There have been difficulties, well known to the Seanad.  These difficulties have been eased in two ways, one definitely by a new arrangement with the banks, and money is more readily forthcoming than it was; and there is on foot a project of a particular type of investment corporation which would still further ease the operation of the Act.  The Act has been of considerable <Col N="556" /> benefit, as will be understood by the fact that the money involved by way of guarantee is about half the sum under the old Act.</P>

The Senator will recollect that under the provisions of the Act which expires on the 31st July, there is to be a statement given to the members of the Oireachtas showing the state of things.

I do not think the members of the Seanad understand what that company is or know anything about it.  I happen to have seen the prospectus on the matter, and really it is not one which I think the members of the Seanad should consent to.  It is the most unbusinesslike proposition I have seen.  I have never seen anything so outrageous.  The company was started with a certain nominal capital.  Advances are made at the request of the Government.</P>

    <P>I quite realise this Bill is one of very great importance to the country.  The amendment I have proposed is with a view to making it more complete and beneficial than possibly it will be if it is passed in its present form.  I have been inundated with letters and applications from people in the country who are alarmed at being thrown back for their only source of relief on the county councils.  There is no use in shutting our eyes to the facts.  The county councils have not always been bodies in which one could have the greatest confidence.  There are a great many cases in which people may have made a mistake.  We know, unfortunately, <Col N="559" /> in the country that there are influential people on various public bodies who may not regard with a friendly feeling, people interested in the matter of drainage.  The fundamental principle of this Bill is to take away from the Board of Works, who have hitherto had it, the responsibility of carrying out those projects and placing them in the hands of the county council.  Almost all the amendments that stand in my name are directed towards altering that and leaving the people the option, if they so wish, of going to the Board of Works, as in the past.  I know the feeling exists, and that difficulty will arise in the way of any people who are anxious to develop their lands.  I urge on the Parliamentary Secretaries in charge of the Bill to adopt this amendment.</P>

By the amendment they will be enabled to approach the body that is to be set up under the Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamBarrington" hpid="Mr. BARRINGTON Mr. BARRINGTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BARRINGTON</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily. Perhaps I might explain the procedure that was adopted in the past.  Where a number of people felt that their land required drainage very badly, they presented a petition to the Board of Works.  The Board appointed inspectors, who had all the necessary inquiries made.  Then, if it was thought fit, a drainage board was constituted to carry out the works.  I do not propose that that should be done now in every case.  I propose that, if circumstances arise in which it was necessary to have a drainage board constituted, the Board of Works should have power to do so.  The parties could apply to the county councils, and the county councils might then investigate or refuse to investigate.  The onus would be thrown on the councils.  I got a letter from a man who fears he may be at the mercy of people who, perhaps, will not be kindly disposed towards him.  That man would prefer, if he could, to forward his application to the Board of Works with such a deposit as the Board think necessary for the purpose of having it investigated.  There are still farmers in the country who have confidence in the Board of Works, and who are prepared to say that they will get better treatment and that their lands will be better developed if they put up the money necessary to enable the Board of Works to do it.  They feel that if they make application to the county council under the Bill that body will not incur the expense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="561" /> I also desire to call attention to a report in a paper that I received yesterday, where a similar question was referred to the county surveyor.  The idea is that when the county council receives the applications they will refer them to the county surveyors.  In the case that I have referred to, the county surveyor refused to do anything in connection with the matter unless he was paid.  I think the Bill is very defective as it stands, and in order to meet such a case this amendment should be added to it.  The people concerned will have to deposit with the Board of Works such a sum as the Board thinks will be sufficient to have an application investigated.  It is possible that county councils may not find themselves in a position to do the work.</P>

      <P>I think the Secretary's point is a little different.  It is not merely a question of inspection. After inspection, if the Board of Works thought it desirable to carry out the work, the Secretary, I think, is pointing out that that would involve the setting up of drainage boards.</P>

      <P>There are undoubtedly a couple of points involved in what Senator Barrington has put forward.  There is the fear that the county council may simply throw the petition aside.  In the preliminary stage it involves very little expense to the county council.  The Senator has <Col N="562" /> pointed out a case where the county surveyor may refuse to do the work. He said there was no provision in the Bill for that.  There is provision in the Bill whereby a county council may appoint another qualified engineer to make an inspection if, in the view of the county council, it is not one of the ordinary duties of the county surveyor or if they feel that he is already overloaded with work.  If the Senator reads Section 3 carefully, he will find the provision there.  There is undoubtedly a question involved in these amendments, not merely as to approach to the Board of Works to take up this particular work, but&mdash;it is clearly provided for in Amendment 3 &mdash;the setting up of drainage boards. I do not say that is the only alternative. Drainage boards may not be necessary, but that is the proposal, and it is almost fundamental in these amendments.</P>

      <P>We think that they are not only not necessary, but should not be allowed.  This idea of drainage boards, in the first in stance, seems to me to cut across the whole idea involved in the Bill.  It in volves, especially in the most important portions, finance in connection with the Bill, and co-operation between the central drainage authority and the county councils.  I am not going to raise any objection about the drafting <Col N="563" /> of the amendment.  I am simply referring to the general idea, and if I refer to any particular amendment it will not be to criticise how it affects the drafting of the Bill, but how it seems to cut across the very idea of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Take amendment 3, that I have already referred to, and make the change suggested by the Senator.  The Senator proposes in Section 3, sub-section (3) to insert after the word &ldquo;council&rdquo; in line 14 the words &ldquo;or any drainage board constituted under the provisions of this Act.&rdquo;  The section would then read: &ldquo;Every council to which a petition is presented under this Act shall refer such petition,&rdquo; and so on, and then finally &ldquo;shall consider such petition and such report, and may, if they think fit, pass a resolution (c) undertaking that if the lands referred to in the petition or any part thereof, either together with or without other lands in the neighbourhood thereof are constituted a separate drainage district the council or any drainage board constituted under the provisions of this Act would maintain the drainage works, etc.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is to say, that the council shall undertake that any drainage board constituted under the provisions of this Act shall do certain things.  They shall undertake that a body over which they have no control shall do certain things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamBarrington" hpid="Mr. BARRINGTON Mr. BARRINGTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BARRINGTON</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the meaning of the amendment.  The meaning of it is, that if the county council refuse to undertake this liability the Board of Works can establish a body that would be prepared to do that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I was giving that as an illustration of how the amendment cuts across the Act.  Undoubtedly, as the amendment stands, it does provide that the council shall undertake that either the council itself or the drainage board shall do these things.</P>

      <P>According to the amendment the county council is still to undertake that the drainage board shall do certain things.  Under this amendment there is no co-operation because by it we are cutting out the county council.  That is my objection to the amendment.  The whole scheme of the Bill is based on co-operation between the county council and the Central Authority.  The principal purpose of these amendments is to allow for the possibility of these drainage boards being set up.  After the experience that the Board of Works has had, the main purpose of this Bill is to get rid as quickly as possible of the existing drainage boards, and certainly not to facilitate the creation of any new drainage boards.  That is the point of view so far as this Bill is concerned.</P>

      <P>The object of this Bill is very largely to get back to an old Act called the 5th and 6th Vic. That Act proved to be such an utter failure that drainage boards had to be established to obviate the difficulties that had arisen under it.  It threw a certain amount of work on the Board of Works, and now the Board of Works are anxious to shuffle off all their responsibilities and put them on the backs of county councils.  I think you will find that the county councils will not accept that responsibility.</P>

      <P>The last point made by the Senator was that the Board of Works are trying to shuffle off, as he expressed it, their responsibility. The Senator ought to know that we have practically no responsibility under the Act of 1863. <Col N="565" /> The Board of Works had much more responsibility under the Act of 1842 than they had under the Act of 1863. In going back to the principle of the Act of 1842, the Senator says that the Board of Works are shuffling off their responsibility, though there was less responsibility under the Act of 1863.</P>

Surely if the farmers are allowed to go, in the first instance, to them, they would naturally ask them to do what they would have to do eventually.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamOSullivan" hpid="Professor O'SULLIVAN Professor O'SULLIVAN">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask Senators to remember that I cannot deal with several points at a time. I was replying to the last interruption of Senator Barrington's when he said that the Board of Works was trying to shuffle off its responsibilities under this Bill.  What I want to say is this, that the Board of Works is taking more responsibility under this Bill than it had under the Act of 1863 or under the Act of 1842.  Under the Act of 1863 the position was this: The initiative lay with the local people.  They provided the plans and they paid the engineer, and the only responsibility of the Board of Works was &ldquo;to vet&rdquo; the scheme. It is true that the Board of Works came in as regards the final award. The carrying out of the scheme was in no sense in the hands of the Board of Works.  It was in the hands of the promoters and their particular engineers. It was, as I have said, at the vetting of the scheme that the Board of Works came in, and after a final award had been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Once the drainage board was established, the Board of Works could not interfere except in one way.  If the drainage district was badly neglected, the Board of Works could come in. They could do the work themselves, and <Col N="566" /> put an extra charge on for what they had done, but otherwise they had no responsibility and no power whatever. They had more power, as I say, under the Act of 1842 than they had under the Act of 1863, but they have even more power and more responsibility under the Bill that we are now discussing than they had under the Act of 1842.  Senator Barrington suggested that the county councils were not perfect. We never pretended that they were perfect.  Drainage Boards, in our experience, have been extremely imperfect. Our recent experience has been that drainage boards are nowhere effective. I do not say that there is no place where they are not effective, but as regards any that we have examined the evidence is that they are not effective. During the past eighteen months we have examined, I suppose, sixty districts, and in none of these cases is there an effective drainage board in existence.  The main idea of this amendment is to get back these drainage boards to the position under the Act of 1863.  Senator Barrington condemned that Act.  He also condemned the Act of 1842, which was replaced by the Act of 1863.  The Act of 1842 failed possibly owing to extraneous reasons, such as the famine, and to the fact that famine works were carried out under it.  The Act of 1863 failed owing to its own inherent defects, and owing to the great social changes that took place under the operations of the various land Acts passed since 1881. This amendment is an attempt to revive in essence and to keep alive the Act of 1863.  I might say in passing that we are not repealing the Act of 1863. There is no repeal section in this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>This is rather complicated, and I want to know if I am right in saying that if the county councils turn a local petition down, that then the petition is dead, and there is no redress.  Would not Senator Barrington's object be met by giving the right of appeal to the Commissioners in any case in which the county council refuse to pass a scheme. The point is this, that there might be a very excellent scheme which the Board of Works would say was quite <Col N="567" /> a good scheme on its merits, but if the county council turn it down it is dead, and the petitioners have no power to go behind the action of the county council.  Would not the Senator's position be met if, instead of his elaborate proposals, there was a provision enabling the petitioners to go straight to the Commissioners and to appeal against the refusal of the county council to pass their scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamOSullivan" hpid="Professor O'SULLIVAN Professor O'SULLIVAN">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Bill was in the Dáil there was an amendment put down to that effect, but we felt that we could not consider that for the reason that the Bill involves close co-operation between the county council and the central authority. Under this Bill you are asking the county councils to undertake a very heavy responsibility, and therefore we did not think it fair that the county council should, so to speak, be saddled with responsibility in respect of a scheme which had been turned down by them.  We are not repealing the Act of 1863.  We are simply letting it die.  I want to make it quite clear that there will be no more public money given under that Act of 1863.  I fear that if this particular proposal were carried, people might be anxious to start more drainage boards.  In view of our experience of the existing drainage boards, these people would not be likely to get very much from the Ministry of Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole thing depends upon the finances of the scheme.  One of the many reasons why the present legislation was a dead letter, as it was long before this Bill ever saw the light, was that the finance was defective.  There was no means, owing to the various changes in the law and the splitting up of property, the passing of the land from the landlords to the tenants, to collect the drainage rates and the drainage maintenance rates.  This Bill does provide a means for doing that. It faces that particular responsibility which was never, as far as the drainage maintenance was concerned, under the Act of 1863, the responsibility of the Board of Works.  It was a responsibility of the local drainage board, <Col N="568" /> and they have never been able to fulfil it.  A drainage rate of sixpence or one penny cannot be recovered until six years, you cannot wait seven years, because then the statute of limitation would come in.  But this Bill does provide a method of collecting the rates for the proper maintenance of those districts.  It will be collected as the poor rate is collected, which is a much easier and less expensive way. The whole work of the Bill depends upon finance, and the finance depends upon the close working and co-operation between the county councils and the central authority.</P>
    <P>If you set up a drainage board as suggested here who is to collect the rate?  I have read the Senator's amendments in that direction, and I confess I am not quite clear about them when it comes to this point of the finance of the Bill, either in regard to Clause 17, 19 or 21 dealing with maintenance. The amendments he suggests there leave me in doubt as to whether it is the county council or the drainage board that is to decide what the amount of the rate is to be.  If the drainage board decided what the amount is to be, who, then, is to collect it?  The county council&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is what I want to be clear about.  That is the worst of the defects that have to be cleared in prospect of a drainage board being established.  I was not quite clear from the amendments whether it was the drainage board or not that was to do that work.  If it was the drainage board then it absolutely kills the whole purpose of these amendments.  It has been found impossible under the existing law for the drainage boards to collect the rates.  It would be still impossible under this Bill, and if it is impossible to collect the rates I think the State cannot give money which it cannot be paid back.</P>

      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary consider this point: If a scheme were turned down by the county council the applicants might <Col N="569" /> feel that they had not got due consideration. In that event would the applicants have the right to appeal to the Commissioners, and if the Commissioners sent back the case to the county council with their imprimatur and the suggestion that it might be more fully considered, then the county council might give it more full consideration, and that might be a step between the acceptance and the rejection of the amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>That might place the Commissioners in a very invidious position.  If they approved of a scheme that had been rejected by the county council, and sent it back to the county council, that body might tell the Commissioners to mind their own business, and might put the Commissioners in a false position.  If there is to be an appeal at all, it should be direct to the Commissioners to say whether they would or would not sanction the scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. IRWIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with that, were it not for the difficulty that the Parliamentary Secretary pointed out, that a direct appeal would put the Commissioners in the awkward position, perhaps, of compelling the county council to carry out a scheme that they were not anxious to carry out.  I foresee great difficulties in that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickKenny" hpid="Mr. KENNY Mr. KENNY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>The point raised in this discussion is as to the action of the county council in turning down a scheme that might be presented to them and whether there should or should not be a right of appeal in that decision. There may be cases, and very deserving cases, in which the county council will think fit to turn down the scheme. County councils have large interests to consider; for example, whether drainage would benefit roads, and if it did you would possibly find it easy to get the co-operation of the county council. If a drainage scheme was of benefit to public health, that, possibly, also would interest the county council and would serve to get the co-operation of the county council.  I can see the prospect of that co-operation all round which the Minister sees, and the probability <Col N="570" /> of contributions coming through the county council or the county councils affected, though there will not be much work done under this scheme, because it leaves the liability on the petitioners. This is rather ambiguous.  It does not clearly define the whole liability of the scheme and the cost of the works may rest entirely upon the petitioners eventually. Certainly there is a clause which permits a contribution from the Central Fund.  Public health may come in there and public utility and the Central Government may make a contribution.  If local interests other than the interests of the petitioners are served, such as roads, the local council may make a contribution if they so wish.  But the position, so far as the liability of the petitioners is concerned, is left in doubt.</P>
      <P>There was a movement made in my own locality, and the first question put to me was: &ldquo;What is our liability of this scheme is set up?  The ultimate cost may be considerable, and we may have to bear the brunt.  We do not know how the liability is to be spaced out, whether it is to be for a number of years or not; the rate of interest and sinking fund and the question of contribution-in-aid, are all very doubtful, and we would like a clear definition before putting our names to anything of the sort.&rdquo;  Possibly there are very good reasons for leaving the position in that ambiguous way and for not giving any closer or clearer definition. The principle running through this Bill, owing to the difficulties met in former schemes, is to get the co-operation of all parties concerned, both as to carrying out the work, the collection of rates, and the maintenance of the work when carried out. These matters can be more efficiently done through the county councils as they are a collecting body, and as the contribution will be collected with the poor rate and through the county councils. If the Minister would see his way to clear up some of these little points, I think it would make for the greater success of the operations of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I think it is not necessary for me to say that we are all concerned in making this Bill as effective, <Col N="571" /> efficient, and useful to the country as it can be made.  I am speaking as one who in the past has been very intimately connected with these things. I think the Minister is extremely hopeful if he hopes, under the Bill as it stands, without any appeal from the county council, or without any chance of the petitioners approaching the Board of Works, that the Bill is going to be efficient to any great extent.  I know that the whole question bristles with difficulties.  I know that the Act of 1847 was a failure, and I know that the Acts 26 and 27 Vic.  have been very largely a failure, and I am convinced that if this Act goes through as it stands it will also be a failure.  I want to make it as efficient as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Put yourselves in the position of a county council.  Suppose there is a member of the county council who has spite or animus against some of the petitioners.  Such things do unfortunately happen in the country.  I think that last week there was a case in the newspapers in which a county council ruled out a certain class of people.  The same thing may arise in connection with drainage.  Supposing someone on the county council has an animus against anybody; the county council will consider how the ratepayers, whom they represent, how the roads, sanitary arrangements, and so forth, are affected by this cost.  They may not, perhaps, be affected at all.  The people promoting a scheme may not be people of great influence, but they feel the necessity of having drainage done, and the county council may say that they do not feel themselves bound to pledge the resources of the county to the scheme. I have had much experience in the past, and I cannot hold the Board of Works entirely free from blame in connection with this matter.  They had vast powers which they did not call into force, and sometimes they called them into force at times which were not desirable.  As the Minister has said, inquiries were made as to the maintenance work done during the last four or five years, and they were not found satisfactory.  I would like to ask any Senator who knows the conditions that existed during the past four or five <Col N="572" /> years whether anything in the way of maintenance of roads, bridges, or anything else has been satisfactorily carried out in that period.  To quote the example of how such things have been done during the last few years is, I think, simply shelving the question.  I have suggested what, in my opinion, is best to be done, but the Parliamentary Secretary does not see his way to fall in with my views, and I cannot do more.  I am certain that, unless the Bill contains some appeal from the county council, it will be a failure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamOSullivan" hpid="Professor O'SULLIVAN Professor O'SULLIVAN">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned the fact that we had made inspections specifically during the last couple of years.  It is not true that neglect on the part of drainage boards is confined to the last couple of years. Many of the boards have ceased to exist, and in very few cases have they raised proper maintenance rates to carry out the work.  That experience extends over ten and twenty years, and these boards have, on the whole, worked extremely badly.  I admit that there may be cases in which the county councils may have acted wrongly, even through wrong motives, but if you legislate for these exceptional cases, I fear that you are cutting across and destroying the Bill as a whole.  I am willing to admit that in individual cases injustice may be done, but I am afraid that in trying to see that justice will be done in these cases, you will do damage in many cases, and you will operate against the whole idea of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This preliminary examination by the county surveyor is not meant to be a very thoroughgoing examination.  The idea is not that the county surveyor will prepare a scheme.  The preparation of a scheme comes later by the expert engineer sent down by the Board of Works.  All that is required is that the county council's engineer or the county surveyor shall see whether there is a <i>prima facie</i> case for examination. Senator Kenny raised a number of points, one of which was that people would not know what they are letting themselves in for.  So far as we could arrange, we have made an effort to see that they will know as far as possible <Col N="573" /> what they are letting themselves in for. That is provided in Section 6.  Before there are any commitments on their part to a scheme, everything proposed to be done is set out and the amount required, so far as our engineers can estimate it, is to be set out and, not only that, but the contribution for which each person will be liable in that case is also to be set out.  In sub-section (2) (h) you will see that the amount provided from public funds is to be set out.  It is not because they have voted on a scheme that they are committed to anything.  It is the people who are concerned in the scheme who will decide and not the Board of Works or the county council.</P>

      <P>We will progress.  You see, Senator, I did not <Col N="574" /> stop any wide discussion as there is a big principle involved in the first amendment.  The big principle is this: whether in the event of the county council turning down a scheme, or, in view of the possibility that they might turn down a good scheme, there should be either an appeal to the Commissioners of Public Works, or a direct approach to them at the choice of the local people interested.  That is the big question we are debating.  That is not a Second Reading question, because it arises as an appropriate discussion on Senator Barrington's amendment.  That is the reason I have allowed the discussion to roam on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir NUGENT EVERARD</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask one or two questions, but I do not know to what amendments they would be applicable.  As far as the maintenance is concerned, it appears to be primarily the duty of the county council to see that the works are maintained, but there may not be sufficient force in a district interested in the maintenance of the drainage to make strong representations to the county council.  I have had some experience of drainage districts, and I know that a great cause of discontent is that some of those who are rated for the maintenance of these schemes think that they are over-rated and that they do not get as much benefit as some of their neighbours.  In many cases they are influential people and they more or less obstruct the maintenance, even at the present day, of drainage schemes.  I rather fear that unless it is specifically the duty of the county council to inspect periodically these drainage districts, unless this duty is allocated to either the poor rate collector, the county surveyor or the assistant surveyor, a great many drainage schemes, carried out at great expense in the first instance, may be allowed to go into disrepair and have to be gone over again with a repetition of the whole expense.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">

      <P>I would suggest, in view of what the Parliamentary Secretary has stated, that the existing drainage schemes have all failed&mdash;a statement with which I am in agreement&mdash; that he should, under this Bill, empower the county council to have the existing drainage schemes carried out properly. What I want to convey is this: I have in mind a case where a large sum of money was expended many years ago on a drainage scheme.  A local drainage board was set up and a collector was appointed, but the collector's poundage was so small that it was not worth his while to make the collection. As a result the drainage was allowed to go uncared for, and all this huge expenditure of money has gone for nothing because of the want of a little attention. If the Parliamentary Secretary would incorporate in his present Bill powers ample enough to enable the county council to levy the required rate, and to see that the work is carried out, I think it would be desirable.</P>

I still reiterate what I started with, the suggestion that <Col N="576" /> something should be done to meet the Secretary's great objection, that this amendment would involve a drainage board.  I think the first two amendments can be met without instituting any board.  The whole machinery, except the imposition on the county council for the maintenance of the districts afterwards, is there.  I do not think that is much of a difficulty.  I think it would be a great improvement to an admirable Bill.  I do not wish to press it further, however.</P>

      <P>I think this amendment is not necessary, because it presupposes that some of the county councils would not carry out their duties as responsible people in charge of local administration, including drainage.  I should imagine that that objection was met in the Bill.  It is laid down clearly that the county council shall&mdash;it is mandatory on the county council&mdash;direct their county surveyor or some other engineer to examine the petition and then after the petition has been examined by the engineer, whether he is the local county surveyor or an engineer specially employed for the purpose, when his report is submitted that a special meeting of the county council shall be held to consider his report.  The county council may then pass a resolution approving of the petition.  I am not one of those who have lost all faith in our people and if the councils are not prepared to do what they think is best in the interests of the locality and the people, if they are not satisfied to act themselves on the report they get from the engineer, they can pass a resolution requesting the Commissioners to inquire into the details before they do anything further.

    <P>At least one of the persons, not members of the county council or any of the county councils concerned, who are elected to be members of any committee or joint committee appointed under this section in relation to any drainage works shall be a ratepayer liable to pay drainage rate in respect of such drainage works.</P>

      <P>There is only one point in connection with that.  If I may epitomise what the section means it is this-it will be the duty of the county council to maintain these districts and appoint a small board to do that, and it says that at least one person not a member of the county council or of any county councils concerned who are elected to be members of any committee or joint committee appointed under this section &ldquo;shall be a ratepayer liable to pay drainage rates in respect of such drainage works.&rdquo;  That is that they shall have power to call in persons outside the county council and form them into a board.  It is the same class of board that the Minister objects to. This board is to see that the drainage shall be properly maintained.  Now, instead of having one person, I propose that all the members of the board shall be persons interested in the lands and liable to pay rates for them.  I think that people interested in the land would be more suitable.  It is more their business to see that the work is properly maintained, and I think they should be ratepayers.</P>

      <P>This amendment would impose an unnecessary and undue restriction on the county council in the selection of a committee.  The principle is all right that the members of the committee should be ratepayers and liable to be rated in respect of the drainage scheme.  It is quite possible, <Col N="582" /> however, that outside of these people there might be one or more people who would be experts in matters of this kind, and simply because they did not happen to be ratepayers they would not be eligible to go on this committee and they would be excluded from fulfilling any service on this committee. It is proposed that one of them shall be a ratepayer, and so the principle is admitted, but to exclude persons who are not ratepayers would be imposing a ridiculous restriction.  It might be impracticable in some districts to form a committee with the necessary information and managing abilities if the personnel were restricted to the ratepayers. It may turn out that it would be largely in the interests of those rateable people that someone outside their immediate circle should be selected.  I suppose the claims of the rateable people in respect of misrepresentation will receive consideration, for I do not suppose that there will be great competition for appointment to these committees.  I think it would be injurious to the whole scheme to limit representation to the ratepayers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BARRINGTON</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 27, sub-section (2).  To add at the end of the sub-section a new paragraph (d) as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(d)  any person who permits his cattle to trespass upon, damage or injure any embankments or other works erected under the provisions of this Act or who is owner of the lands immediately adjoining such embankments and who neglects to take sufficient precaution to prevent such trespass shall be liable to the penalties provided by sub-section (3) of this section.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="584" /> This is dealing with an entirely different matter.  It has been found utterly impossible properly to protect the embankments, which very often form an essential portion of an arterial drainage scheme.  People will allow their cattle to trespass unless there is some penalty imposed for trespass on the embankments.  Any person with experience knows that the embankments will not remain for long if cattle keep trespassing on them.  When cattle are found trespassing on an embankment, if you speak to the owner of the adjoining lands about the matter, he will say that the cattle do not belong to him but to somebody else. The onus is put on the drainage board to prove the ownership of the cattle trespassing, and that is impossible to do.  It is obvious that no person is going to allow other people's cattle to trespass on his land if he can help it, and if cattle are found regularly grazing on these embankments and ruining them, it is obvious that they belong to the owner of the land adjoining.  The principle in the amendment has been embodied in some Drainage Acts, but it is left out in this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BENNETT</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no condition of things which leads to greater quarrelling between neighbours than rivers and drainage.  A further penal provision, such as proposed, would only accentuate that sort of trouble.  Wherever there are small rivers there is the greatest difficulty in keeping the cattle from trespassing and crossing from one farm to another.  I do not think you can devise a perfect system that will prevent trespassing.  I think the amendment is impracticable, and would lead to trouble.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a certain amount of sympathy with what Senator Barrington has said, so much so that we had a provision of this kind in the Bill when introduced first, but as the result of strong representations made to us from the Dáil, and also as a result of very careful consideration of the matter by our own engineers, we came to the conclusion that the proposal would be unworkable.  A man <Col N="585" /> could not in practice prevent his cattle, even with the greatest care, from trespassing except he, or the drainage board puts up a fence.  If you ask people along the banks of the river to put up drainage fences, I think they would vote against the scheme as they would imagine that no benefit they would get from the drainage would compensate them for the expense of putting up that particular fence.  It was with reluctance, therefore, I had to drop that particular sub-section.  I would be the last person to deny that the Act of 1869 in this particular was very ineffective.  On one occasion there was an eminent engineer&mdash;I think his name was Barrington&mdash;who gave evidence before a commission, to the effect that he had known several cases in which this particular provision had been invoked, and in which the ludicrous penalty of 1/-, with costs, had been imposed, and so strongly was he impressed with the necessity for a proper provision of this kind that he suggested that the only way was to have a minimum penalty of £3, with costs as well.  I do not wish to enter into the law on the matter, but I have a vague idea that under common law a man could be summoned for trespass. I am not sure that a man is bound to fence his land under common law to keep his cattle in, but in any case it is with reluctance that I was compelled to drop this particular provision.</P>

      <P>I would ask Senator Barrington to withdraw this amendment.  I consider it is impracticable. Without any very high embankments it would be almost impossible to prevent cattle trespassing on them.  Any damage caused by the trespass would be found out by periodical inspection, and it is the repair that is done in time that counts.  I do not see that any penalty is to be imposed for damage done to drainage by cattle walking through a stream, and in that way carrying down all sorts of dirt, and blocking and damming up a great deal of water.</P>

      <P>My reason for bringing forward this amendment was <Col N="586" /> because of many years' experience.  I had before me cases where important drainage was carried out, and there were miles and miles of embankments. One man allowed his cattle to go on these embankments and damage them to such an extent that the next flood that came up burst them, and for miles around serious damage was caused.  They took proceedings against the drainage board and the damages recovered were something in the nature of £700.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;If and whenever the execution of any works under this Act would or might involve the destruction or injury of or any interference with any ancient monument which in the opinion of the Minister is of public interest by reason of the historical, traditional, archæological or artistic interest attaching thereto, the Minister may with the consent of the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland by order constitute the said Commissioners guardians of such monument under the Ancient Monuments Protection Acts, 1882 and 1892, and thereupon those Acts shall apply to such monument and the said Commissioners shall take such steps whether by removal and re-erection, raising, embanking or otherwise as they shall consider necessary for the protection of such monument.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The amendment does not appear exactly as it was handed in.  As I said at the time, it was necessary to have it looked at by the draughtsman.  This is the draughtsman's version, to which we agree in substance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BARRINGTON</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 17, after the word &ldquo;interference&rdquo; in line 18 to insert the words &ldquo;including excessive use thereof.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is to provide for a case where a contractor who, we will say, is constructing lines of supply over the country would be conveying by lorry heavy poles and other material along country roads.  It would be a great temptation to such a contractor, if materials were landed in Dublin, to put them on a lorry and send them down over the public road.  Anyone who has any experience in these matters knows that there is nothing so destructive to roads as carrying poles, which swerve as the lorry goes along I think it is very undesirable that a contractor should be permitted to use the roads for bringing these materials longer distances than is absolutely necessary.  It is very undesirable in the <Col N="591" /> interests of the ratepayers.  The Minister should see that such materials are not carried further than is necessary from the nearest canal depot or railway station.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamBarrington" hpid="Mr. BARRINGTON Mr. BARRINGTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BARRINGTON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think both are the same.  Amendment No. 11 reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 17&mdash;To add at the end of the section a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(e)  it shall be incumbent upon the Minister to provide in all contracts executed under the provisions of this Act that all heavy materials, poles, cables, etc., for the execution of the works for distribution of electricity under this Act shall not be carried by road for a longer distance than would be involved in the carriage of the same from the nearest railway station, canal harbour, or other public depôt for the handling of goods.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I have some knowledge of the methods that were adopted to try and deal with excessive use of the roads by motor lorries.  The county councils, in order to meet cases where there was excessive use of the roads by lorries, made a comparison of what the expenditure was before the roads were so used and afterwards.  They found it quite impossible to carry that comparison out unless tolls were levied.  It would be impossible, in such a case as this, to select a certain branch road, as the materials might be going from Dublin to Castleconnell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamBarrington" hpid="Mr. BARRINGTON Mr. BARRINGTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BARRINGTON</NameTxt>

      <P>As I understand it, the amendment that Senator Barrington desires is to prevent the excessive use of the roads by lorries.  Where the roads are used to <Col N="592" /> an excessive extent, those who use them should pay for them.  The owners of motor lorries that drew timber had to pay for the use of the roads.  They were prosecuted by the county councils, and damages were successfully obtained against them.  A contractor, if he wanted to make as much money as he could, might ruin the roads with heavily-laden lorries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the matter is adequately provided for already. Senator Barrington said that heavy poles would obstruct the traffic. The remedy should be to prohibit them on the road.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamBarrington" hpid="Mr. BARRINGTON Mr. BARRINGTON">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>If the amendment said the excessive use thereof, in so far as excessive use is liable to damage the roads, and if that is the aim I would ask the Senator interested in the amendment to look at sub-section (b) of Section 17 of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Paragraph (b) of section 17 says: &ldquo;The Minister shall, at or before the completion of the works, either restore the road or bridge to its former condition, or construct, after consultation with the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, a new permanent road or bridge.&rdquo;  If I am bound to restore the road to its former condition where it has been cut up by heavy traffic, I do not see what is outstanding.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamBarrington" hpid="Mr. BARRINGTON Mr. BARRINGTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BARRINGTON</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already moved that amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>In answer to this amendment I urge that in so far as it is an attempt to provide against damage being done to the roads, that, as I have already said, is met by paragraph (b) of Section 17.  I would like to point out what the expense and inconvenience would be of following out the proposed new section (e) to its conclusion.  Take <Col N="593" /> as an example that part of the country lying between Sligo and Boyle.  There are railway stations at both these points, and of course there are other stations in between.  I am getting the transmission line extended to Sligo, and I may take material by road towards Sligo.  There will have to be carted a certain number of poles and wires for the purpose of laying the line.  So long as I go towards Boyle, I am getting to a point at which I can use Boyle railway station.  But if I want to reach a point beyond Boyle, I will have to deliver the poles and wires at the next station, which may be some miles away, and then cart them back a certain number of miles by road.  That is going to involve more expense and more destruction of the roads.  I think that all that is met by paragraph (b) of Section 17.  Let me take a station ten miles from Boyle.  I may want to erect poles and wires a distance of 6 miles away.  That will mean that after delivering the poles and wires at a station 10 miles away, I will have to cart them back a distance of four miles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamBarrington" hpid="Mr. BARRINGTON Mr. BARRINGTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BARRINGTON</NameTxt>
      <P>Take the transmission line from Limerick to Dublin, which I suppose will be the principal one in the country.  Say that you want to deliver poles and other materials at some place between Roscrea and Maryborough. You may find it more convenient to send the material on a lorry from Dublin to the point at which the poles are going to be put up.  The lorry may be sent the full distance from Dublin, whereas if you use the railway and deliver the material at Roscrea Station you would save the roads a great deal of wear and tear.  There are several other places all over the country where the same thing may happen. The poles used in connection with the erection of transmission lines are very heavy.  These poles extend a long way over the lorry.  They surge up and down, and they cause tremendous wear and tear to the roads.  I suggest that if the roads are to be used for this purpose they will be cut to pieces, and that is what I want to guard against.</P>

      <P>In view of the paragraph in Section 17, to which <Col N="594" /> the Minister has called attention, it is natural to assume, I think, that the Government will do this in the way that will inflict least injury on the roads, because you must remember that under that paragraph in the section the Government have undertaken the obligation of putting the roads back into proper repair.  I am sure they will do this in the way that will cause least damage to the roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamBarrington" hpid="Mr. BARRINGTON Mr. BARRINGTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BARRINGTON</NameTxt>
      <P>What I fear is that the contractor will employ the easiest and the speediest means that occur to him to handle the material, and if all these heavy materials are to be taken over the roads of the country, then enormous damage is certain to be done to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>If the amendment is to be taken seriously it means that all the heavy material, such as the engines and machines used in the construction of the canal, are going to be taken by road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamBarrington" hpid="Mr. BARRINGTON Mr. BARRINGTON">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>All the heavy machinery needed for the excavation of the canal is to be taken by rail and landed at Foynes.  There is provision for the building of a special railway for the carrying of heavy machinery to the place at which it is required in connection with the making of the canal.  As a matter of fact, I might say that these transmission poles are not heavy at all.  There will be no great traffic occasioned by the transport of the poles and wires required for the transmission lines.  It will be a matter of getting these things landed at certain points, and then transporting them by some means or other across fields to the points at which they are required.  If you leave out the machinery required in connection with the construction of the canal the <Col N="595" /> amount of material taken by road in connection with the Shannon scheme is going to be very small.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamBarrington" hpid="Mr. BARRINGTON Mr. BARRINGTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BARRINGTON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is drawing a red herring across this question by suggesting that I meant that the heavy engines were going to be taken by road.  I only meant the material used in connection with the distribution of electricity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment reads: &ldquo;All heavy materials, poles, cables, etc., for the execution of the work for distribution of electricity.&rdquo; That includes, I take it, the engines required in connection with the generation of electricity, and surely generation is a matter that is precedent to distribution?</P>

      <P>If the Minister had the experience that I have in these matters he would see, I think, that lorries going up and down the country with heavy poles cause a great deal of damage.  My idea in moving this amendment is to save the ratepayers of the country from having to bear the damage caused by this kind of traffic.</P>

The message is to the effect that the Dáil has agreed to the amendments inserted in this House, Nos. 1 to 7, with the exception of No. 4, with which they disagreed.  The amendment No. 4 with which they disagreed is not, I think, of very vital importance. It will be found on page 3 of the Bill.  It simply provides that after the word &ldquo;entry&rdquo; in Section 6 the words &ldquo;if necessary&rdquo; should be inserted.

      <P>Before the House rises I would like to point out it was already arranged that we would meet to-morrow at half-past eleven, and that the first business would be to deal with the report of your Committee and the recommendations they made with regard to the coming elections.  I ask the House to allow me to make one slight change.  It is a matter of very great personal convenience to the Deputy Chairman that he should be able to dispose of his motion for the Second Reading of his Bill earlier in the day, and as that will occupy only a few minutes, I will put it first on the Order Paper; the second order will be the matter of dealing with these recommendations. As to that, might I say, personally I hold the view, after looking into it, that the time provided for the handing in of proposals was very short.  Of course it had to be short in view of the pressure that has been put upon us, but in as much as owing to the important private engagements of Senators, we will not be able to meet next week until Thursday, I do not see any reason why the time for handing in these proposals should not be extended to Thursday.  That would give from Friday to Thursday, and I think that that would provide possibly as much time as would be reasonably required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then there is another suggestion that I want to make, and I want Senators to turn it over in their mind.  The form of the proposal contains, as part of the form, the consent of the candidates proposed. The fact of that being on the form will involve handing it about, and passing it from the Senator who is nominator to the candidate, and will involve delay.  I intend to suggest to the House to-morrow that there should be an alternative&mdash;that is to say, that a candidate may be at liberty to send his <Col N="597" /> consent in writing, direct to my office, so as to get rid of the necessity of having to send the actual proposal form which he might not do if the Senator proposing him was at one end of the Free State and he at the other, and which would involve considerable delay.</P>
