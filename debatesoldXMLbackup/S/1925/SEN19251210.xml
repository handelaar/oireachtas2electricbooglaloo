      <P>I think it will be a convenience if we distribute, in the first instance, the papers in connection with this election for the Standing Committee for the ensuing year.  It will take some time to take them up and verify the results in view of the fact that it is by proportional representation. The papers will be distributed now, and I wish to explain very briefly the procedure to Senators, because it is not exactly simple.  The object is to select a Committee of eight, known as a Committee of Selection.  The duty of that Committee will be, when they are appointed, to make recommendations as to the Senators they think most desirable to fill the vacancies on other Committees.  We have several important Committees that are re-elected each year, and the duty of the Selection Committee will be to recommend suitable Senators for those other Committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The list will be handed to you now and it contains the names of the sixty Senators.  Each Senator is at liberty to vote for any number from one to sixty.  I would recommend you not to extend your vote to the sixty.  You may do it, but possibly you will be satisfied when you have reached number eight.  However that may be, you are entitled to vote in favour of the entire sixty or if you wish you can confine it to one.  If you exceed one nomination you have to number your succescessive Senators consecutively, that is to say, you give your first preference to Senator A, then if you want to give your second preference to Senator B you number him two; your next choice is three, and so on in that way.  Any paper not so handed in numbered in that way is to be rejected.  You are not to vote for the Chairman in this connection. <Col N="30" /> He is not disqualified, but I do not think he should be on the Committee. I am not a candidate for it, nor is it necessary to vote for the Vice-Chairman. He is an ex-officio member. Senator Bennett is an ex-officio member, and therefore you do not require to vote for him.  You are not to sign the paper or put any mark on it that would identify it, because it is voting by ballot.  Therefore, you are not by any way to disclose the identity of the persons who fill the paper, either by signing it or by any other way.</P>
    <P>May I make one other suggestion, not by way of dictating or limiting Senators' choice, but the principal work will occupy their time for the next month or two.  That is the real function to be discharged during the next couple of months.  Therefore, I say, in making your choice of Senators you should, as far as possible, see that you are supporting candidates who are likely to attend.  The papers will now be distributed. They will be collected in a quarter of an hour, and if by any chance a Senator gets into trouble with his paper so as to require a second one he has only to apply to me and he will be furnished with a second one.</P>

      <P>While the papers are being distributed might I mention another matter?  The House will recollect that yesterday, at my suggestion, Senator O'Farrell was good enough to fall in with what I invited him to do, to put off his motion on the paper yesterday until to-day. He did that because I suggested to him that it would be impossible for the Minister, owing to the proceedings in the Dáil, to attend yesterday, and the House then agreed the motion should stand over until to-day.  In the meantime, the expected conclusion of the debate yesterday has not arisen.  The debate is still going on and it will be necessary for the Minister for Industry and Commerce to be in his place in the other House to-day.  He is here now and I understand he is in a position to make a statement that perhaps Senator O'Farrell might like to hear before he opens his motion.  I have not <Col N="31" /> the faintest notion of what it is, but it was rather suggested to me by the Minister that perhaps it would be better for the Senator to hear it and it would be certainly convenient for the Minister if he were allowed to make it now, because then he could depart in peace to a less serene atmosphere.  I do not know whether Senator O'Farrell would think that a reasonable suggestion or not.  He is entitled to proceed with his motion without giving place to the Minister, but it occurred to me it would be an advantage to him if he heard what the Minister had to say.</P>

      <P>I should like to say a few words at this stage.  Apparently the Cathaoirleach has been misinformed as to why I came here.  I came here to make a further appeal to the Seanad.  With regard to one thing the position has been accurately stated by Lord Glenavy, namely, that I have to attend the Dáil to-day and it would not be possible for me, in consequence of that, to make a statement such as would be warranted by the motion of Senator O'Farrell.  I do not want to delay the motion.  What I want to do is to ask the Seanad to reserve their vote until I shall be able to make a statement prior to their voting.  Senator O'Farrell said yesterday evening that the patient should be here while the medicine was being administered. That is not possible, but I should like to turn up here to show whether it was a poisonous draught or a tonic.  I should like to make a statement before the motion is put.  If the Senators think of going on without my presence I do not object.  I do not even say that it is not desirable, but I should like the House not to take a vote without allowing me to make a statement.</P>

      <P>I beg to move the introduction of the Shop Hours (Barbers and Hairdressers, Dublin and Districts) Bill, 1925.  This is a Bill to give effect in law to an agreement that has been arrived at between the employers and the working people engaged in the small industry known as hairdressers' or barbers' shops.  It is not necessary in introducing a Bill to make a speech. It is a Bill simply to give effect to an agreement arrived at and so put an end to the practice that was not very nice of keeping those shops open on Sundays, and late on Saturdays.  I <Col N="34" /> formally beg to move that the Bill be read a first time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Seanad regrets the unhappy auspices under which the Shannon Electrification Scheme has been launched, and hereby records its considered opinion that the success of the undertaking and the general interests of the State will be best promoted by a recognition on the part of the Government of the right of the workers engaged to rates of wages at least sufficient to provide themselves and their families with the indispensable necessaries of civilised life.</P>
      <P>I feel that I am at a considerable disadvantage in moving this motion from the fact that the responsible Minister is absent and that there is no representative of the Government at all present. Nobody regrets more than I do the necessity for moving such a motion. From the very inception of the Shannon Electrification Scheme the Labour Party gave it its blessing and its unqualified support.  We have no regrets for that and we would enthusiastically do so again under similar circumstances. We admired the ability of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in piloting the Bill through both Houses and we ventured to express our admiration of that ability.  I am sorry to say that the idol has turned out to have feet of clay and while we may compliment him upon his ability we certainly cannot congratulate him upon his statesmanship.  We had looked upon this in a particular way as a measure of our own, so to speak.  We felt that it was the first great scheme of national reconstruction and one that would have far-reaching, vital effects upon the commercial, social and economic development of the Saorstát.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had intended, if circumstances were other than they are now, to make a special appeal from the headquarters of Irish Labour to all those engaged on the work to look upon it as a national undertaking, to give unstintedly and <Col N="35" /> ungrudgingly of their best, and to show what Irish workers could do towards the social and commercial regeneration of Ireland.  Unfortunately the Minister has decreed otherwise and to-day we have no option but to offer all the opposition that is possible in the circumstances to the scheme as now being run and we appeal to all that is decent, high-minded and patriotic and to all who are anxious for lifting the standard of Irish life above the level of the pig-sty to say that the terms which the Minister offers to the rank and file of the workers on this job are an insult to our civilisation.  This is purely an engineering job.  There can be no denying that fact.  Instead of taking the wages obtaining for navvies and people of that kind on engineering jobs throughout the country the Minister seeks to take the wages paid in connection with agriculture in the district.</P>
    <P>In the first place there is little or no agricultural labour employed in that particular district.  Along the banks of the Shannon they are very largely small farmers and they work the land with the help of their families.  This work is absolutely different to farming. No one can say that it is work analogous to that performed on a farm.  The work is absolutely different and five-sixths of the men engaged will have to be brought from a distance.  They will have to leave their own homes and support themselves in the much-vaunted canteens that we heard about and then send home whatever remains to keep their families.  I know that the President said that the men engaged on the work would in the main be single men. In other words, they could not afford to pay married men.  These men, whatever their circumstances, must live lives of celibacy until this work is finished and at the end of that period as they will probably be unemployed they can get married.  They will have plenty of time to do it.  Not only is this purely an engineering job but it is being run by one of the best organised engineering firms in the world, with the result that they will be able to get the very last ounce out of every man.  When you compare this work with agricultural work you compare it with the <Col N="36" /> worst organised industry not only here but in any other country.</P>
    <P>I do not think any other industry would survive for two years if it was worked in the antiquated, haphazard and careless manner in which agriculture, in the main, is worked in Ireland, for reasons that we are all aware of. The result is that the farmer is never able to get the same return from labour as an engineering firm such as this, with its perfect organisation, able to use the last minute and get the last ounce of power out of every individual employed.  In addition, agriculture is at present in a particularly depressed position, and it is on such conditions&mdash; conditions which are unprecedented but which, I believe, are of a temporary character&mdash;that the contractors, on the advice of the Minister, seek to fix a wage of 32/- a week.  The cost of living stands to-day 188 points over pre-war. It is only a simple calculation to see that 32/- a week now is equivalent to 17/- per week pre-war.  I do not think anyone here would agree that 17/- a week on an engineering job would be a reasonable wage in pre-war days.  We were told, and believed, that one result of the scheme would be that it would have a profound effect on Irish commercial and social life.  If that were not so I do not think the country could afford the scheme.  If it can afford the scheme it can afford to pay at least the ordinary wages paid by private employers on a similar job.</P>
    <P>If the country cannot afford to pay the ordinary rate of wages then the country cannot afford the scheme, because a country in that condition of bankruptcy will be quite unable to buy electricity at any price or for any purpose. We are told that we are a poor country and that consequently in any Government job we have to pay wages below the standard.  In effect that is what we are told.  Does that argument hold when we are going to purchase the materials necessary for the job?  Will it do to go to Germany, to England, or elsewhere and say to manufacturers or others: &ldquo;Look here, gentlemen, we are a very poor country.  We cannot afford to pay the market price for materials, but we want to give you an order to carry this scheme into effect&rdquo;?  Instead <Col N="37" /> of getting a reduction because of our poverty, in reality would we not be forced to pay more because our credit would not be as good as would otherwise be the case?</P>
    <P>I do not think Siemens-Schuckert have given their services any cheaper because of the alleged statement that we are a particularly poor country.  The wages paid are based on the fact that the men concerned have been drawn from the land.  Did anyone ever hear a more ridiculous justification for such an atrocity?  After all where are the police and the Civic Guard drawn from?  Are they not drawn from the land in the main?  And do we pay them farm labourers' wages?  Where are members of the Civil Service drawn from?  Where are members of the Dáil and of the Seanad drawn from in the main, and even Cabinet Ministers?  They nearly all come from the land.  They have been connected with the land in one form or another and still we never take that into consideration when fixing their remuneration. We heard a lot of mawkish humbug, because that is all it is, in the circumstances, recently about a Gaelic Ireland.  Instead of creating a Gaelic Ireland, it is more likely to create an Irish China.  It matters little what any people do if they have such working conditions forced on them by their own Government that they are unable to raise themselves above the level of the ordinary pig-sty.  That is the grand rural culture that a native Government was to create.  That is what a native Government, with the help of the Gaelic language, was to do. The Minister's father was a member of the British Parliament, and I should like to visualise what he would say if this scheme was promoted by the British Government at this rate of wages.  I fancy he would blush to see his son in an Irish Parliament seeking to impose these degrading conditions on Irish workers.</P>
    <P>The Minister is terribly annoyed at being criticised.  He glories in his shame, because shame it is.  I notice that he has chosen to be rude and insulting to Labour Deputies in the other House because they thought fit to criticise the scheme.  It seems that it only <Col N="38" /> requires a Ministerial post and a university education for one to dispense with the ordinary courtesies of life with impunity.  One often thanks the Lord he is not a gentleman in that sense of the word when we see the manner in which Ministers have conducted themselves in debates on this particular question in the other House.  It is a pity he and his colleagues did not show the same strength of will, the same great foresight and political acumen last week when British Ministers were robbing Ireland's pockets. One danger of this attitude is that if Ministers come down very low in reply to questions on the subject, both Senators and Deputies may eventually come down to the Ministerial level.  I admit it is a petty effort, but still it is quite possible, and when that happens, well the dignity of the Oireachtas will have been a thing of the past.  I know it is very difficult for gentlemen with comfortable incomes to try and place themselves in the position of a family having to support themselves and get the necessaries of life out of what remains from 32/- a week after the breadwinner has provided for himself away from home.</P>
    <P>We are inclined, I suppose, in cases of that kind to look upon workmen as the British in India would look upon the native who was intended by nature and by Providence to have his children brought up in suffering and ignorance as if that is his allotted place in life. Why should we try and visualise these sufferings?  Our common Christianity tells us that all children are made after God's own image and likeness and have certain fundamental rights which no one has a right to deprive them of.</P>
    <P>Ministers are constantly painting glowing pictures abroad of Irish conditions, and at home taking fiendish delight in saying that we are only a nation of paupers.  In Italy recently the President gave an interview to the foreign Press and we could almost hear the flow of the milk and honey.  He gave one the impression of places in Ireland where the streets are paved with loaves and the houses thatched with pancakes.  Yet the first speech he made when he came <Col N="39" /> home was a querulous lecture on the audacity of looking for the barest living wage on a great Governmental construction scheme.  It is nearly time Ministers said one thing and stuck to it and not make foreigners laugh at and Irishmen weep at their antics.</P>
    <P>In page 65 of the Report the firm say that they will offer prizes for rapid work.  How are they going to do that? Here and there men are selected and are privately given 10d. an hour instead of the standard of 8d. per hour, and these are used as a sort of spur to try to get the others to give of their best at 8d. an hour.  It is simply like buying a slave and bribing that slave to trade on his unfortunate colleagues. It reminds one of the ancient days when they took a man from the galleys and put him over others who were his fellow slaves.  He turned out to be the greatest tyrant of all and he punished the others in a way that no other gaoler would because when men drop to a certain degree of poverty there are no depths to which they will not sink, mentally as well as physically.  The Minister states that he will get all the men that are necessary.  He will, but of what sort?  He will get the flotsam and jetsam of humanity, the down-and-outs. The waifs and strays of humanity will always trek towards where there is excitement or anything new, but he will never get good workers at the present rate of wages to make this great scheme a success.</P>
    <P>Already we have it for a positive fact that over a thousand men have come and worked for a short time and gone their way.  They could not possibly exist or bring themselves to exist under the conditions in which they were supposed to work.  Two men who walked all the way from Dungarvan, which was a sure sign that they were anxious to work, worked for a week and then trekked off the whole way again rather than stick the conditions under which they had to work.  To give the whole of the men that will be engaged on the partial scheme, say 50/- a week, would only mean at the outside an additional £300,000.  That at 5½ per cent. would be £16,500.  The estimate of the minimum output for the driest year is 150,000 units, so that the cost of giving <Col N="40" /> these men 50/- a week, to the consumer of electricity, would be one-fortieth of a penny per unit.  In other words, a person using a forty-volt lamp four hours a day for every day in the year, would have to pay only 2d. at the end of the year, or 1/2d. per quarter, to meet this extra cost.  If we take it on the basis of the minimum consumption estimated by the Minister for the first three years after the scheme is in operation, that is 36 units per head of the population, of 112,000,000 units, it would mean about 1-35th of a penny, and the difference in price would be, at the very most, 3d. per year to a person using a forty-volt lamp four hours a day for every day in the year.  Are we to keep these men for all those years working under these dire conditions of poverty rather than pay that additional mite in the cost of electricity?  That is the difference between poverty and a living wage, and are we not prepared to make that sacrifice?</P>
    <P>We are told that as a result of the recent pact made in London our credit will be considerably improved and our facilities for floating loans very much better than hitherto.  If there is any improvement worth mentioning&mdash;I fancy on that estimate made by the Minister that we could get a loan at 5½ per cent.&mdash;we will be able to get the same loan now at 5 per cent. when our credit has been so much improved, seeing that the Minister estimated that we would get a loan at 5½ per cent. even when this terrible alleged burden was hanging over our heads.  The difference of 1/2 per cent. in the interest on the loan would be £26,500.  That would more than pay for floating an additional £300,000 of a loan, and you could give considerably more than 50/- a week to the men concerned.  The Minister, however, is evidently determined to have his victory over helpless humanity.  He is determined on being the strong talkative Minister and to see this thing through to the bitter end. Personally I do not envy him a ghastly triumph of that kind.  His allies will be hunger, privation and suffering.  I am very much mistaken, however, if any Government will long survive a victory of that kind.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="41" /> We have heard quite a lot about this wonderful diet which is supplied at 12/- a week to the galley slaves employed on the scheme.  I hope Senators have read the menu card which was published in the daily Press.  They will notice, if they have, that breakfast consists of bread and butter&mdash;I am told now that it is landlady's butter, a mixture of butter and margarine&mdash;and a saucepan of tea.  That is the substantial fare on which these men are expected to go out to do heavy navvies' work, in many cases up to their ankles in mud, floundering on the banks of the Shannon. Then for dinner they are supplied with meat, vegetable, and potatoes.  I do not say anything about that.  For tea they will have, again, bread and butter, and by way of a little variety they are to have a half-ounce of jam.  These are the total meals per day.  Evidently in order to be able to tackle the substantial breakfast it is necessary to have no supper, so from the time they get their bread and tea they are to have nothing until the following morning when they will have bread, butter and tea again to fortify themselves for the day's work.  One result of this is that some of the men are spending an additional 6/- or 7/- a week to buy extra food so as to keep themselves from actual hunger.  I have heard of one man who bought as much as three breakfasts in the one day.  Some of the men go into Limerick for this extra food as they do not want to be seen buying the stuff at the canteen; when they bring back a loaf they eat it privately, in the huts.</P>
    <P>We saw a short time after the outbreak of the Civil War the menu allowed to political prisoners who had been taken in arms against the State. I ask Senators to compare that menu with the menu offered to those men who are asked to bring this great scheme into being and who are working 50 hours a week.  When comparing this diet with the diet supplied to those who were taken in arms, one begins to wonder are loyalty and patriotism worth while at all.  It is a very sad state of affairs that Irish soldiers led by Irish generals have no more ennobling pursuit than to lead bodies of blacklegs to steal the bread from the tables of Irish women and children.  These are men <Col N="42" /> who thought they were fighting for an ideal, but now that they are demobilised the Government employs them to lead blacklegs.  That is the grand result of their fight for liberty.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether there is any significance in the fact that the Minister's predecessor is the so-called Labour Adviser on this scheme.  I wonder also is there any significance in the fact that one of the contractors' names has never been disclosed?</P>
    <P>We should not forget that we have yet to get money for this scheme and I wonder does it strike the Minister that he is going to get money on more favourable conditions with peace obtaining along the banks of the Shannon than if we are in a state of perpetual war?  There is a limit beyond which constitutional means will not go, and be it constitutional or otherwise, it will be the effort of all those associated with Labour to warn investors everywhere not to sink one penny in the scheme, that the scheme is cursed from its inception because of the auspices under which it was floated, and it will be the effort of Labour to make it a failure. If the Minister thinks this is not going to make any difference he can go on. It is very difficult to fight this scheme in the ordinary way, because of the fact that no trade unionists have been employed on the scheme.  They have simply gone round and got people from the gutter and employed them.  But these conditions will not last always. Already we have had a strike there. There was a strike there last week and we are informed that as a result of it an offer has been made to increase the wages by a few shillings.  I do not know what truth there is in that.  In any case the fact that we may be beaten is not going to deter us.</P>
    <P>There are times when we must fight whether we win or not, and this is an occasion on which I certainly would prefer to be on the side of a defeated fight for the cause of humanity than on the side of the victor, the only result of whose victory will be to press down and demoralise Irish rural conditions. The scheme will be cursed by those whom poverty and other circumstances have forced to accept work on it.  It will have the curse of those women and <Col N="43" /> children who will have to live in poverty for the next three years because of the miserable wage paid to their breadwinners.  It will be banned by organised Labour throughout the whole of its work, and under those conditions it cannot be a success.  If this is what the Government can do for us I think it is time they gave the country an opportunity of seeing whether they cannot find some other Government who will do a little better.  We can find £250,000 a year for the next sixty years to pay into the British Treasury, and we can find another million for the purpose of increasing by ten per cent. the compensation payable to people whose property was destroyed. We can find all that money and hamper ourselves for the next sixty years, but we cannot find money to pay the men engaged on the first great scheme of national construction a wage which will enable them to buy for themselves and their families the indispensable necessaries of civilised life.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Farrell has made a very clever speech.  I have heard such speeches made before.  He speaks for the Labour Party.  I have no quarrel with them, but I regret to hear that they intend to offer opposition to this scheme.  The real genesis of his speech is this, that the labourer, in what he terms simply an engineering scheme, is not given his proper wages.  Of course that is an important point to the Labour Party. I will just state exactly what the Minister in charge of the Bill for this scheme said in the Dáil on the 24th November, 1925.  Before I read that I should like to say something else.</P>

      <P>With your leave, sir, I will proceed.  Senator O'Farrell complained that people who criticise this scheme in the same way as it is criticised here were treated with ridicule.  Let me just read what occurred on the 24th November, 1925, in the Dáil.  Mr. Davin asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If he can state the total number of workers employed in the Shannon scheme in the Limerick district on Tuesday, November the 17th, 1925, the numbers in receipt of 50/- and 32/- respectively, also the number of Germans employed on the date mentioned, whether he has made any inquiries as to dissatisfaction amongst workers on account of the quality of food supplied, and whether or not and if so how many men were either dismissed, or left work for this or any other reason since the work commenced.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Mr. McGilligan replied: &ldquo;On the 17th November, 517 Irish and 109 German workers were employed, a total of 626.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is no doubt what Senator O'Farrell objects to, and it was rather sarcastic, I admit:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Deputy will be sorry to hear that the number of Irish workers has since risen to 609 and that a total of 718 is now employed.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Now he mentions that there has been a strike.</P>

      <P>I am not going to follow Senator O'Farrell into his technical terms or into the meticulous finances that he dealt with.  He really made out that we were going to borrow <Col N="46" /> money at I do not know what, and while it was said we were very rich that we were the poorest country in the world.  I do not agree with him, but of course he is quite at liberty to say that and put it into a very clever speech.  To take a broad view of the question, the real truth of it is that we have got a Government now that is going to carry out the scheme.  The attitude of the Labour Party I can quite understand, but I hope that now and in the future they will take a broader view in the matter than that which has been stated in the speech we have just heard.  They are quite right to oppose and quite right to find fault with wages, but I do hope they will take a broader view of the matter than what has been expressed.  We are a new State, a very new State indeed, and it is only now that we are entering into the phase, as I mentioned before, of domestic legislation.</P>
      <P>I know that Senator O'Farrell travelled very far in his speech.  He alluded to Italy and to some other countries. Mussolini's name and other names were mentioned.  I do not wish to pass any criticism whatever on other countries, nor do I wish to find fault in any way with Senator O'Farrell's speech.  He has a right to his opinions the same as anybody else. I hope, however, that the Labour Party will not really interfere in this serious matter, because it is a serious matter to encourage men who are only too anxious to be encouraged to make a little mischief.  After all this is only a very small matter.  The world does not care very much whether the Shannon scheme goes through or not, but we here care very much, and therefore I hope that the Labour Party, for whom I have the greatest respect&mdash; their consistency in opposing this is what they are out for, as I see they are consistently opposing&mdash;will at all events in this matter modify the very strong opinions which they have expressed publicly in the calm atmosphere of our Seanad.</P>

      <P>I listened with as great a care as I could to the very able speech of Senator O'Farrell, and having heard it I have tried to construe <Col N="47" /> his motion and consider whether the Seanad is in a position, or ought to be in a position to accept it. What he asks us to do in effect is to say that the rates of wages paid to the Shannon workers are not sufficient to provide them, as his motion states, with &ldquo;the indispensable necessaries of civilised life.&rdquo;  That is what we are asked to maintain.  That would be a very easy question to answer if we had any knowledge of the actual costs, of the actual requirements and needs of civilised life.  Civilised life is a very large term to use, and this resolution is of a very complex kind.  Everybody admits the right of a man to a living wage, and the right of a man to the reasonable amenities of life and to reasonable comfort.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasBennett" hpid="Mr. BENNETT Mr. BENNETT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BENNETT</NameTxt>
      <P>A grand assumption of ignorance, as the Senator phrases it, To enable us to come to a conclusion on this matter we would need to look around and to consider this question in a broad way.  We would have to consider what the income of the country is, the state of our national budget, as well as the needs of the community as a whole.  All these things we would have to consider.  Then we should try and get a concrete case, and see if an injustice is being done here as against the needs of the community.  No one would deny the economic doctrine which underlies this: the right of every man to live and the right of every man to enjoy the reasonable amenities of life; but it is also the duty of the State and the duty of the nation to see that not one particular section of the nation, but that the nation as a whole, is kept in reasonable comfort.  For this reason, before I would like to express an opinion on such a matter as this, I think there should be a broad stocktaking of <Col N="48" /> all the assets of the community to consider whether the wage that is tentatively suggested&mdash;there is no concrete suggestion put before us&mdash;would ensure in the words of the motion &ldquo;the indispensable necessaries of civilised life.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If a country is not in a position to satisfy the particular viewpoint of one section of the community, is the theory then that all effort must stop and that we must all die?  Senator O'Farrell suggests that the country cannot afford a scheme of this nature, unless it can pay the wage which a particular section demands.  If that is admitted, no work can go on, because after all a man has to consider costings and a thousand and one other things, and is it to be suggested that the work must stop because one particular party, and only one particular party, concerned in this contract considers that it is not getting sufficient?  That is my viewpoint. I do not think we have sufficient material at our disposal to say whether or not the reasonable amenities of civilised life are being provided for the workers in this case.  For my part I should like sincerely that the scheme could afford to give the workers 50/- a week.  I should like that every worker in the country could, if possible, get more than 50/- a week, but at the same time I would like to see that justice was done all round, and that it would not be filched from one for another to get it.</P>

      <P>Cheap talk, Senator O'Farrell replies.  I offered no interruption to his expensive talk.  Expensive talk is all very well, but we ought to talk sensibly.  If we come here to discuss national schemes, then I think we must discuss them from the national viewpoint.  Men are equal, we all know: they are all equal in personal dignity, but they are not equal in individual power nor are they equal individually. What would be a reasonable amount to give what is called in this motion the needs of civilised life in one case, would not give in another case that reasonable amount, and I maintain that to accept a motion such as we have here, without thinking on it in <Col N="49" /> the broader aspects, would not be reasonable.</P>

      <P>Quite so.  I never expected that you would have any opinion as to what I would or would not do.  Nevertheless, I have a duty to perform, and I will endeavour to perform it.  We must all take into account the reasonable theories of economics admitted by worker and capitalist alike, and surely in that case no man would produce a certain amount of wealth more than his fellows, by some means or by some contingency, unless he was allowed the enjoyment of the excess production which he produces by his own individual efforts.  But these are broad questions of economics which are not concerned with the present case, and to narrow the thing down, I take strong exception to Senator O'Farrell's suggestion that because a scheme cannot pay a wage which he and those associated with him desire, that, therefore, the scheme should not be carried out.  He based his case very largely on that: that the country should not carry out a scheme which cannot afford to pay the wages that Senator O'Farrell says it should pay.  That is the doctrine he wishes us to subscribe to.</P>

We are told forsooth that agriculture is worked in the most haphazard way.  We are told that we agriculturists are working in the most haphazard way and we are advised to work in a better way.  We hope to work in a better way, and we are gradually striving towards that goal.  If we are not working in a way that would appeal to Senator O'Farrell, we are, I suggest, working in a way which we believe will contribute to the greatest advantage of Ireland as a whole and not for the interests of any small of narrow section.  We shall try and so order the affairs of this State that in the long run each individual in the State will be better off.  If Senator O'Farrell will agree to amend his motion in some way he might make it acceptable to me.

He makes an appeal which means that in his opinion the wage paid is not a wage <Col N="51" /> that would maintain certain people in civilised amenities.  I maintain that a large number of the people of this unfortunate island of ours are being maintained on as small a wage.  The rate may indeed be insufficient.  I read into his innuendo that unless the wages he demands are paid&mdash;he tried to qualify his statement afterwards&mdash;the scheme is unsound, and should not be carried out.

It is in that spirit that I try to examine the motion Senator O'Farrell has brought before the House.  I am somewhat puzzled at the attitude taken up by organised labour; because if all organised labour had been able, through its organisation&mdash; if its organisation had been sufficiently comprehensive and efficient&mdash;to cover the whole field, I need hardly say we would not have Senator O'Farrell standing up in this House for the purpose of trying to gain his demands.  They would be gained in another way, a strictly constitutional way, and, possibly, in a more effective manner.  Presumably it is because this labour organisation is not sufficiently powerful to cover the whole field of labour that we are now getting this form of political pressure exerted, I do not say improperly exerted, in the interests of the labouring classes.</P>

      <P>We have heard a good deal about the right of the labourer to live.  It is his right, but it is all a question of degree.  I do not think that the Senator has satisfied the House, and he has not satisfied me, that the standard of living afforded here is unduly harsh.  I admit it is not generous, but it is better, and this is the point I wish to make, than the standard of living afforded generally to sixty or seventy per cent. of the population.  It is a better standard of living than is afforded to the ordinary agricultural labourer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter of opinion.  The House can decide.  The wage paid under this scheme is, roughly, fifty per cent. more than what is paid to agricultural labourers.  I go further and I say it affords a far better standard of living than that enjoyed by small farmers whose standard of living is worse than that of paid agricultural labourers.  In view of these facts it is very difficult to persuade oneself that there is any case made for paying an admittedly higher standard than that enjoyed by sixty per cent. of the population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to take a detached view of these matters apart from sentiment. None of us can get away from sentiment. We all have it.  I know in some quarters there is some doubt that many employers do feel in their hearts the conditions under which labourers work and exist.  I do not think it is a fair suggestion; we all feel this sentiment, but there are inexorable laws of economics that you cannot get away from without ruin to the State.  There are methods by which you can, for a short time, by financial artifice raise prices and wages, and for a time all goes well and things are very good, but then comes the crash, and many countries have suffered from it.  The countries that aim at maintaining a sound financial position have to be governed by the laws of supply and demand, and to <Col N="53" /> a certain extent, and I use the word advisedly, you cannot get away from the fact that labour is a commodity, and capital is a commodity, and you cannot ignore that aspect of the matter in its entirety.  The State does not accept responsibility for every one of its citizens except the obligation to keep them from starvation.  It does not accept the obligation of supporting every one of its citizens.  The State cannot accept the obligation to support more than the power and wealth of the State justifies, and for that reason I cannot see that the case has been made out that in view of this country's wealth and in view of the supply that is offering that the wages offered are unduly harsh.  They certainly are not generous but they are economic and that, in my opinion, is the determining factor.</P>

      <P>We are told that this is an engineering job.  The work for which this wage is offered is work that will be done by men who are navvies.  It is a navvy's job, not an engineer's job.  It is unskilled labour. No doubt it is labour that many unskilled men could not do, but still it is unskilled labour.  Now when we are told that these men are to get 32/- a week that does not mean 32/- alone. These men will have some sort of shelter huts provided for them in addition to their 32/- a week.  Of course I admit it may be necessary to construct shelter huts for these men. If the men got £4 a week or £5 a week it would be necessary to construct huts <Col N="55" /> so as to follow the job as it develops. This hut accommodation would be in addition to the £4 a week just as it is in addition to the 32/- a week.  We are told that there are no trade unionists employed at this work.  Well there are men unemployed who might be on this work, and I say there are men unemployed and largely unemployed by trade union restrictions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DOWDALL</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather pleased to be asked to prove it.  I can give Senators an example of what took place in Cork recently.  A man who had been a trade unionist took employment in Ford's, and Ford's wages being over trade union rates, no one there subscribes to the trade unions.  I will give the full details of this to the Labour Senators if they desire to inquire into it.  In due course this man, who is a technical man, got better employment elsewhere, and his work was such in his new job that it kept eight or ten carpenters going.  The firm by whom this man was engaged was told: &ldquo;You must not employ him, he is not in the union.&rdquo;  The employer said: &ldquo;He will join the union.&rdquo;  But the union people answered: &ldquo;Oh, no, he left us and we cannot have the union taken up and thrown down at pleasure, and this man must go.&rdquo;&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said his employer. &ldquo;if he goes eight or ten carpenters must also go,&rdquo; and the reply was: &ldquo;They must walk the plank.&rdquo;  As I say, I am prepared to give the full details of this case if it is required.  Was not that making unemployment?  Were these men so unemployed the flotsam and the jetsam of the Labour movement? You may get some flotsam and jetsam on the Shannon scheme, but we are told that men actually walked from Dungarvan to find work on the Shannon scheme, and it can hardly be said that it is the flotsam and jetsam of labour that would travel that distance to obtain work.  I do not attempt to say that 32/- a week, with whatever is added, is a generous wage.  I say that if inquiry and investigation showed that the scheme could afford to provide more in the way of wages, I would <Col N="56" /> warmly support the paying of more for this work, but if this work can only be done at this price, then I trust that the Government will persevere and carry it out to its successful issue.</P>

      <P>I rise to second the motion, if it is not too late, proposed by Senator O'Farrell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Just before I say anything in the matter I would like to read now a paragraph from the introduction of the scheme as published by Siemens-Schuckert. This paragraph says: &ldquo;There is no more growing necessity in the world of to-day than this&mdash;to increase the production and manufactures of all nations under circumstances which promote the prosperity and contentment of the individual.&rdquo; This is the introductory note in Siemens-Schuckert's report on the Shannon scheme, and we based our claim on the introduction of the report. Senator O'Farrell dealt at length with the position from the labour standpoint and some of the Senators who followed him endeavoured to controvert, or rather evade, the arguments that he put forward. Senator the Earl of Mayo stated that navvies were entitled to be paid navvies' wages.  That is our point. This work would be navvies' work.  I am surprised at the ignorance of people who are talking about this Bill who say that this is not navvies' work. If there is one thing more than another that surprised me in the discussion about wages in this scheme it is the audacity and colossal ignorance of those people who have been comparing navvies' work with agricultural labourers' work.  I see that Senator Barrington is laughing at this.  He is a civil engineer and he knows that the work to be performed in this Shannon scheme is not to be compared to agricultural labourers' work.  This is a big engineering job in which numbers of navvies will be required.  One portion of this work will be cutting a canal about 100 feet wide and 30 feet deep. If the removal of the earth out of that canal is not navvies' work, I do not know what the work of a navvy is.  I will leave it to Senator Sir John Griffith, one of the finest engineers in this country, whether this is navvies' <Col N="57" /> work or not.  I worked on schemes not as big as this, but on schemes something like this.  I worked at a scheme like this at the other side of the water. I did not work as a navvy but at my trade.  Circumstances and the inability to get work at home drove me to work there, and the navvies employed there were paid as much as the skilled men.</P>
    <P>The men engaged on this work will be up beyond their middles in mud and slime from 8 o'clock in the morning until they leave off at night.  And they are to do that work on three slices of bread and a cup of tea.  That is what your civilisation is coming to.  We are told that the scheme cannot afford to give the unfortunate men anything better than three slices of bread and maybe margarine and a cup of tea.  I am speaking to you as one who went through it, and perhaps you would not be talking so much about economics if you had gone through it yourselves. There is no use in talking about economics to unfortunate men who have to go through this.  As I say, I went through it, and when you have gone through it I would like to see you come back and talk economics.  There is no use in talking economics to a man who is driven from his home here in Dublin or elsewhere to go to the Shannon scheme to earn bread for his wife and children.  That man goes down to Limerick.  He gives to that scheme his blood and sweat and he does not get sufficient to send home enough money to pay the rent of his little house.  Then you talk about Christianity and about the State.</P>
    <P>Senator Keane talks about opposition to the scheme.  If I am not making a mistake, Senator Keane threatened that the capitalists might lend their opposition to this scheme by withholding their capital.  I venture to say that there would be little thought about economics when there is a question of paying interest to the moneylenders and to the bloodsuckers, but when it comes to a question of the unfortunate man and his wife and children getting a little more bread and butter then the talk about economics starts and we hear a lot about the inability of the country to pay a decent wage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="58" /> The Minister told us that he had applications from 6,000 men looking for jobs on the Shannon scheme.  If that is so I say here that they have no right to fool other men by having placards in every Labour Exchange in the country inviting men to apply for these jobs.  That is only fooling the men if they have 6,000 applications already.  But I say that the fact that these placards are exhibited in these offices is the best proof that they have not got these 6,000 applications.</P>
    <P>With regard to this motion, the Senators here may vote it down. The Government may use every device that is in their power with the help of all those that are backing them to defeat this motion; but I venture to say that this scheme will never be finished at the wages which they offer. The class of workers they get now may be fit to scrape the top of the ground, but when it comes to the hard manual labour the Government will not get navvies in Ireland to work at 32/- a week and do the work required.</P>
    <P>If you want to ascertain the proper rate of wages that ought be paid on this scheme ask Deputy Good.  Ask him what amount of wages he thinks should be paid, and I will guarantee to you that he will tell you that he would expect that the wages of builders' labourers should be paid.  That is what we claim.  We have no quarrel with Siemens-Schuckert, but what we claim is that these labourers should be paid a living wage.</P>
    <P>Senator Bennett talked about economic conditions and the status of a living wage, and I interjected the remark to him &ldquo;had he read Rerum Novarum.&rdquo;  We accept the principles with regard to a living wage as laid down in Rerum Novarum.  Rerum Novarum is the Encyclical on labour that was issued by the greatest Churchman in our generation, the late Pope Leo XIII.  In that Encyclical he laid down what the conditions of life ought be for the meanest worker.</P>

      <P>Senator Sir John Keane spoke about the conditions of employment on the Shannon electrification scheme being better than the conditions in the case of the majority of agricultural labourers. I disagree with him.  I am not going to admit for a moment that this work is similar to the work of an agricultural labourer.  But I say that the position of the agricultural labourer is altogether different from the man who would be engaged on this job. Unfortunately in this particular locality where this work would be done there are not sufficient labourers to mind the huts that will be necessary on the job.  In a scattered area where there is very little of a population they will not get the labour for this scheme. Therefore, every man who goes there has to leave his home.  Now, there is no agricultural labourer with a little cottage at a small rent and half an acre of land who is going to leave that and swop it for a job at 32/- a week on the Shannon scheme.  The men who will go to work on this job are men who have been engaged on this particular class of work elsewhere.  Senator Dowdall spoke about Government policy, and I have no hesitation in declaring solemnly, as I declared before, that as soon as this Government came into office, and since, they have used any and every means to reduce the standard of wages of the workers in this country.  They attacked the wages of the workers, but they failed lamentably to deal with the profiteers.  They reduced the work of the labourers all over the country, but they allowed the profiteers to grow rich and fat on the poverty and misery of the unfortunate workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not sympathy we want; it is bread and butter.  We get too much sympathy and too little bread and butter.  Now, it is an extraordinary thing, if what I am informed is true, and that is, that the Minister and the Government who are persevering in connection with this have been told by a member of the Government Party, who is one of the largest employers of <Col N="60" /> Labour in the South of Ireland, that the wages they are offering in this scheme are not sufficient.  Now that member of the Government Party is as good a judge of a fair wage as people who never either laboured themselves or employed anybody else to labour.</P>

      <P>I do not think there is any necessity to mention the name. He is a member of the Government Party, and I think he is one of the largest employers in the South of Ireland. If this statement is not correct the Minister for Industry and Commerce can contradict it.  Certain Senators are taking umbrage at the suggestion made by the mover of this motion that the Labour Party are prepared to give every resistance, and to use every effort to prevent this scheme being carried out.  We make no apology for that.  We are going to use every means at our disposal in order that this scheme should not be carried through unless carried through under fair conditions. The Government's argument is that the fair wages clause applies to this contract, and the fair wages clause, as I understand it, reads something like this: &ldquo;That the contractor shall pay not less than the standard rate of wages paid for similar work in the district or locality in which the contract is, or if there is no similar work in that district then in the next district where wages are being paid.&rdquo;  It is most extraordinary that the only work comparable to the work done on the Shannon scheme, and that, as a matter of fact, is almost similar to the work they are engaged on at the moment, is the running of a railway from Limerick to Ardnacrusha, in the district near which the Great Southern Railways Company is completing a branch line.  They are paying their labourers 48/- a week.  If they want a rate of wages for similar work in the district they have got it there, but the Government will not admit that.  They supply the figures on which the wages were based, and they have responsibility for their own action. They supply figures on which Messrs. Siemens-Schuckert based their estimate.  It is their responsibility to get out of it, and they will not <Col N="61" /> get any help from us until they cough up and pay a decent rate of wages. Senator Dowdall referred to eight carpenters being unemployed.  He said there were eight trade unionists unemployed. I guarantee and am prepared to bet Senator Dowdall, although I am not a sportsman, that none of those eight trade unionists will go to work, although they are unemployed.</P>

      <P>They will not go on a blackleg job anyway.  One side of the story is all right until the other side is heard.  I have a good experience of trade unions because of little disputes I have been in.  In the many cases where I had to deal with employers I think, if they speak the truth, they will say that I was always reasonable when dealing with them.  Senator Dowdall did not tell us that when this man went into Ford's to a sheltered occupation he probably did not pay his subscriptions to the trade union.  When he got out of the sheltered occupation he could not be taken into the trade union until he had paid what he owed. It is begging the question to be dealing with these little items and bringing them into a big question like this.  We were anxious to give our whole-hearted support to this scheme.  We were prepared to ask the workers of the country to give of their best to carry it through. From my experience in dealing with employees for the last thirty years I know that if you treat your workers generously they will respond to it.  Let the Government treat them generously on this scheme and they will respond. If a man is discontented his output will not be as good as if he were contented. It would pay the Government to meet the men in this scheme and give them fair conditions of employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In dealing with this question I felt very sorry.  I looked forward to this scheme being the commencement of the work that this nation could do to build up its resources and to endeavour to make the country a little more prosperous and happy for all its citizens, even the navvies, the men who wheel the barrows.  We are fighting for the <Col N="62" /> lowest man, and to the credit of the tradesmen and dockers of Limerick&mdash; their wages were not questioned, but it is our glory although the Minister may sneer at it&mdash;men who were well paid themselves and had no quarrel, they refused to work until their fellow-men were well treated.</P>

      <P>One of the objections the Labour Party have is that this is not agricultural labour and that therefore the labourers should be treated as navvies.  I wonder are the Labour Party aware of the fact that where agricultural labour exists here, namely, in the Corporation employment at Crooksling, that the agricultural labourers there are getting 30/- more than the agricultural labourers outside for ten hours a week less work? They cannot have it both ways.  If they have to pay here 30/- over the right standard wages people cannot complain.</P>

      <P>It is a pity, as Senator O'Farrell remarked in moving his motion, that the patient is not here when the medicine is being administered. We, unfortunately, have to administer the medicine in the absence of the patient.  Until this motion was introduced here one would imagine that some of the Senators who already addressed the House on this question never heard of any trouble on the Shannon scheme.  Senator the Earl of Mayo displayed a delightful ignorance of the conditions under which the workers have to live, and rather railed <Col N="63" /> at the Labour Party for introducing such a matter into this House.  I do not propose to deal very much longer with the Earl of Mayo and his attitude on the question, but at any rate he seemed to be unaware of the fact that the ordinary working man had a family to maintain.  Then we had Senator Bennett, who, judging by the way he spoke, seemed to be under the impression that we conferred a Ministerial position on him yesterday.  He seemed to be an apologist for the Government. &ldquo;The Government cannot afford it,&rdquo; and so on; it is always thus where the working class are concerned.  The Government cannot afford it, cannot pay, and so on.  Senator Keane rather disapproved of the action of the Labour Party in dealing with this matter in the way they are, and hinted that industrial action was the proper way to deal with it.  Senator Keane, if he carries his mind a little back, will remember that he organised the farmers in the County of Waterford to enforce starvation wages on the agricultural labourers of that district, and it was under his leadership that the farmers and workmen were pauperised in that county.  So that from his point of view if he thinks over that enterprise he will realise that industrial action is not to the advantage always of employers and workers.  It has been pointed out that this scheme got the whole-hearted support of the Labour Party because they believed it was going to do good for the whole country, and the Minister here declared that the contractors are perfectly satisfied with the labourers and their output, and further said that everyone would be perfectly happy at the wages the contractors were prepared to offer.  Innocent young people that we were, when a Minister of the Government made a statement here, we unfortunately accepted it in good faith.  We learned a lesson in that matter, because apparently the contractor is the Government and not Siemens-Schuckert.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government lays down what the wages are to be.  It is being pointed out that the wages under the Shannon scheme should be comparable to the wages paid to agricultural labourers. <Col N="64" /> There is no analogy between the people employed on this scheme and ordinary agricultural labourers.  I know from a long experience that there is a kind of bond of sympathy which exists between the agricultural labourer and the farmer and his employee.  When a man is sick, a farmer does not dock his wages. When a man is in trouble, he comes to his aid either in food or money to help him over his trying period and to help his family.</P>
    <P>In addition the agricultural labourer has a house at a cheap rent and certain perquisites from his employer such as milk, fuel and potatoes.  The other unfortunate men have nothing.  From that point of view alone there is no analogy between the ordinary farm labourer and the man going to work on the Shannon scheme.  I give Senator Dowdall credit for being a comparatively good employer, but he has not told the Seanad that he believes 32/- is a living wage for any man, single or married.  Take the case of a married man who gets employment on this scheme, although there was to be no room for married men on it.  If you take an average family of six, consisting of a father, mother and four children, what does the wage amount to?  If you take three meals a day for each member of the family, that represents 18 meals, or 376 meals in a week.  What does that work out at? It works out at less than 3d. a meal per head.  Do you believe it is possible to produce a meal for a dog for 3d. not to mention a human being, leaving out anything for incidentals, and for such a luxury as a pint of porter or champagne? That is the reasonable standard of living that Senator Bennett would commit the Irish worker to.  Is it the standard of living the Seanad believes the working man should be committed to?  Are you going to do away with the sacred bonds of marriage and bring only single men to work on the Shannon scheme?  No married man could possibly work on the Shannon scheme at the wages and live.  Even the Ministers and even the contractors are not as callous as some of the Senators who have spoken here.  According to the newspapers an increase has been <Col N="65" /> given on the miserable wage that was offered.  Some of the Senators who have spoken said the wages should be 32/- and no more, and if the men do not take it let them go on tramp. Senator Bennett said he approved of a man stealing if he was hungry, but he does not believe a man should be fed when he is working.  The wages provided on the Shannon scheme do not permit a man being fed.</P>
    <P>The Germans who came here to supervise the job have already had a strike.  No one condemned the Germans for going on strike against the conditions that obtain on the job.  That was kept under the surface, but the labour adviser was very quickly on the job.  The grievances of the German invaders were very quickly attended to and remedied.  The money for the scheme has to be found.  We gave this scheme our whole-hearted support in this and in the other House.  Senator Sir John Keane, who unfortunately has just left the House, told the Minister and the Government that if it was handed over to the Germans to carry out it was quite possible the finances would not be forthcoming.  It is just possible the Senator is organising opposition to the financing of the scheme.  At any rate we, in the Irish Labour movement, will resist the scheme with all the force we can command, and will resist the enforcement of coolie conditions on Irish workers.</P>

      <P>On reading over the motion, I am sorry that Senator O'Farrell has brought it before the Seanad unless the Labour Party desired to call attention to the wages of 32/- a week. To ask the Seanad to say that the general interests of the State and the success of the undertaking are to be dependent on whether the wages are to be 32/- a week or not is rather more than it should be asked to say.  The Seanad is not a proper jury to decide whether labour should be paid 32/-, 42/- or 50/-.  I am a great believer in organised labour.  I do not believe we could manage our concerns if labour were not organised, and unless we could deal with leaders instead of having to deal with a crowd.  Labour can fight those concerned as well in Limerick as in any other place, so that I <Col N="66" /> think it is hardly fair to expect a declaration upon such a scheme here.  I doubt if such would be in the interests of Labour.  For instance, supposing the decision went against Labour on a vote, it might be taken as an indication that the Seanad considered 32/- quite sufficient.  The wage is not, I say again, a generous one, and not one that any of us would give if we could help it. However, I do not think the Seanad is a jury to say whether the State is or is not right in connection with the wages paid.  I doubt if any decision by the Seanad would do any good unless Senators would be satisfied in having attention drawn to the question.  I wonder is the Seanad ready to take the risk of having a wrong interpretation placed on such a decision?  There is a risk, and it may be quoted as much against Labour as it would be in favour of the Government.  I doubt if it is a wise thing for Senators belonging to the Labour Party to ask the Seanad to vote on this question.  I think Senator O'Farrell and the Labour Party were right in bringing the motion forward and ventilating it, but I doubt if they are wise in their own interests in having a vote on it.</P>

      <P>I want to make a few remarks dealing with what was said by Senator O'Farrell and other Senators.  At the beginning of the discussion I think Senator O'Farrell said that every form of occupation in the Shannon scheme should be considered an engineering occupation.  I thought that a fallacy, and a statement easy to rebut.  To take an instance, one could <Col N="67" /> hardly hold that those who sank the foundations at a place like Dunsink should be considered astronomers and should get astronomers' wages.  There are certain forms of unskilled labour outside navvies' labour.  It is not so much the fault of the Government that wages were restricted as the capacity of the country to pay them.  When I say that, I mean that in the long run every sheltered trade must press on the one that is unsheltered, that being agriculture. Eighty per cent. of these people hold less than 40 acres, and you cannot prevent farmers from sweating their children.  All agricultural labour is sweated labour.  There is nothing to prevent a farmer utilising the help of his family.  If the Labour Party were able to protect the children I would support them.  Who is this vote against?  It seems to me that the fight is really against the child of the farmer who toils in an unsheltered trade.</P>
      <P>I think there is also another fallacy. The Shannon scheme need not be considered as if it will go on for ever at 32/- a week.  I understand the Shannon scheme is to be concluded in three years.  The wages of 32/- were compared with those of people who come from the land.  The Civic Guard was mentioned.  The Civic Guard is a restricted service with special standards, and I think the same standard might justly be applied to such work as there is on the Shannon scheme for three years.  That is to say, it need not necessarily be recruited from married men.  It is a fallacy to think that the wages offered any labourer are necessarily wages to support a family of four.  The Civic Guards are not recruited from married men with families of four.  It goes back to the one fallacy that the Shannon scheme is to be the standard for continuous employment in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I tried last Sunday to see for myself the conditions under which these people live in the barracks on the Shannon.  I was unable to go, but I got some of the details of the conditions under which they live.  These are the food rations and on one side I will give the Army rations as compared with them.  In the Army the daily ration is: 16 ozs. of <Col N="68" /> bread, 2 ozs. of butter, 5/8 oz. of tea, 2¾ ozs. sugar and 14 ozs. potatoes and half a pound of meat.  As against that the daily ration issued to the men on the Shannon scheme is 22 ozs. of bread, 4 ozs. of butter, 40 ozs. of potatoes, and the same amount of meat as in the Army.  These are the conditions under which they live.  There is a heated room, a bed with three blankets and two sheets and a mattress that is supposed to be proof against parasitic insects. It is quite easy for anyone to make great game of labour, organised or unorganised.  Really, the facts of the case must be considered.  I would not have spoken on this subject had I not been confronted with a threat that forces which were unconstitutional were to be employed.  I think that is a monstrous thing, that Labour has formed itself into an exotic colony in this country which refuses to owe allegiance to the country.  They have imported patriots from abroad who use the argument of patriotism.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. GOGARTY</NameTxt>
      <P>Perfectly so, but the sufferings which it entailed were not confined to one class.  As far as I see the opposition and the threat of unconstitutional force comes from a party which calls itself a Labour Party and does not limit its membership to citizens in this country necessarily.  I am not out against Labour.  I consider myself, whether I would be entitled to become a member of the Labour Party or not, a worker.  I do not wish to keep the House any longer, but I do want to clear up that matter in regard to the food rations.  As regards the wages paid, the Shannon is not the only work in Ireland where wages of 32/- a week are paid and accepted. I have heard that on the Owenmore river a wage of 30/- a week was accepted without any protest.</P>

      <P>When we hear allegations as to starvation wages, I must remind the House that there are certain large forces engaged in winning sustenance from the earth who do not get any wages at all.  These are the farmers and the farmers' children. I would willingly consent to give these labourers employed on the Shannon scheme 50/- a week, or even £5, if I were not afraid that Senator Farren would condemn this as slave-driving and that this was given to make other people work at a less figure.  If one is to consider 10d. an hour paid to some of these men&mdash;in order to stimulate others who get 8d. to work more&mdash;as a bribe, then the logical conclusion is that every effort made to increase wages in cases in which it is merited is a bribe.  I think that is fair.</P>

      <P>I must not be regarded as insisting that the limits of the wages should be 32/-.

      <P>Senators will remember that at the passing of the Bill inaugurating the Shannon scheme a certain section in this House were anxious that the details of that scheme should be inquired into and examined, including the wages proposed to be paid to the workers.  On that occasion members of the Labour Party refused to consent to any such investigation and helped the Minister to pass this measure in a very hasty manner.  I have heard it now stated that in similar circumstances, the Labour members would act in the same way and pay no regard whatever to the question of wages that should be paid to the workers in that undertaking.  I hold in any undertaking in this country, <Col N="70" /> whether it is carried out by a Government or by a private individual, the time to settle the wages question is before the works are started and not when the works are partly under way. If it is found that the Labour Party will take the opportunity of urging on Governments or private individuals to start industries and keep the matter of wages, and strikes for increase of wages, until the works are partly commenced, that will have the effect of preventing any men with money from investing their money on any new industry in this country.</P>
      <P>I am not going into the question of whether this 32/- per week is sufficient or not.  I have a return here from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce giving the wages paid in the different counties to agricultural labourers and in the different drainage works throughout the country.  There may be circumstances in those cases that would have the effect of increasing the very low wages.  I have before me a statement of the wages paid to the agricultural labourer in the County Dublin, which were fixed by agreement.  The wages in the outer portion of the county, outside the 10-mile limit, are 34/6 a week without any perquisites whatever.  That agreement is signed by the representatives of the farmers and of the Labour Party.</P>

      <P>It has been stated that in the County of Waterford the action of the party led by Senator Sir John Keane was responsible for the great poverty that now exists in the county amongst farmers and labourers. What are the facts as regards the position in that county?  I am very glad to say that peace exists at present there, notwithstanding the fact that the Transport Union spent £43,000 in subsidising an attack on the farmers of that county, in putting forward not alone a claim for excessive wages but a claim for their land.  In addition to the £43,000 spent, which would relieve a good deal of the unemployment now existing, the houses and the property of 150 of these farmers were burned out, costing another £20,000.  I submit that all this money was spent foolishly.  If that were available now it would help greatly in relieving unemployment.  I might say that it was the action of the farmers of the County Waterford which has saved the situation as regards every man being entitled to work his own farm in the way he thought best.</P>

      <P>The debate now stands adjourned.  I am just reminded that the same difficulty, if we do not meet on Monday to dispose of <Col N="72" /> this business, will arise on Tuesday, because the Minister will be engaged very actively on Tuesday in another place, and probably up to very late on Tuesday, so that it is extremely likely that if we did not meet on Monday we would not be able to accomplish what we had in mind.  It is the privilege of Senator O'Farrell to wind up this debate, therefore I think it is better to revert to our original idea and meet on Monday.  It may involve a holiday on Tuesday, but I think it is better to meet on Monday at 3 o'clock.</P>
      <P>There is another matter to which I wish to refer, and that is as to the more economic and efficient distribution of our time.  For the last three years a good deal of emergency legislation has been put through.  We never knew exactly when we would be wanted to meet or how long we would be occupied when we did meet.  We were constantly being asked, and did so with a considerable amount of grumbling, to push through important Bills without really adequate time for their consideration, with the result that our meetings were rather spasmodic and the public got the impression, I think, that we were not giving the consideration to Bills that a House like this was intended to give to them.  Speaking for myself, I do think that the Seanad would perform its functions with greater advantage to the State if we could arrange our business, as it were, so as to ensure even for the so-called formal measures adequate and full discussion.  I think that could best be accomplished, now that these emergency measures are out of the way, if we could arrange, I do not mean sessions, but say, fortnightly, or even weekly sittings at a time so as to prevent inconvenience to Senators&mdash;the summoning of them from all parts of the Free State with, perhaps, only a couple of hours' work for them, and then having to go back to their homes next day, to return again in the following week.  If we could, in the future, so arrange our business as to provide for a week or a fortnight's continuous work at a time, I think it might be found to be a very great improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Allow me to suggest one other thing, <Col N="73" /> which perhaps may be found to be of some help to our new Senators.  Every Bill that is introduced into the Dáil, the moment it is read a second time and printed, every Senator gets a copy of it.  If this same Bill is altered in Committee to any material extent, there is a reprint of it, and every Senator gets a copy of that also.  When Senators get copies of these Bills, if they are interested in them, and if at the same time they would follow the discussion that takes place in the other House on them, they would find their minds supplied with abundant information on the material points in them before they reach this House.  Therefore, when the Bills reach this House Senators would know something about them beforehand.  They would have a grasp of all the material points in them and would be in a position to discuss them fully when they reach this <Col N="74" /> House.  I am only throwing that out as a suggestion because it is often said here by Senators, when Bills come up, that they have been sprung upon them, that they know nothing about them as the Stage reached was only a Second Reading one.  As a matter of fact, every one of these Bills will have been in Senators' hands for days or perhaps weeks before they reach this House for Second Reading.  Senators can also have the benefit of reading the debates on the same Bills in the Dáil, because these debates are supplied to them within two days of their taking place. I am just throwing that out as a suggestion in the hope that it may help us later on, if we can, to arrange a more definite, economical and efficient distribution of our time.  The Seanad now stands adjourned until Monday, December 14th, at 3 o'clock.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 5.35 p.m.</P>
