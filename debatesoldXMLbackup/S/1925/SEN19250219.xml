    <P>23.&mdash;(1) If at any time after the appointed day the council of any county or urban district by resolution passed after such notice as is hereinafter mentioned declares any road which is not a public road, but over which a public right of way exists and which connects two public roads and is not less than eleven feet wide in the clear, to be a public road, such road shall for all purposes be a public road.</P>
    <P>(2)  Not less than one month before passing any such resolution as is mentioned in the foregoing sub-section, the council shall publish in at <Col N="762" /> least two newspapers circulating in their county or district notice of their intention to consider the passing of such resolution.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>That amendment will require a little alteration, in the matter of the words &ldquo;over which a public right of way exists.&rdquo; A public right of way may be a public right of way merely on foot, or it may also include a right of way for animals, and it may extend to a right of way for vehicles.  I presume the Minister means a public right of way, an unlimited one.  If so, you would have to insert after the word &ldquo;way&rdquo; in the fourth line of the amendment the words &ldquo;for foot passengers, animals, and vehicles.&rdquo;  Then the clause would be amended by insertion of the words after &ldquo;right of way&rdquo; the words &ldquo;for foot passengers, animals, and vehicles.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I beg to move:</P>
      <P>New section.  Before Section 27 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;27.&mdash;(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of Part II of the Development and Roads Improvement Act, 1909, and Section 3 of the Roads Act, 1920, the expenses of the improvement and maintenance of main roads shall be a first charge on the Road Fund, and the Road Fund shall be allocated by the Minister in each year to the councils of the several counties and county boroughs in proportion to the total expenditure of the said counties and county boroughs respectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  The sum received from the Road Fund by the council of each <Col N="763" /> county or county borough under the preceding sub-section shall be in recoupment of the sums expended by such bodies on the improvement or maintenance of main roads in the previous financial year.</P>
    <P>(3)  Nothing contained in this section shall affect the duty of the county council under Section 25 of this Act to raise and defray the expenses of maintaining and constructing main roads in the county out of the poor rate.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is, I submit, an important amendment, to secure that the assistance given from the Road Fund to the local authority should be more directly applied to the maintenance of main roads.  At present these grants out of the Road Fund are applied only to improvement or construction.  The local authority has to bear, out of the local rates, the entire cost of maintenance. I admit that the dividing line between maintenance and improvement is somewhat slender and obscure, and that these two divisions are somewhat arbitrary and do overlap.  But as things are now the Minister has power to prescribe definitely the purpose for which advances out of the Road Fund are made, and, in effect, no assistance is given to maintenance proper.  The result is that a heavy and increasing burden which is becoming far beyond the financial resources of the local authority, is being imposed in respect of these main roads.  Now, if this is to continue, the Government would be met with a very ugly situation.  I use these words deliberately.  The rural ratepayers are becoming increasingly restive in respect of the burdens of local rates, and the readiest direction for retrenchment is in respect of roads. Other services may follow later on. What is to happen to the Minister if he is faced with this situation which is not an imaginary one, that the majority of the representatives returned to the new councils may be pledged to a limited rate?  There is an active movement on foot to secure that&mdash;a pledge to secure a maximum rate, and that maximum rate could not meet all the present commitments.  It will be difficult, probably, to effect much retrenchment <Col N="764" /> on asylums.  It will be probably difficult also to effect without great hardship any substantial saving on the county homes.  It will also be somewhat awkward to make drastic cuts in salaries, but it will be quite feasible to make very big cuts in respect of roads, because, after all, the farmers do not want these beautiful, steam-rolled, tarred roads which the motorists require, and which the country requires also in the interests of tourist and other traffic.  If the local authority refuses to maintain these roads what is the Minister going to do?  Is he going to abolish them, and to send down paid Commissioners to administer these bodies and get a further rate struck which, in some cases, he will have to collect by very coercive measures?  That is a matter that can be avoided in very great measure by an amendment of this kind. Furthermore, the allocation of this road fund appears to be entirely in the hands of the Local Government Central Authority, and need not necessarily bear any relation to the expenditure in the county.  That again is inequitable and the object of the amendment is to secure that each county will receive a grant in aid proportionate to the amount it spends.  It may be urged that it will not be possible to ascertain the expenditure, or to disintegrate the expenditure on main roads from the expenditure on bye-roads.  That should no longer be impossible if the Minister carries into practical effect the new accounting methods to which he is pledged.  That system of modern accountancy would render it quite feasible to ascertain the expenditure on main roads apart from the others.  I therefore ask the Seanad to consider this amendment with sympathy.  It is most necessary in the face of growing uneasiness amongst the rural ratepayers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LINEHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to second the amendment.  I think it is very inequitable that any part of the cost of the maintenance of the roads is not defrayed by the taxes paid by the motorists and that the money paid in by them is devoted entirely to the improvement of the existing roads and the construction of new roads.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Sir John Keane made a statement with regard to the allocation of the Road Fund, in which he said that it was set apart for construction or improvement as apart from maintenance.  I do not think that is so.  I think that according to statute a certain percentage of the Road Fund is available for construction, and it is also quite possible for the Minister to devote a portion of the Road Fund to maintenance.  In addition, the money subscribed by county councils out of the local rates can be devoted to maintenance, and in that connection maintenance includes improvement, which would mean the construction or reconstruction of roads.  The total revenue of the Road Fund is at present only about one-third of the money expended out of the local rates in the maintenance and improvement of roads.</P>

      <P>When the Senator refers to expenditure on roads, does he mean roads on the whole or only main roads?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKenny" hpid="Mr. KENNY Mr. KENNY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to roads as a whole.  Road maintenance out of the local rates was, roughly, about £1,500,000 for a year, and the Road Fund revenue for the same period was about £500,000.  With regard to this amendment, I would ask the Senator to take into consideration the future progress of the country.  I think it is generally understood and conceded that in order to have progress in any country it is necessary to have the best transport facilities that can possibly be afforded.  That is the basis of progress in any country.  Whether it be tourist, commercial, pedestrian, vehicular or any other traffic, you must have good roads and not merely quagmires.  Other countries are meeting the situation as it arises, and I do not think that any country would put a serious embargo on motor traffic.  Certainly motorists, particularly tourists, will fight shy of any country that does not cater properly for motor traffic.  They are not going to bring a valuable car, costing probably £1,500, here to be wrecked perhaps on a bad road.  I think the first inquiry of an intending motor tourist would be as to the condition of the main roads of the country, so as to be sure <Col N="766" /> of being able to get with facility from one point of interest to another.  They are not much concerned with by-roads or district roads, but they certainly would make inquiry about and be concerned as to the main roads.  Senator Sir John Keane took a different view when he said, &ldquo;We do not want this tourist traffic.  We do not want these beautiful roads for motor traffic at all.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir JOHN KEANE Sir JOHN KEANE">
      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>What I said was that the rural ratepayers do not want these roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKenny" hpid="Mr. KENNY Mr. KENNY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>The rural ratepayer is the principal ratepayer in this country. He is a farmer and represents the principal interests of the country, and he contributes in bulk the greatest amount in taxation.  When you say &ldquo;We,&rdquo; if by that you mean the people who are paying this impost for the maintenance of the roads, then if you mean that, I think the farmer is as much interested in the progress of his country, leaving his patriotism aside, and is as much interested in the development of transport facilities, as the shopkeeper or any other person. In so far as that bears on the general progress or development of the country he cannot be unconcerned as to whether the country makes progress. If it progresses he will benefit directly or indirectly.  Progress would certainly be to his advantage, and if money is brought into this country by tourist traffic, by the development of horse-racing, or by development in any other direction, the farmers stand to gain.  They are the bedrock industry of this country, and should benefit by every progress it makes.  The farmers are the people who pay the most rates. The Seanad can take one of two views. They can go back to the primitive time, to the time before the motor, when the roads were sufficient for the class of traffic on them at the time. To-day many farmers have their motors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In time, with the development of the farming industry, most farmers will have their motors.  It is for the farmers to consider whether we should not devote ourselves now to the gradual improvement and development of our roads so that in time the farming <Col N="767" /> industry will progress, and when new industries are created the farmer of to-day who now has a horse and car will have a motor.  Is the farmer well advised to take up the position that is taken up for him by Senator Sir John Keane?  If we are to go back to the time prior to the motors the Senators will have to ask themselves how they are going to remain at that.  You will certainly fall behind.  I think it is the desire of every Irishman who has his country at heart that we should keep step, as far as our means will allow, with progress in other countries.  You cannot say, &ldquo;I will stop here, and I do not want to go ahead.&rdquo;  Transport and facilities for transport, cheap freights, economic methods of delivery are at the very base and root of all progress, and I cannot see that the Seanad will be wise in accepting this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NugentEverardBart" hpid="Sir NUGENT EVERARD Sir NUGENT EVERARD">
      <NameTxt>Sir NUGENT EVERARD</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly support this amendment, for the simple reason that it must be within the knowledge of everyone that the whole system of traffic on our country roads has been altered within the last few years.  I recollect not so many years ago, when any use of the road which might be considered abnormal, such as the carting by steam lorries of timber, was a sufficient ground for an action for damages by the county council, but now if we take an action for the improper use of the road by lorries conveying six or seven tons of goods regularly from the metropolis to provincial towns we should be at law all the time, and I am not quite sure we shall be able to establish our case for a claim for damages.  It is obvious that when rates for the upkeep of the road are placed upon the farmer it was never intended that the road should be used as the railways are used.  Very often now they are used instead of the railways.  I know of cases where goods are conveyed for long distances in lorries at a cheaper rate than by the railways.  It is hard on the farmers. He is overburdened by rates and taxes. Now you put this extra charge on him, for the public convenience, of keeping up a road which is, under the ordinary <Col N="768" /> form of construction, unable to bear the traffic, when you have a Road Fund which is available, I believe, for reconstructing the roads.  I am sure it would go a short way if we had to construct all our main roads which are used now for this heavy traffic.  Therefore I consider that where the Road Fund or any other newly created fund is applied for the purposes of construction it should be also equally applicable for the maintenance of roads as long as this traffic is permitted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDuffy" hpid="Mr. O'DUFFY Mr. O'DUFFY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'DUFFY</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to oppose this amendment for various reasons, the principal of which is that the amendment would prevent the improvement of our main roads.  If the county council were to be recouped the amount they would spend on the main roads for their upkeep, I believe the Road Fund would not, as it stands at present, be equal to providing for any improvement whatsoever, and I think everyone will admit that there is a considerable improvement necessary in the state of the roads in this country.  I believe instead of decreasing the amount spent on the roads, we should look forward to increasing it by many times its present amount.  I believe it will be necessary to do that if this country is going to develop along the lines that Senator Sir John Keane would like it, that is to say, from the agricultural standpoint.  I cannot agree with Senator Sir Nugent Everard.  He speaks as if the people using the roads were apart and distinct from the agricultural community.  I would like to remind him that it is in the interests of the agricultural community that those lorries are using the road. It is to serve their interests, to bring them nearer the market, to give them coal, artificial manures, seeds and other things required in the conduct of their business, and to bring those commodities in the cheapest and most expeditious fashion to their doors.  It saves them from having to go for the goods to a railway station miles away.  It saves them the delay of waiting perhaps for weeks and the expense of loading at the railway stations and carting home.  All that is obviated by having a lorry running from the merchant in Dublin to the farmer's door.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hold that if the agricultural industry <Col N="769" /> particularly in this country is to develop, we require an extension rather than a limitation, and if so we require far better roads than exist at the present in the country.  If the four or five hundred thousand pounds subscribed at present by the motoring community is to be flittered away in a few thousand to various county councils to relieve them of the obligation they have always had of maintaining the public highways in the country, I hold that it will not provide for any improvement, and, therefore, I will vote against this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacLYSAGHT</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt very much if the farmers benefit at all from the existence of lorries, and, if they do, they do not benefit to any appreciable extent compared to the huge impost the destruction of the roads by lorries causes.  It is true that lorries are used for collecting milk from creameries. That is done, however, on the side roads and we are dealing with the main roads.  These lorries do not deliver the stuff to us farmers.  They are used in most cases as an alternative to the railway and canal to deliver stuff to the traders.  That does not make a single penny difference to us.  It may make a little difference to the trader.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LOCAL GOVERNMENT and PUBLIC HEALTH (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather surprised at this amendment of Senator Sir John Keane. He has conjured up a terrible picture of what would happen if the ratepayers of the country got on their hind legs, banded themselves together in a desperate attempt to cut down rates, and, as a result, refused to spend any more money on the roads.  Certainly that is a terrible picture, but I do not think there is any great likelihood of it happening.  One of the great difficulties about the councils at present is that there is a very great tendency when these bodies come into office to cut down estimates very considerably. They do not show nearly the <Col N="770" /> same alacrity afterwards in trying to put the spirit of that conduct into force, as the very same councillors who are anxious to reduce the estimates are often the ones who bring the greatest pressure on me to increase salaries and pensions.  That is my general experience. I would be very pleased with the amendment if it did all that Senator Sir John Keane alleges it would do.  I do not see that it is going to make for economy at all.  I think it would work in the opposite direction.  Apparently the purport of the amendment is to allocate money out of the Road Fund in proportion to the amount expended by the various councils on main roads. That would mean that the most extravagant, and probably the most inefficient, and uneconomical, would be the county to get most out of the Road Fund, whereas a county council that was carrying on its administration economically and efficiently would be penalised.  The amendment would not help in any way to take the burden of road maintenance off the shoulders of rural ratepayers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Road Fund is, possibly, only the nucleus of a national fund which might eventually develop into a fund that could be utilised for the maintenance of main roads on a national basis. I have visions, possibly at some future date, of capitalising that fund, and being able to use it for the maintenance of roads as a national charge with perhaps additions from the Central Fund.  As Senator Kenny has pointed out, last year we expended one and a half millions on trunk roads.  Up to now we had no main roads, as main roads are understood under the present Bill.  A main road would be one declared as such by the Minister.  The nearest things corresponding to main roads under the present Bill are trunk roads, and it was on trunk roads that our grant was expended last year. About one and a half millions were expended on the construction of trunk roads, only a half a million of which came from the Road Fund.  Senator Sir John Keane says that this money should be expended on maintenance as well as construction.  His amendment restricts expenditure from the Road Fund <Col N="771" /> on maintenance.  Heretofore I had no power to expend this money except on the construction of roads but, under Section 37 of the present Bill, I have power to expend it on the maintenance of any road.  I think it is very necessary that my Ministry, on the advice of the Road Advisory Committee, should have power to expend this money as they consider most fit, and be left free, so as to make the best possible use of it in future developments.</P>
    <P>As I said, we are hampered at present with regard to the Fund.  That is the only reason why we cannot maintain roads on a national basis.  I have taken ample power under the Bill to maintain the roads on a national basis to-morrow morning if I had the money. The only source from which I see any possibility of getting the money is the Road Fund.  If we allow that Fund to develop and grow, I will have power to use it either by capitalising it, or in some other way, to maintain roads nationally.  If the Seanad accepts the amendment it means that there will be no possibility of dealing with the road problem on a national basis.  Every little county will spend its own money in its own way.  The most extravagant council will get most, and the county that carries out its duties efficiently will get least.  The amendment puts a premium on extravagance and waste, and for that reason I ask the Seanad not to accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir JOHN KEANE Sir JOHN KEANE">
      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very much struck by the total inability of any of the speakers to realise the fundamental fact, that is, the financial position of the farmers.  Senator Kenny referred to farmers as if they were national philanthropists, who were even prepared to go to the length of breaking themselves in the interests of that sentiment. Of course, that is totally different from the realities of life.  People have got to cut their coat according to their cloth.  Farmers cannot afford to pay these charges.  Estimates have been made of what farmers are earning. In the best years of the war they were getting nine to eleven per cent. on capital.  In the years 1921-22 they were getting 6 per cent., and last year 3.2 per cent.  Of course, the results are <Col N="772" /> all hidden by the fact that farmers employ in many cases unpaid labour, and apparently live at a very low standard.  Inquiry for three years following the slump showed that small farmers were living at a lower standard than labourers.</P>
      <P>The farmer has been asked to keep up the roads for the motorists, roads altogether beyond the requirements that his industry necessitates.  The Act of 1909 prohibits any expenditure out of the Road Fund for maintenance. Of course, if this amendment is passed it will mean an extension of the provisions of that Act to maintenance, but I would ask the Seanad to recognise that as bare justice.  Senator Duffy said that the effect of the amendment would be to prevent all improvement, but I fail to see that.  So far as 75 per cent. of the expenditure on main roads goes, that would be a first charge on the Road Fund, but if there is any surplus, and there is nothing to show that there will not be a surplus &mdash;even now, perhaps, there may be a small surplus, though we are in the dark about it, because the cost of the maintenance of the main roads is not known, it is only estimated&mdash;that surplus after meeting that first charge could go towards improvement.  If the Government desire to give a special grant, as they did the other day in providing £1,000,000, it could quite easily be provided by the Act of Appropriation, which gives that grant, that it should be spent on improvements or construction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir JOHN KEANE Sir JOHN KEANE">
      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not know that that was so.  I thought there was a limit of one-third in regard to new construction.  That would be for new roads and would be different altogether from the widening or improvement of existing roads.  Under the Act, it should be explained, power is given to maintain these newly constructed roads only.  So far as these are concerned, the Act gives the power of maintenance, <Col N="773" /> but I am afraid we cannot look forward to any very large measure of new construction in the near future.  The Minister is unduly apprehensive about what the farmers are going to do.  I am afraid he is not very sympathetic and that he does not understand the farmers' financial position. When people are up against a desperate situation, desperate remedies are required.  I hope he will try to meet the situation which I have outlined, but he has given no indication as to how he is going to handle it. My submission is that you cannot force a local authority to strike rates beyond its financial capacity, and that you cannot put soldiers in to collect rates over the people's heads under such circumstances.  The Minister suggests or portends that some day he may wish to capitalise the Road Fund.  I would remind him that there is nothing to prevent an amendment of any legislation that we are now passing.  No one pretends that enactments which we make to-day are going to last for all time.  If, as the situation develops, further action or different financial treatment is required it is only a matter of getting fresh legislation and of reviewing the matter in the light of the altered conditions.  I hope, therefore, that the Seanad, bearing all the facts in mind, and particularly the fundamental fact which is the financial position of the farmers to-day, will pass this amendment.</P>

      <P>I am in sympathy with the principle of this amendment, but there is one point which occurs to me in connection with it on which I would like to have some enlightenment.  As I understand it, it proposes to put on the Road Fund half the expense of the cost of the maintenance of the roads in this country If that is to be done, how long, I ask, will the Road Fund last?  I would like to know from Senator Sir John Keane, or the Minister, what the total expenditure for maintenance is likely to come to for any one year.  It seems to me that under this amendment we might be putting a burden on the Road Fund that it could not bear.</P>

      <P>I would like to point out, in connection with this amendment, that already there are statutory charges upon the Road Fund. Therefore, I think, if this amendment is passed, it will be necessary to make an alteration in it, and to substitute for the words &ldquo;shall be a first charge&rdquo; the words &ldquo;subject to existing statutory charges.&rdquo;  If the amendment were passed in its present form, the application of expenditure in the way suggested upon maintenance work, would be a first charge upon the Road Fund. My recollection is, that antecedent legislation has already created certain first charges on that fund.  One of them is the recoupment to each county council of the expenses it has incurred in collection.  That, I think, is made a first charge on the Road Fund by statute.  I may be wrong, but that is my recollection.  Then, again, I do not know where Senator the Earl of Kerry finds that one-half of the fund is to be appropriated to roads.  The suggestion, as I understand it, is that after existing statutory charges are defrayed, the balance is to be applied, so far as it will go, <i>pro tanto</i> in discharging the amount expended by each county.</P>

      <P>There was one point raised by the Minister about which I would like some enlightenment. He pointed out that, under Senator Sir John Keane's proposal, the money was to be allocated to county councils in proportion to the total expenditure incurred by each council.  What the Minister said struck me very forcibly.  It was that such a proposal would be a direct incentive to county councils to be particularly extravagant in their expenditure on the roads.  They would be extravagant in their expenditure on the roads for the purpose, as they would argue, of getting as much as they could out of the Road Fund.  I would like to know from Senator Sir John Keane what steps he proposes to guard against that happening.</P>

      <P>The answer to that is perfectly obvious.  It is that the balance that would be available for this purpose would be nothing like equal to the amount expended, and <Col N="775" /> therefore these public bodies would not expend huge sums in the hope of getting only a small portion of that recouped.</P>

      <P>Yes, but that will bear a small proportion to the total expenditure.  This is only a limited sum that will be available as a balance.  I am only pointing this out for the purpose of assisting the Seanad. I am not taking any part in this as regards the merits of the matter, because it does not concern me.  The position, as I understand it at present, is that this Road Fund is allocated in certain directions.  Portions of it are already allocated by Act of Parliament.  In the first place it consists of the motor duty which is collected by the county councils, and the first charge upon the Road Fund is to recoup the county councils for the expenses they have incurred in collecting these motor duties for the State.  When these moneys go into the Central Fund, the first charge on them is to recoup the county councils for the purpose which I have just indicated.  My impression is that there is a further charge placed upon the Road Fund by statute, and therefore, if I am right, all that would be available for the purpose of Senator Sir John Keane's amendment is the balance, and that balance will not be a very large sum.  Therefore, the amount to be received under this amendment by each county will only bear a very small proportion to the amount expended, be that sum small or big.</P>

      <P>I should like to know if the whole of the Road Fund is expended every year on construction or maintenance of roads, or whether there is any surplus accumulating year by year?  If there is no sum accumuiating, the amendment will be useless. Obviously it will be a question of getting more money, and the question will be as to who is to get it and where it is to come from.  The Oireachtas will eventually have to decide whether the <Col N="776" /> maintenance of the roads is to be almost exclusively, as now, a public charge, or whether the direct users, for commercial and other purposes, should not pay in proportion to the use they make of these roads.  A distinguished authority has estimated that the wear and tear of motor traffic on the roads is at the rate of threepence per ton-mile. In other words, a lorry carrying five tons of traffic, and weighing, itself, four tons&mdash;giving a total weight of nine tons&mdash;causes damage at the rate of 2s. 3d. per ton-mile every time it travels over a road.  So that, although these lorries are able to carry traffic actually at a lower rate than the railways or tramways, in reality they carry at a higher rate, if you charge to them the damage they do to the roads&mdash;damage made up by public funds.  A lorry will carry coal to Athy for about 1s. 6d. per ton-mile, but if you add 1s. 3d. per ton-mile to the damage done to the roads you will find that the total rate is very much higher than the railway charges.  So that this competition and the alleged blessing that it confers upon the community is not real blessing at all. It merely means distributing the cost over the community, instead of making the trader or the owner of the lorry pay the freight.</P>
      <P>This amendment is not going to increase the Road Fund, and consequently it is useless if the Road Fund is already expended at the discretion of the Ministry.  What the Minister has to do is to try and consider means by which the Road Fund will be increased by an increase of taxes on motors, either directly or indirectly, and make them pay in a higher degree than at present for the damage that they do to the public roads.</P>

      <P>With regard to the question put by Senator O'Farrell as to the expenditure out of the Road Fund under the Act of 1909, as I recollect it, there is a distinct provision that each year there is to be a published statement by an accounting officer of the receipts and expenditure for each year.  So that that information must be available in some White Paper somewhere.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister told us that the sum of one million was spent over and above the amount given by the Road Fund, so that the amount spent would be near one-and-a-half millions.  The Road Fund is only £300,000.  On the Committee Stage of this Bill I spoke on this subject and suggested something on the lines of Senator O'Farrell: that the Central Fund should be called upon to bear the charges because the money derived from the taxation of motors is utterly inadequate.  From what we heard in this debate I am more than strengthened in that opinion.  If one were to tax railway engines at a rate so that the tax would be able to maintain the railways it would be no more foolish than to expect the tax on motors to maintain the roads at present. We are discussing the future in terms of the past, but that future has not been widely enough imagined.  We are in a transition stage at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The railways, owing to the way they run, will suffer because in a little island like this one can get everywhere by the road and that is not so with regard to the railways.  The railways were not planned for connecting with the best harbours or for the benefit of the people.  They were strategic railways constructed for convenience, not cheapness. There is no railway to Black Sod Bay, for instance, or to the Shannon Estuary, but that is only an aside. The roads now have become the railways and people use much the same kind of engines on them.  These roads were made originally to carry foot passengers and cars and carts of not more than two tons weight.  The roads cannot maintain the traffic and the Road Fund is inadequate for their maintenance.  We are talking round and round in circles because this forces upon the Minister a difficulty which can only be surmounted by legislation and not by the Minister.  If we prove to him that the roads are inadequate something may be done, but we gain nothing by swopping responsibility between farmers and motorists and looking at them as two different sets of individuals.  I do not want to <Col N="778" /> repeat what I said, but it is impossible to expect the Road Fund to meet the difficulty.</P>
    <P>We will have to envisage the roads as railways and we will have to build them in such a way as to prevent the annual recurrence of taxes for their maintenance.  They will have to be built in a permanent manner and of something that will last for four or five years without becoming an annual drain and the only way to do that is to arrive at a recognition of the position.  I have tried to put the matter before the Seanad in the light that it appeals to me, but I am afraid I did so rather confusedly.  I am not very clear on the question, but the position is that the roads will have to take the place of the railways in the long run.  In England, those who invest in railways look to the day when the railways will carry nothing but mineral produce.  Guinness' can send their material from Dublin to Naas with two men to-day, to do the work that five hundred men would be required to do if it went by rail.  Soon the roads will replace the railways and the sooner they are put into a permanent position to face that strain the better.  That will not be done by a motion or an amendment of this House. To make the taxation of motors as users of the roads equitable would be to ruin the motor industry.  It would mean that motors would have to pay three pence a ton-mile and the railways would really be cheaper.  The reason of the apparent cheapness of motors at present is that motors have taken advantage of the free use of the roads.</P>

      <P>The Road Fund has been mentioned.  This is an echo of other debates that we have had. <Col N="779" /> There is a statutory obligation on the Government to publish the Road Fund accounts on the 31st January, but they have not appeared yet.  I would like to point out further that the Minister has very considerable powers in his own hands, and he has power to prescribe what is a main road.  I do not wish to suggest that he should be <Col N="780" /> niggardly, but if he considers the charge is likely to come too high he can naturally be somewhat restricted in his view as to what a main road is.  So that he has administratively, in his capacity as Minister, a very considerable lever by which he can curtail this expenditure.  I think that that is a very important point to remember.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>After paragraph (d), Section 25, sub-section (1), to insert a new paragraph (e) as follows: &ldquo;(e) such road expenses shall be separately levied as a road rate, and shall be shown separately in all demand notes.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of this amendment is that those whom the Minister criticises as being men anxious for economy, but more anxious for expenditure, should be made to prove by their acts that they have not made good.  Hitherto, it was not possible to levy a road rate separately, because you had the district rate and the main road rate combined. If this amendment were passed, it would be very easy to show on the demand note that so much would be expended for roads and so much on other services.  In that way the ratepayers would have a good opportunity of knowing what is spent, and it would be a great incentive to work economically. Hitherto, there has been an immense amount of adverse and destructive criticism of all local authorities and their works, but I suggest that this amendment would enable people to criticise correctly; they would be able to know exactly where their money goes, and they would be anxious as to the spending of it.  At present it is a kind of hotch-potch, mixed up with the poor rate, and there is not the same desire or incentive on the part of the local authority to make good.  You have just heard a very lengthy debate on the sad condition of the man who keeps the road, because, after all, the main burden is on the farmer.  There is no doubt about it&mdash;everybody discussing the previous amendment agreed &mdash;that the farmer was sick and needed treatment.  Doctors differ greatly as to what the treatment shall be, and there is great danger that the poor unfortunate patient will die before he can even squeal.  He is squealing, and will have to squeal a long time, but I think if such an amendment as this were passed, it would make for economy and efficiency, and better than all, make people who, during the greater part of the year are apathetic, take an interest in these matters.  I think such an amendment as this would give them a <Col N="781" /> direct interest in local management and local affairs, and in that way do untold good.</P>

      <P>I second the amendment, and I should like to say that while it is desirable that this duty should be specially embodied in the Bill I imagine that the Minister has power, by order, to regulate what would be printed on the demand note, and I hope that he will go a good deal further.  In some of the British municipalities a good deal of valuable information appears on the demand notes.  They divide the information into expenditure over which the local authority has control, and expenditure over which the local authority has not control.  That alone would be an exceedingly useful piece of information.  Then they further sub-divide into various headings. This whole matter is linked up with a proper system of accounting, and if there is a proper, scientific system of accounting, the main heads of account should appear on the demand notes, and give ready information to every ratepayer who wishes to look into the matter.</P>

One is under the Bridges Act, where more than one county is involved.  As far as I can see from this Bill, the effect of the passing of the Bill will be to narrow down the incidence of taxation.  You have big bridges like the Waterford Bridge, to which four or five counties contribute. I was satisfied that if this Bill had remained as it was&mdash;I may be wrong&mdash; that the charge would be narrowed down to one, or at most two counties; therefore, the two amendments that are in my name, one of them without my knowledge, have the object I have set out in the first portion of the amendment, No. 16.</P>

      <P>This is an amendment embodying the principle of the one I think that was introduced by Senator Sir John Keane on the Committee Stage. As his amendment was originally drafted, it was a little wide, as it might mean that too high a price might be demanded for materials, stone and gravel, and other materials taken out of quarries that were opened by the local authorities.  This would make it necessary to take into consideration the charge that the local authority was put to in getting at the materials.  I think in the circumstances that Senator Sir John Keane is willing to accept this amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the section as it stands at present the Minister has absolute power to change his mind as often as he likes during the duration of a direct labour scheme.  The object of this amendment aims to ensure that an existing scheme, which may have been approved of, shall be deemed to have been approved of, and shall continue in operation as long as the scheme was originally intended to continue, and the Minister should not be given power to discontinue that scheme.  In the planning out of the work on these particular roads the county council, or their engineers or surveyors, may have mapped out the work, whether it is to be done by direct or contract labour; they might have been working two or three seasons in advance, and they may have got their material and machinery ready, so that it would be a hardship if the Minister had power to say that the work shall go on for four or five months and end there.  The amendment aims at preventing the Minister or his advisers from interfering with these schemes, when it has been decided that <Col N="792" /> they shall be done under a certain system.</P>
    <P>It also cuts the other way.  If the county council has the power to do their work by contract, the Minister ought not to have the power to say to the county council, &ldquo;You must do it by direct labour.&rdquo;  When speaking on this matter on the Committee Stage, I think the Minister agreed that it would be fair that the county council ought to be given some control over the manner in which this work is done on the roads in their respective localities.  The councils' engineers ought to be the best judges as to whether the work should be done by direct labour or by contract. I do not think the Minister should have power to interfere with such arrangements.</P>

      <P>I cannot agree to accept this amendment.  A somewhat similar one was introduced in the Dáil. As Senator Bennett has pointed out, I have the power to extend as well as curtail.  If I am not allowed to curtail direct labour, I should not have the power to extend it.  Heretofore these direct labour schemes were on a stereotyped basis.  An order had to be signed stating specifically the amount of wages paid, the amount of work done under this scheme, and it could not be varied for three years.  It was a cumbersome <Col N="793" /> form; in fact, these direct labour schemes were originally drafted with the object of making it impossible for the councils to work them.  At present I am trying to put these schemes on the same basis as contracts.  The county councils are in a position to carry out their road work by contract or direct labour, according as they desire, and Senator Farren apparently wants me to put contract labour in a privileged position and to allow them to have their schemes in force for three years, whereas the ordinary contract would be in operation only for twelve months.  I think the proper thing would be to allow the county council to carry out whichever scheme is most economical and suitable, and, if not, to allow the council power to bring it to an end before the end of three years if necessary.</P>

      <P>The object of the amendment is to safeguard the position of pensionable officers who would lose their pensions owing to their years of service being broken through no fault of their own, as, for instance, by a committee of the county council going out of business, so it might besaid, for some reason, such as not recognising the central authority.  These cases have occurred, and when the Technical Committees disappeared their employees automatically lost their employment. There are a few cases where these people have the full service with this small break in it.  I know of one particular case where a man worked for a Committee in Co. Longford for 10 years, and when that Committee went out of business, for the reason I have stated, he immediately went to the Kildare Committee, where he has been working since.  He has thirteen years' service, and yet, because of that small break, he would be debarred from a pension.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In Section 36 there is a definition of <Col N="796" /> a pensionable officer.  There are some conditions and exceptions to that, one of which is contained in Clause II. (Roman figures).  The object of my amendment is to delete that section.  In reading it I wondered why an exception should be made for a solicitor in this particular case.  I was unable to find any reason for this.  Solicitors are not persons that one has an extraordinary pity for.  As old people they are not to be much pitied, for they can work at their profession.  A solicitor is in rather a favourable position.  He does the work of the Local Government in his own office as a rule.  He may have to come out of it, but he has to come out of it also for the business of some private persons.  He gets a complete monopoly of the work of the Local Government which gives him a particular advantage, and he has a status as a solicitor of the county council which brings grist into his mill.  Numbers of people employ him because of that status.  Why he should be given a pension by the local body when anyone else who employs him does not give him one is something which I cannot explain.  Engineers are not given this pension.  They were ruled out the other day.  Those pensions should be limited as far as possible to people who spend their lives working for the local body and who are worn out at that work.  A solicitor can go on working much longer than any other person.  A labourer must go out on the road and get wet and when he gets old he cannot go on.  A solicitor can go on to the last moment of his life.</P>

No one can look after himself as well as a solicitor.  The only reason I can find why this clause is put in is that solicitors belong to a profession and are exceedingly well up in everything.  This must have slipped in, <Col N="797" /> and I do not think anybody noticed it until it fell under my eye.</P>

      <P>I second the amendment. It seems to me that not only are solicitors being well treated, but they are being treated more favourably than anyone else.  They had only to be appointed before the Act of 1919 to come in under the Bill.  I know solicitors who were very anxious to get appointments from local bodies because it brought them other emoluments. These men acquired vast businesses and made money, so that to pension them now is grossly unjust.  I can call to mind the case of a man who was solicitor to a local body and who is now a State solicitor.  I think such cases occurred in many parts of the country.  Is it contended that a man who was originally solicitor to a district council and who has now become a State solicitor is to receive a pension? I think that would not be fair. Solicitors, I think, were always well taken care of.  Senators who had experience of the old Local Government Board will remember that in my district the district council had advertised for a solicitor and gave what they considered was a commensurate salary for the work, £50 or £60.  The Local Government Board of that time, in its wisdom, said the council was wrong and would not sanction the appointment under £100 a year.  The district council reappointed the solicitor, but the Local Government Board was adamant, with the result that a man who was willing to give his services for £50 had to get £100.  When you had these gentlemen willing to take the appointments I do not think it is fair that they should be saddled on the community as pensionable officers.</P>

      <P>I wish to support the amendment.  Some solicitors get a fixed salary, and others are paid according to the work they do.  Solicitors to a local body have a preference of any legal work, and it is the experience that they are very anxious for such appointments. Such an appointment is a sort of tacit admission that they were selected specially for their merits as solicitors.  Where a solicitor is paid for the work he does, on what basis will <Col N="798" /> the pension be computed?  A pension could be based in a case where a man gets retaining fees, as in the case of the Waterford Corporation, where £150 is paid, as well as other perquisites.  The solicitor to Waterford County Council is only paid for what work he does. How would a pension be estimated there?  Solicitors to local bodies charge the last penny of the scale of fees laid down, but a local body can demand taxation of the costs when they send in their bill.  A certain percentage may be taken off on taxation.  That is the only safeguard there is.  We find that no reduction is made for a local authority, any more than for ordinary clients, from the scale of charges.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Colonel Moore's amendment for this reason, that when it was proposed to make school-attendance officers pensionable I opposed it on the grounds that when they took up the position it was not pensionable.  I think solicitors are in the same position.  When they were appointed the office was not pensionable. The Minister came to my aid on the last occasion and said that he was loath to place new pensions on the country.  I presume his assistance will be equally forthcoming now.</P>

In order to clear the air, I wish to say that I am not a solicitor and have not been in collusion with anyone about this particular section.  Really, I think there was some misunderstanding about it.  Under this Bill no new pensionable right is conferred on solicitors at all.  As a matter of fact, under the present Bill, solicitors will no longer be pensionable.  Under Section 8 of the Act of 1919 standing solicitors were specially picked out for pensionable <Col N="799" /> rights.  In many respects that was an unfortunate Act.  It has given us a great deal of trouble to administer. Standing solicitors who were appointed prior to 1919 acquired pensionable rights under that Act.  These officers have those rights, and it is a very wrong principle to interfere with existing rights or to take rights from people who have them under statute. No solicitor appointed since 1919 will have pensionable rights, but we have to protect the interests of those already appointed, which is the sole object of the section.</P>

      <P>I would like to have the position made clear.  Is it the case that if this amendment of Senator Colonel Moore's is passed all persons who, prior to the passing of this Act, held offices entitling them to pensions, will be deprived of these pensions?  Does it mean that previous agreements made by Act of Parliament, by which particular solicitors were appointed and were entitled to pensions, will be affected if this amendment is passed, or will this amendment have the effect of providing only that future solicitors shall not have pensions?  I take it, myself, that the Bill does definitely prevent any solicitor appointed in the future from being entitled to pension.  But is there danger that, if <Col N="801" /> we remove this, we will be singling out one class of persons who, however wrongly, under a previous Act, were entitled to pensions from getting a pension, and in that way will be repudiating that Act.  In other words, we would not be keeping the obligations of the State. I agree that it is foolishness to give pensions to solicitors, if the facts as stated here are correct; but I would hesitate to vote for an amendment which would amount to a repudiation of former obligations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BROWN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there must be some misapprehension about the legal position of a solicitor to a local body under the existing law.  It is quite true that, before the Act of 1919, a standing solicitor to a local body was not a pensionable officer, but under the Act of 1919 he became a pensionable officer, and if dismissed he would have the right to a pension.  Also, if he retired with the sanction of the Local Government Board, he would be entitled, if he reached a certain age or suffered from a certain set of infirmities, to a pension. These are the officers dealt with in this section, and if the amendment of Senator Colonel Moore is carried, you will deprive officers entitled to pensions under the Act of 1919 from being pensioned under this Act.  It is true that, if dismissed, they would have a right to their pensions under the 1919 Act, but this Act does not dismiss them, and therefore they ought to be entitled to pensions under this Act.  It is true, also, under a subsequent section of this Bill, that if you carry an amendment standing in my name later on, they will have a right to elect whether they will go for their pensions under the 1919 Act or under this Act.  In Section 8 of the 1919 Act you will find that a pensionable officer is there defined as including the standing solicitor to a local authority.</P>

      <P>Of course I know <Col N="803" /> that the profession will back up one another.  I presumed that from the beginning.  Regarding the 1919 Act, that Act was imposed by another Parliament. It was imposed for the purpose of inflicting an injury on local bodies, and of securing their own people.  At that time there was not a single representative of the Free State in the Imperial Parliament, which passed it, and I cannot say that I have any particular respect for that Act.  It was not passed with the sanction of anybody in the Free State.  In fact it was done contrary to the wishes of the people in this country and was simply an imposition.  It must be remembered too, that at the time it was passed we had a Parliament of our own sitting in this country.  There is another point I wish to make, and it is that I presume these pensions will be calculated in accordance with the amount of work done within the last three years. Everybody knows that the amount of work done by solicitors during the last three years has been very exceptional on account of the variety of happenings that were going on.  Therefore, their pensions now would be calculated on what they received during a very exceptional period, and they would get very high pensions.  It has been pointed out by Senator Mrs. Wyse-Power and by Senator Douglas that these people are brought into this Act quite unnecessarily, and that if this provision were <Col N="804" /> left out the people who come under the 1919 Act will not be deprived of their pensions at all.</P>

      <P>These officers are in exactly the same position as the solicitors. They have existing pensionable rights, and the object of this section is to see that these rights are preserved. Like the solicitors, they will suffer as a result of this Bill; they will not be pensionable in the future.  Heretofore compounders of medicine were pensionable because they came under the heading of medical officers.  In this Bill the definition has been changed from &ldquo;medical officer&rdquo; to &ldquo;registered medical practitioner,&rdquo; which rules out compounders, and the result is that they lose their rights.  Unless they are specifically safeguarded by this section, they will no longer have these rights. Neither will they have power to contract out of the Bill.  It would be just as great a hardship to deprive these people of their existing rights as, in my opinion, it was to deprive solicitors of their rights.</P>

      <P>I hope that the Seanad will not pass this amendment. The arguments that were advanced against the case of solicitors, irrelevant as they were, do not apply in this case, because I understand that these people are paid salaries&mdash;very miserable salaries&mdash;and have not the special fees such as solicitors have in big law cases. As a result of the fact that their salaries are small, their pensions must be proportionately small, and a man with, say, twenty years' service would get one-third of his salary, which would be an exceedingly miserable pension. They are in the same position as a doctor who has been appointed to a dispensary. He has his salary in that position but he has also his rights as a private practitioner, and it is not contested <Col N="807" /> that he should get some pension when he is deprived of his employment, or when he retires after long service. Apart from these facts, I think that it is a very dangerous and discreditable course to follow to deprive people of rights which they enjoy under existing legislation, and, above all, it is astonishing to find people here who advocate that kind of policy who would move heaven and earth if any rights conferred on them under the old regime, which we have honourably taken over and promised to observe, were proposed to be taken away.  If we attempted to take away the rights of landowners and big people of that kind, I wonder what kind of uproar there would be.</P>

      <P>Section 39, sub-section (2), to add at the end of the sub-section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  In this section the expression &lsquo;officer&rsquo; includes any person duly appointed standing solicitor of a local body before the passing of the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1919.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment might seem, on the face of it, to be consequential; I mean that it might seem that it ought to be rejected because Senator Colonel Moore's amendment has been carried. <Col N="808" /> That is not so.  Section 39 only applies to officers of more than ten years' standing.  The effect of Senator Colonel Moore's amendment has been to deprive all solicitors of local bodies, no matter what their length of service was, of the status of pensionable officers.  It has also deprived those solicitors of local bodies who have under ten years' service entirely of any rights they had under the Act of 1919. My amendment would still give the solicitor of a local body who has more than ten years' standing his rights under the Act of 1919.  What it does is to give an officer of more than ten years' standing the option of saying whether he will take the rights that he has under the Act of 1919 or the rights that are being given to him under this Bill.  You have deprived those solicitors of their rights who have less than ten years' standing, and we cannot go back on it.  But those who have been serving local bodies for more than ten years, if this amendment is adopted, will have the rights they were given under the Act of 1919, that is, they will be entitled to elect to retain the rights that were given to them by the Act of 1919.</P>

      <P>I think that before the House would pass this amendment it should be quite satisfied as to the method by which these pensions are assessed, because there may have been a very big law case during the previous three years on which this assessment takes place, and I think it would be monstrously unjust to assess a pension on that.  I do not know whether there are certain statutory rules and regulations for assessing pensions, but if there are not we ought to be enlightened, so that we may see that no undue burden is placed on the ratepayers by a method of calculation which is exceptional, and which does not appear to apply to other officers who are on fixed salaries.</P>

That would clear the minds of anybody who entertains the idea that people are taking opportunities, independent of their label&mdash;that what is called the old gang, has invited its friends to gather round and become pensionable on the new Government.  If we could know the length of service prior to the Act of 1919 we would be in a position to judge the title to a pension of any of these persons whose positions we are discussing.</P>

It is a most extraordinary thing, but we hear some Senators supporting solicitors, whose service to a public board is part-time, to enable them to get a pension, and at the same time opposing a man who gives thirty years' hard work in the service of the same people.  These Senators hold up their hands in horror at the thought of such a thing.  I do not believe in that.  I believe a man should be consistent, and that he should vote for pensions for every person who gives good service, and, further, that he should not be drawing a narrow line between a solicitor and a man who works in the streets.  We are perfectly consistent.  We believe that every man and woman who gives good and faithful service are entitled to superannuation in their old age.  The reason that we support this amendment is because we believe in that.  If we were vindictive we should oppose this amendment and say: &ldquo;We will not support it because you would not give a pension to our people.&rdquo;  We do not believe in doing that.  We believe it is right to support the amendment, although the people who are pleading in favour of it have not been as consistent as we have been in voting for these pensions.</P>

      <P>I think the time is opportune now distinctly to stipulate and lay down the lines on which these pensions are to be computed.  Senator Brown may have an idea of his own, but I think there is a want of definiteness about the whole thing.  I know solicitors of county councils have been earning abnormal fees in connection with the defence of claims for compensation, huge schemes for labourers' cottages and the acquiring of land and all that, within recent years, and if the average is to be computed on the last three years' earnings, or what might be considered their earnings, from the taxed cost of these solicitors' fees for the past three or four years, it would be an enormously heavy burden on the pension list.  It would be inequitable, and I ask Senator Brown to help the Seanad to deal with it.  The question of the computation of the pensions is a big one.  I would say that it would clear things up if the average were taken over the whole of the period of service rendered by the solicitor.  If you take a bad year with a good year you will get the assessment on an equitable basis, but certainly to consent to signing a blank cheque in this way is more than the Seanad should be asked to do.  I think the mover of the amendment ought to state what the liability will be in the matter of pounds, shillings and pence.</P>

      <P>In this case, also, I must vote against this amendment. It would upset the amendment already passed by the Seanad.  I am against pensions for short periods.  I think those Senators opposite who are fighting for pensions ought to agree with me as to what pensions are really for. Take the case of a man who goes into an office or any business whatever, spends his whole time working there, and gives to the public service so many years of his life that he is practically unable to work any more.  I think that man is worthy of a pension, but I do not think any man is worthy of a pension who goes into any employment, whether civil, private, or public, merely for a short period, for five or even ten years.  A man goes into an office for ten years.  He goes out at the age of 30 or 35, as the case may be, in the full vigour of youth.  I do not think pensions are meant for these people at all.  I think once you begin to grant pensions to people who have served a short period of five or ten years, you <Col N="812" /> begin to lay on the State an impossible burden, a burden which may be increased to almost any extent.  All sorts of employees would come under it who gave a short period of service or who left their employment after a few years.  Why should they get it?  Such a person does not get any pension out of a private office.  Nobody will give a pension to a person who served five years in his employment.  Why should you do it?  This State is becoming overburdened with pensions of all sorts. Millions of pounds are being lavished in these pensions.  The country is simply swamped and is crying out loudly against it.  I cannot see any reason for giving pensions to these people.  I think also this question of the amount of pensions these persons are to receive does not seem to have received any attention from the Minister.  If he worked out the sum that some of these people get from fees he would be staggered. I think that some of these solicitors have got quite enough already, and I must oppose this amendment.</P>

      <P>I also oppose the amendment.  I think there seems to be a difference of opinion as regards the basis on which these superannuation allowances should be levied.  In one case it would appear to be on the whole salary, and in another on certain profits. Apart from that altogether, I think it is a wrong principle that any person who has not given his whole time to the service of the State should be pensionable.  In these cases, these officers do not give their whole time. They give a very unimportant portion of their time to the service of the State, and for the portion they gave to the service of the State they have been sufficiently remunerated by the vast amount of work they derive from the populace.  For that reason I think it is a very unjust principle that a person who is not a whole-time servant should be entitled to a pension.  I think the amendment should be defeated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am fully in agreement with Senator Bennett's views as regards solicitors.  I do not think that the office should be made pensionable, and I have embodied that principle by not making it pensionable under the <Col N="813" /> present Bill.  But in this particular case it is not a question of saying whether solicitors should be pensionable or not.  It is a case of our finding they are pensionable already, and I think it is wrong to deprive these men of the rights which they have already. There have been several questions put as to how pensions for solicitors have been arrived at.  It is not easy to arrive at these figures.  If a solicitor sends in a bill of costs for work done during a period of ten years and that falls under one year, you would not allow that as one year's emoluments.  You will take into account that the work was spread over ten years.  All these factors are taken into account administratively. That is the great objection to putting down minimum pensions.  If you have a minimum pension scale, well, you are obliged in law to pay the officer his minimum pension, according to the sixtieth scale.  For that reason we are not having minimum pensions.  We allowed a very wide discretion in this matter and it is necessary that we should have it, and we take every precaution to see that no extravagant pensions are paid under this scale.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 40, sub-section (1), page 21, line 60.  To add at the end of the sub-section the words &ldquo;and unless the officer has failed to give continuously satisfactory service, not <Col N="815" /> less than an allowance calculated in accordance with the scale laid down in the Fifth Schedule to this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The schedule provides for a minimum pension calculated at the rate of one-sixtieth of the average of the last three years' salary.  The maximum pension cannot exceed two-thirds of the actual salary.  Now no matter what may be said against the undesirability of having minimum pensions fixed, I think it is a very necessary business arrangement that the local authorities should have some definite basis to go upon in calculating the pensions to be paid to any pensionable officer.  This is necessary. I think the position of having twenty different local authorities with as many different scales of pensions is not right.  In respect of the individual who is pensioned, I should say that we must remember that these pensions are looked upon as part of his salary. Every employer takes the question of pension into account when he is assessing the salary of the employee, and the salary is reduced accordingly.  Is it fair to leave the man from whose salary that deduction has been made without having the least idea as to how he stands in respect of pension?  One council may decide on one particular basis of assessing the pension, while their successors may decide upon an entirely different basis, with very inequitable and unjust results to the individual concerned.  The most that a man could get under this would be two-thirds of his salary, and he must have forty years' service in order to get that.  He must have thirty years' service in order to get one-half of the average of his last three years' salary as a pension.  The amendment is sufficiently wide, I think, to allow very great discretion to a local authority in assessing a pension, because it provides that unless an officer has failed to give continuously satisfactory service he shall get his pension, so that if there are circumstances which operate against the spirit of this amendment they can be taken full advantage of by the local authority, and, moreover, the pension has to be finally passed by the Minister before it becomes operative.  I think most of the members of local <Col N="816" /> authorities will welcome the establishment of a definite basis for pensions, because it would save them from the very undesirable attentions that are paid to them by people who are about going on pension with a view to getting a good pension as against a bad one.  I believe there are people with ten or fifteen years' service who had a pension of two-thirds of their salary assessed.  That cannot be done now except in a way the Minister will have to turn down.  It seems to me extraordinary that there are pensionable offices created, and no local authority has any knowledge of what basis the pension shall be calculated.  It is a most unbusinesslike and chaotic arrangement, and leads to all sorts of abuses.  The Minister said, I think, on the last day, that it was intended at some future date to bring in a Bill dealing with pensions.  I suggest that Bill cannot deal with those who are about to become redundant now as a result of the operations of this Bill, and in respect of people who are not redundant, their pensions will fall due in the next ten or fifteen years.  The new Bill will operate in their case independently of this amendment, because it can repeal all previous Acts, and consequently the Minister cannot be prejudiced in introducing it by accepting this amendment.</P>

      <P>I cannot agree to accept this amendment.  There are very grave objections to accepting the principle of minimum pensions.  In the discussion on the last amendment, questions arose which illustrate the difficulty of having a minimum pension.  In the case of solicitors, it is a very difficult thing to arrive at what their pension really should be, and there might be considerable differences in the point of view of various people as to what the pension should be.  It would be very difficult to decide how a court would rule in the matter, and the result would be that if we had a minimum pension scale fixed in practice we would be obliged to grant probably the maximum pension in order to protect ourselves against an action in court.  If we insert a minimum scale, the final <Col N="817" /> authority for deciding the scale of the pension would not be the Ministry but the court of justice, and in order to avoid the risk of costs and defeat in the court, we would be inclined to grant a more liberal scale; in fact, the maximum scale.  In practice we always adhere to the sixtieth scale, and add years for meritorious service.  That is the usual administrative system.</P>
      <P>If, as in the case of solicitors, which was dealt with before, their fees for the previous three years were exceptionally high owing to exceptional conditions, that would be taken into consideration in arriving at their pension, but if we are tied down by a minimum pension scale then it will be impossible to take such considerations into view, and in practice we will be obliged to grant maximum pensions where a much more moderate pension would be equitable. For that reason I ask the Seanad, in view of the difficulty the country is in at the present moment, not to agree to this.</P>

      <P>I do not know what the fate of the amendment will be, but I do seriously suggest that when the Minister opposes an amendment he should indulge in arguments which would appeal to an assembly with even the most elementary type of intelligence.  He proceeds to argue against this on the grounds of the difficulty of assessing a solicitor's pension when he knows that by the last amendment solicitors are deprived of pension. Why put up obstacles that do not exist?  He says that if you fix a minimum in order to protect yourself from legal action you will have to pay the maximum.  In every case of ten years' service you will have to pay a pension amounting to two-thirds of maximum. Unless the Seanad has other reasons I suggest that no argument has been used against the amendment.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Farrell has simplified the matter by saying the minimum scale is based on salary alone, but the Senator must bear in mind that we have to take emoluments and fees into consideration as well as salary. In theory it is easy to draw up a scale and say the minimum is so many 00000<Col N="818" /> sixtieths of the officer's service.  There are tremendous practical difficulties, and in order to safeguard ourselves we have to grant a much larger pension than we would in the ordinary course of events.

      <P>This is an amendment to delete the sub-section as it stands.  I think the officer who gets a pension ought to be very well satisfied to pay his ordinary debts to the shopkeeper.  A number of officers who may get pensions have expressed to me that they have no desire to be treated differently from the rest of the community in the payment of their debts.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>Before Section 54 to insert two new sections as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;54.&mdash;Before the election of county councillors next held after the passing of this Act, the Minister shall by order define each county electoral area and the number of councillors to be elected for each area, having regard to the number of local government electors in each area, and shall declare all the urban districts in each county to be one or more separate county electoral areas.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;55.&mdash;No member of a county council or board of health elected for an area forming or being wholly included in an urban sanitary district or districts shall act or vote in any case in which such council or board acts or votes in its capacity as rural sanitary authority, but he shall be entitled to vote and act at the election of a county medical officer of health for any county health district in the county.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard this as a very important amendment.  There is a provision in the Bill at present which enables electors in urban areas that are not liable for the rural sanitary rate to have a voice in the expenditure of that rate.  I <Col N="820" /> think that is a very wrong principle to adopt.  I think taxation should go with representation and these two amendments are put down to remedy a defect in the Bill.  The urban areas are excluded from the sanitary area of a county and the ratepayers of urban districts pay nothing towards the rural sanitary rate.  It is very wrong therefore that they should have any voice in the disposal of the money of the rural ratepayers.  Urban areas at present form a very large part of some counties.  In County Cork urban areas form one-eight of the entire population. The Bill gives such areas a right to have a voice in the selection of persons to administer the rural sanitary rate. The amendment I propose directs the Minister to define the electoral areas of the county.  I presume that, in any case, he will have to do that, as the number of councillors to be elected in the future differ considerably from the numbers elected in the past.  When making the division into electoral areas I have suggested that the Minister should keep the urban areas separate from the rural districts and allot to them county councillors who would have power to vote on every subject that came before the council or board of health, except when it is acting as the rural sanitary authority.</P>
    <P>There is a precedent for doing so, as, when the Public Health Act was being introduced in 1878 the powers of the rural sanitary authority were entrusted to boards of guardians, with the exception of members elected for urban areas who were to have no voice when the guardians were acting as the rural sanitary authority.  The amendments that I propose are on practically similar lines.  I can see no great difficulty in separating the urban areas and giving them their own county councillors. As a matter of fact, I think in the Dáil the Minister was told by those interested in urban areas that when amalgamating large rural districts there would be nobody from the urban districts to represent the poor of the town, and that the voice of the urban areas would be swamped by the rural districts.  In the matter of the relief of the poor, and of the rates that go to provide for the poor, it would be an <Col N="821" /> advantage for each urban area to have a county councillor in its own district. If the amendment is carried I believe there will be in most cases one councillor allotted to each urban area, and in some cases two councillors.  I hope the Seanad will not insist on the principle of giving persons who are not liable for a rate a voice in its disposal.</P>

      <P>I wish to support the amendment and I do so largely because I have received a considerable number of representations from the country that the principle is inequitable of giving urban districts a vote for expenditure towards which they do not contribute.  Of course that is a flagrant violation of the accepted principle of democratic government.  If I remember correctly taxation without representation lost us the States of America. Although this is a very microscopic example of the same principle, it holds. Another reason is that anyone who has experience of how these councils work, knows that there is very considerable difficulty in getting attendance.  The urban representative will be on the spot, and naturally, will be more inclined to give regular attendance. Added to that fact they are voting away money which they do not raise. That will be a very great injustice. There is no difficulty whatever in making the alteration.  There is a certain amount of administrative trouble, but there is no difficulty in separating the urban and the rural areas.  It is quite easy to do so, for the elections and the division will be effected if the amendment is carried.</P>

      <P>I am strongly opposed to the amendment.  It is, I think, a wrong principle to try and separate the rural from the urban districts in that particular way.  Undoubtedly it is true that there is some anomaly about having representatives from the urban areas deciding, as the sanitary authority of the county, what the rural areas are to do.  It may be also pointed out that it is not a good principle to have men from the southern end of a county health area deciding matters affecting the northern end.  All these little difficulties will arise in administration.  The <Col N="822" /> good results that will follow from this policy very much outweigh the evil consequences. In practice it would be impossible to put Senator Linehan's scheme into operation.  The idea of bulking all the urban districts into one electoral area and giving them representation as such would give rise to extraordinary anomalies.</P>
      <P>Take the position of Tirconaill.  Under this scheme you would have three townships there constituting an electoral area, and they would be only in a position to elect one member.  Would that one member represent Buncrana, Bundoran, or Letterkenny?  It would be impossible for him to be a good representative for the three townships.  If he came from Letterkenny, Buncrana or Bundoran, he would naturally look after the interests of the particular town he came from, to the neglect of the other two.  In the same way in County Longford, the quota for two townships, Longford and Granard, would be only two representatives. Those two representatives would be elected by the Longford township, which has more than a two-to-one majority over the electors of Granard. That would mean that the Granard people would be doubly unrepresented in the public health administration of the county.  A great number of anomalies of this kind would arise if we were to insist on this cleavage of urban and rural interests, and for that reason I would ask the Seanad to permit the present arrangement, which is the only practicable arrangement, to stand in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Amendment put and negatived.</P>

      <P>I do not know what the wishes of Senators may be with regard to the continuance of this discussion.  I think it is quite plain that we cannot dispose of this Bill tonight, but it is also obvious that we could dispose of it if we sit to-morrow. If we sit to-morrow, at what hour shall we meet?  When we sit on Friday, we usually meet at 11.30 a.m.  I may mention that the Minister for Finance is prepared to attend to-morrow and to <Col N="823" /> continue the discussion raised some weeks ago by Senator Sir John Keane on public accountancy.  That, I presume, would be at the conclusion of the Report Stage of this Bill.</P>
