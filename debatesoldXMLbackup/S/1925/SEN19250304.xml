      <P>Before this Bill passes, I should like to enter one final protest against the clauses of the Bill that deal with the maintenance of main roads.  Naturally, one does not expect anything to be done now.  Throughout the whole debate on this Bill I fear the Government has revealed the fact that they have no policy for dealing with this very difficult and, to the rural ratepayers, very anxious problem.  It is because one feels that the Government may be met with a very difficult issue in the near future that one laments this lack of policy.  The rural ratepayers cannot possibly afford to maintain the main roads up to the standard suitable for modern civilisation. I refer to their having to cater for modern motor traffic.  Some other fund must be created which will relieve the rural ratepayers of this burden. This Bill makes no provision for dealing with that question.  It is for that reason that I wish to enter my protest now and, at the same time, to ask the Government whether they will give some indication of the measures that they have in contemplation for dealing with this important problem.</P>

      <P>I quite agree with Senator Sir John Keane in his views with regard to this question of roads.  The road difficulty in this country has been an outstanding difficulty.  It is a question of very great importance, not only to <Col N="904" /> the rural communities but also to the country at large, and the sooner we do tackle this question the better for the country as a whole.  I have always held the view that there should be two categories of roads&mdash;national roads and district roads.  Judging by the experience of other countries, I do not think that any other method of dealing with the road question will ever be successful, except in one direction, and that is having the national and main roads kept up by a central authority and the district roads kept up by the counties.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Bill generally, I would like to say that I think it is a good Bill, and I think it is a step in the right direction.  We have had a system of local government enforced in this country since 1898.  That system was modelled on the English plan.  I do not think that it is suitable to the conditions of Ireland.  We are not a rich country like England, and we want an inexpensive method of local administration and of local government.  I think that this Bill, as far as it goes, is a step in the right direction, but I am not very sure that even with this Bill, and even with the reforms which it has made in connection with the operation of local administration, the burden on the ratepayers will not be found to be exceedingly heavy.  I am not at all sure that after some years' experience of this Bill a demand will not arise in this country for a still cheaper method of local administration.  I say that this Bill is a step in the right direction.  I have supported it all through, and I congratulate the Minister and his Department on the way in which they have engineered this very complicated Bill&mdash;a Bill which has raised many controversial points&mdash;through the Seanad.</P>

      <P>With regard to the roads, it seems that they are the great difficulty in this country at the present moment.  They are the greatest problem we have to face.  It seems to me that some means will have to be taken to make those who use and very often break-up the roads pay for the roads. At present they pay a very small sum. These big motor lorries which travel along the roads break them up, and the owners pay almost nothing for the upkeep of the roads.  The railroads are <Col N="905" /> kept up by the owners.  The tramways are maintained by the tramway owners, but the roads, which are used by these heavy lorries, are not kept up by the owners, but by the ratepayers.  These lorries use these roads in competition with railways, canals. and tramways. The only way I would consider fair would be that the owners of those lorries would pay whatever may be considered a proper tax on oil, or whatever means may be devised to make those who cut up the roads pay for them. Then the ratepayers will have a chance of keeping the roads.  There is no doubt about it, the local authorities cannot keep the roads at present.  These motor cars and lorries are running full-speed along the roads, and they cut them up. The canals would relieve the roads a great deal if they were kept up properly and given a fair chance.  But the canals are not kept up properly.  Many of these canals are choked with weeds, and there is scarcely any traffic on them.  These canals would, if properly maintained, carry a great deal of the traffic that is now taken along the roads in these lorries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasBennett" hpid="Mr. BENNETT Mr. BENNETT">

      <P>I wish in the first instance to say that I think the Bill, on the whole, is an admirable Bill and makes for efficiency of administration, and that it will lead to a great deal of good.  I wish to emphasise, after having said that, the necessity that exists for reform on the question of roads.  In the County of Limerick we have been making great efforts to improve the main arteries, and some of our roads were good roads up to quite recently. I know that within the last two or three months heavy lorries have absolutely cut up some of our roads so much that one can hardly travel over the roads at all now owing to the condition in which they are.  I know that the problem confronting the Government is a large one.  I do not think that any amount of expenditure short of reconstructing the roads would enable the average road in the country to bear the heavy traffic of these four or five ton lorries.  I think something will have to be done to get the capital sum necessary to make trunk roads of such a character that will carry this <Col N="906" /> traffic of four or five-ton lorries.  Meanwhile, I think the Government should consider the question of preventing the use of roads by these heavy lorries, and so keep off the roads a class of traffic for which they were never intended. That is altogether apart from the aspect of the inability of the farmer to pay for the upkeep of these roads, and the inability of the roads to carry the traffic which is undoubted.  The ordinary road work cannot be continued on the roads if this heavy traffic is allowed to go on.  I would ask the Minister to consider the question of diverting this heavy traffic from the ordinary roads of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>One has naturally to sympathise with the views expressed by the Senators who have spoken, while at the same time remembering the important fact that almost all those who have spoken helped to aggravate the problem of the roads by adding materially to the cost, which the amendment they carried intensifies. This amendment makes the cost of material very much greater in certain respects than heretofore.  That certainly is not a useful contribution towards solving this burning question of the roads.  One can easily see that this is a big national question which will have to be dealt with by the Government, and not by any county council. So far there has been no constructive proposal put forward for dealing with the roads.  I believe a Roads Advisory Committee is sitting.  It may be able to make recommendations that will solve this question, if the roads are not to become altogether impassable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is in some respects a better one leaving the Seanad than when it came here.  At least in one respect it has been made a little ridiculous by the introduction of a section which should never have gone into it, imposing the oath test for future clerks who enter the service of the local bodies.  It would certainly have been better without that.  There is another blot, a most important one, in the Bill, and that is giving the Minister power to close down the popularly elected assemblies after an investigation set up by himself, and <Col N="907" /> of which he is to be the sole judge and arbitrator, and as a consequence the dignity and responsibilities of these assemblies are very much taken from. Any assembly, whether great or small, that knows that the sword of the Destroying Angel is constantly hanging over it must lose in dignity and self-respect. In respect of local authorities generally the Minister is made a sort of national chief to go round and threaten to close down local authorities after very little investigation, and for that reason one can hardly hope to see the new councils of the future being the brilliant success that one would expect them to be, if they had a little more authority or had not the sword hanging over their heads.  In other respects the Bill has been improved.  I should have wished that the amendment dealing with competitive examinations had been accepted pending the introduction of the promised Bill.  It was the first serious attempt to mitigate the awful abuse of canvassing in respect of the filling of clerical appointments.  I hope that the promise of the Minister to introduce a comprehensive Bill dealing with appointments of all kinds by local authorities will not be unduly delayed, for the new appointments or re-appointments will have to take place after the next election through the dissolution of the rural district councils, and the setting up of the boards of health, and we would require to have in the immediate future the principle of competitive examinations ruling.  For that reason I hope the Minister will be able to realise his promise without undue delay, and that within the next few months he will introduce a Bill which will remedy the abuse which is notorious and which, I think, is inherently associated with appointments made by local authorities, and indeed by most assemblies whether they are elective or not.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LOCAL GOVERNMENT and PUBLIC HEALTH (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Senator O'Farrell's last point, I am very anxious, as I have already said, that effect should be given to the spirit of his amendment, but in <Col N="908" /> the meantime there is no great urgency about the matter, because there are Selection Boards set up dealing with practically every vacancy that occurs under local authorities throughout the country.  I do not anticipate that under the Bill there will be a great many new appointments.  All the present officers of rural district councils automatically become officers of the county council, and naturally any new appointments will have to be made from the existing staffs.  I was very favourably impressed by his amendment at the time it was introduced, but I think it is quite obvious that it would be a very risky matter to insert an amendment at such a late stage without giving the two Houses full opportunity of discussing and debating it.  Undoubtedly if we tried to put it into operation at present it would give rise to serious anomalies, and for that reason I think the Seanad was wise not to insert the amendment as it stood, and that Senator O'Farrell was wise in withdrawing it and allowing the matter to be dealt with in the orthodox way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a good deal of discussion about road policy.  I do not think that Senator Sir John Keane was quite fair in saying that my Department has no policy with regard to roads.  In the present Bill we have taken a very considerable step.  We have practically nationalised the main roads by giving the Central Government power to state what roads will be main roads, and also by giving the Minister power to maintain any road in the country if he so desires through the Central Government.  It leaves me in the position at present that if I had financial support I could have any road in the country maintained by contract, and I could have any of these big firms that are maintaining roads, according to the latest standards of efficiency in England, to come over here and construct between Cork and Dublin, a trunk road of concrete or asphalt, or any of the modern substances.  I have that power under the Bill.  The only difficulty is with regard to finance.  I do not think any proposal has been put forward in this House which could materially assist me in solving that <Col N="909" /> financial difficulty.  The financing of our road policy is, to a great extent, bound up with the duty on motor vehicles or motor fuel, and that whole question is being investigated by the Roads Advisory Committee.  I have no doubt that as a result of their investigations we will hit on some new principle for financing the roads, and excluding lorries over a certain weight from running on the roads.</P>
    <P>There is no problem I am more interested in than the road problem.  I believe at an early date we will be able to find some solution.  Another point to be considered is that experts are by no means agreed at present as to what is the best kind of road for a trunk road in this country.  Some say tar macadam, others a bituminous road, consisting of this new bitumin, and more concrete roads.  Before finally deciding on that I thought it well to carry out some experiments, and accordingly I am experimenting with four or five different kinds of roads in County Dublin.  After we have had some experience of seeing how these roads stand up to modern traffic, we will be in a better position to decide on a national policy with regard to trunk roads.  It is a matter with regard to which we should go slow, and not rush it, for it might be a costly matter for the country, and we do not want to take any steps that we will be sorry for later on.</P>

      <P>Before the Bill passes through its final stage, there is a verbal amendment to one section which would seem to be necessary.  It is in Section 33 in the last print of the Bill.  In sub-section (1) of that, the Minister is given power to make regulations prescribing &ldquo;the standard and quality&rdquo; of the materials which may be used on the roads.  If you go to sub-section (4), which defines the acts the Minister may not do, you will find there that he shall not use in the maintenance of a road any material of &ldquo;a nature or quality,&rdquo; etc.  That is the sub-section that needs amendment.  I beg to move that the word &ldquo;nature&rdquo; be deleted and the word &ldquo;standard&rdquo; be substituted therefor.  The sub-section <Col N="910" /> would then read &ldquo;any material of a standard or quality,&rdquo; &amp;c.</P>

      <P>I understand that this Bill is for the purpose of amalgamating the Civic Guard and the Dublin Metropolitan Police.  No doubt, in the interests of efficiency and possibly of economy, a measure of this sort may be commended.  I do not propose to go into that question now.  At the same time may I, for sentimental reasons, express the regret that I feel personally at the passing of the Dublin Metropolitan Police.  The Dublin Metropolitan Police, whatever their successors may be, were physically the finest body of police in the world.  As we all know, they were famous for generations in tug-of-war contests.  They defeated almost every team that came before them.  Many of us are under personal <Col N="911" /> obligations to the old Dublin Metropolitan Police.  They were a very kindly and a very humane body of men. I do not know whether their successors will follow them in these respects or not, but I think I may say that the old Dublin Metropolitan Police were really a very popular body.  About the first tune that I ever remember hearing was that with the refrain, &ldquo;Are you there Moriarty?&rdquo; My old nurse used to sing that for my edification.  The Dublin Metropolitan Police came down to us through many years and had a very interesting history.  I think it is only right that someone should say a word to express regret at the passing of this old force.  It was really a national institution. It was also an admirable institution, and a very kindly and humane one, too.  I can only hope that the traditions of humanity and kindliness which were synonymous with the name of the old Dublin Metropolitan Police will be carried on by the new Force, and that if they cannot be improved upon they will at least be perpetuated by their successors.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. FARREN Mr. FARREN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FARREN</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I desire to say that, personally, I am not particular about the passing of the D.M.P.  Some people probably will miss them, notably those who used to read &ldquo;Studies in Blue&rdquo; yarns about Mrs. Casey and things of that kind. The amalgamation of the two forces will, I think, lead to greater efficiency. I desire to say, however, that in my opinion a grave injustice has been done to the citizens of Dublin under this Bill.  The citizens of Dublin have had to pay, and are still paying, the enormous sum of 8d. in the £ on the poor law valuation for the upkeep of the D.M.P.  It is now proposed to amalgamate the D.M.P. with the Civic Guard, so that we will have but one police force in the country.  The ratepayers in no part of Ireland, except in Dublin city, have had to pay a special rate for the upkeep of the police force. Therefore, I do not think it is fair that the citizens of Dublin should continue to be saddled with this additional burden of 8d. in the £.  No doubt, this special tax is to be diminished, and at the end of eight years it is to be wiped <Col N="912" /> out altogether.  That is the proposal under the Bill.  I put it to the Minister and to the Seanad, that the ratepayers of Dublin have already paid more than their fair share of the special burden, and that they should be relieved of it at once.  During the last nine or ten years they have had to shoulder very heavy burdens indeed, and hence I think that this rate of 8d. in the £ for the police force should be abolished at once.  Why, I ask, should the ratepayers of the City of Dublin be saddled with this burden when the ratepayers in no other part of the Saorstát are called upon to pay such a tax?  In Cork, Limerick, Waterford, or in any of the other Irish cities, or, indeed, in no part of the Saorstát, except in Dublin, have the people to pay a special tax for the upkeep of the police force.  The entire cost of the police force all over the country is defrayed out of the National Exchequer. That, I suggest, is most unfair to the citizens of Dublin, who have to contribute their quota to keep up a police force in every part of the Saorstát, and, in addition, are called upon to pay the special rate of 8d. in the £ for the upkeep of the D.M.P.  I do not think that you would find in any other city in the world a better spirit of citizenship than here in this City.  That spirit of citizenship is reflected in the prompt way in which the rates of the city are paid.  If a person has an enthusiasm about anything it is usually manifested in £ s. d., and on that score the citizens of Dublin have a splendid record.  The payment of the rates during the whole period of the troubles that we had here was really remarkable.  The payment represented 98 per cent. of the entire collection, and I think that can be claimed as a wonderful record.  Therefore I do not think that this imposition on the citizens of Dublin of a special rate of 8d. in the £ for the upkeep of the police in the city should be continued, and I think that the Minister should have this burden at once removed from the shoulders of the citizens.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeNesbitt" hpid="Mr. NESBITT Mr. NESBITT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. NESBITT</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully agree with the remarks made by the last Senator.  One of the arguments used in days gone by against the imposition of this special <Col N="913" /> rate of 8d. in the £ for the upkeep of the police in the city was that the Corporation of Dublin had nothing to do with the government or with the control of the police force in the city.  The Corporation was not in the same position as Corporations in Manchester and other English cities where the city police forces are under the control of these bodies.  The police in this city were a Government institution.  I agree with Senator Farren that the citizens of Dublin should not be treated in a different manner to the citizens of Cork or Limerick, who have not to pay a special rate of this kind, and hence I think the citizens of Dublin should be relieved of this special charge of 8d. in the £ for the police.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister speaks I would like to ask a question with regard to the third schedule. I wonder would the Minister indicate how the numbers of the Force to-day compare with the previous strength of the Force and also what the present strength of the Dublin Metropolitan Police Force is compared with its strength before the Treaty.  We are all anxious to reduce this Force to the minimum which public safety and public order will admit.  But it is a notorious fact that hundreds of petty burglaries have been going on on the outskirts of the city for months past and so far as one can see not one in a hundred has been detected.  In the district in which I live, I heard of a couple of score of burglaries and robberies which were committed night after night in houses within a short distance of each other, and I never heard of a conviction taking place.  The policeman is as rare in the district apparently as the white blackbird.  A district itself may be quite law-abiding but that does not follow that it will not have nocturnal visitors of a very different character.  A couple of months ago a gentleman coming home about one in the morning, whether from a dance in the Kildare Street Club or from an election meeting&mdash;I know not&mdash;lectured the whole avenue for at least an hour.  He would have proved a splendid speaker, especially at those interrupted meetings of which we read so much <Col N="914" /> nowadays.  He spoke for fully an hour for two nights in succession, and very much to the discomfort and disedification of the inhabitants; he spoke quite effectively, but not one of the familiar slow and heavy-footed night steps that we associate with policemen was heard. It is an old tradition of the police that they generally turn up when the trouble is over.  In these instances they did not turn up at all, and I was in great trepidation, because the gentleman announced his intention of repeating the performance every night until the Government was out of office.  He evidently changed his mind.</P>
      <P>I was speaking to a station sergeant of the D.M.P. some time ago about the general condition of the Force.  He complained that the quality of the new recruits was not at all up to the mark, that they fell very much below the original standard, and that it was difficult to find men of the old type such as was found in the old D.M.P.  Amalgamation may make for economy.  I do not know whether the physical standard will be altered.  I take it if it were it would mean a saving in boot leather.  One result of the amalgamation should be economy.  Whether it is to be economy at the expense of efficiency or not is a matter that vitally concerns the people of Dublin, because I think the policemen in Dublin want to be of a particular type owing to the particular nature of the duties they are required to perform, such as regulating the traffic, and night duties amongst the people, who are knocking about at all hours.  There is genuine complaint as to the patrolling of the outskirts of the city in the early hours of the morning, when footpads and various types of individuals of that kind have a free field to carry on their depredations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="MINISTER for JUSTICE (Mr. O'Higgins) Kevin O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for JUSTICE (Mr. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter that was raised first on this Bill was its financial reactions, whether it will involve an economy, or the reverse of economy. The Bill will have little, if any, financial reactions, and it is in no sense an economic measure.  The object aimed at is improved efficiency in administration. The feeling is that to cope properly <Col N="915" /> with crime you need a single system of police intelligence for the entire area of jurisdiction of the State.  We have found that a system of two distinct police forces with distinct areas of jurisdiction involves an amount of wasteful routine and is a factor in favour of the lawbreaker and the criminal.</P>
      <P>You have, in those days of Ford cars, a criminal dropping down from Dublin to a rural area and committing his crime there and coming back again that evening to a different police area and police jurisdiction, and all the time the two jurisdictions were a steady factor in favour of the criminal. It is better to have the entire area of the State in one police jurisdiction, and that is the main object of this Bill. Under the Bill the Metropolitan Police become simply the metropolitan division of the amalgamated force.  The personnel remains the same, and the Bill gives to every member at present serving in the Dublin Metropolitan Police a security of tenure in the metropolitan area.  So for a considerable time you will have within this Gárda Síochána an anomaly of one self-contained division&mdash;one division the members of which, or mostly the members of which, will have fixed tenure in their area.  That will, of course, be a disappearing anomaly because recruiting in future will be simply to a single force, and recruits can be sent anywhere throughout the area that the Force serves.  But the present Metropolitan Police are given by the Bill a tenure and security in the metropolitan area.</P>
      <P>It is recognised that a special training would be needed for policemen serving in the metropolitan area, and that will be attended to in the future. Men who are intended to serve in the metropolitan division will be trained to that end, but it is better to have the one force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is just one consequence of this Bill which I would like to advert to. We had hitherto a detective branch attached to the Metropolitan Police. That branch was confined in its functions to the metropolitan area.  After this Bill becomes law the detective <Col N="916" /> branch of the Metropolitan Police will become the detective branch of the Gárda Síochána.  It is proposed to increase its strength to two hundred and to enable it to operate throughout the entire country.  That is something that is needed and something that is welcomed by every responsible person living in rural areas.  On the one hand I have a very definite objection to altering the position of the Gárda Síochána as an unarmed force.  I think the ordinary policeman through the country should be able to perform his functions without the use of arms, but equally there are scattered through the country people who resort to arms in the commission of crime, and these can only be met and beaten by persons similarly armed.  We will confront people of that type with what I believe will prove a sufficient number of armed detectives. If the number is insufficient the number will be increased, but I think it is better to try that plan rather than simply resort to the idea of a complete arming of your police force.  A certain number of armed detectives in every division of the Gárda Síochána will, I hope, give the desired result.</P>
    <P>In reference to the eightpenny rate, I did not, of course, expect that the proposal in the Bill would pass without comment or without criticism, but I put it to Senators that it is a reasonable proposal.  The Exchequer must get some little time to find exactly how it stands, and to take its bearings before taking over a burden which amounts in the year to £52,000.  A graded reduction over a period of eight years is not a hardship, the more so when you remember that the Bill involves no real change for the Dublin citizen.  He is getting the protection of person and property which he got before and the personnel of the Force remains the same as before, the existing members of the Metropolitan Police having tenure in the area, and so on.  There is no real change and the relief, if gradual, will be considerable in the total.  At the end of eight years the National Exchequer will have taken over from the ratepayers this burden of £52,000.</P>
    <P>There is just one aspect of the thing which I might touch on.  The Metropolitan <Col N="917" /> area has 18 per cent. of the police of the country, and it contains about 13 per cent. of the population and about 15 per cent. of the valuation. It has 18 per cent. of the police personnel and there are those who would argue that even with the unified force a case could be made for some special contributions from the metropolitan area in aid of the police force.  However, it is not proposed to perpetuate or stereotype any such contribution, and at the end of eight years, on this penny per annum reduction, the contribution will have ceased.  On the question of strengths, we took over in 1922 a force of 1,124.  Under Article X. of the Treaty 558 have retired, so that the sentiment we might feel about the passing of the Dublin Metropolitan Police we should have spread over the last three years, because they were, in fact, passing all the time, and there are left only about 400 of the 1,124 which were transferred.  The remainder went under an Article of the Treaty which was designed to meet the case of men who had rendered themselves so obnoxious to the new regime that the continuation of their services would not be desirable, or alternatively, to whom the new regime would be so obnoxious that they would be unwilling to serve it. Five hundred and fifty-eight members of the Dublin Metropolitan Police went under that Article.  It was simply the lure of the pension and there was no way out of it.  Once the men expressed their desire to go and stated that they were unwilling to remain on owing to the change of Government, then there was no legal means of defeating that desire, but I think it was a result of that particular Article of the Treaty which was never contemplated by either set of signatories.  It was a result that was regretted, and the Dublin Metropolitan Police as we knew them have been steadily passing out. Of the Dublin Metropolitan force as it exists now, roughly the proportions would be seven to four&mdash;there are about 700 new men and 400 of the men who were transferred in 1922.</P>
    <P>This fusion at the moment and for some considerable time to come is really little more than a fusion of headquarters. It will scarcely affect the <Col N="918" /> actual serving member of the Metropolitan Police.  His duties and the area of his duties, and his conditions of service, remain substantially the same and little more is taking place here and now than a fusion of headquarters, which will be more convenient for efficient administration. That is the chief result, that and the extension of the strength of the detective branch, and of its operation throughout the entire area of the State.  I build a certain amount of hope on that for improved conditions in the country and for increased security of person and property, and increased respect for law, throughout the country.  By May at the latest I think we should have functioning throughout the State an efficient detective branch of the Gárda Síochána.  The members of that branch will be very carefully selected.  I recognise it is a big responsibility to put arms into the hands of men who will wear no uniform and, outwardly at any rate, no distinctive badge to mark them off from the ordinary civilian, and because I take that responsibility very, very seriously I can guarantee Senators that the selection of the personnel of the branch will be very, very carefully conducted, and that I will be, so far as it is humanly possible, personally satisfied of the integrity and discretion of every man who is taken on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>They are.  On the question of the strength, I have a table showing the strengths over a period of years.  I find that in 1838 the strength of the Metropolitan Police was 1,011; in 1840, 1,210; in 1883, 1,296; in 1885, 1,268; in 1901, 1,284; in 1914, 1,270; in 1922, 1,140, and the present strength is 1,220.  Over the last year there were times when the strength was considerably down owing to men going out and the fact that recruits were only in training.  There were times when we were carrying on with a strength that was not very much above a thousand. Of course, the burden of police duty has been steadily increasing in the city; the volume of traffic, for one thing, is very much bigger, and it was necessary to put more men on point duty, and so on.  In fact, I think that four or five years ago there was not one policeman on point duty in the metropolitan area.  I am aware that in certain areas out about Rathmines, and in other places, there were complaints that patrolling was somewhat thin and infrequent.  It was difficult to cover the entire area at times when we were under strength, and it is only for the past two or three months that the matter of strength has been satisfactory owing to the fact that recruits are coming in.  At present I think there is less complaint, and we are satisfied that with that strength of 1,220 we will be able to meet all reasonable calls.  In regard to the question of physique, this Bill, at any rate, involves no change.  There is no difficulty in preserving the present standard, and there is not any difficulty at all in getting recruits up to that standard.</P>

      <P>Before the Seanad adjourns there is a matter that I would like to mention.  Senators will have observed that the flag on Government Buildings has to-day been flying at half-mast in respect to the memory of President Ebert, of the Republic of Germany, whose funeral, I understand, takes place to-day.  Previously we passed a resolution of sympathy with the people of the United States on a similar occasion, and I think members of the Seanad will agree with me that <Col N="921" /> on this occasion we might pass a resolution of sympathy with the people of Germany in the loss which they have sustained through the death of President Ebert.  We have not been brought as a nation into contact with them, though there are many and various ties between the peoples of this country and Germany, and I think we recognise that President Ebert himself has served his country during an extremely difficult period, and, as far as we can see, served it well. His loss is one which, I think, will be felt by a very large number of people in Germany.  I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Seanad Eireann desires to place on record the expression of its deep regret at the sudden death of President Ebert and to convey to the people of the German Republic its deep sympathy with them in the national loss they have thereby sustained.</P>

I think that before we could consistently pass this motion we ought to remove that stigma from the German people.</P>

      <P>I would like to mention a matter that I want <Col N="922" /> Senators to turn over in their minds; I do not want them to arrive at any conclusion about it to-day or to-morrow, but it is a matter that we will have to consider carefully in the very near future.  I refer to the fact that at the end of the year there will be an election; a number of Senators will be retired automatically, and there will be an election to fill the vacancies.  No machinery, as far as I can make out, is provided anywhere for the purpose of this election; that is to say, no machinery of a direct and practical kind.  We have no provisions as to the period when the election takes place; we have no provision as to the obligation for serving preliminary notices, and matters of that kind.  The provisions that are in the Constitution in reference to the method by which these vacancies are to be filled are very complicated, and all these matters require careful consideration.  I have conferred on this with Senator Douglas, and the idea that occurred to me was that we might, later on, formulate a request to the other House to form a Joint Committee to deal with the matter, but on thinking it over, I considered that as it relates so much, and to a large extent exclusively, to this House, we ought, in the first instance, to appoint a Committee of our own to consider the matter.  It may then turn out that there are certain points on which we will require the collaboration and co-operation of the other House, because the other House has a voice in the determination of the panel of candidates to be submitted to the electors. They have a voice in that, but in so far as other matters to be determined concern our own domestic legislation, I think in the first instance the most desirable plan would be to appoint a committee on our own to go into the whole matter and consider it carefully.  Although it is not very urgent, seeing the election will not take place until December, still the matter is so intricate and complicated that I think the sooner a committee of that kind is appointed the better it will be. I just want the House to think it over, and perhaps when we meet next week or the week after, we might consider what course we will take.</P>
