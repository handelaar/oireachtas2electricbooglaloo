      <P>I beg to move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 46.  To add a sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2)  No allowance granted under this part of the Act shall be capable of being taken in execution or otherwise alienated by process of law for the payment of any debts or liabilities of the person to whom such allowance was granted.</P>
      <P>The section was substantially the same when the Bill was introduced in the Dáil as it will be if this amendment is inserted.  For some reason which it is not quite clear, this portion of the section was removed.  Personally I think it is very much better that this provision, which I think was inserted in most of the previous Bills of the kind, should be retained.  I think it is a mistake that, particularly in the case of the older pensioners, it should be possible to tempt them to enter into debt, and of speedily spending their pensions before a particular instalment is paid.  I think a provision of this kind by which instalments due cannot be taken for a debt&mdash; which means in effect that they cannot get credit in advance of their pensions &mdash;is a very wise provision and I hope it will be agreed to.</P>

      <P>This provision was put into the Bill originally.  I had not, however, any hard and fast views on the matter and I left it to a free vote of the Dáil.  I am in the same position in the Seanad.  I do not know how it will go afterwards.  Probably the Dáil <Col N="536" /> will uphold their decision.  I am just in the same position as I was in the other House.</P>

      <P>I oppose this amendment. I think it places pensioners under this Bill in a very privileged position as compared with other people. Not only are they in the enjoyment of a very good salary during their term of office, but when their period of service expires they are provided with a very handsome pension at the expense of the ratepayers.  Then, you add to that the further privilege of not being liable to pay their debts with these pensions. That is a privilege, I think, that should not be accorded to them.  It is one that the ratepayers would not consent to.  Not only do I oppose this amendment, but I also oppose the section in the Bill which provides that their pensions cannot be taken for debt.</P>

      <P>I have already stated that is not the object of the Report Stage at all.  The object of the Report Stage is to give a further opportunity of considering matters that have been already dealt with on the Committee Stage.  In some assemblies they will not allow a new matter to be sprung on the Report Stage, for the obvious reason that the time has passed for giving it full discussion, and the only exception I have made to that is in cases in which, with the consent of the House, an important question is raised and not fully debated and is allowed to stand over for the purpose of seeing what attitude the Ministry or Senators will take on the Report Stage. If you intended to oppose Section 46, <Col N="537" /> you should have put down an amendment for the purpose.</P>

      <P>At the present time, yes.  Even on the Committee Stage, if you intend to move the deletion of a section, in all fairness you should put down an appropriate amendment to that effect.  It would be simply that the section should be deleted.  Then the Ministers and Senators would be prepared for it.  I think they should get notice.  It would be very irregular that in an important Bill of this kind, any Senator could get up and oppose the passing of a particular section without notice of any kind.  It is an objectionable practice I think in the interests of the House itself.  However, you are now speaking on the amendment and you may deal with it.</P>

      <P>I think the amendment restores the section as it stood when originally introduced in the Dáil. It was quite true that objection was taken in the Dáil that the Minister left it to a free vote of the House.  I do not believe myself in Senator Linehan's description of the amendment&mdash;that it adds a new privilege to pensioners.  It does not mean that they shall not continue to pay their debts.  It means, as I understand it, that the pension cannot be pledged in advance.  It does not mean that once a payment is made you cannot take action against these people <Col N="538" /> to compel them to pay their proper debts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to point out that the object was to secure for the pensioner the enjoyment of his pension which, presumably, in most of these cases is not very large and which is necessary to enable him to live.  The position, unless I am incorrectly informed, is that under previous Acts a provision of this kind has been inserted, and that so far as most pensioners are concerned they are governed by a section of this kind.  I think that it is also in the interests of the trader.  You have to consider their position as to what extent they should give credit.  And it would be much better to have uniformity in regard to all pensioners. With that object I propose this amendment.</P>

      <P>Whenever, under the provisions of any public or local Act, a local body is empowered to grant to any of its employees, other than officers, an allowance in respect of the loss of his employment, Section 36, sub-sections (1) and (2) of Section 38, Sections 40, 43, 44 and 46 of this Act shall be substituted for such provisions, and shall apply to the granting of such allowances, and to such allowances when granted with the following modifications, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  in such application the words &ldquo;office&rdquo; and &ldquo;officer&rdquo; shall include &ldquo;employment&rdquo; and &ldquo;employee&rdquo; respectively, and the word &ldquo;salary&rdquo; shall include &ldquo;wages&rdquo;;</P>

      <P>Section 47, page 23, lines 51-52.  To delete the words &ldquo;any of its employees, other than officers,&rdquo; and to insert in lieu thereof the following words: &ldquo;to any person in its employment who is not a pensionable officer within the meaning of this part of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am afraid this amendment will not have much effect, judging by the fate of my previous amendment on the same subject.  At the same time I think it is not desirous that we should have that unjust distinction between officers.  I am not sure although my previous amendment was defeated that the word &ldquo;officer&rdquo; does not cover employees.</P>

    <P>Every person who at the date of the abolition of a committee of a county infirmary or a county fever hospital (whether before or after the passing of this Act) under or in pursuance of Section 7 of the Local Government (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1923, was or shall have been an officer of that committee, and, except in the case of a medical officer, devoted the whole of his time to the service of the committee, if his period of service under such committee was, or shall have been, not less than ten years, shall have the same rights to receive an allowance from the county or county borough council or councils to which or to a committee of which the functions of the committee aforesaid have been transferred on its abolition as he would have under this Act if he were a pensionable officer of a committee or joint committee of the said council or councils and had held office thereunder for a period equal to his period of service under the committee aforesaid, and had been removed from such office for a cause other than misconduct or incapacity.</P>

      <P>I beg to move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Section 16 of the Asylum Officers' Superannuation Act, 1909, shall be amended by the substitution of three years for ten years as the period to be taken into account for calculating the average salary and emoluments of an established officer for the purposes of that Act.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I do not think I require to say much in moving this amendment.  I think three years as an average is a more equitable arrangement than ten years. If you take ten years you are going over a very erratic period.  As things are to-day they are more or less stabilised. Consequently it is my opinion that the period of three years would be much better for all concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. BURKE Mr. BURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposed to this amendment which is somewhat similar <Col N="541" /> to an amendment we had in the Dáil. Officers of asylums are on a different footing altogether from other officers of local authorities and have a superannuation code of their own, based on a contributory basis.  The basis of the calculation of their pensions is over three years, whereas the basis for the ordinary officer of a local authority is calculated over ten years.  There are also other differences in the positions of officers of lunatic asylums and officers of other local authorities.  Certain officers of lunatic asylums automatically become pensionable when they arrive at the age of fifty-five, and the basis of calculation of their pensions is so many fiftieths of their salaries and emoluments, whereas the basis of calculation of the ordinary officers of local authorities is so many sixtieths.  The whole thing hangs together; it has been worked out on mathematical lines, and if we are to vary one part of the system we will have to vary the whole system.</P>
      <P>It would be a very invidious thing at present to change the basis of calculation from ten years to three years. During the last few years the wages of officers of lunatic asylums have gone up beyond all bounds, in some cases over 100 per cent., and naturally any officer retiring now would, under this amendment, get a much higher pension than if the pension was calculated on a ten years' basis.  Perhaps in ten years' time after wages come down to normal a retiring officer will be in a much worse position.  This amendment would put the officers at present going out in a very much better position than those who had gone out previously.  It is also, of course, inequitable from the point of view of the rates.  As I have mentioned before, a Commission is about to inquire into this whole matter of lunatic asylums and poor relief, and I am not prepared to reconsider the code dealing with asylums until this Commission has brought in its report.  For these reasons I am opposed to the amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment put and declared lost.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I move to delete the word &ldquo;ten&rdquo; and substitute therefor <Col N="542" /> the word &ldquo;five.&rdquo;  Section 49 provides that officers of committees of county infirmaries and county fever hospitals whose posts are abolished may receive compensation by way of an allowance after ten years' service. The amendment seeks to provide that any employee whose post is abolished and who has had five years' continuous service shall receive some allowance by way of compensation.  I am merely following the precedent set in the Railways Act, 1924, an Act passed through the Oireachtas as a Government measure. It was very distinctly laid down in the first instance at the instigation of the Government that anybody losing his post who had five years' continuous service was to get some compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it was right to make a proposal of that kind where private employers were concerned, surely the responsibility of the public to its employees is none the less serious than that of a private employer to his employees. What is right in one cannot be wrong in the other.  One can easily visualise the position of employees, such as those people who would come under the amendment, who have got into a particular groove, who have had a specialised form of training and whose training is of no use to them in the outer world.  Is it fair after they have given, we will say, five years' service of that kind, service of an exceedingly important character, that from a humane point of view they should be turned adrift at this particular time when unemployment is rife in all industries, and that they should not be given compensation? They may have nine, or nine and a half years' service, and still they are debarred.  This is not a case of giving a pension for services rendered; it is merely to give some compensation for taking away the person's employment, for no fault of his own, but because a Bill has been introduced to improve public administration.  I suggest that that is elementary justice to people whose positions are abolished, that after they have spent at least five years studying and practising at their callings they must have qualified themselves specially for their employment, and it is not just or equitable to say: <Col N="543" />&ldquo;You have got to lose that employment in the public interest; we offer you nothing else; we cannot hold out any guarantee to you that you can get employment elsewhere, because the duties you have been performing are of no use to you in the commercial world, but we will not give you any compensation for the loss of your office. Your sacrifice must be made at our dictates in the interests of the public.&rdquo;  If that is the principle underlying this Bill certainly it is not a just or equitable principle, and it is one which the Government themselves said would not be just or equitable to apply to the railways.  Under the Railways Act people with less than five years' service are entitled to two months' salary for each year in a lump sum, and if they have five years' service they are entitled to compensation by way of a pension.  If it was right in the case of the railways I assert that it is right in this case, and that it is the least we owe to these people whose employment we are filching from them, not because of any fault of theirs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. BURKE Mr. BURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>No, they are not.  I would like the Seanad to understand that these officers at present are not entitled to any pension or gratuity of any kind.  If one of these officers was dismissed heretofore, even after fifteen years' service, be could get no pension. Under this Bill we are giving pensionable rights to officers who have had ten years' service.  We are not granting that concession to officers with less than ten years' service, because if we did we would open the door to gratuities.  You cannot pay a pension to an officer with less than ten years' service, and you would have to pay him a gratuity.  A very heavy burden has already been placed on local authorities as a result of these gratuities, and I do not think that there is any great hardship on these officers if they have been in office for less than ten years.  It is not the same as if they had devoted their whole time to the work for fifteen or twenty <Col N="544" /> years and were not in a position to take up any other employment.  Any man who has devoted only ten years to a certain employment should be quite well able to take up another position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BENNETT</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that the position as regards employees of local bodies and those of the railway company is on all fours.  It might in the case of a certain number of railway employees who had prepared specifically for such employment, clerks who had to undergo an examination and a period of training, and so on.  These considerations, I think, would put them in a rather favoured position as compared with the position of employees of local authorities.  But apart from that, the Railways Act was a great experiment, and it was essential, I take it, that the good-will of everybody concerned should be secured.  There surely must be a limit as to the period for which a man would be justified in getting compensation.  I think the ten years prescribed by the Government is thoroughly reasonable, and that the amendment should not be accepted.  I do not believe that it is on all fours with the precedent of the Railways Act, and I think the position of any servant of a local authority will not be injured by leaving the Bill as it came from the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>The position of these people is absolutely on all fours with nineteen-twentieths of the railway employees.  With the exception of the clerical and supervisory grades no railwayman is entitled to any pension whatever, and can have his services terminated at any time with a fortnight's or a month's notice, as the case might be.  Such men only retain their positions permanently during good conduct on the strength of their industrial power.  That may have something to say to the fact that the Government adopted a different policy in the case of the railways from what they do in the case of these people whom they realise have no industrial power.  If they had treated the railway employees unfairly they might not have had any railways working, and I think it is a very bad principle to embark on the policy, that <Col N="545" /> simply because people are not able to hit back, or to defend themselves by powers other than Parliamentary, you must sacrifice them in the public interest, as you call it.  When a man in this employment has eight years' service he must be fairly well advanced in years from the point of view of getting employment, and the fact that he has been an officer under a local body is certainly no recommendation for him to get employment in the industrial or commercial world.  It would be rather against him.  I suggest that it is absolutely cruel to take away the employment of these people, tell them that you will not give them any compensation, but simply close your eyes and ears to any sufferings you inflict on them, and say: &ldquo;No matter what becomes of the children of this man with nine and a half years' service, it is only in the interests of the public and the ratepayers that he should get no compensation.&rdquo; If that is the spirit underlying the Bill I certainly am not prepared to associate myself with it.</P>

      <P>It is suggested that a boy of twenty years who goes into the employment of a public body and leaves after five years should get a gratuity.  That seems to me to be very unreasonable.  Such a young man would be in the prime of life.  He has been serving a certain kind of apprenticeship and is fully capable of going out into the world and earning his living at something else, just as if he had been employed in a shop.  Pensions are for people who are worn out, not for young men of twenty-five, who are just qualifying themselves for their work in life.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 51 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;51.&mdash;(1)  A county council may, if they think fit, by resolution passed at any annual meeting, direct and prescribe that the Chairman of the Council and his successors in office shall be styled and known as county mayor.</P>
      <P>(2)  At the first meeting of a county council after the triennial election of members of the council, the council may, if they think fit or, in the case of this power having already been exercised, shall, elect one-fourth (neglecting any fraction when the whole number is not divisible by four) of the whole number of members of the council to the style and dignity of county aldermen, each member voting for a number of members (other than himself) equal to the number to be elected and the persons receiving the highest numbers of votes (subject to the drawing of lots in the case of ties) to be deemed elected.</P>
      <P>(3)  No proceeding in any court, act in the law, public document, or other matter or thing, shall be invalidated, questioned, or otherwise impaired or affected, by reason only of the description of any person as councillor or chairman, instead of an alderman or mayor, in pursuance of the powers given by this section.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By this amendment I propose that a county council should have the power, if it so desires, to style its chairman county mayor, and also that a fourth of the members of the county council should be called county aldermen.  I think that &ldquo;chairman of the county council&rdquo; is a rather unwieldy term, and that &ldquo;county mayor&rdquo; would be much easier.  Apart from that, much more dignity is attached to the word &ldquo;mayor&rdquo; than to &ldquo;chairman.&rdquo;  The chairman of a county council is a representative <Col N="547" /> of a large area, and I think the county council, if it wished, ought to be entitled to call its chairman the county mayor.  It would mean no expense to the ratepayers, and I am sure many Senators will be glad to hear that.  If that is right, I think the other thing follows, that you should have county aldermen.  If the amendment is accepted, I think it will be availed of fairly fully.</P>

The Senator might be prepared to omit the few counties where there is a corporation.  I should certainly support anything that would add dignity to the chairman of the county council and the county council itself.  They have done a lot of honorary work since 1899, and if the Senator can hit on another term which will make them even more revered I will agree.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 51, sub-section (2).  After sub-section (2) to add a new sub-section (3) as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) The power of a county council to co-opt additional members after a triennial election shall cease after the passing of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By the 1908 Local Government Act the county councils were empowered, after each triennial election, to co-opt two additional members.  I propose that that section be repealed and that that power cease after the passing of this Bill.  I think it is desirable that every member of a county council should be elected from the ratepayers, should be in full touch with them, and should know what his responsibilities are.  If it is necessary to increase the number of members of a county council, it can be done by adding two members to the number of members elected, and in that way we will get over any difficulty of the number of county councillors being too small for the work they have to do.  I observe in sub-section (2), clause 51, that the number of members to be elected to the county council shall be increased by a number equal to twice the number of rural districts in existence in such county on the appointed day.  That will more than double the elected members of the county council.  If it is necessary to have any new members, I suggest they be added for election purposes and that the system of co-option be done away with.  From my experience of co-option, I have found <Col N="549" /> that not the most suitable men were co-opted but rather the most active canvassers.  When they got into the council they were the most extravagant in spending the rates.</P>

There are also men of considerable experience who, sometimes, owing to the activities of their opponents at an election, are not elected.  Men who gave good service in the county council, because they were not of a particular way of thinking, failed at the elections. You cannot argue by individual cases that the thing is going to be wrong. That does not justify the undermining of the general principle.  The principle, I think, was all right, in giving a county this margin that they might secure to themselves men of any special knowledge in any branch of local government or redress some inequality in some part of the area.  The principle is sound and should be maintained.</P>

At present any man on the register for any part of the whole place can be elected for any division.  He need not live even in that area.

But I object to a Senator coming along at this time of day with the proposal that a person, to be eligible for election, shall be a ratepayer.  There are very efficient people in this country who have rendered good service on the county councils and who are not ratepayers. It is not every man who is endowed with sufficient of the world's wealth to entitle him to be described as a ratepayer.  I am surprised at Senator Kenny bringing forward such an amendment.  The amendment would debar the majority of people from seeking election on the county councils. I leave it to the good sense of the Seanad to say whether they are going back to the old system, that nobody except a lord of the manor or someone of that type is eligible to sit on a public board.</P>

The landlord is responsible for the rates, and some of these people <Col N="552" /> are as good citizens as can be found. They are really ratepayers, inasmuch as they pay their rates through the rent, but the landlord is made responsible for the rates.  The rates are paid in his name.  To debar all these people from seeking election for membership of the county council, or other public board, would be a grave injustice, apart from the reactionary and undemocratic character of the amendment, which excludes women who are not ratepayers, although they may be the wives of ratepayers.  It would be a step back into the Middle Ages if the Seanad were to adopt such an amendment as this.</P>

      <P>I think there is a limitation in the case of holdings of a certain valuation.  I am stating the position generally.  The law goes very far, because the case decided was a case in which the landlord had actually agreed by his lease that he <Col N="553" /> would pay the rates in consideration of the tenant paying him a certain fixed rent.  It was held that that was illegal, as the Act of Parliament stated that the rates were to be paid by the occupier.</P>

A man might be a ratepayer and resident in the area on the day of his election, and he might cease to have these qualifications the next day.  If Senator Kenny's amendment is intended to be effective, surely it should apply during the time the person in question purports to act as a member of the council.  In other words, no person should be eligible for election or should be eligible to act as a member, if he was not resident and a ratepayer.

      <P>In Ireland, when the Local Government Act came into operation, the previous position was changed and the whole onus was thrown on the occupier.  It was open to the occupier to get his rent adjusted accordingly.  He could get a certain portion of his rent deducted on account of the payment of the rate.  Some occupiers did that and some did not.  Every occupier is now a ratepayer or should be a ratepayer. I hold with the amendment, that a candidate should be both resident and a ratepayer in the particular area in which he seeks election.  It is the least we may expect that a member of a body which has to do with the levying, collection and expenditure of rates should have some personal interest, as well as representative interest, in the matter.  If he is not a ratepayer, he can advocate the most radical departures at the county council and they will have no effect on him personally.  I think it is radically wrong that a man without any stake or vested interest in the county should go forward for such an important position.  Schemes which would have an effect on the pocket of the ratepayers might be proposed by him, while he would himself remain absolutely unaffected.  I hold with the amendment as it stands.</P>

There has been a certain amount of ill-feeling in county councils, owing to the contention that persons from one part of the county put undue expenditure on another part. It is only right that a person seeking election should come from the area in which he seeks election.  Senator Foran wanted a definition of the word &ldquo;ratepayer.&rdquo; On a certain occasion a number of aldermen and councillors went to a certain mayor and told him that the ratepayers were becoming indignant at the cost he was putting upon the constituency by litigation and otherwise.  He listened very carefully, and then he said: &ldquo;As regards the ratepayers, I would advise you gentlemen to go home and look up Walker's Dictionary.  You will see that &lsquo;ratepayer&rsquo; is defined as &lsquo;a person who pays rates.&rsquo;  The more rates he pays, the more he is fulfilling his function in life.&rdquo;  I think that would apply to a good many of the arguments here.</P>

      <P>Would not that inflict a great hardship on a farmer or labourer who migrated during the course of the year?  He would be disqualified the moment he left the county. I do not think that is reasonable.  It is very hard that a man should not be allowed to better himself by changing his farm or employment.  The law as it stood inflicted no hardship.  I never heard it suggested that because a man was not a resident he was not competent for the position.  There were men in many councils who were not resident in a particular area and who represented the whole county satisfactorily. I think the law as it stood protected everyone.  Everyone in a county who was a householder was entitled to be elected, and I think it worked well. I do not think the change proposed will work better.</P>

Under the present Bill I think that is not so essential.  Under the previous Act the expenditure on district roads was paid by the district.  All the roads now are to be a county charge and, as the road expenditure is the main expenditure in a county, I think the business can be conducted as well by members of a county council, no matter what district they come from.</P>

They are outside the boundary, but they use the city of Waterford for their markets and other business.  You debar them entirely from representation on the council of the county where they do all their business.  I have no doubt there are other cases like that near Dublin.  It would not be equitable to exclude residents outside the boundaries from representation on the council.

      <P>It is very necessary to have this word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; in here. There is a rather severe penalty for acting, and in many cases members of local authorities are disqualified without knowing it.  For instance, up to quite recently it was not very clearly decided whether a director of a company which had entered into a contract with a local authority would be disqualified from acting on that local authority.  He might have acted in that capacity, and would be liable to this severe penalty.  For that reason it is necessary to put the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; in, and the onus in the particular case is thrown on the defendant to show that he did not act knowingly. In administering the Act, I will do everything in my power to see to it that any member who is disqualified will know that he is disqualified by having a notice hung up in the room where the council meets notifying the conditions under which a person would be disqualified from acting as a Local Government representative.  If a great hardship is not to be inflicted, it is necessary to retain the word &ldquo;knowingly.&rdquo;</P>

    <P>&ldquo;(4)  If any person is, after the passing of this Act, convicted of acting as a member or officer of a local authority when disqualified, he shall be disqualified for a period of ten years from the date of such conviction for being elected or appointed to any paid office under or in the gift of any local authority: provided that the disqualification arising under this sub-section may be removed by <Col N="564" /> the Minister certifying under his hand that on full consideration of the circumstances he is satisfied that the disqualification should, either as regards a specified vacant paid office, or generally, not continue, but in any such case as in this proviso mentioned, such certificate as aforesaid shall be forwarded with and form a necessary part of the application of any such person as candidate for any such paid office as aforesaid, and no such person shall be eligible for appointment to any paid office unless such certificate shall have been obtained and forwarded as aforesaid.&rdquo;</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="565" /> Before Section 55 to insert two new sections as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;55.&mdash;No political question unless bearing directly on matters within the jurisdiction of the local authority shall be discussed at any meeting of a county council, board of health, urban district council, borough council, or any committees thereof.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;56.&mdash;Should the Minister consider that the provisions of the foregoing section have been contravened at any meeting he shall by order declare the proceedings of such meeting to be null and void but without prejudice to anything done previous to the issue of such order.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think I am right in saying that a good deal of adverse criticism has been levied at the heads of local government boards, both from within and without the country, owing to the frequent discussion of political matters which have nothing to do with the business of the local authority.  If it were possible to put a stop to these discussions, I think the dignity and status of our local bodies would be very much enhanced. I have experienced myself for many years great disquietude by being a member of local bodies where such matters were discussed.  So unpleasant was it on many occasions that I quite believe that if only politics could be kept out of local boards far better people would be got to take up the work of local government.  To a great extent in the past, and even in the present, these political discussions have been used as a form of pillorying, by which you can brand people's politics in any manner that may be required.  It is also used as a form of notoriety or advertisement for any form of political creed. Nothing has a more degrading psychological effect on our local bodies than these political discussions.  If an instance were required I would only point to the case last week where the General Council of County Councils, which is supposed to be the <i>corps d'elite</i> of councils, indulged in a discussion of the merits and demerits of certain political prisoners.</P>
    <P>If the House would agree with me so far, the only question would be whether an amendment of this kind is <Col N="566" /> likely to be effective, and whether it secures its purpose in the best way.  I suggest it would not be wise to prohibit political discussions altogether, simply because the authority of the law would be flouted.  They would take place all the same, and you would have to impose special penalties, imprisonment or something of that kind, to enforce the law.  That would not be desirable, and would only make martyrs of the people concerned.  Under the proposal now before the House the effect would be that if a political resolution, outside matters bearing directly on the business or question within the jurisdiction of their authority is raised, all the other business will be liable to be declared, by the Minister, when he gets the minutes, to be null and void, so that if any political resolution is brought up it will be open to any member to say: &ldquo;I hope the members present realise that if we pass this resolution we will have to go home, for all the business transacted to-day will be futile and abortive.&rdquo;  A wise chairman would say at the beginning of the meeting: &ldquo;If there are any political resolutions we will take them first, and then we may go home, as nothing further can be done.&rdquo;  If a political resolution is not brought up at the beginning of the meeting the chairman could refuse to take it later on.  I suggest that the amendment is likely to be effective without making martyrs of these people, who wish to indulge in political propaganda at local boards.</P>

      <P>I am quite in favour of the object the Senator has in view, but I have some doubt as to whether the method he has adopted is the most effective.  The Ministers, of course, are always politicians, and I think the result may possibly be that if a resolution is in agreement with the Minister's political views he may consider it non-political, whereas if it is against the Government he will declare the proceedings null and void.  I think these two sections can be drafted into one by adding at the end of the first section: &ldquo;Any proceedings at such meeting shall be null and void if any of the members present points out that this is a political resolution.&rdquo; otherwise I am afraid that the political <Col N="567" /> resolution will go if the Minister who is in office at the time is in favour of it.</P>

If I, personally, were asked at a given moment when a discussion on some economic matter was taking place, to say when it passed into the political sphere, I would find it very hard to decide.

      <P>I feel that Section 56 is necessary, because, as Senator Bennett has pointed out, there will be cases on the border line.  Some of these cases are obviously outside any local jurisdiction, questions about prisoners and those having to do with the boundary.  There are questions dealing with rating and valuations which the local authority has a right to discuss, as well as contemplated legislation in respect of these matters. This amendment gives the Minister <Col N="568" /> power to say whether the subject is outside the jurisdiction, and naturally he will give the benefit of the doubt to the local authority.  I think we may trust him to do that.  It is only when there has been a flagrant breach of Section 56 that he will act.  If, as Senator Dowdall says, the Minister cannot be expected to act impartially, well then, I am afraid it is hopeless to expect any government in the country. Ministers do realise their responsibilities apart from party, and act in a quasi-judicial capacity.</P>

      <P>The trouble I have about this amendment is this, that while I sympathise very much with the object Senator Sir John Keane has in view, I do not see exactly how we are going to define the evidence on which the Minister is to act.  The amendment says: &ldquo;No political question shall be discussed.&rdquo; Who is to give evidence as to whether or not a political question has been discussed?  If you could define the offence at the stage at which the discussion arrived at a resolution and the resolution was put, it would appear on the minute book of the local authority. Then you might have some sort of evidence on which the Minister could act, but without something of that nature I am afraid it is far too vague, though I entirely sympathise with the object Senator Sir John Keane has in view.  I am afraid his amendment will not carry out his ideas.</P>

On the minutes which come before him at present from local authorities, the Minister frequently disallows their proceedings as regards appointments and other matters.  There is a legal duty imposed on the secretary to the local authority to record the proceedings of the meeting on the minutes. My recollection of local authorities is that these political resolutions are always recorded on the minutes.</P>

      <P>I think that anyone who has a knowledge of public affairs in our country must realise that it will be absolutely impossible to carry out in practice an amendment of this kind.  Residing as I do in the South of Ireland, in the neighbourhood of the Blarney Stone, I realise quite well that in my own district it would be impossible to put into practice an amendment of this kind.  Members of public boards are very fond of indulging in political discussions.  I think that in a great measure they act as a sort of safety valve when crises arise from time to time.  It would be a dangerous precedent, I think, to try to stifle discussions on public questions that arise from time to time.</P>

      <P>They are not very much tied to the resolutions.  The resolution goes to the Press and is then supposed to have achieved its purpose. Frequently I have seen a member going in with a resolution written by someone else.  I have even seen members unable to read resolutions which they had got dealing with political questions.  Senator Haughton's point is a groundless one, because when a meeting is called for a political purpose <Col N="570" /> naturally a discussion could take place. If they liked to summon a special meeting to discuss the release of prisoners, that, of course, would be in order.</P>

      <P>I think Senator Sir John Keane would be wise to withdraw this amendment.  As regards these political resolutions, we are all glad to recognise that the occasion for them is growing less.  It is very seldom that resolutions of the kind now come before public bodies.  The position of a chairman is, of course, a peculiar one.  He has his standing orders for the conduct of the business of the meeting, just as standing orders are in existence here for the conduct of the business of the Seanad.  A member may rise in his place and ask that the standing orders be suspended for the purpose of calling attention to some urgent matter of general public interest.  The standing orders are there, and when the member declares the nature of the matter to which he calls attention, if two-thirds of the members present stand up and give their assent the chairman has no option in the matter but to allow the discussion to go on.  I think it is rather unfortunate, in this amendment, to be calling attention to matters of this sort. We are now getting into a calmer atmosphere than that in which we lived some time ago, and with the re-election of new bodies this question of political resolutions at meetings will gradually die out.  In any case if you were to go up North, I do not think Senator Sir John Keane would rule out a discussion on the boundary question at a meeting of some county council in one of the counties on the border.  A discussion on that question would certainly be semi-political.  At least, it would be very hard to disintegrate what percentage of it was political and what percentage of it was not.  I think, in all the circumstances, it would be a wise thing, and that it would reflect on the credit of the Seanad if we were to say that this was not a time when amendments of this kind should be brought forward here.  It would be better, I think, if they were not brought forward and to leave the evil, such as it is, to exhaust itself.</P>

      <P>I am in favour of the principle at the back of the amendment, but I am afraid, as several Senators have pointed out, that in practice it would be very difficult to put it into operation.  It would place a very awkward responsibility on me in the matter of deciding what was political and what was not political.  It might get me into serious difficulties with my own political chiefs in ruling out various matters that they might interpret in a different way from the way I would interpret them.  It puts the responsibility on me of making two decisions: first of all, whether it is a political resolution or not, and, secondly, whether it has a bearing directly on matters within the jurisdiction of the local authority or not.  It is quite obvious that a great many border line cases would arise on which it would be difficult to adjudicate.  Senator Sir John Keane said that the evidence to be placed before me would be the evidence in the minutes of the public meeting.  In many cases there is a big delay in the sending on of these minutes.  In some cases there is a delay of a month, and occasionally two months.  Paying orders may have been issued, and contracts may have been entered into, and perhaps partly fulfilled, before the minutes reach me.  Then I may be asked to rule that the whole thing is null and void. That would be a very serious thing for the local authorities and the parties they had entered into contracts with. For that reason I am opposed to accepting the latter part of the amendment. Senator Butler has an amendment down which proposes to effect the same purpose.  That is to come on for discussion later, and it may be easier to accept it than this one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the first part of the amendment, it is, in my opinion, impracticable, because of the definition of politics.  In Webster's dictionary, politics is defined as &ldquo;The science of Government.&rdquo;  That is a wide definition enough, unless the Minister invents a new one, and if he does invent a new one I suggest it should be added to the section of definitions in the Bill.  The amendment, desirable as it is, will simply give new employment to a set of gentlemen who will proceed to drive a coach-and-four through it, because without moving any resolution at all they can discuss all the politics they want to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One can always, I believe, break the law and, by following the example of certain exalted and eminent lawyers, keep just within the limit.  To pass this amendment will simply act as a sort of challenge to those whose object will be to discuss politics after the new councils are elected and who, perhaps, would not have any great incentive to do that unless this amendment were inserted. I believe that the amendment, if inserted, would act as an incentive and an encouragement to such people and that they would claim it as a triumph over the Oireachtas every time they were able to break through it.  Many of them would like to nullify many things done at the meetings by discussing politics or moving a resolution.  It is always easy to move a resolution at the end of a meeting, although no previous notice of it had been given.  It is easy to foresee the number of ways in which this could be availed of and that quite a lot of chaos could be created.  I had hoped that we would have been able to adopt something which would prevent politics being discussed at the meetings of public bodies, but when you come to put that in practice you find it an exceedingly difficult question.  There is no reason why a controversy on religious subjects <Col N="573" /> should not also be prohibited.  Yet we would never think of putting in an amendment to that effect.  I take it that there is a certain code of duties which these bodies are elected to perform, and that it is within the judgment of any chairman to say that a certain resolution is out of order.  You must allow him a certain amount of discretion in matters of that kind, and we must have little faith in Irish humanity if we believe that many of these boards are going to be the fiasco that some of them were in the past.</P>

      <P>I think the harm some Senators appear to see as coming from political discussions at meetings is greatly exaggerated.  On such questions as contemplated legislation, for instance, the medium of expression that could give information would be those very bodies that might have political discussions.  There would be such discussions and they would be very useful.  But if this amendment is passed the Government of the day would be deprived of a great source of knowledge that would ordinarily come to them through these public representative bodies.  I think the harm done by political discussion is greatly exaggerated. Where a proper chairman is elected to such local bodies it should be in his discretionary powers to rule such matters out of order if he thinks they are out of order.  If the chairman of such meeting wants the business concluded satisfactorily, and if he is a business man, he will rule anything of an irrelevant character out of order, and will not allow it to be discussed, and the business will be transacted properly.  I am quite in sympathy with Senator Sir John Keane on ruling out political discussion if that were possible. But I think it is impossible.</P>

      <P>I am very much in sympathy with the amendment and especially the first part of it, because I see, from the change that has come over the country, that there is no longer the same occasion for the number of speeches and debates which in the local bodies were often a complete waste of time.  If the powers were placed in the hands of the chairman to decide whether a resolution proposed <Col N="574" /> was political or not, and to refuse to sanction it, if it was political, although he might not, perhaps, have the courage on all occasions to exercise his discretionary powers, he would see at any rate that the country, if this Bill is passed, did not wish to see the local powers conferred on local bodies made use of for purposes other than those for which they were conferred.  It is to be hoped that after the next general election of members to local bodies it will be found that the decision of the electors did not depend on what political party the candidates belonged to, but rather that candidates will be chosen for their business efficiency.</P>
      <P>In that case there ought to be some way, at any rate, of showing the disapproval of the country, assuming this Bill is approved of by the country, of the waste of time which often happened at these boards in the past in discussions upon matters which were really outside the functions of county councils or boards of guardians or district councils and have frequently occupied the time of such bodies.  I certainly will support the first part of the amendment.  The suggestion that the Minister should penalise the work of the councils by rendering nugatory all their efforts to do business because what he might consider a political resolution had been passsd would, I think, be a great mistake and would place the Minister in an extremely difficult position.</P>

I am perplexed that so many should be in sympathy with the object of my amendment who despair of any practical method being discovered to make it effective.  I do not believe legislation is quite so bankrupt as all that.  We passed legislation recently purporting and claiming to do far more difficult things, the cleaning out and renovating of small dairies in the country and also legislation purporting, if adopted, to give enormously increased revenues to certain industries.  I firmly believe that this provision, if tried, <Col N="575" /> would be found to be quite effective. After all, if it was not effective or fully effective it rests entirely with the Minister. He can apply it as strictly or as liberally as he likes.  I do not think the Minister should shirk his responsibility. He has taken far greater responsibility and he has attempted more difficult things, such as the dissolution of bodies like corporations and county councils.  It should not be difficult for him to exercise a wise discretion in matters of this kind.</P>

Consequently, the people to-day who occupy those boards are not so much to blame for remembering that this thing has gone on for generations at public boards, and, as I said, we know that old customs die hard.  If to-morrow or any other time any public board introduced a discussion on Protection versus Free Trade I submit that that would be a political discussion. Now, where is the present Minister or his successor going to draw the line between what is political and what is not political?  Even Senator Sir John Keane, with all his ability, would find himself taxed to decide where it begins and where it ends.  Consequently I believe the thing is impracticable and ought to be withdrawn.  It cannot be remedied in the way suggested by the amendment.  Every person who thinks at all would like to see more practical discussion and less of the windy man.</P>

      <P>I agree with what Senator Sir John Keane said, but how it is to be put into practice I cannot see.  The Minister has already stated that according to the amendment he would have to decide what is a political question.  That will be putting upon him a tremendous responsibility. Senator Sir John Keane said &ldquo;the Minister is shirking his responsibility.&rdquo; Well, he has got this Bill, which will soon become an Act, and he has got to see it carried out, and I do not envy him that task, if he carries it out in the proper manner.  I do not think he will be shirking any responsibility. You may as well try to stop the currents and the tide in Dublin Bay as to stop my countrymen talking politics whenever they are assembled together.  As one of the Labour Senators said, other generations have done it and it will continue.  I cannot possibly see how, in an Act of Parliament, you are going to prevent people from talking, for that is what it amounts to.</P>
      <P>Let them do their business first.  If a resolution came forward the chairman could say: &ldquo;I am bound to accept the resolution if the Standing Orders are suspended.&rdquo;  I know if I were chairman of the meeting I would have to accept it.  I hope Senator Sir John Keane will not press this amendment, because it looks as if the meaning of it was that we are to hold our tongues about politics.  We are not going to hold our tongues about politics.  Certainly not.  In every generation we talk politics and we are going to talk politics whenever we gather together on any occasion.</P>

I have never known that rule broken.  Consequently men of all classes and sections in these organisations <Col N="577" /> have met together at friendly meetings and discharged the business of these bodies.  We need not look forward to the danger of the chairman's ruling being nullified.

If a clause of this kind were inserted, it might be useful: &ldquo;It shall be the duty of the presiding chairman of every county council, public health board, urban district council, borough council or committee thereof to rule out of order any question, discussion or resolution which, in his opinion, is of a political nature and does not bear directly on any matter within the jurisdiction or control of such county council,&rdquo; etc.</P>

      <P>Section 57, sub-section (2).  To delete the words from and including the word &ldquo;the&rdquo; up to and including the word &ldquo;year&rdquo; in line 13, and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;each meeting,&rdquo; and to delete in paragraph (a) all the words from and including the word &ldquo;at&rdquo; in line 16 to the word &ldquo;months&rdquo; in line 17, and substitute therefor the words &ldquo;such meeting.&rdquo;  To delete all from and including the words &ldquo;at least&rdquo; in line 19, paragraph (b), to the end of the paragraph, and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;such meeting,&rdquo; and in lines 25-26 to delete the words &ldquo;during such preceding six months.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Shortly, the meaning of this amendment, which is a General Council's amendment, is that members should be paid, at the close of each meeting or as soon after as possible, the amount provided in Schedule 5 for travelling expenses. Under the Bill as it stands payment appears to be deferred for the whole six months, and a member would have to have attended at least three-fourths of the meetings of such county authorities as shall be held during the preceding six months.  You can imagine instances which may arise, that with the very best intentions a member may not succeed in having attended three-fourths of the meetings.  It may happen there may be sickness or there may be enforced absence on the part of the members.  I think it would be bad, if, in view of these contingencies, he would be debarred from getting the expenses due to him.  In selection boards, Departmental Committees or Consultative Committees appointed by the Minister, the practice is that the members attending the meetings <Col N="580" /> send in an account of their expenses and these accounts are dealt with before the next meeting and payments forwarded to them.  Why that principle should be departed from here is not very clear to the General Council of County Councils.  That is the reason why this amendment is submitted to the Seanad asking that members attending county councils should be paid such expenses as they are entitled to be paid to them straight away, and that the words I have mentioned should be deleted from the Bill so that the members who attend should be paid such expenses as they are entitled to on forwarding their accounts.</P>

      <P>There was an amendment somewhat similar to this amendment in the Dáil, and I opposed it.  The object of this section, or the principal object of it, is to try to ensure better attendance at the meetings of local bodies.  I think, sir, that you in another capacity, delivered a very famous judgment on this matter, in which you used rather strong strictures with regard to non-attendance of members of local bodies.  It is common knowledge that in the past, and even at the present time, the attendance at these meetings is very poor.  Under this section, payment will not be made to members unless they attend three-quarters of the meetings.  Payment will not be made at the end of the six months unless they have attended three-quarters of the meetings.  This will ensure that the man who carries out his duties in an honourable and efficient manner will be paid, and the man who neglects his business and who only turns up when appointments are about being made will not be paid.  The effect of Senator Kenny's amendment would probably be to stimulate this present tendency to turn up only when matters of a pecuniary interest are involved, and to <Col N="581" /> neglect the ordinary duties of the council. The section as it stands is a very good protection against that kind of conduct, and for that reason I ask the Seanad not to accept the amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a rather different proposition from the last amendment, and Senator Bennett has expressed the view already that finds favour with a good many, namely, that the expenses allowed to members of a county council are so trivial that they either should be deleted entirely or increased.  That was also the view of the General Council&mdash; namely, that the expenses allowed under the Bill as it stands do not represent any appreciable part of the expenses of the members attending these councils and committees.  The members of the General Council would much prefer that the expenses should be left out entirely rather than that they should be dealt with in a meagre and halfhearted way.  They went further and said: &ldquo;Why not be allowed, in addition, the same expenses as were allowed to members of Consultative Councils?&rdquo;<Col N="582" /> I think you will find, already, that members of Consultative Councils are allowed travelling expenses, and subsistence allowance, and some amount to repay for the loss of their time in attending these councils.  The members attending the county councils suffer from a similar disability.  They pay their railway fare.  That part of their expenses from their residence to the place of meeting is to be repaid, but the subsistence allowance is not provided for, nor is there an equivalent for the loss of time in their own business. This is an inconsistency they find fault with.  They are doing public business the same as the consultative committees.  They are doing the work of the public.  The principle is held so far as the members of consultative or selection boards and departmental committees are concerned they should not be at any personal loss for doing the business they are called upon to do. They are unable to understand why that principle is departed from in their case.  They are doing not only committee work but administrative work of a very important character.  I have been asked to submit this amendment in the hope that the Minister may be brought to accept it.</P>

      <P>The provisions in this section for the payment of expenses are not very liberal.  I am prepared to admit that.  Yet they are something novel.  Heretofore those members of local authorities received no out-of-pocket expenses of any kind, and this is a considerable step forward.  It is much easier to increase that sum as we go along than to take from it.  It is much better to begin quietly, and not to go too far in the beginning.  There is a great difference between members attending the Oireachtas or members attending a Consultative Council, and members attending the local council. The latter are within a few hours' journey of the place of meeting.  They rarely stay there longer than one day, and there is no reason why they should get subsistence allowance. As a general rule they are able to fit in meetings of their council with business of their own.  As a general rule these meetings are held on market <Col N="583" /> days and every possible attempt is made to facilitate members in that way. I think it is a very big thing to get the principle accepted to pay those members at all.  If we go too far now the whole principle may collapse.  I think it is better to adopt the motto, &ldquo;Hasten slowly,&rdquo; in this matter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment will enable county councils to arrange with urban district councils or county boroughs for the use of their libraries for the benefit of the rural districts.  I do not think that there is any such power in the Bill.  In Kilkenny there is a library in the city, and I think it would be desirable that the benefits of that library should be extended to the surrounding rural areas.  The county council could give a direction in that connection, and if the <Col N="585" /> library facilities were extended, the people would benefit very much.  Perhaps the County Waterford might be in the same position, and in that connection Senator Kenny might have some remarks to make.  I am sure it would be very desirable indeed if the people of the rural districts could take advantage of a library in Waterford by arrangement with the county council.</P>

      <P>After Section 60 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>61.  It shall be lawful for the Minister <Col N="587" /> in such cases as he may think fit to grant to any new buildings erected on old disused sites or to any existing factories or warehouses which owing to their dangerous condition are in need of repair, immunity from re-valuation for a period of five years after the erection or rebuilding has been completed.</P>
    <P>The effect of this new section would be to reduce the number of sites that are vacant in many parts of the country and it will encourage building.  We all admit that it is something of a shame to see the sites in O'Connell Street remaining vacant.  No effort is being made to rebuild there.  In rural areas there are many sites in a somewhat similar condition and it would be very desirable indeed if building could be encouraged.  I believe the effect of this amendment would be to encourage builders to proceed with the erection of houses.  We have a precedent for this in the Housing Act, where there is a provision giving relief in the matter of rates over a period of twenty years.  In the Westminster Parliament they inserted a clause somewhat similar to mine in the Dublin Reconstruction (Emergency Powers) Act, and it extended over a period of twelve years. I think everything possible should be done to encourage building.  What I suggest in this connection might also apply to factories in want of repair. Quite a number of people are at present adverse to spending money on repairs. If, however, they were aware that they would be relieved of rates for some years, they might be induced to proceed with any necessary work.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Rourke is misinterpreting the Dublin Reconstruction Act, I think.  The Act of 1916, or even any later Act, does not do what he says it does.  It gives power to the effect that the valuation shall not be increased for twelve years.  It is quite a different thing in the matter of rates. The position is that if the premises were rebuilt they would not be revalued at a higher valuation for a specified number of years.</P>

      <P>As one who had something to do with the Act of 1916, I would like to point out what actually happened.  That Act was, naturally, opposed by the residents of the street, because we wanted a better type of building than the old building and we had to concede something.  One of the things we conceded was a total remission of the first year's rates after reconstruction, and a guarantee that for the subsequent eleven years the rating of the premises would not exceed the rating of the destroyed premises; that is, the valuation would not be affected. A good many members in the Council Chamber objected, but I thought it was a good bargain inasmuch as we were building up a huge reserve fund.  In a year or two all these premises will be revalued at possibly three times the existing valuation.</P>

      <P>I desire to support the amendment.  It would be a very good thing if this were adopted, and accepted by the Minister.  There are many discouragements nowadays to house-building, the Rent Restriction Act and the Town Tenants' agitation all largely preventing enterprising people from going into building on a large scale.  I am aware that in some parts of England and Wales building societies, that were originally started in a small way, have now grown to immense proportions.  This is all because an undertaking was given to those about to start building on a substantial scale that there would be no charge for rates whatever over a specified number of years.  If that policy were adopted in the twenty-six counties, a great change would take place in the building trade.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'DEA</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like also to support the amendment.  The primary reason why there is not so much building in progress is that every man who desires to build is terrified because of <Col N="589" /> the enormous cost.  We see where all the traders and others in O'Connell Street, though they have got their <i>ex gratia</i> grants, are not doing anything in the matter of building.  Reconstruction in that area is absolutely at a standstill.  They are faced not only with the cost of the building, a sum which will have to be borrowed from the bank, but they have to face a worse ordeal, and that is that the valuation is raised four or five times higher than it was at the time the building was destroyed.  I do not know anything that will have a better effect on the rebuilding of destroyed property than the putting of this amendment into force.  You probably, as a result of this amendment, will have the whole of the derelict sites of Dublin rebuilt in the near future and this will hasten the work.  These destroyed sites, remaining as they are, unbuilt, are an eyesore to the city, and are simply appalling.  These ruined buildings stare us in the face everywhere, even in the main thoroughfare.  I believe if the Minister agrees to this amendment that inside five years we will probably have the valuation of the property of the city raised by £500,000.  It will take a large sum at least to reconstruct these dilapidated buildings.  I do not know a better investment for the Government or better work they could do than to accept this amendment stopping the re-valuation of these sites for ten years or so.  Where new buildings are being erected, if the raising of the valuation were delayed for ten years or something like that, it would give a great impetus to work of reconstruction.  Suppose I go to rebuild any part of a factory to-day, it would not be a very elaborate one or a very big one that could be built at £10,000. I may not have the money.  Then I have to go to the bank to borrow it. The interest on that would be at least £600, that is, if the bank will lend me the money.  If the banks do not lend the money then the building cannot be erected at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My business is upset during the time of building, and it would be very difficult not only to find the money, but also to meet the extra new demands, three or four times the rates <Col N="590" /> and the taxes that were paid on the old premises.  To meet these demands immediately afterwards would be a charge that no business could afford. We want some encouragement to rebuild on these wretched sites, and it should be given at once.  I have great pleasure in supporting the amendment.</P>

I think it would be advisable if a time limit were put in; it might have the result of getting the work started during the present year. If the proposal be accepted I would suggest a time limit of twelve months; that unless the work was started within twelve months and completed within two years these concessions should not be granted.</P>

Supposing there was no valuation on record&mdash;I do not know whether that could be possible&mdash; on an old disused site, what is to be done?  There is a lot to be said for the spirit of this amendment, but I wonder how a manufacturer or trader would look upon a position like this.  He gets one of these ridiculously cheap old <Col N="591" /> sites, and he sets up as competitor beside another man who is paying higher rates, and he gets off for the first five years with a third or fourth of the rates that his competitor has to pay. How would the existing manufacturer or merchant look upon a proposal of this kind?  We have not only to consider those who are setting up in business, but those who are striving to exist.  I am not against the spirit of the amendment, but I would like to ask Senators to consider that point of view.  When is the five years to start, and who is to say when is the building completed?  I think some tightening up in the principle is called for.</P>

      <P>I think this is an unnecessary complication by limiting the new buildings to old sites.  In America, where growing towns are anxious to bring in business and anxious to increase their rateable capacity, the greatest help is given to prospective builders.  I think in Dublin, considering the name we have had for preventing any enterprise, through monstrous rates, that this should be worded to encourage the erecting of factories on any site within the Greater Dublin area, when it will be fixed, irrespective of whether they are old or disused.  It is high time something like this were done, and I would extend the period certainly.  In some of the American cities the limit is twenty years, as ten years would be too restricted. In answer to Senator O'Farrell's objection, it must be remembered that when a competitor comes in to erect a factory he is putting new business in the country, and the old factories, such as they are&mdash; and there are very few&mdash;are probably beyond any monetary consideration, because any concern that could sustain the rates in Dublin must be in a position that is practically unbreakable. This is a provision that should be very welcome in view of the volume of very desirable and very much wanted business that may ensue.</P>

I certainly think that anything that is an incentive to building, which will increase building at the moment, in view of the great shortage of houses, will be welcome.  Senator O'Farrell's objection is a very cogent one.  I think an argument against him would be the fact that a man starting business in competition with a rival whose business has been in existence for some years would be handicapped inasmuch as the rival business man has probably written off his initial debts, while the new man would have to face all the initial charges and would probably have a bank charge on his business.  I do not think the amendment will have the application that Senator O'Farrell fears.  I think it is very reasonable. If I were asked I think I should make it mandatory on the Minister, and I would certainly extend the period.  It is so mild that I think it should have the support of every Senator.</P>

      <P>The wording of the amendment seems to be very defective. This is not the first time that such a section has been introduced into an Act in this country.  Some three or four years ago when loans were given for the rebuilding of the destroyed areas in Sackville Street and somewhere else in the city there was a section giving relief from rates for a certain period from the rebuilding, a remission for a few years afterwards.  The present amendment is very defective in its wording.  I agree with Senator O'Farrell that the wording &ldquo;disused site&rdquo; is very defective, and I think also that &ldquo;existing factories&rdquo; and &ldquo;warehouses&rdquo; is a very defective way of describing these.  Disused sites might include sites in Sackville Street, which, although they are not occupied, are not in the real sense disused.  I would suggest that if the Minister is not now opposed to the amendment, he should leave the matter over for Report and that a section somewhat similar to the one I referred to should be brought in.</P>

I am naturally interested in encouraging building as much as possible <Col N="593" /> and interested in trying to advance building, whether by remission of rates or by stereotyping valuations, but of course the Minister for Finance has to consider it from an altogether different angle, as it involves property tax and the taxpayer generally.  At present our Department is in communication with the Minister on this whole matter and I am not in a position to give any definite statement as to how it stands at the moment.

It must be most disadvantageous to the business of the city that a site on which business might be carried on, and which, if built on, might relieve unemployment, is lying there disused.  I think the concession suggested by Senator Brown, that they should not be charged more than the old rate, would be a very fair compromise in the matter, one that probably the Minister for Finance would look favourably on.</P>

      <P>I beg to move:</P>
      <P>Section 61.  Before Section 61 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;61.&mdash;(1) It is hereby declared that the issue or intended issue of an advertisement inviting or affording opportunities of applications for appointment to a paid office under or in the gift of a local authority and appointing a time for election of a person being one of those so applying, casts upon every member of that local authority a duty of being free to exercise his judgment and discretion at the time of such election <Col N="595" /> by voting for such of the applicants as he shall then think fit, and that accordingly the giving by any member, or the soliciting by any person from any member, of any promise or undertaking to vote for any particular candidate or intended candidate at such election constitutes a breach of public duty on the part of such member or person (as the case may be).</P>
    <P>(2)  Any person who</P>
    <P>(i)  gives or solicits any such promise or undertaking as aforesaid; or</P>
    <P>(ii)  with a view to furthering the interests of any candidate for any such appointment as aforesaid, states that any one or more named members of the relevant local authority or any number of unnamed members of such local authority, have given promises to vote for such candidate at such appointment,</P>
    <P>shall, on summary conviction, be liable to a fine not exceeding five pounds for a first offence, and in the case of a second or subsequent offence shall be liable to a fine not exceeding twenty pounds, and shall, in addition, be disqualified for being a member of any local authority for a term of three years from the date of such second or subsequent conviction.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to make canvassing for paid posts illegal, that is, canvassing definite promises of support from members of public bodies.  I am quite conscious that that will not be an easy task.  I think we should set down as our opinion that the issuing of advertisements seeking applications for paid posts casts upon every member of a public body the duty of keeping himself free to vote for the person whom he considers the best candidate.  Anybody who has any experience of public bodies knows very well that it is the forced promise that is the bane of fair play.  I quite realise that you cannot prevent an applicant <Col N="596" /> from coming to a member, stating that he is a candidate, and what his qualifications are.  There is no objection to that, but there is an objection to the candidate or his supporters trying to extort promises from the members of a public body.  That is being carried on to a terrible extent in many districts in which otherwise administration is clean, and the members, as a whole, are anxious to do their duty.  This eternal canvassing by relatives and friends is a terrible difficulty for members who are anxious to do the right thing to get over, and I know most members of local authorities will welcome legislation to save them from this kind of trouble. That is one aspect&mdash;extracting a definite promise which, I think, should be set down as illegal.  The other is spreading a report that members of a public body are pledged to support a particular candidate.  Many members of the Seanad are members of public bodies, and they know that it does a great deal of harm, and that it is very unfair against other candidates.  The supporters of a candidate who are active and energetic, spread a report that their friend is promised the support of three-fourths of the members of a body.  Probably these members would have given no promise at all. That acts in an unfair way against other candidates.  I submit to the members of the Seanad, many of whom are members of public bodies, that it is necessary to do something to secure liberty for other people who are going up for election.</P>

      <P>We heard a good deal about the difficulty of making political resolutions ineffective.  I am afraid that anybody who fails to do that will find it far more difficult to effect the purpose of the mover of this amendment.  I suffered, as I have no doubt he did, by canvassing, and I finally adopted a method that relieved me.  I put every candidate through an informal examination.  I had a regular number of questions.  One was columns of figures, and I timed the candidate for a clerical position in adding them up, and examined them as to their correctness, and in a very short time I <Col N="597" /> had no more importunate suitors.  I think that is the only way of doing it. Intelligence tests are now very much the fashion with psychological experts, and by adopting this system a member of a public body can free himself from any importunate suitors.</P>

      <P>I think that if this amendment were carried it would be impossible to carry it out.  Anybody who has experience of public boards knows that it is impossible to carry out a regulation like this.  But the obvious remedy for canvassing is to set up an Irish Civil Service, so that competitive examinations would be held for any of these posts.  Not only for these clerical and administrative posts, but in the selection of competent artisans competitive examinations should be held, and the persons with the best qualifications should get the position without any resort to canvassing.  From my experience I say that if you pass this and put it into forty Acts of Parliament it will have no effect.  We might as well face the facts, and these are the facts.  I think if we could set our minds to devise ways and means whereby these posts should be filled after a competitive examination and that the candidate who has the best qualifications would get the job it would be better.</P>

      <P>I do not want to increase the loss of time over an impracticable amendment like this, but I would like to say a word about the man who is canvassed.  I never realised my public importance until I was approached by certain candidates, and it fills a man with a certain sense of civic spirit which he would otherwise not have.  Then it gives you a lively feeling that there is the highest sense of political virtue in the men who are canvassed.  If these things were removed, if the publicity were taken <Col N="598" /> away from the exalted heights of civic efficiency there would be a general falling off in the standard of the men seeking election without examination. Of course this thing is perfectly impracticable, and, therefore, I think the least we say about it the better.  It is one of the few things that are left us that cannot be legislated for.  If they were we would find ourselves in the arid regions of Plato's Republic or More's Utopia&mdash;undesirable places.</P>

      <P>Unless my memory fails me I think there is some regulation as to canvassing votes, and my recollection of it is that any man who could have been proved to have promised his vote was disqualified from voting in an election.  Senators who are members of councils can say if that is the case or not.  It is not so much that a man should not obtain support by canvassing, no matter what the regulations may be against it, but very often a candidate goes around and unblushingly tells you that Mr. So-and-So and Mr. So-and-So have promised him their votes.  I think the fact that he would be running these friends of his into the risk of paying a fine of £5 each might check that to a certain extent.</P>

All they have to do is simply to state in their advertisement that any candidate proved to have solicited or canvassed for votes shall be, <i>ipso facto</i>, disqualified.  That is in the hands of every county council and every public body.  As a matter of fact, I may say that for some years past in the great English Civil Service it has been an inflexible rule that outside influence brought to bear for an appointment is a disqualification.</P>

That has always been acted upon since, and the consequence is that they have had practically no new appointments; they have been filled by promotion.  I once <Col N="600" /> held a competitive examination for a pensions clerk and I was so harassed by the Local Government Board and by everybody else that they would not give me pen, ink or paper, and I had to bear all the expenses of the examination myself.

Originally I intended to have some provision in this Bill whereby all persons appointed to positions under local authorities would have to pass through something like the Civil Service Commission&mdash;local selection boards&mdash;and where appointments would be by public examination, or examination of some kind.  When we went into the matter, and after we had put the provision into some kind of draft shape, we found it ran to a very considerable size.  I referred to the same matter when we were discussing the county medical officer, and I found that it would be necessary to have a separate Bill dealing with this whole matter.  It is quite a big business, and I do not think we would be able to deal with it thoroughly on the Report Stage.  However, we may be able to deal with some specific phases of it, but there is a Bill actually in draft form at the moment. It has not yet passed Finance and the Executive Council.</P>

In fact, in some parts of the country this amounts to a public scandal.  It is one of the causes of the uneasiness and insecurity which prevents the country from making that progress towards stability that we would desire. One of the most damaging effects on the morale of the ordinary people and one that tends to destroy the sense of civic spirit is to see officials occupying prominent positions in the State who are at the same time spouting treason and spreading insidious propaganda against the State.  I suggest it is time that some effort was made to curb the activities of these officials and to make them realise that they cannot have it both ways, that they cannot draw salaries from the State and at the same time try to upset it.</P>

If at the time a man seeks an appointment he has it in his mind or in his heart to undermine the interests of his employer or to act in a spirit counter to them, it is most dishonourable and dishonest.  Even if he had not these intentions at the time of seeking this employment, if afterwards he allows himself to be suborned, and acts in a spirit hostile to his employer, and particularly in such a grave matter as undermining the foundations upon which the State or the Government rests, it is more serious still, and his honest and honourable duty would be, if his convictions or point of view changed, to resign his office and seek employment elsewhere.</P>

      <P>I am inclined to agree with Senator Colonel Moore.  The British tried this method of imposing oaths of allegiance and everyone will agree that they were a hopeless failure. We have condemned the exacting in Northern Ireland of an oath from people holding public offices.  These are not Government positions in the strict sense of the word at all.  An oath taken under duress is of very little value, and many a man in order to keep his family will take the oath under duress, but it is not going to bind his conscience afterwards.  I do not think people should be put up against a position of that kind.  If we are not able to induce allegiance to the State by voluntary <Col N="606" /> methods, we are not going to do it by the imposition of an oath.  I think we are virtually passing a vote of no confidence in the stability of the State and its continued existence by proposing an amendment of this kind.

      <P>It is not so much the imposition of the oath that counts as the putting an end to the position of the hero who wants to have it both ways and the effect the taking of the oath will have on his heroics in various parts of the country.  There are, to my own knowledge, one or two men drawing salaries from the Government who parade themselves in the West of Ireland as people looking for a Republic and doing this as a sort of afterthought. At the same time they are receiving their salaries.  If the finger that points at oath-takers can also point at them it will be impossible for them to keep up this deception.  There are certain persons who make a great to-do about this matter, as if the oath taken now were not for the benefit of the people of the country.</P>
      <P>It is no longer a parallel to speak of the imposition of an oath on that section of people in the North who do not regard themselves as permanently within its borders.  This oath taken by the officials employed by the Free State that they will be loyal to the Free State will prevent their undermining the Free State and inflicting injury on everyone in it.  That effect we will get by making it incumbent on every official or employee to take an oath to give good service and not to promote insecurity.  I am not at all anxious that anyone should take an oath against his will.  It is not so much for the sake of the oath as for defining the position of the man employed by the State, who is against the State, that I support Senator McLoughlin.  If a man parades as a Republican from any form of confused mentality&mdash;arising, perhaps, from the intermediate system &mdash;if he parades as one who tries to injure the hand that feeds him, the hypocrisy will be apparent, because it will be in the region of dishonesty.</P>

      <P>I am strongly in favour of this amendment, and I think Senator Gogarty has put his finger on the right spot when he says it is not so much aimed at the political views of these people as against their dishonesty.  There are a number of people parading in the country as being opponents of the Government and of the system of local authority operating under the Government, and yet they are drawing money which they could not draw but for the fact that the Government is functioning. This will make them come forward and state whether they are in favour of existing conditions or not.  They may take the oath and say they take it under duress, but if they do they can only masquerade as a very poor type of hero.  A man who masquerades as a hero and is afraid to give up his position in order to support his opinion is not going to get much support.  I am placed in a difficult position as Minister for Local Government in sanctioning the appointments of men who all along are trying to obstruct the work of the Government.  Take the instance of a county surveyor who happens to be opposed to the present Government. When grants are given, complaints are made to me that the grants are being frittered away and that the county surveyor is not trying to get the best results out of the money granted.  I am not in a position to take action against that individual.  The same thing applies to rate collectors and others.  This will define clearly the position of these people.  If they accept a post under the Government and take this oath, they cannot masquerade as great heroes, and that will be to the advantage of the general public.</P>

      <P>This declaration is to apply to persons about to be appointed, or a person about to receive some increase of salary, or something else like that.  That is not going to meet the case at all.  It is only dealing with some people who may be going into the service or who, already in the service, are entitled to some emolument or promotion.  I do not believe in those declarations, and I suggest that what is needed in this country more than anything else is a little <Col N="608" /> Christian charity.  I think the time has arrived when instead of aggravating the position, we should try to heal the sore, and I say that if you pass this, you will have more trouble.  A similar attempt to this was made by the British Government when they were in occupation, and we know the effect of it was that a few men refused to take the oath, but the great bulk of the civil servants took the oath, even though they did not believe in it.  A few men did not take the oath, because their conscience would not allow them, but they were very few, and you could count them on the fingers of your hands.</P>
      <P>I read last week in connection with the Northern Government that a Catholic chaplain of some hospital, because he refused to make a declaration which was against his conscience, was refused the salary he was entitled to. Somebody says, &ldquo;Quite right.&rdquo;  I say, &ldquo;Quite wrong.&rdquo;  You employ a person to do certain work.  You do not employ him because of his particular brand of politics.  You employ him because of his efficiency in carrying out certain work, and not because he is prepared to take certain oaths.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied, from my experience, that the people who take the oath would not be half as good servants as the people who would not take the oath, and I think that at this time of day there is no use in adding more fuel to the fire.  We have had sufficient trouble in this country without coming along and taking a man's bread and butter from him because he differs politically with us.</P>

It simply declares: &ldquo;I ... do hereby solemnly and sincerely declare that I will bear allegiance to the Irish Free State and its constitution as by law established.&rdquo;  Surely, he does not suggest&mdash;and I hope nobody will suggest&mdash;that a man who will not sign that declaration should continue to receive money from the State or from a local body.  It is very sad that it should be necessary, but I am afraid from what we have heard of the state of affairs in some parts of Ireland, <Col N="609" /> that it is necessary.  It is a blot on the Bill for the reason that it must refer to a transitory state of things, but it is necessary in order to prevent various officials from receiving pay and boasting of their disloyalty.</P>

Where a man has done his work very efficiently, he is entitled to an increase.  But if the man is plotting against the interests of the State, surely he is not entitled to an increase.

As one great man said, &ldquo;No man can put a boundary to the march of a nation.&rdquo;  Consequently, I think the introduction of an amendment on those lines is most reactionary.</P>
      <P>The Minister made a great case in connection with a county surveyor who differs with the present Government. He may be a competent county surveyor, but he may not agree with things as they are.  I hope the majority will never agree with things as they are, and that they will always look ahead. If a man does not agree with the present condition of things, he is to be branded as an outlaw and denied the emoluments which may be allotted to him by the council in authority over him.</P>

I know those oaths have been unsatisfactory and of no use.  Probably the first pledge taken in this country was taken about seventy years ago.  At a meeting of Irish Members of Parliament they pledged themselves to certain things we need not go into now.  One Member said he did not believe in pledges and that they were generally broken. It happened just one year after that he was able to get up and say that the pledge was broken by all except himself.  He was the only man who kept the pledge.  We are here to make friends with all people and not to make ourselves objectionable to them by forcing our opinions down their throats.  The effect of this oath will be the throwing out of honest men and the putting in of dishonest ones.  Dishonest men will take oaths of any kind, but honest men will not take them and are left out.</P>

    <P>The great objection against this declaration is that the British insisted on it and that Northern Ireland insisted on it.  The circumstances are quite different.  This country repudiated British rule.  The Parliament of Northern Ireland is a body which repudiates the idea of an Irish nation. It is an exotic creation, for the establishment <Col N="611" /> of which not a single Irish Member voted, and therefore not a single Irishman owes it allegiance. But it is quite a different proposition when the Free State is the creation of the majority will of the Irish people. In asking these officials to take an oath of allegiance to the Free State, we are only asking them to take an oath to the sovereign authority of the Irish people.</P>

      <P>Section 62, sub-section (5).  In line 40 to delete the words &ldquo;three years&rdquo; and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;one year.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of the amendment is, in the event of the Minister having to exercise his powers for the purpose of dissolving a local body, that within a period of one year an election shall be held for the purpose of electing the local authority.  I think that is a reasonable amendment.  Under the Bill at present if the Minister dissolves a local authority the people are disfranchised for three years, and the duties of the public authority will be carried out by some person appointed by the Minister.  For three years the people who are paying the piper are <Col N="613" /> deprived of the privilege of calling the tune.  In other words, the people of a local area are deprived for three years of deciding who should conduct their local affairs.  That is a reasonable amendment, and ought to be accepted by the Government, unless they have made up their minds that the people are not fitted for self-government.  The amendment provides that within one year an election shall be held.  If the members of a local board have not carried out their duties properly the people who are paying the rates will get an opportunity of electing other people to carry out their duty.  Unless you are going to set up an autocracy, so that the people of the country shall not have any say in local affairs, this amendment ought to be accepted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BARRINGTON</NameTxt>
      <P>I have an amendment down which I think is of a more democratic and popular character than this.  I propose that before the Minister holds the new election he has to take a plebiscite of the electors as to whether they would prefer the continuance of the administration of their district by Commissioners or have a new election held.  Democratic government has been defined as government in accordance with the wishes of the people, and I do not see any possibility of ascertaining the wishes of the people as to what form of government they wish except by taking a referendum.  I am sure every democrat here is going to support the principle I suggest.  I should not be surprised if the results would occasionally surprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember many years ago, a public body in Cork was suppressed by the Local Government Board and Commissioners appointed to carry out their duties.  Every local body immediately held meetings to denounce the suppression of this body. At the end of twelve months it was found that the Commissioners had effected a very large saving&mdash;something like £60,000 or £70,000.  They had put the affairs of the local authority in order.  All the local bodies met again and passed resolutions congratulating the Commissioners.  When the term of the Commissioners expired, <Col N="614" /> the local bodies came together and they passed a resolution asking the Local Government Board to continue the Commissioners and the L.G.B. had to tell them that they had not the power.  I do not want our present Minister to be in that position. If the local people desire a continuance of government by Commissioners, I want the Minister to be in a position to continue them and not have to say that he had no power.</P>

      <P>There are other ways by which the public can make their opinion felt.  There is the Dáil, and the Seanad and the public Press. It is strange how sensitive Governments become to currents of public opinion if they have any volume.  The Corporations of Dublin and Cork have been suppressed.  Speaking as a Corkman, and knowing something about the matter, I am certain that the suppression of the Cork Corporation was responsible for winning the pending election for the Government at that time.  There was a tremendous amount of inflation&mdash;if I might use the word in this connection&mdash;in order to create some sort of bogus indignation with regard to the suppression of these Corporations.  I never remember anything falling so flat.  Those agitations fell flat because the public fully appreciated that the suppression of these Corporations was belated rather than premature.  Everybody who was not quite blind recognised that they were inefficient and in many cases corrupt.  The Government suppressed these bodies after public inquiry.  If there is any volume of opinion in favour of an election, this section gives the Minister power to hold it.  I ask the Seanad not to tie his hands by compelling him to do that within twelve months, if the task of the Commissioner is not completed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>I have an amendment, something on the lines of that proposed by Senator Farren.  That is an amendment of the General Council of County Councils.  The attitude of that council with regard to the suppression of local bodies is that they are affected in their personnel.  Each county council dissolved automatically wipes out two or three representatives of the General Council.  That is one aspect of the matter.  They are losing their representative capacity.  To that extent certain counties are not represented on the General Council now.</P>
      <P>With regard to the general principle of suppression and the power that the Minister has to dissolve, it is a moot point as to whether the business of local bodies could not be better conducted by thoroughly competent administrators. It is a moot point whether, if a plebiscite were taken in Dublin, it would result in showing there was a keen desire to revert again to a Corporation.  That is a matter that has to be tested and tried.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the broad question of the right of the Minister to dissolve public bodies after inquiry, if he wishes to pursue that policy, which is such a radical change from all that has gone before, I would say that he has not sufficient mandate&mdash;that the people should have some voice in that.  If the people were asked, in view of their experience of councils already dissolved, and the benefits accruing to the ratepayers through these dissolutions&mdash;at least on paper&mdash;I do not say that the people might not say that is the correct course to pursue.  Then it comes to the point whether the people should not have some voice in the appointment of the Commissioners who are to control their affairs, whether a panel should not be set up, say of thirty&mdash; like the Burgomasters in Germany&mdash; and from that panel the Minister should select his men.  There would be a certain qualification for men wishing to get on the panel.  They should be men of a very high standard of administrative and other ability.  These men should be elected by the nation. Then you would have the nation as a whole having a voice in local administration, and you would have the most able and most highly qualified men to <Col N="616" /> take up the administration of these councils.</P>

My amendment is at the next election for local bodies that the suppressed bodies shall go in with the others, and that there shall be an election all round.  These elections will be held within a year, and that would dispose of my amendment.  At the same time I think as the question has been raised we had better know where we are in this matter.  I see a way out of it.  The people as a whole would possibly support it, for they would still have a voice, though not in the same detailed way as at present, in electing the members of County Councils and Corporations.  In that sense I support the amendment.</P>

      <P>I do not think this is an appropriate occasion to discuss the relative merits of popularly-elected local authorities and those appointed by the central authority.  The whole principle is one that wants to be challenged, but that need not be gone into now.  This amendment has a distinctly practical bearing, which I suggest the House should decide.  The Minister is not going to dissolve a local body except its affairs have got into a bad way, that rates have got considerably into arrears, and considerable confusion has thereby resulted.  It is quite out of the question to expect any body of administrators to clear up a mess like that in one year.  Anybody who has an elementary knowledge of administration must know that.  It is hard to fix the period required, but I would say that a year is not sufficient. For that reason alone I suggest the amendment should be defeated.</P>

      <P>I am not able to support Senator Farren's amendment. I think with Sir John Keane, that a longer term should be allowed to the Commissioners.  The question is an important one, especially as regards those districts where the Corporations have <Col N="617" /> ceased to exist, and the Commissioners have been installed.  I entirely agree with Senator Dowdall that there is an immense amount of satisfaction in Cork and the neighbourhood because of the fact that the Commissioner is functioning there to the satisfaction of the vast majority of the people, including most of the members of the Corporation itself.  Many of those gentlemen who were relieved of the onerous duties that were placed on them were capable public men, and endeavoured conscientiously to carry out their duties.  Owing largely to the state of affairs in the country during the last few years, and also because the triennial elections had not taken place, things got into a state that would not have otherwise happened.  With regard to Senator Barrington's amendment, may I allude to the question of referendum?</P>

      <P>With reference to some of the statements made here by Senator Barrington regarding a referendum, I wonder would he be prepared to submit to a referendum the right of the Minister to dissolve these councils.  Senator Sir John Keane says this whole question ought to be raised.  I am not opposed to a change in the method of local administration. <Col N="618" /> If it means greater efficiency I am in favour of it.  What I am opposed to is allowing any individual to set himself up as a dictator, and saying: &ldquo;I am the only pure person in this country. There are none of the local authorities in this country pure enough to carry on the work for which they were elected, if I say so.&rdquo;  It has been said that inquiries were held, but the least said about these inquiries the better.  If I wanted to, I could talk about some inquiries, or some people appointed Commissioners, and could make some people ashamed.  It was not because of their qualifications for carrying out their duties they were appointed in some cases.  Now the people have a right to be consulted on this question as to whether or not the people should elect representatives to manage their affairs.  That is the fundamental issue involved in this.  I do not think that we should light-heartedly give power to anybody to say the people have no right in the spending of the rates that they have contributed.  Make no mistake about it, some people might be prepared to advocate the non-payment of rates if they are to have no say in the manner in which the rates should be spent. That is not beyond the bounds of possibility, and these people would be quite justified in doing so.  Senator Sir John Keane spoke about getting into arrears, but in Dublin they were not in arrears.  They had a record collection.  Ninety-eight per cent. was the collection in Dublin during the past five or six years, and that record, considering what Dublin has gone through in the past few years, is splendid and one that any city could be proud of.  I think Senator Mrs. Wyse Power will agree with that.  The rates were paid, and it was not because the rates in Dublin were in arrears that the Corporation was suppressed. If the people in Dublin were paying rates that was proof positive that they were satisfied.  Senators may say &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; but the people have not got an opportunity of expressing their opinion on this matter.  Senator Dowdall told us that the Government candidate in Cork won because the Corporation was suppressed. <Col N="619" /> I might just as well use the contrary argument, and say that the Government lost the last election in Dublin because the Corporation was suppressed.  You cannot have it both ways.  The fundamental question is, should the people who pay the rates have nothing to say in deciding the manner in which the money should be spent.  The appointment of local managers may be a success. <Col N="620" /> If I were satisfied that another system is better I would support it.  I do not hold any mandate for public boards.  It is not because I was a member of a suppressed board I am speaking as I am on this fundamental question, but I am thinking that the Oireachtas will be making a sad mistake in taking away the rights of the people.</P>
