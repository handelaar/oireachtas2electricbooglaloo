      <P>The first matter on the Orders of the Day is the consideration of the Coroners Bill, 1925, in its Second Stage.  I should say that this Bill appears irregularly on the Orders of the Day because, under our Standing Orders, it is necessary in the case of a Bill of this kind that notice of motion should be served for the Second Stage.  No notice of motion has in fact been served, but as this is our first experience, I think, of putting a Bill through this house, I am sure the House will waive the matter in consideration of its being a novel experiment, and allow Senator de Loughrey to move the Second Stage.  Senators will recollect, though, for the future, that when a Bill introduced here reaches the Second Stage the Senator promoting the Bill should serve notice of motion that he will move the Second Reading.</P>

      <P>Briefly, I may say that the object of the Bill is to secure that inquests will be held in any case where death is due to something other than common illness.  In my opinion, inquests ought to be held in <Col N="146" /> any case where a public inquiry might lead to the prevention of the recurrence of such a death.  Within recent times it has become quite noticeable&mdash;I do not say in all districts, but certainly in many districts,&mdash;that coroners have become very lax, and it has almost become the rule to hold no inquests except in cases where there is a suspicion of foul play.  To my mind, inquests should serve a greater purpose than that.  One of the main objects, I think, should be to prevent deaths from accidents or violence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister stated in the Dáil that the law as at present constituted dealt with such cases.  That may be, but it certainly is not sufficiently explicit to put the obligation on coroners because, without making any inquiries except in one case, the case of a tramp found dead on the roadside, which was reported in a paper of another county as happening in Kilkenny, the facts have come accidentally under my notice that in five different districts there have been cases of death where inquests should have been held but where they were not held.  The following were the causes of death in these cases as reported:&mdash;Suicide, found drowned, street motor fatality, railway servant killed on line, burnt to death in own house, found dead in lime-kiln, death in hospital from threshing machine accident, and vagrant found dead on roadside.  I have not made any inquiries at all, but these cases have come under my notice.  They were not confined to any one area but were spread over five districts.  One case was over the border, but I do not think that makes any difference.  An amendment of mine, inserted in the Local Government Bill, was rejected by the Dáil. While that amendment was being debated here the unusual incident happened of a stranger in the Gallery sending me a note stating that to his own knowledge, in his locality, recently two deaths had occurred, one found drowned and another found hanged, and that at the request of the relatives no inquest was held.  I think it is most objectionable if relatives can prevent inquests from being held.  It is possible that relatives may contribute in some way to suicides, and it <Col N="147" /> is not inconceivable that a case of murder, camouflaged by relatives to look like suicide, might occur.</P>
    <P>I want to secure that coroners will do their duties.  I believe, from what was said on my amendment to the Local Government Bill, that I will have the support of the Seanad in this Bill. I think there was fairly unanimous approval of the amendment, but it was pointed out that as the Minister objected to its insertion in the Local Government Bill, a Private Bill embodying it would be better.  Therefore I am trying that experiment, and I ask the Seanad to pass the motion in the interests of the safety of human life.  The case of the vagrant found dead on the roadside, I hold, was one for an inquest as to whether his death was due to malnutrition or exposure. It was extraordinary that no inquest was held in the case of the railway servant found dead on the line.  If I were to go to the trouble I could obtain a very long list of instances similar to those I have mentioned, but I have merely referred to these cases to impress on Senators the absolute necessity of having the law made clear and distinct.  I move the Second Reading of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKenny" hpid="Mr. KENNY Mr. KENNY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion. The object of the Bill is to define more clearly what, in the view of the promoter, is the obvious duty of a coroner.  It is stated in page 2 of the accompanying memorandum that was circulated to Senators, that in 1884 it was judicially laid down that an inquest should be held by a coroner in respect of every case of death in his district in which there is any reasonable suspicion that there may have been something peculiar in the death, that is, that it may have been due to other causes than common illness. The promoter of the Bill wishes simply to have these words inserted in it as defining the duty of the coroner rather than, as at present, a general instruction of the duty to hold an inquest in the case of a sudden death of which the cause is unknown.  I think that the Bill is very necessary in view of the laxity of certain coroners, at least throughout the Free State area, <Col N="148" /> instances of which have been cited, and by way of bringing them to a clearer conception of their duties and what the public expect from them, I think that this Bill is very desirable. As a result of these inquests certain matters may come to light which would be of very great benefit to the general public.  The evidence at an inquiry of this kind is published, and, as in the case of a death which was found to result from anthrax, the cause was traced to infection in shaving brushes imported from the East.  Without that inquest that fact might not have been known; these brushes would have continued to be imported; the public would continue to buy them, and many more deaths might have resulted.  That is only an incidental case, an instance that has cropped up in the holding of inquests.  Possibly that inquest would not have been held if the coroner there had a lax idea of his duty, and it is, as far as possible, to prevent laxity that this Bill has been introduced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="MINISTER for JUSTICE (Mr. O'Higgins) Kevin O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for JUSTICE (Mr. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection to the principle of this Bill.  My objection to the Bill is that it really leaves the situation very much as it finds it.  The operative section, Section 1, declares that &ldquo;For the removing of doubts it is hereby declared that it is the duty of the coroner to hold an inquest in respect of every death occurring or on a dead body lying within his district reported to him or otherwise coming to his knowledge in respect of which there is any reasonable suspicion that the death may have been due to causes other than common illness.&rdquo;  I do not know whether there is in fact any doubt but that that is the duty of a coroner, and anything that has been said in support of the Bill is simply in the direction of a statement that certain coroners are not doing their duty.  But the legal position would be unchanged by the Bill.  The fact is that a coroner is supposed to hold an inquest in the case of any death which he believes to be, or which he believes might have been due to causes other than natural causes.  That is the position now; it would remain the position if this Bill is passed, and as to the point that coroners are not holding inquests <Col N="149" /> in cases where they ought to hold inquests, that is something that could be dealt with and could be remedied. Coroners have no absolute tenure of their office, and if it is brought to my notice that a particular coroner is failing to hold inquests in cases where inquests ought undoubtedly to be held it could be dealt with, and it would be one of the functions of public representatives to bring such things to my notice.</P>
      <P>In fact, neither from a public representative nor from any public body, have I got any representations of the kind.  This Bill states that: &ldquo;It will be the duty of the coroner to hold an inquest in the case of a death in respect of which there is any reasonable suspicion that the death may have been due to causes other than common illness.&rdquo; One might ask&mdash;a suspicion in whose mind?  In the mind of the coroner?  The coroner, I take it, would declare that he always held inquests in the case of any death in which he had a suspicion, so that if the Bill were to go through it would need to be quite clear as to who was to have this suspicion which would constitute a cause for an inquest.  I would undertake, if the Senator did not press the Bill, to circularise coroners on the matter, say that a Bill had been introduced here in these terms and that cases were cited in support of it by a Senator rather pointing to the fact that inquests were not always held in cases in which it would be in the public interest that they should be held, and generally draw the attention of coroners very definitely to their duty in the matter.  My sole objection to the Bill is this, that it does not alter the legal position in the slightest; it contributes nothing, changes nothing.  The position the day after it was passed would be exactly the position the day before it was passed, and I do not think Bills like that ought to be introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One might as well pass a Bill stating that for the removal of doubts it was the duty of the District Justices to carry out their jurisdiction under the Courts of Justice Act.  That is not a thing there is any doubt about, and there must be a remedy, and there is a remedy in the case of public officers <Col N="150" /> failing to carry out their duty.  There is a remedy in the case of coroners, and if a concrete case is brought under notice it can be taken up and dealt with.  I want to stress this, that in the last three years no case has been brought under my notice, either by a public person or by a public body, of a coroner failing to hold an inquest in a case in which it would be in the public interest to have an inquest held.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. BROWN Mr. BROWN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BROWN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that we should pass the Second Reading of the Bill.  It is quite true, as the Minister has pointed out, that the Bill, as it stands, is really of no practical use.  That is, that it is merely declaratory of the coroner's duty, and if it were finally passed in its present form it would be of no real, practical good.  I think the best course to adopt is that the Bill should get a Second Reading, and that we should then refer it to a Special Committee to consider whether it could not be made more effective by the addition of amendments.  It is quite clear from the facts that we have heard, that there are instances in which inquests should be held and are not held. It is very difficult to make a coroner amenable in cases of that kind.  I think there should be a provision in a Bill of this kind making it the duty of the medical man who attends a person who dies of something other than common illness, or a medical man who holds a post-mortem examination, or who is called in where a dead body is found, to report to the coroner that it is a case in which death is not due to common illness, and that he considers that an inquest should be held.  At any rate, the question is one of sufficient importance.  Though the Bill in its present form may be of little practical use, at the same time it could be made one of practical use, and for that reason, if the Seanad would pass the Second Reading, I would move that it be referred to a Special Committee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I happen to know something of this matter.  My late father was a coroner, and I know that in the form of wire which arrived announcing a death, there was invariably a formula at the end, stating that the police either had or had not a suspicion of foul play.  Generally, the telegram set out other circumstances as, for instance, whether the deceased had been attended for any period by a doctor, and if so, what the doctor's opinion was.  It does not invariably follow that in every case of sudden death there should be an inquest, because very often you find that whereas a person had died suddenly, he had been under the care of a doctor, and the doctor's opinion was that that was something that was liable to happen from the nature of his disease.  While I do not contest that some of the instances which Senator de Loughrey has advanced may be sound and valid, one has to remember that sudden death is not in itself a sufficient cause for an inquest.  If the person had been attended by a doctor, and if his medical adviser was not surprised that death should have come about in that way an inquest would be unnecessary. If Senator Brown's suggestion of passing the Second Reading and referring the Bill to a Special Committee is adopted, I would be glad if some opportunity could be given to my Department of putting its views before that Committee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the suggestion made by Senator Brown.  I was going to make a similar suggestion to that just made by the Minister, that the Special Committee should have some assistance from his Department.  If we appoint a Special Committee to consider this Bill there is no reason why this Committee should have to report at an early date.  They can take their time.  It is quite clear that this is a matter which should be investigated.  The principle we have already agreed to when discussing an amendment to a previous Bill.  We are <Col N="152" /> all agreed that the wording of the Bill is not satisfactory, and most of us agree that, as it stands now, it would not achieve any useful purpose.  At the same time there may be many matters regarding the duties of coroners which might find a useful place in this Bill, and if we referred the Bill to this Special Committee, as we can do under our Standing Orders, with no date as to when it should report, it could obtain at its leisure such evidence and such information as the members of the Committee would require. The Minister, or someone from his Department, could attend and give assistance to the Committee.  When we receive their report we would know whether it was better to proceed with the Bill or to have, as the Minister suggests, a circular sent out from his Department.  There is one matter in which I would disagree with the Minister. He said that Bills of this kind should not be introduced.  My view is quite different.  Members of the Seanad cannot get expert legal advice in the drafting of Bills, but I think it is very much better that when members feel that there is something which can be remedied by legislation, if they wish they can bring in a Bill, take it to the Second Stage, and, if the principle is adopted, that expert assistance should be given in the drafting of it. I do not think, though the Minister may disagree with me, that he should discourage individual members from bringing in a Bill of that kind.  I should like to encourage it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make a correction and an explanation on that point.  I had to point out that the Bill would not change the legal position, and I think that is accurate. If I said that Bills of this kind should not be introduced, that is not quite what I meant.  What I meant was that if the Bill contributes nothing, if it changes nothing, it should not be passed as it stands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir T. ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that there is a danger that in a Bill of this sort we might go further than the promoters of the Bill really intended. I do not suppose that any member of the House desires that there <Col N="153" /> should be unnecessary inquests.  We do not want to have an inquest held where there is no real necessity for it. The holding of unnecessary inquests might, perhaps, add a new horror to death.  There is, unquestionably, a very strong impression amongst Senators in favour of the Bill, that some coroners require to be induced to carry out their duties more efficiently.  It is true, as the Minister says, that this Bill leaves the matter practically as it was. It would act as a gentle reminder to coroners who are not disposed to carry out their duties very energetically, but I think that as this is the first Bill that the Seanad has endeavoured to pass, we should not allow it to die prematurely.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>Pardon me for a moment.  This question of referring it to a Select Committee can only arise after the Bill has been read a second time.  It is premature to discuss it at present.  We are on the question of whether the Bill is to be read a second time, and the motion to refer it to a Select Committee cannot be debated under our Standing Orders until the Bill has been read a second time.</P>

      <P>I cannot give you that opportunity, because the question has not arisen.  In fact, Senator Brown was a little irregular in starting the suggestion about a Select Committee at this Stage, because the question does not arise unless and until the Bill has been read a second time. As a sort of bait to the Seanad to pass <Col N="154" /> it, he threw out the suggestion that it might be referred to a Select Committee.</P>

      <P>I referred to the Public Safety Act, not to this Bill. This Act which I now ask to have continued for a year deals with the execution of court judgments, or of decrees, and with them only.  Perhaps I ought to say something in justification of the proposal to continue the Act until March of next year.  The position in the country with regard to the execution of decrees is improving steadily, not very rapidly.  There is a gradual improvement from quarter to quarter. The number of decrees executed in March in the country was 2,426.  In April it was 2,451.  The decrees in hands at the end of March number 5,712, representing a money value of £107,790, and the decrees in hands at the end of April were 5,645, representing a money value of £102,085.  From month to month and quarter to quarter for the last year or eighteen months there has been a steady improvement in the position.  It was very bad about two years ago.  At present, under the Temporary Enforcement of Law Act, I think in certain counties where the position is worst I have assistant under-sheriffs helping in the execution of decrees.  I have one, for instance, in Donegal where the position is that there are still in the hands of the undersheriff 301 decrees representing £7,121. In Kerry 475 decrees are in the hands of the sheriff representing £9,000.  In Leix there are 187 decrees representing a money value of £8,000.  In Mayo there are 423 decrees valued £2,900.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="156" /> I am not yet in a position to make a permanent proposal with regard to this whole phase of administration, which is, of course, unquestionably of the first importance.  I would like to base permanent proposals on a normal situation.  The normal situation cannot be said to have been reached yet, and probably will not be reached under the twelve months extension of the temporary Bill which I am asking.  The position with regard to the execution of decrees was never satisfactory.  I have spoken to solicitors through the country and they tell me the position is as good as it ever was.  It was never quite satisfactory, and would need to be put on a better footing than it ever occupied in the past.  I ought to warn Senators that my permanent proposals will not differ very much in character from this temporary Act, but I would like to postpone them until after the new Rules of Court have been approved and are in operation, and also until the picture with regard to unexecuted judgments through the country is somewhat nearer normal than this return, for instance, would show.</P>

I understand that either the President or the Minister for Local Government anticipated coming into the Chamber when the Local Authorities (Combined Purchasing) Bill was being discussed.  The Minister for Local Government has indicated that his Estimates are being taken in the Dáil, and I have sent to ask if it is the wish or desire of the President to be here. <Col N="157" /> With respect to the Bills on the Order Paper, I do not think there is likely to be any opposition on the Committee Stage, or any desire for amending the Bills except, perhaps No. 6, Local Authorities (Combined Purchasing) Bill.  Some amendments have been handed in for No. 6, and, therefore, I think it is a Bill the House would like to discuss in Committee.  The question for consideration is whether the House would like to take up that Bill in Committee along with those other Bills to-morrow. Time is running with regard to these Bills, and there is a good deal further legislation on the stocks. There are some nine Bills, two or three of which are of first-class importance, on their way through the Dáil.  Therefore I am anxious that while we are here we should put through as much work as we conveniently can without hustling the members.  We ought to meet to-morrow and, if possible, go through the Committee Stage of these six Bills and take up the Fifth Stage of the Treason Bill.  Unless I hear an objection of a substantial character, I shall put the Committee Stage of those six Bills on the Agenda to-morrow.</P>

      <P>I see that there is a sound reason for going on with these six Bills, if we are not to meet next week, and I take it that is what the House will decide to do, but at the same time I call attention to the inconvenience of having the Committee Stage so soon after the Second Reading as we sometimes have.  I think we ought to have a rule that a week should elapse between the time of the Second <Col N="158" /> Reading and the Committee Stage of every Bill.  There ought to be in fact a standing order in this House to that effect.  There would be no objection very often in passing a Bill through all its subsequent stages in one day.  It happens that all the Bills except one on the Order Paper to-day are not Bills for which a series of amendments would be moved.  As a rule, we ought to insist on having a week's interval between the Second Reading and the Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I am a great believer in the importance of having an interval between the Second Reading and the Committee Stage with regard to any Bill which has provoked controversy or excited public opinion.  If we were to have an inflexible rule that a week were to elapse it would really be more honoured in the breach than in the observance.  I am satisfied from the state of contemplated legislation that we would be compelled to dispose of the Committee Stage of some Bills and all their stages in one day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>To sub-section 3 of Section 1, Senator Moore moved an amendment, to insert after the word &ldquo;who&rdquo; in line 35, the words &ldquo;with a view to aiding the treason.&rdquo;  After some discussion you, sir, suggested as an alternative the insertion in line 36 after the word &ldquo;treason&rdquo; the words &ldquo;whom he knows or has reason to believe.&rdquo;  I promised that I would give the matter consideration before the Report Stage, and, having done so, I am not inclined to accept the amendment. The purpose of the Senator, as I understand it, is already achieved by the sub-section as it stands.  A person cannot be guilty of a crime unless he has committed an overt act capable of being seen by someone else or has made default in doing such act, or <Col N="160" /> unless a wrongful intention or some other guilty intention of the mind is present; what is called the <i>mens rea.</i> That guilty frame of mind will not be imputed to a person who does an overt act unless the act is voluntary.  A voluntary act or action is one which is definitely willed, and an involuntary act is one which is not willed.  Accordingly under the sub-section as it stands if the defendant could prove that he was constrained by overwhelming force to harbour or comfort a person engaged in levying war against the State, or, having taken every step which a reasonable and prudent man could take in the circumstances, he believed that the person whom he was alleged to have harboured or comforted had not been engaged in levying war against the State, a defence would be afforded to him to a charge preferred against him under the sub-section.</P>
      <P>The onus would, of course, be on the person charged to satisfy the jury as to these facts.  In that connection I would like to remind the Senator that, under the Criminal Justice (Evidence) Act, passed last year, a person is now entitled to give evidence on his own behalf, and can rebut the presumption of guilt.  It is open to him to show that, in fact, there was no guilty frame of mind, that he had not, and could not, from the nature of the case, have the knowledge essential to constitute a guilty mental condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel MOORE Colonel MOORE">

      <P>It is not compulsory on the prisoner to give evidence. It is a matter for himself and for his solicitor to decide whether it would be to his advantage to do so.  What I am saying is that he can now give evidence, and that it is open to him to rebut the presumption of guilt by showing there was no guilty state of mind.</P>

      <P>I do not like to embarrass this Bill in any way, but I find a difficulty in following the Minister when he says that, under sub-section 3, the accused would be entitled to be acquitted if he showed that he acted under compulsion and not with knowledge.  I cannot find anything in the section to that effect.  Apparently, under the section, the offence would be complete the moment the fact was proved that he harboured, comforted, or encouraged a man.  In the absence of some word like &ldquo;willingly&rdquo; or &ldquo;knowingly,&rdquo; I do not see that want of knowledge could afford him any defence.</P>

      <P>I grant that there is nothing written in the sub-section. The idea was&mdash;I was stating the general principle&mdash;that a person would not be convicted of a crime if he could show that his mind and will did not go with the crime; if he could show that there was no guilty frame of mind on his part; and that he was acting either under compulsion or without that knowledge which would be essential to him.</P>

      <P>The Minister leaves it to the jury to decide what is actually wrong.  In the past we know that in many cases judges and juries have been so prejudiced in these matters that they have not given the prisoner the benefit.  We all know the case of Alice Lisle, who was condemned and beheaded for sheltering a refugee, although she denied that she knew there was anything wrong about it. That was in the days of the Bloody Assize.  We know also the case of those called the Manchester Martyrs, who were hanged, and whom nearly everyone believes now should not have been convicted.  Within the last three months an English judge, who has now retired, has publicly stated that they should not have been hanged, as there was not sufficient evidence against <Col N="162" /> them.  I do not think it is wise to leave these presumptions to the jury to decide what they may or may not do.  It should be laid down, one way or the other, and I am fortified in that view by the statement that you, A Chathaoirligh, have made.</P>

      <P>I think some more words are essential to make a man liable to the penalties laid down in the section.  I do not think that should be left to a jury.  It is quite possible that a treasonable person may come to any man's house for a night or two and remain there without the knowledge of that man.  I do not think that should be a crime or that in such a case a man should be made amenable under this section.  Some words should be put in to indicate whether a man was a willing party or not.  I do not think the safeguard of the Minister would entirely cover the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a very definite objection to it, and for good and sufficient reasons.  From the point of view of anyone with administrative responsibility, it would be an impossible task to say to the prosecution that they should prove knowledge on the part of the accused.  I am asking that the knowledge should be assumed, while it is open to the accused to rebut the presumption of a guilty frame of mind by any evidence he can adduce.  Take the situation of a conflict in the country and of persons in arms or in action against the State being harboured.  It ought to be sufficient on the part of the State to prove the fact of harbouring. It would be open to an accused person to say that he did not know that Tom or Patrick So-and-So, whom he kept for a fortnight in his house, was in action against the State or had taken part in any hostilities against the State.  It would be for the jury, sizing up the situation as best they could, to decide whether there was any Patrick So-and-So who acted as host to the other man, the frame of mind that would constitute the offence of treason and harbouring men engaged in hostilities against the State, to <Col N="163" /> say to the Attorney-General, &ldquo;You must prove that this man was put up at the other man's house for a period and you must prove that he had knowledge that the other man was engaged in hostilities against the State and in conflict with it.&rdquo;  The Attorney-General could not be expected to prove that.  What evidence of it could he adduce?  He could, of course, adduce evidence that the person might well be aware of it, but he could not prove &ldquo;the guilty frame of mind.&rdquo;  He could only prove the fact of harbouring.  I do think it would lie with a defendant to show either that he was an unwilling agent, that he was overawed or acted under compulsion, or to show alternatively that he did not know and had no means of knowing that this person was engaged in hostilities against the State.  That a jury would advert and would be bound to advert to such considerations as that might be urged. But to go the length of accepting the Senator's amendment to prove not merely knowledge, but motive, would be out of the question.  You might harbour a man from many motives; you might harbour him from motives of humanity.  You might take pity on his plight.  You might have no desire to aid treason, and yet you might harbour him and so commit an offence. The Senator's amendment, taken literally, would mean that the Attorney-General would have to prove that the harbouring was done not merely out of humanity or pity, but out of a positive desire to assist the treason.  If it is a big task, an impossible task, to prove knowledge on the part of an individual, it is still more difficult to ask the prosecution to prove motive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that having regard to the objects of this Bill and having regard to the necessity of defending the State, that that end is best served by leaving the section as it stands, by leaving it open to any accused persons to convince a Judge and to convince a jury that there was no guilty frame of mind on their part, that they did not know that this person whom they had been harbouring or entertaining in their houses, was engaged in any hostile action.  I am afraid you will only find <Col N="164" /> juries too willing to believe cock-and-bull stories of that kind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite see the difficulty that the prosecution would be placed in if they had to prove affirmatively that the individual harboured, encouraged or comforted persons knowing they were engaged in levying war.  I quite realise that.  But it would be open, under this section, to any accused person to say: &ldquo;I did not know he was levying war; I was coerced; I was doing it unwillingly.&rdquo; and all that.  I do not believe the prosecution will ever get a conviction under this Bill.  I believe it would be well worth the Minister's while to consider whether he would add on some such words as these:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Unless the accused person satisfies the Court that he did not know and had no reasonable means of knowing that the person or persons alleged to have been encouraged, harboured, or comforted, was or were engaged or had been engaged in levying or waging war against Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That throws the onus upon the prisoner to satisfy affirmatively the court, whereas if you leave it as it is it will be open to the jury to acquit him if he said he did it under coercion. I doubt if you would ever get a conviction under that Clause at all as it stands.</P>

      <P>The Minister, when dealing with this particular amendment, mentioned that a person might harbour persons and might not be in sympathy with treason, but that he might harbour them by giving them supper or comforting them in distress. Some words put into the amendment now would meet that particular case.  I have no doubt, when the Minister says that no jury would convict, that if he were on the jury himself he would not convict.  But we must remember that people are not so broad-minded now as formerly, and they look at things from the point of view of a particular angle that suits them at the moment, and I think that if something were put into the amendment that would deal with that aspect, it would be more satisfactory. I am interested in this from the humanitarian point of view, and I think these words would have a great advantage if put in.</P>

That was accepted by the Minister, and this one that you are now on, was also accepted; that the word &ldquo;lawful&rdquo; be inserted before the word &ldquo;orders&rdquo; in line 39 of Section 3 (e).

      <P>In connection with Section 3, I had some proposals which the Minister agreed to think over.  He did not promise to accept them.  I proposed to change the section, and to break it up into two sections, parts (a) and (b)&mdash;(a) the inciting any member of the military force, and (b) inciting any person in the Civil Service.  I suggest that these should be two different sub-sections.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>The verdict is unfavourable there.  I think the section as it stands is really better.  It gives a very wide discretion to the court in regard to all the offences covered by the section.  A fine of from one penny up to £500, or from £500 down to one penny, could be imposed, or penal servitude from three years to twenty years, and imprisonment with or without hard labour from two years down to one day.  It leaves complete discretion to the court as to the amount of fine or imprisonment that would be imposed.  The amendment would really have the effect of making more, rather than less, severe the punishment in the case of the offences he classifies as trifling.  For this reason&mdash;I do not know whether he has adverted to it or not&mdash;under the amendment the judge is deprived of the discretion given to <Col N="170" /> him in the original section, and he is confined to imposing a sentence of hard labour for a term not exceeding two years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel MOORE Colonel MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do.  From the little I know about the law, I think the custom is to divide the different offences into different classes, differentiating between the more serious and the minor ones as regards penalties. I think it is quite contrary to legislation generally to give to a judge power that used to be given in Mahommedan countries to Pashas and Bashi-Bazouks. A man might be brought up for begging in the street, and have his head cut off for that offence, and he might also have only his toe cut off&mdash;just as the Minister talks of inflicting little penalties. I do not think a judge should have the power to do anything he likes.  It is contrary to the law generally.  The law, as I understand, lays down the maximum punishment for serious crimes, and the maximum penalties for minor crimes.  I do not see why we should go back to the Turkish regime.  I think we ought to confine a judge to what he ought to do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir JOHN KEANE Sir JOHN KEANE">
      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the interest in this Bill arises not from what it does or does not propose to do, but from the indication that it gives as to the policy of the Government in regard to local administration.  In my judgment, it reveals a steady and continuous tendency towards central control and regulation.  That tendency is finding its way largely into recent legislation in the State.  We have had very strong evidence of it in the Dairy Produce Bill, and in the Live Stock Breeding Bill, and we have got it here again.  This is an attitude of regulating and controlling, instead of trusting the people to work out their own salvation.  We must give every credit to the Government in their intention to effect a positive saving by this, but one is doubtful if positive saving would be effected, but if it is going to be so, every credit should be given.  This Bill fails to show a clear grasp of the meaning and purpose of democracies and democratic control.  It looks as if, in a way, the Government are afraid of trusting their own offspring, and while on special occasions, on the public hustings, vehement lip is given to these democratic principles, when it comes into action by their policy they largely nullify these professions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of us had grave misgivings as to the operations of these locally elected bodies for the purposes of administration, but surely the day has gone by when we can look at it in that light?  For better or for worse, this policy of autonomy in Local Government has been set up.  It has been on trial now for many years, and until the Government declare it as their policy to sweep it away, it seems to me that we have to let it take its natural course. We will have to let it continue until the Government come to us and say that this thing has to be scrapped and that <Col N="174" /> they propose to deal with the whole matter of local administration by a system of managers.  If the Government were to declare in favour of doing that, I think they would find a considerable measure of support in certain quarters.  I personally would give them my support in a matter of that kind, but at present that does not seem to be practical polities. Therefore, so long as this popular election continues to be a part of our Local Government system, we must try rather to develop such virtues as it claims to possess.  One way to do that would be to educate the people by putting responsibility upon them, by trusting them and letting them learn by experience.  Unless you give a very considerable measure of latitude to these local authorities, how will they ever learn?  If you nip in the bud any sort of tendency on their part to display initiative, how are you ever going to develop a civic sense amongst the people and that high character as regards local affairs that we all hope to see as the outcome of such experience? I think this measure is short-sighted in that it checks and attempts to stereotype local authorities in their action in this important matter of local purchasing. It seems to show a lack of imagination, and a failure to realise that you can only learn and educate by a process of making mistakes, and thereby gaining experience in that way.</P>
    <P>I do not think this is a Bill that we should throw out, but at the same time I do not believe that it is going to effect very much positive good.  I fear that it may do a certain amount of indirect and positive harm by unduly curtailing the free play of local elected bodies.  As regards the details of the measure, I may have some amendments to move on the Committee Stage. From my reading of the Bill it seems unreasonable that the official contractor should be the contractor for all local authorities or none.  It would seem reasonable that an official contractor could be appointed for one or more local authorities, and that he should serve in the district of which he has a knowledge, but it does seem wrong to me that a positive attempt should be made to stereotype quality.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="175" /> Simply to say that a shovel is a shovel and that a shirt is a shirt is not sufficient. You should have definite and distinct samples available of the different articles that are in question, and if the Government are going to insist on people buying through the Central Authority, the people should be sure of what they are buying.  If they can buy locally an article which is something better than what the official contractor proposes to supply, and one that answers more to their requirements, I think they should be allowed to do so.</P>

      <P>I rise to support the principle of this Bill.  Looking at it generally, I think it is a desirable measure.  As far as I can see from it, it is open to everyone in Ireland to contract for the articles required and to get their names on the official list. I cannot see that it will inflict a hardship on anyone.  If, under this measure, local authorities can get their supplies at a more favourable rate than they can be got otherwise, I think that is quite right and proper. I would like, however, to have some assurances as to the number of persons who may be appointed on the central authority which will have so much to say to the purchasing of supplies. The only fear I have is, that too many people may be appointed on that body and that it may become cumbersome. Three or four sections in the Bill deal with the powers to be vested in inspectors, with the number of persons to be appointed and the remuneration that is to be paid.  There may be a danger that a future Ministry may become somewhat extravagant, and may appoint too many persons to these positions.  That is a matter that will have to be looked into, because it would be highly undesirable if an excessive number of persons were appointed to administer this measure when it becomes law.  With that reservation, I desire to support the Bill.</P>

      <P>As regards the motion standing in the name of Senator Sir John Keane, which proposes to call the attention of the Executive <Col N="178" /> Council to the alteration of certain forms contained in the schedule of the Country Boards of Health Accounts Order, and which has appeared on the Order Paper on several occasions, it does not appear that we will be able to get any further with it to-day.  It has been adjourned several times for the convenience of the Minister for Local Government, who expressed his anxiety to be here and to make a statement in reply.  I have given him various opportunities of doing so, but unfortunately he seems to be engaged always.  I suppose we had better adjourn it until to-morrow, as the Minister is not likely to be able to attend to-day.  We cannot, however, be perpetually adjourning it.

I am inclined to think when the chairs, carpets and curtains are laid down and the room completed, we will find the acoustic properties improved.  If not, then we can try the room downstairs temporarily for one meeting without any change of furniture.  If that was satisfactory, then we could have the whole thing changed or go elsewhere. I think we had better wait until the Board of Works have had the room completed, and I take it that everything will be done to hasten its completion.</P>

It seems to me that it would be a pity to incur a considerable amount of further expenditure without knowing what the result is likely to be.  There were several suggestions made, and amongst them one which emanated from An Cathaoirleach, and that is that the chair should be placed within the windows at the end of the room after taking away the distinguished strangers' gallery.  Then the seating accommodation could be arranged so that Senators would be facing one another as they were in the old Chamber, and the hearing would be very much improved, because instead of Senators sitting at different ends of the room trying to hear, we would be facing one another, which would be a much better arrangement.</P>

      <P>With regard to next week, I understand it is possible that the Shannon Electricity Bill will be passed through all its Stages by Tuesday next, and if that were so, of course, it will be possible, if it were for the convenience of the House, to meet on Wednesday next and take the Shannon Bill.  It would be the only matter we would have to discuss that day.  The discussion of that Bill, I presume, would last a considerable time.

      <P>It comes to this, and the House should take this matter in hands, that we must imperatively demand to have a more economical distribution of our time.  I think it is quite a mistake that Senators should be called from distant parts of Ireland and have only a meagre bill of fare to keep them going which can be disposed of at the end of a couple of hours.  I think we should try to arrange our sittings, and should try to accumulate business so that we might sit for four days in the week&mdash;that is four days one week and four days the next week&mdash;so as to have a continuous sitting of four or eight days.

      <P>In connection with the Shannon Bill, I think the position is this:&mdash;The Fourth Stage of the Bill is down for Tuesday next.  I saw the Minister last night who is in charge of the Bill, and he said he was anxious that the Seanad should have as much time as possible to consider that Bill. He said he does not want delay if he can avoid it, and he told me he hoped the Dáil would agree almost immediately to take the Fifth Stage, so that we could have the Second Reading Stage, and could have a long period between the Second Reading and the Committee Stage if the Seanad so desired.  I am quite certain that all he wants is to provide that we should have a reasonably long time to discuss the Bill from the time it leaves the Dáil.  If we find difficulty in taking the Stages one after the other or taking the Second Reading and then the Committee Stage, I do not think that that would make any difference to the Minister.  What he is anxious about is that we should not afterwards complain and say we did not get the Bill in time.  I am only speaking now as the result of a conversation I had with him casually last night.</P>

      <P>If the Bill gets through the Dáil on Tuesday, I could not ask this House to go into Committee on that Bill on Wednesday and Thursday.  I am sure Senators would not do so.  It seems to me there is nothing to be gained by convening the House simply to discussing the Second Reading on Wednesday, when we have no other business for that day. I think it is better to put it off until we have an interval to consider the Bill, and then to take the Committee Stage immediately after the Second Reading.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="184" /> Therefore, Senators would be called up here next week and would be finished with their work in one day.  I think it is better, therefore, that the Second Reading of the Shannon Bill should not be taken until the week after next.

Then, if it is an unreasonable thing to ask the Seanad to meet to discuss the Second Reading the next day, there is nothing for it but to see what we can do the week after.</P>

I do not see how you can reconcile the two views, your view that we should wait until a great deal of business comes together, and the other view, that in spite of the inconvenience, it is better to have a certain interval between the Second Reading and the Committee Stages.  Either one or the other has to prevail.  I suggest that the Second Reading be taken on Thursday next, not on Wednesday, if on Saturday you are reasonably satisfied that it can <Col N="187" /> come before us.

If, on the other hand, I come to the conclusion that it is not certain&mdash;because, of course, I cannot summon the Seanad unless there is some certainty that the Bill will be out of the Dáil&mdash;I shall not convene the House until next Wednesday week.</P>

      <P>It has been printed up to its present Stage, and any Senator who wants to know its contents, may fairly assume that it will come up here in the condition in which he finds it to-day.  Any Senator can get <Col N="188" /> a copy to-day if he asks for it, and I venture to say that it is in the same condition now as it will be when it leaves the Dáil.  It is the intention of the Government to fix specially the Report Stage for Tuesday, but the Bill as it passed Committee is now in print, and I predict, with a certain amount of confidence, that the Bill, as it stands at present, will be very little altered after Tuesday next.</P>

      <P>I propose that the following seven Senators form the Select Committee to consider the Coroners Bill, and that the quorum be four.  The only one whose consent I have not asked is you, sir:&mdash;Senators Lord Glenavy, de Loughrey, Kenny, the Countess of Desart, Farren, Jackson and myself, with you, sir, as Chairman. The time and date of meeting will be fixed by you, sir.  There is no particular hurry about it.</P>
      <P>Motion put, and agreed to.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 5.5 p.m. until 3 o'clock on Thursday, May 21st.</P>
