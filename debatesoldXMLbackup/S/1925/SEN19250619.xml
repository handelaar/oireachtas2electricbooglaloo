      <P>Since I mentioned yesterday that it would be perhaps more desirable under the circumstances to meet on Thursday of next week, I have been discussing the matter with Senator Douglas, and in view of the amount of business that has to be disposed of before the House rises for the Recess, I have come to the conclusion that it will be much wiser for the Seanad if they agree to meet on Tuesday.  That will enable us to get rid of a good deal of pressing matter and will leave Thursday free for the nominations and probably for the Finance Bill, which may have reached us by that time.  I know there has been extraordinary unanimity among the Deputies of the Dáil in agreeing that Wednesday should be spent elsewhere. Apparently they wish to attend the counting of the votes at the local elections. I thought the members of the Seanad might have the same desire.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LINEHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>We have only got this Bill this morning.  I think you are establishing a very bad precedent in allowing the Second Reading of the Bill to be brought forward at such a short notice.  If that precedent is adopted in other cases, I am afraid it will have the effect of not giving full consideration to legislation.  I hope no precedent will be established in putting through those Bills so quickly.</P>

      <P>We have done so in other cases where it was fairly plain and obvious that the Bill was not a controversial one.  I do not think this is likely to be a controversial one, and, if you recollect, you will have the fullest opportunity of discussing it in Committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave requisite notice of the Second Stage, that is, two days.  There will be several days before the Bill comes before the Committee. The position with regard to this Bill is as follows:&mdash;I brought this Bill in at the request of the Committee of the Merchant Traders' Association, and since I brought it in I received the approval of the Distributive Workers' Association, including the drapers' assistants.  The Bill is simply to give effect to an agreement which was arrived at by the trade generally about four years ago.  If the Seanad is not willing to allow this Bill to go through its various stages in the course of a week or eight days it will be impossible for it to become law this summer. <Col N="601" /> As far as a number of assistants in the smaller houses are concerned that will mean they will not get the full benefit of the system.  From the time I received the request it was necessary to have the Bill drafted by a barrister, and I may say, incidentally, it was drafted by Senator Brown.  It was impossible to have it drafted earlier.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterDeLoughry" hpid="Mr. de LOUGHRY Mr. de LOUGHRY">

      <P>I propose consideration of the Bill be adjourned until next week.  I would like to give small traders affected by this Bill an opportunity of expressing an opinion on it.  As Senator Linehan says, the principle does not affect people outside the Dublin area, but it may later on. We have heard a good deal recently about interfering with the rights of the people.  In my opinion the rights of the people are being interfered with in this.  This is, as far as I can see, in the interests of the big drapery houses and the assistants.  While the assistants may be able to make a very good case, I think we are inflicting an undue hardship on small traders who find it very difficult to make their business pay at the present time.  I think the assistants are fairly well protected under the Shop Hours Act and under other Acts.  We have had no time to go into this Bill, and as I do not think it is pressing I propose that its consideration be adjourned until next Session.</P>

      <P>I would prefer that the Seanad should decide about the Second Stage now.  If the House accepts the Bill to-day, it can, if it wishes, reject it at a later Stage next week, or <Col N="602" /> if there is opposition, it can then postpone the Bill until after the adjournment. I hope the Seanad will be prepared to pass the Second Reading to-day. On the Fifth Stage it can be postponed if much opposition arises.</P>

      <P>I second the proposition to postpone consideration of this Bill.  I think it is unnecessary and very intolerant legislation that will affect a large number of very small and struggling people.  I think it is one of the most penal Bills I have read for years.  The penalties imposed under the Licensing Act are not as severe as those imposed on a person selling a pair of stockings on a Saturday night.  I think the Bill requires further consideration, and should not be allowed to pass now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>Personally, I am always averse and hostile to hurried legislation, but in this particular case this Bill, as Senator Douglas has explained, is the result of an agreement between two parties.  The effect of postponing further consideration of it until after the Recess would mean rejecting it altogether for the present year, because the summer season would be at an end, and the great benefit that would be derived by early closing would be useless for the present year. An agreement was entered into some time ago, and a large body of the employers and the assistants honourably observed the agreement.  A small section broke away from it without consent. What the Bill seeks to do is to make binding the agreement that was entered into.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill does not seek to hit the very small trader, because it exempts people who run shops with their own families. It would be said, of course, that that would debar persons with one assistant from keeping open.  A line can always be drawn, as, if the Bill was to apply to a shop with ten assistants, someone else would come along and say he had eleven assistants and was not allowed to keep open, while those with ten could.  There is always a borderline.  I am surprised at Senator de Loughry's objection.  I thought he had a fairer and a more reasonable <Col N="603" /> conception of freedom and of decent working conditions than he has shown on this occasion.  Closing at 7.30 on Saturday evening, with the exception of the three Saturdays that are named, is reasonable.  Any person who has business to do should be able to do it before that hour.  After that hour the dregs of the business are not worth having, and will fall to the small traders who run their own business.</P>
    <P>You may extend the shop hours to 9.30, and still have a section that would want to keep open until 10.30, and even some who would want to keep open until midnight.  That kind of thing would be very unfair to those who agree to close at a regular hour. It would be very much better, in my opinion, to have a fixed hour for all shops to close at.  When that fixed arrangement is made, the public generally will adjust themselves to it, and the net result will be that the assistants will have a little more freedom, and the employers will be saved a great deal of anxiety caused by the present irregularity in closing hours. The fixing of closing hours will, I believe, also lead to a due distribution of the trade amongst the various establishments. I hope that the Seanad will not agree to hold up the passage of this Bill.  Its doing so would deprive a very worthy section of the community of the amount of freedom which they are seeking under this Bill and which the employers are quite prepared to concede.</P>

      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in favour of the shortening of hours as much as possible, but on the other hand I would like to say that I have not had an opportunity of looking into this Bill very carefully.  All I have heard about it was the hurried explanation given by the Senator who introduced it.  Senator Douglas has told us that if we give the Bill a Second Reading to-day the remaining stages of it can be taken in the next session.  Senator O'Farrell tells us, on the other hand, that it would be wrong to do that for the reason that the summer months would have passed when the next stage of the Bill came to be considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>There is some confusion in the Senator's mind, I think, about that.  What Senator Douglas did say was that if the Seanad gave the Bill a Second Reading to-day the Committee Stage could be held up until after the Recess, but I would like to point out to Senator Colonel Moore that Senator Douglas did not invite the Seanad to hold over the remaining stages of the Bill until after the Recess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel MOORE Colonel MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not talking about inviting at all.  What I did say was that Senator Douglas's suggestion cut across the suggestion made by Senator O'Farrell, and <i>vice versa.</i>  If the Seanad agree to do what Senator Douglas suggested, then the next stages of the Bill, supposing it got a Second Reading to-day, would not be taken until the summer months had passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>What I suggested was that if the Seanad were prepared to give the Bill a Second Reading to-day, the further stages could be taken next week, and that in the meantime Senators would have an opportunity of giving the measure the consideration which Senator Colonel Moore asks for. If, on the other hand, the Seanad were to refuse to give the Bill a Second Reading to-day it would be impossible to proceed further with it before the Recess, even though Senators, between now and our meeting next week, realised that in rejecting the Second Reading to-day they had done wrong.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. WYSE-POWER</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in favour of early closing, but at the same time I am anxious that the small traders who are not, I think, members of the Master Drapers' Association should have an opportunity of having their interests considered.  The members of the Master Drapers' Association close, as a rule, at 1 o'clock on Saturdays and at 6 on ordinary week evenings, but then there is a very large number of small traders who are not members of that Association, and I think that before we give this Bill a Second Reading we shall have an opportunity of getting their views on this matter. There is one point, I think, which has been omitted from the Bill.  Provision <Col N="605" /> is made so that all the large houses may remain open all day on the Saturdays before the big holidays, such as at Easter and Whitsuntide, but I notice that the Saturday before the August bank holiday is omitted.  That is a matter that should be attended to, I think.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'DEA</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not very conversant with the merits of this Bill, but I think it will be admitted that the Shop Hours' Act affords great privileges to shop assistants.  Before I could agree to the Second Reading of this Bill I would have to satisfy myself that its provisions were not calculated to inflict an injury on the smaller traders.  These shops cater for people of small means, and as a rule their busiest hours are on Saturday evenings.  Before we come to any conclusion on this Bill I think we should give an opportunity for having the views of the smaller traders put before us.  In my opinion Senator de Loughry has stated the position very fairly.  The attitude he has taken up is, I think, an equitable one.  I certainly could not support the Bill until I get an assurance that its provisions are not calculated to penalise and do a serious injury to the small traders in the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasForan" hpid="Mr. FORAN Mr. FORAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FORAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to Senator de Loughry that he ought to move that the consideration of the Bill be adjourned until after the holding of the Seanad elections.  After these elections perhaps some of us may not be here either to support or oppose the Bill.  I seriously suggest to the Seanad that to turn down the Second Reading of this Bill will do an injury to the prestige of this assembly in the opinion of the people of the country.  In my opinion, this Bill reflects the first attempt at democratic or progressive legislation in this House.  Some Senators have stated that they have not had sufficient time to study this Bill.  In my opinion a Senator who gets up and states that he has not had time to study a Bill which consists of a few small paragraphs must be a very lazy man.  We have been told that this Bill will inflict a hardship on the smaller traders, and also that many of them are only able to make a living <Col N="606" /> when the larger houses are closed.  I remember the time when many of these smaller houses were open on Sunday mornings.  Is it suggested that we ought to go back to that system again?  I hold that even in the case of the smaller houses we should not facilitate them to the extent of enabling them to keep open, as some of them used to do years ago, until 11 and 12 o'clock on Saturday nights.  I suggest to those who are opposing the Bill to withdraw their opposition and to give it a Second Reading to-day.  If there are any safeguards which they think ought to be introduced, well, then, these can be discussed on the Committee Stage, but I do not think the Seanad should agree to the holding up of the Bill by rejecting the Second Reading to-day.  I do not think any decent-minded Senator should support such a suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>I might point out to Senators that if the Bill is given a Second Reading to-day it will be open to Senators, on the Committee Stage, to discuss by amendment the position of the smaller traders, and, if it is thought desirable, to limit the operation of the Bill to houses of a certain rateable valuation.  These are matters that can be fully discussed on the Committee Stage.  I am just pointing that out to the Seanad.  At the same time, I desire to say that I have no interest in the Bill at all, and know nothing about it.  I thought it well, however, to point out to the Seanad that the difficulty suggested as regards the smaller traders can be fully debated on the Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. FARREN Mr. FARREN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FARREN</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of the Bill is to give statutory authority to an obligation undertaken voluntarily some years ago by certain traders in the city of Dublin.  By a majority vote, taken amongst the people engaged in the drapery business in Dublin some years ago under the auspices of the City Municipal Council, it was decided that there should be certain fixed hours for the closing of these establishments. Owing to the abnormal conditions that prevailed in the city and generally throughout the country in late years, a number of people engaged in the <Col N="607" /> drapery business failed to adhere to the obligation, as regards early closing, that they then undertook.  A number of them, I regret to say, did not continue to observe the agreement that they entered into, and now they are keeping open after the recognised closing hour. The result is that, more or less, they are in the position of pirates.  The people who observed the agreement honourably lost a certain amount of business which drifted to those shopkeepers who failed to keep the agreement.  I might point out that the shops which keep open to a late hour on Saturday evening cater for the poorer classes of the people, and if anyone should stand up to defend the interests of the poorer classes of the people surely it is the Senators who sit on these benches.</P>
      <P>Thanks to the Trade Union movement, the workers are off now early enough to do their shopping before seven o'clock on Saturday evenings. There is another point.  Fancy young people being employed in weather like this from nine o'clock in the morning until half-past-ten at night, and remember that these people engaged in shops which keep open late are all young. Surely we ought to consider their position and see that traders that insist in keeping their premises open and young people employed during long hours should not be allowed to do so.</P>
      <P>There is only a certain amount of shopping to be done.  People cannot buy more than they require, or more than their pockets allow them.  There is no doubt that the big shops get the benefit of the trade taken from the smaller shops.  There will be no hardship inflicted on the smaller traders who run their shops with the aid of their own families.  This Bill only deals with shops where assistants are employed for hire.  I appeal to Senators, from the point of view of humanity, to support the Second Reading of this Bill so that there may be some regulation of the hours during which shops should be kept open.  There will be no hardship inflicted, but you will prevent people taking advantage of other people's premises being closed to do a little extra trade.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BENNETT</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked a question as to whether there would be time between now and the next Stage of the Bill to acquire an amount of necessary information in regard to these particular drapery houses.  It seems to me that if the drapery houses close earlier, say at seven o'clock, a great number of working men will have their wages paid to them by half-past six o'clock&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. FARREN Mr. FARREN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FARREN</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasBennett" hpid="Mr. BENNETT Mr. BENNETT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BENNETT</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, then they will be parading the town up to a certain hour of the Saturday night with an amount of money gingling in their pockets, and it may be a question as to whether their wives may be able to induce them to go into the drapery shops to buy something useful and necessary rather than go into another class of shop which keeps open until nine o'clock.  I think we ought to take a little time over this idea.  It would be wiser to try and find out whether people would spend their money with more advantage in the one shop than in the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>There were several points raised during the discussion which I think would not have been raised if the position had been fully understood, and, possibly, it would have been better if I had made an introductory statement dealing with those points.  In the first place, the position with regard to hours is briefly this: During the war it was obligatory to close between the hours of five and six, and during our own war here, if I may use the phrase, it was not wise to remain open after six or six-thirty o'clock and so the houses closed down. In 1920 a general meeting of the Merchant Drapers' Association&mdash;and I may say in passing I am not a member of the Association&mdash;was held and was attended by almost all the drapery traders known as the late Saturday opening houses.  The meeting was not attended by the larger firms like Clery's, Pim's, Todd's, Arnott's and so on, who close early on a Saturday.  The small houses may be divided into two classes, namely, those known as the larger and those known as the smaller.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="609" /> The larger of these houses had been in the habit of closing at eight or nine o'clock on Saturday nights, and the others at ten or eleven.  At this meeting it was urged that those in the habit of closing at eight or nine, including the firm with which I am connected, should agree to closing at 6.30 p.m., leaving an additional hour longer to the smaller houses, which did not compete, as a whole, with the larger houses.  That was carried, and has been, and is being carried out in most districts in Dublin.  But owing to the fact that a number of houses have changed hands in these districts, many of the new proprietors did not feel themselves bound to keep the agreement. I do not want to emphasise that overmuch.  Most of the houses do not wish to go back to the late hour of nine or ten o'clock on a Saturday night, but I am afraid that will be the result if people are allowed to drift in some districts, and if a number of the houses remain open up to 9.30 and some up to 10 o'clock.  Drapers generally have been informing their staff that if this continues they will abandon the arrangement of closing at 6.30 or so, and that they will remain open until 9 o'clock.</P>
    <P>That is being resisted by the assistants, and I am informed by the employers and assistants that the only way to solve the difficulty is to make an arrangement which will be binding generally and which will be carried out.  This Bill is not to change or to create new hours.  In the next place, it is only covering three years, because it was suggested to me by the Ministry concerned that at the end of two or three years the Government would have to deal with the whole question of shop hours, and that it was better to leave it open so as to fit in with the new scheme.  When I speak of agreement I mean two things.  Four years ago there was an agreement including the houses to which Senator Mrs. Wyse Power referred, known as the smaller houses.  In this particular case a move was made by the Merchant Drapers' Association, and someone had to take charge and get a Bill drafted.  I very much hope that the Seanad will not turn down the Second Reading of this <Col N="610" /> Bill.  They will have plenty of opportunities between this and next stage to consult persons affected, and if any general outcry arises against the Bill I will not go on with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterDeLoughry" hpid="Mr. de LOUGHRY Mr. de LOUGHRY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de LOUGHRY</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose I should be considered as not very much interested in this Bill, having no connection whatever with the drapery trade.  I believe that in that case it would be a hardship on the small traders in the country.  The workmen in Dublin are paid on Friday evening or early on Saturday morning, and they can do their shopping early. That, however, does not obtain in the country, as people like farm labourers do not get paid until Saturday evening. Summer-time is not recognised in many country districts, and, as a general rule, it is after 8 o'clock in the evening when people arrive in a country town to do their shopping.  If conditions have changed so much in Dublin, and if there is no necessity for people shopping after 7.30 p.m., I cannot see why it is necessary to pass legislation such as this.  I think the trade unions here should be strong enough to get people to do their shopping before 7.30 p.m.  I think that some time should be given to ascertain the views of small traders who are directly affected.  It has been stated that this is in the interests of merchant drapers and the assistants, but I am not much interested in them as they can very well look after themselves.  I would be influenced, however, by the opinion of small traders.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CUMMINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is time enough to bid the devil good morrow when we meet him.  This Bill applies only to the city, and when the time comes to extend it to the country it will be time enough to argue the merits of the case.  I hope it will be extended to the country and I hope that arrangements will be made to have wages paid at a proper hour to enable men to do their shopping early on Saturday rather than having them coming home at midnight to disturb the amenities of country life.  We have people parading the roads and streets up to a late hour on Saturday night and into the <Col N="611" /> small hours of Sunday morning, a fact which is very disedifying to a country town.  I think there should be no difficulty about this Bill.  It is not a drastic measure and its intention is to revive what was voluntarily agreed to some years ago and which would still be agreed to were it not for the dislocation of trade in the country.  It is a boon which everybody welcomes, and it is hoped by this Bill to revive that boon.  I think that the Seanad should have no difficulty in giving it a Second Reading to enable advantage to be taken of the Bill before winter comes.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the House will allow me to say a few words with regard to this Report, as I was Chairman of the Committee from whom these recommendations are issued.

It seems to me that that would be a very inconvenient method of dealing with this Report, and, if there is no objection from any part of the House, I think the more appropriate course would be to consider it as if we were in Committee and allow me to put each paragraph to the House.  May I also say that as I do not regard it as a controversial matter I should like to refer to two essential matters in the Report, not for the purpose of influencing the House but for the purpose of explaining the views of the Committee upon it.  We were of opinion, rightly or wrongly, with regard to the out-going Senators that we should either place them all on the list or place none.  That is to say, whatever action was taken with regard to the nineteen out-going Senators, they <Col N="612" /> should either all be placed on the list of proposals or none should be put on the list, and should be left to their automatic right under the Constitution.</P>
      <P>Our idea was that it would be regarded as an invidious thing and, perhaps, as a slur upon out-going Senators whom we failed to put on our list and the selection would be invidious.  There fore, there were two ways of dealing with them, either that they should all be placed on the proposal list or, alternatively, that they should not be eligible for proposal, as they had their automatic right under the Constitution of joining the Panel after the Panel is completed.  There is a good deal to be said for both views.  I think that the real persons to be consulted are the out-going Senators.  If there is any expression of opinion on their part that they would prefer to be left alone and be committed to their rights under the Constitution I am quite sure that the Seanad will respect that view.  On the other hand, the alternative proposal is that of the Committee which is before the House.  It is not a matter of controversy and I am sure it is a matter upon which we will all agree whatever the views of the out-going Senators may be.  There is another small matter which I want to mention.  At the time these recommendations were drafted we were under the impression that Wednesday, 24th, would be the last day that would be convenient for allowing the handing in of proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Considering it since then, I do not see the necessity for fixing such an early date, for this reason.  The voting is not to take place until the following week, that is, on the 1st July.  Between the conclusion of the nominations and the actual voting all that has to be done is preparing the ballot papers, and that cannot take a very long time.  Seeing that we altered our date of meeting to Thursday, it seems to me that there is no reason why the date should not be extended to Thursday and, if the House approves, I suggest that it be extended to 12 o'clock on Friday.  That would give ample time to do everything that has to be done between Friday and the 1st July, as all that has to be done in the interval is the preparation of the ballot papers.  There is just one other <Col N="613" /> matter.  You will see that one of the recommendations provides that the proposal of candidates is to be in the form in the schedule.  The moment you arrive at a conclusion, if you adopt the form in the schedule, that form will be available after the sitting of the House, as forms have been printed in anticipation of the decision of the House.  If you look at the form you will find that at the end there is a provision made for the signature by the candidate of his desire to have his name put forward.</P>
    <P>I pointed out the other day that if that was the only way in which the candidate could notify his assent it might cause considerable delay in passing the proposal form backwards and forward between the candidate himself and the Senators who nominate him.  I suggest that this form should not be taken away but that there should be an alternative recommendation or paragraph in the Report allowing any candidate, instead of having to send this particular form, simply to send within the stipulated time a statement under his hand that he consents to his name being put on the list.  That would be an alternative to the other form.  He could sign the proposal form in the schedule, but if he found that inconvenient he should not be prevented from sending forward under his own hand to the office here a consent in writing to have his name put on the list. If it is the wish of the Seanad to adopt the suggestion I have made and to treat this Report as if it were in Committee I will take the recommendations paragraph by paragraph and put them to the House.</P>
    <P>Paragraph No. 1 put and agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">PARAGRAPH No. 2.</P>
    <P>All outgoing Senators, who signify in writing their consent, shall be proposed by the Leas-Chathaoirleach or other Senator authorised by him.  All other candidates must be proposed by not less than two Senators, with due regard to Article 33 of the Constitution, in so far as it enacts that special reference is to be had to the necessity for arranging for the representation <Col N="614" /> of important interests and institutions in the country.</P>

      <P>In connection with this paragraph it appears that outgoing Senators may be nominated by the Leas-Chathaoirleach or another Senator authorised by him.

      <P>What the first three lines mean is this.  If the House prefer that the outgoing Senators should be proposed <i>en bloc</i> instead of leaving them their right of having their names put ultimately on the Panel, the method to be adopted is indicated in the first four lines of paragraph No. 2.  That is to say, the duty is imposed on the Vice-Chairman or, if he finds he cannot attend, upon some Senator authorised by him to propose these names <i>en bloc.</i>  That, of course, does not interfere with the Deputy Chairman's power of nomination as to others; it would not go outside that.</P>

      <P>No.  To meet that, Senator Douglas has prepared and will send out if the paragraph is carried in this form a notice to each outgoing Senator asking if he wishes to have his name proposed in that way.  If the House adopts this method we thought it fair that each outgoing Senator should be expressly notified that this is going to be done, if it meets with his approval, because some out-going Senators may not be here to-day.</P>

      <P>It is well that the House would realise the implications of this paragraph.  If it is adopted as it now stands it means that the whole of the outgoing Senators can, if they so desire, waive their constitutional rights of going automatically on the Panel and instead&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I mean to waive it for the time being or take advantage of submitting their names to a vote of the whole Seanad instead of taking advantage automatically of the constitutional right of going on the Panel. The advantage of that is that at least a number of the outgoing Senators would be absorbed in that way on the Panel of the 19 elected representatives of the Seanad and it would restrict the numbers on the final Panel which may be 76, or in certain circumstances may be as many as 79.  If the whole of the outgoing Senators who desire to go forward are absorbed in the Panel formed by the Seanad and the Dáil, then the number on the final Panel should not be more than 57 which would still be numerous enough.  There is in adopting this of course a certain amount of disadvantage to certain sections of out-going Senators.  There are, for instance, a few people going out who are probably not attached to any particular group in the House and who could hardly hope to get sufficient preferences to place them on the Panel at all, although they might, if placed on the Panel, get a good following in the country.  They might reasonably object to submitting themselves to an unfair test instead of exercising their undoubted constitutional rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are also a couple of groups, say 5, three of whom are outgoing, and if these three in each case desire to go forward for election here, they could not possibly hope from their own supporters to be elected on the Panel.  To that extent they would be turned down and if afterwards they exercised their constitutional right, it might be reasonably argued that they were more or less injuring themselves morally before the electors in being turned down by the people in this House who ought to know them best.  That is inevitable because of the constitution of the House. That is, practically half the House represents a particular section of the community who are not affected by this election at all or who are affected to a very limited extent.  They can put forward new nominations on the panel of 19, seven or eight of which may not be in respect of outgoing Senators.  I do not think it is desirable that all out-going <Col N="616" /> Senators should be placed on the Panel of this House.  It would be well to understand therefore that if the whole of the outgoing Senators who wish to go forward allow themselves to be nominated in the manner suggested they are, with their eyes open, of course, submitting themselves to a test which may be considered an unfair one from their point of view and that in the event of their being turned down, that is not an indication that they do not command the confidence of those whose confidence they might reasonably hope to command.  I think the effect of these resolutions would be that any Senator who so desires could have himself nominated by the Leas-Chathaoirleach or alternatively he can avail himself of the opportunity of being nominated by two Senators as provided in a subsequent paragraph of this report.  In either way he would be eligible for the election of the 19, or alternatively he could refuse to go forward in either way and merely exercise his constitutional right.  That is only a permissive arrangement.  It does not make it compulsory for any Senator to submit himself to that fair or unfair test.  It leaves it open to him, if he desires to reduce the number of the Panel from being unwieldy, and to avail himself of the ordinary method of nomination and election when this final election comes along on the 1st July.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel MOORE Colonel MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>First I have the complaint, the usual complaint, that this thing has been rushed on us in such a way that hardly half the Senators know what they are doing.  This Committee was appointed on the 30th April last.  It did not meet until the 3rd June.  During all that time, as far as I know, they might have met to consider these things during the summer months, and they might have sent out their proposals to Senators some time ago.  It is a matter that concerns very particularly a certain number of Senators.  It concerns us all in a general way.  It concerns the whole country, and I think it is a most unreasonable way for the Committee to have acted as they did. This morning Senators were talking together, and one-half of them did not understand this particular matter. <Col N="617" /> Now there is a question of restriction. This Constitution has been drawn up, and published, and the people of Ireland understood that the election to the Senate was going to be open competition at the end of the three years.  It is now proposed to limit it.</P>
      <P>The Senate is making certain arrangements by which this is to become a close borough, on which the other people of Ireland are not allowed to enter.  That may be the result of this Resolution.  If the Senate agrees to this Resolution you may have that result.  If all these retiring Senators are proposed by anybody, by, say, An Leas-Chathaoirleach or anybody else, and if the Senate agree to put these nineteen retiring Senators on the Panel, that would thereby exclude everybody else&mdash;that is, if they make these nineteen Senators the nominees of the Seanad-the nineteen nominees which the Seanad are entitled to have.  That will exclude nobody else that comes along, at all events from the Seanad. I am talking with a certain amount of ignorance that most people here have on this matter, and I am not very definite about it.  Nobody knows the result. On the other hand, if one votes for that, one is put in the position of practically limiting the Constitution and going out of his way to arrange the thing in a way that was not thought of by those who drew up the Constitution &mdash;that is, limiting the number of these that are to be put on the Panel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, one is put in the position here, if one does not agree with that, of voting practically against certain Senators with whom we have been sitting here, who are friends of ours, and whom we would be reluctant to vote against for personal reasons.  It would be an invidious thing if some of us would stand up and say: &ldquo;We will not agree to this Resolution, we will nominate our own batch.&rdquo;  That means voting against these people.  It puts us in an invidious position, and into a position in which people do not like to be put.  We all ought to know that the Constitution lays down the class of people who are to be elected on the Seanad.  We know there are a certain number of people outside who have <Col N="618" /> complied with these conditions and provisions.</P>
    <P>In one paragraph it is laid down that those who have done great work for the country should be put on the Seanad. Therefore, we can hardly assume that we have here all the talent of Ireland. People outside might reasonably expect to be given a chance to be put forward for election.  If we agree to this clause, or to the part of it that I have pointed out, we are putting ourselves in the position of being criticised by the whole country People would say: &ldquo;Here are Senators who were elected themselves, not by the votes of the people, but by the Dáil, and they are making it a close borough.  No one else is allowed to go up for election but these.&rdquo;  It may be said that only those who have a claim to be elected on the Seanad would go on the list proposed by An Leas-Chathaoirleach.  The Senate may unanimously vote that that is their panel, and that they will have no other panel.  I think that in the interests of the Senators this clause is undesirable.  That is a matter entirely for the Senate, and I have no right to dictate to any Senator going out what the advantage or disadvantage is.  I am only pointing out the view that will be taken by the critics in the country, if we adopt a certain measure.  It seems to me that we would be in a better position by allowing these candidates to go forward and take their chance with the country, as every one of us will have to do sometime.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to say, by way of explanation and answer to two points that have been raised by Senator Colonel Moore, that at the time this Committee was appointed, they were of opinion, and were so advised by me, that under the Constitution this election could not take place until after the 7th December.  The Executive Council, apparently, were of a different opinion, but they have come round now to the view that that is the proper time and the legal time under the Constitution.  Consequently they have introduced a Bill to enable them to carry out this election in October. Of course, had they followed the course which seems to be implied by the Constitution, <Col N="619" /> June would have been ample time for the Committee to meet.  It was not until it met that it was ascertained that the Government had come to this decision that the election should take place in October in anticipation of the vacancies in December.  That explains why the Committee did not meet until June.  At the same time I might also remind the House that I called attention to this matter fully six months ago, and suggested the formation of a committee. But no action was taken on it until very much later.  Then with regard to the other matter that Senator Colonel Moore suggested, that this election should be held on the principle known as the principle of &ldquo;go as you please,&rdquo; and that there should be the fullest opportunity for everybody being nominated, I should remind him that the Constitution provides to the contrary.  The Constitution provides: &ldquo;The method of proposal and selection for nomination shall be decided by Dáil Eireann and Seanad Eireann respectively.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The Constitution contemplated that there would have to be an elaborate provision made both in the Dáil and Seanad for the purpose of the carrying out of the provisions of the Constitution dealing with this election.  These are only matters of order that have been raised that I wanted to dispose of.  I want to get rid of the suggestion that there has been any delay on the part of your Committee. The moment that they ascertained that the Government proposed to have this election in October they did not lose a moment.  We took every opportunity of getting in touch with the Executive Council, and also with the Committee of the Dáil who are dealing with the same subject matter.  The Seanad has approved of my suggestion, that we take these paragraphs separately. If, on each paragraph, we are going to roam over the whole question we would never arrive at any conclusion. <Col N="620" /> It is quite pertinent for any Senator to deal with No. 2.</P>

      <P>To the extent that the suggestion is that An Leas-Chathaoirleach should propose, <i>en bloc,</i> the names of the retiring Senators or such of them as give their consent in writing, I wish to say that anything that would have a tendency to create in the minds of the people any feeling that this House, in its rules or in laying down any method of selection, wanted to restrict in any way the choice of the people in the election of Senators, any such suggestion that a Senator has his name put forward in that way, would have a bad effect.  The people, of course, will have the ultimate decision in this matter. We should do nothing here to give the impression that we are trying to establish a close borough, and we should do nothing here that would, in any way, prejudice, favourably or unfavourably, the chances of any retiring member of this House.</P>
      <P>To that extent it is fettering the free choice of the people.  Supposing that a member was turned down in this House, it goes without saying that that turning down would prejudice his election by the people.  There will probably be from 57 to 80 candidates. People far away in the west, the south, or the extreme east, would know only men prominent in public life, men whose names have appeared frequently in the Press.  The people at the time of the election will harp back to anything the Dáil or Seanad may have done with regard to certain members of the Seanad here.  If they find that the Seanad has turned down certain members that will be a little pointer for them, and in the absence of any knowledge they would say that they were turned down by their own colleagues, and that would prejudice them.  I think we ought not to do anything that would in any way limit or influence the ultimate choice of the people, or let the impression go abroad that we were in any way trying to give any undue advantage to any retiring member of the present Seanad.</P>

The suggestion was that by getting, or attempting to get, 19 on the panel a free choice was prevented.  This proposal does not suggest that the 19 members should be the sole selection.  The only thing it tries to do is to prevent a Senator from proposing 100 candidates, and in that way probably having as many as 3,000 candidates to select from, which is a thing, I am sure, nobody desires.  In addition to the 19 names, you would have probably 30 other persons selected.  That would be two for each member of the Seanad.  That would be a selection of 49 from which to select 19.  In addition, there would be 38 selected by the Dáil, so there is no reason why a prominent citizen of the Saorstát should not have the opportunity <Col N="622" /> of having his name submitted on the Panel.</P>

The only effect of the proposal that the An Leas-Chathaoirleach should nominate the names in the way proposed is to make it easier for any person willing to submit his name to the Seanad.  If you delete this without doing anything else then you will place the outgoing Senator in the position that he may fail to get a nomination.  If he wishes to submit his name to the Seanad he will have to find two Senators to sponsor him, but after this proposal he is placed in a better position than any other form of nomination, for he can easily have his name put forward if he so wishes.</P>

      <P>There is confusion, and I am not surprised, as the matter is complicated.  I quite agree that the Seanad has been more or less rushed in this matter, but this is not the Seanad's fault.  I think I can make it quite clear to the House, if they will allow me.  We are dealing with two separate lists.  The first is the original list.  That is the list of Senators proposed as candidates for the outgoing vacancies.  If you keep before your minds that that is the proposed list, as distinct from the selection or panel list, then you will see, I think, the difference.  There is nothing whatever that indicates, by putting a man on or off the candidates' list, if he is an out <Col N="623" /> going Senator, that the chances of his election to the final panel are in any way prejudiced.  The difficulty of the position that faced the Committee in making a recommendation was, we felt that it would be a very invidious thing to leave it to the chance that some Senators would propose for the proposal list one or more of the outgoing Senators, and that some of the outgoing Senators would not have their names proposed on the proposal list. We thought that would be an invidious task for the Seanad itself, and it would be an invidious matter for the outgoing Senators whose names were not put forward for the proposal list.  Accordingly we came to the conclusion that it would be desirable, if possible, to arrive at one course or other, and either to provide that they should go on the proposal or preliminary list automatically if they so consented, or that it should not be in the power of the Seanad to put on one or more of them, and in that event they should be left to their automatic right of joining the second list, that is, the Panel under the Constitution. That is the sole object we had in our minds.</P>

Outgoing Senators should not be entitled to have their names on the preliminary list, and in view of the fact that the Panel is formed, they have the right to have their names on the Panel.  If you once open the door for the selection of outgoing Senators you are penalising those who are not proposed for the preliminary list.  Therefore, the obvious course is to provide that no outgoing Senator shall be eligible for the proposal list.  Then you leave him his automatic right under the Constitution of joining the Panel when he is finished.</P>

      <P>Yes; the alterations in No. 2, which are consequential, shall be put in.  I mentioned I would fix the hours from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m., and from 2.30 to 5.30 every day in the interval between now and the 26th, except Sundays, when the office will be closed, and on Saturdays, when the hours will be from 10 to 1.  With regard to No. 5, I want Senators to see that it leaves open to them a method by which they can deliver their papers. While that allows them to send them by post, they will understand that they do so at their own risk.  A similar proposal to this has been adopted by the Dáil.</P>

      <P>We now come to the Schedule, and I am not going to ask the Seanad to go through it.  I confess I do not understand it, and I doubt very much if any Senators understand it.  I ought to mention that your Committee had the advantage, and a very great advantage it proved to be, of having the assitance of Mr. Wilfred Brown of the Local Government Department, who has had long experience in connection with this matter.  That experience was also placed at the disposal of the Committee of the Dáil. What is contained in the Schedule is an exact reproduction of what the Dáil agreed to on the subject.  The regulations do not differ in many respects from those adopted by the Dáil.  As to the counting of the votes, etc., we have, I might say, and I think wisely, followed the procedure fixed by the Dáil.</P>

      <P>There are no stereotyped regulations, but there are certain provisions in the Electoral Acts.  They are not included in these, because, if you refer to the Acts, this machinery, which is delicate machinery, is applicable solely to this particular matter of the election for 19 vacancies in the Seanad.  It is to be done on the principle of Proportional Representation, which has been followed all through. There are certain methods of dealing with transfer votes and so forth, and arithmetical calculations of the most minute kind, which, as I said, I do not profess to understand, and that I suggest the Seanad might wisely leave alone.</P>

In the case of a paper where the figures 1, 2, 3 are marked opposite names, and where a gap follows until the paper is again marked 6, 7, or 8, will you declare that paper a valid paper, and would it count for the candidates before whose names the figures appear notwithstanding the break in continuity?

      <P>It occurs to me, in view of our earlier decision reagrding the question of proposals, that there are 19 outgoing Senators.  I apologise for going back on this question, but as it is important, I ask leave to refer to it.  The proposals, under the rules that we have agreed on, will mean that at least 38 Senators must exercise their right to propose candidates for the election.  It may not be possible for 38 Senators to exercise their right under that, and in that event we would be placed in an awkward position if we had not 19 nominations.  This House must select 19 names.  I suggest that we alter the regulations so that each Senator could make a nomination, and that we abandon the regulation requiring the nomination to be made by two Senators.  If we make that change, and if 38 Senators exercise the right I have reffered to, then we will ensure that we shall have the requisite 19 names that this House must select.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>There is great force in what Senator Farren has said.  The Committee's recommendation was that the 19 outgoing Senators should have their names automatically placed on the list so that we would start with a list which had 19 names on it.  We then considered that it would not be right to have more than the maximum of 30 additional names. In other words to have 49 names upon our nomination panel, but you see we had come to the conclusion that the 19 names were not to go on it in any shape and what the Seanad agreed to was that each Senator could only propose one candidate.  In that event there would only be a maximum of 30 on your proposal list, and that is what Senator Farren has called attention to. He says that assumes that all the Senators will exercise their right to nominate, but he points out that supposing only 38 Senators exercised their right to nominate then you will have only 19 candidates proposed for the 19 vacancies.</P>

      <P>What the Senator desires is, I think, well worthy of consideration.  I think you should still adhere to the necessity of having each candidate proposed by not less than two Senators, but you might alter the provision which says that no Senator shall be entitled to propose more than one candidate&mdash;you might alter the one to two.  No Senator shall be entitled to propose more than two candidates.  If you make the change proposed, I do not think it will give you an unduly large Panel.  It is well, of course, to keep in mind that no Senator will be at liberty to propose more than one candidate, and so long as you require that each candidate is to be proposed by two Senators, the most that can be proposed under these Rules, assuming that the whole Seanad should vote, is 30.  That would have been all right if you had retained your provision about putting on the 19 outgoing Senators automatically, but you rejected that proposal.  Therefore, you have got to form your Panel without regarding the names of outgoing Senators, <Col N="655" /> and in that connection I think recommendation No. 3 ought to be altered so as to read instead of each Senator having the right only to propose one candidate, he or she should have the right to propose two.</P>

    <P>The bonds shall be redeemable at par in British currency together with the payment of all arrears of interest, and the Minister of Finance shall make arrangements for the redemption thereof within eighty years from the 18th day of December, 1924, by means of yearly or half-yearly drawings, and the said Minister may make regulations for the drawing of such bonds.  Such regulations shall provide for the immediate redemption of bonds transferred by order of the Judicial Commissioner in satisfaction of Death Duties, or in redemption of land purchased annuities charged on the lands acquired by the Land Commission under this Act:</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LINEHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few matters to which I want to refer, and for which I asked the indulgence of the Committee on this sub-section.  The sub-section provides that the bonds shall be redeemable at par in British currency together with the payment of all arrears of interest, and the Minister for Finance shall make arrangements for the redemption thereof within eighteen years from the 18th December, 1924, by means of yearly or half-yearly drawings.  The part to which I direct attention is the fixing of eighty years <Col N="658" /> as the time limit in which the bonds should be redeemed at par.  I think that as in other financial arrangements made under previous Land Acts, and every other security in the British Empire, the fact that no time limit is fixed for the redemption of the money, is a system which I think we ought to follow here, and leave to the Minister or the Government of the day the option of redeeming them whenever they thought fit.  The very fact of the fixing of this period of eighty years greatly enhances the value of the bonds, and correspondingly increases the liability of the tenants who will have to repay them.</P>

      <P>If I may interpose for a moment I would point out that the Land Act provides that bonds should be redeemed in 67 years odd.  It is presumed that we would be able to complete land purchased in 10 years' time.  The idea of the eighty years is simply that some bonds may be found to be so advanced as that they will be redeemed in 67 years.  Ten and sixty-seven are seventy-seven, so we say eighty years.  This particular provision has nothing whatever to do with the inflation of bonds.  It is simply <Col N="659" /> a provision under the Land Act of 1923.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasLinehan" hpid="Mr. LINEHAN Mr. LINEHAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LINEHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Land Act of 1923 was going through I suggested to the Minister an amendment fixing 67 instead of 80 years.  My amendment was not accepted.  The tenants will have to pay annuities at a rate governed by the interest at which the Sinking Fund will be invested.  There is nothing that shows that the tenants will have to pay only for 67 years.  I would not accept that statement unless it was put in writing.  The rate at which the Sinking Fund will be invested entirely determines the period during which the tenants have to pay their annuities, because the Act does not specify any term of years during which the tenants would have to pay.  It merely says that the annuities would have to be paid until the principal is repaid and until it ois certified by the Minister that such principal has been repayed.  The effect of binding the Government of this country to repay these bonds at the end of eighty years greatly enhances their value and correspondingly increases the tenants' liability. I, therefore, move that that portion of the paragraph referring to the eighty years' period be deleted.</P>

      <P>The fact is that annuities will be redeemed under the Act of 1923 within sixty-seven years.  That is a fact.  It is a matter of intricate calculation which we need not go into now.  There was an offer made to us to give a guarantee providing that redemption shall take place within eighty years.  That was the offer, and we accepted, because we know that we can complete land purchase within ten years.</P>

      <P>Has this anything to do with your amendment? You could put it as a question to the Mnister, but remember we are in Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasLinehan" hpid="Mr. LINEHAN Mr. LINEHAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LINEHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the annuities under this Act will be re-retained by the Free State Government here and not transferred to London, as the annuities under the other Acts have been.  I wish to know whether there will be any department for here to deal with this matter of the investment of the Sinking Fund, and also for furnishing the yearly reports of the investments in which they put this money, because at present if the Sinking Fund were iinvested in National Loan it would realise 5¼ per cent.  In that way, if it is always invested at the highest possible rate of the interest consistent with thorough the security it ought to diminish greatly the number of years during which the tenants will be paying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The troubles seems to be that Senator Linehan thinks that the Sinking Fund will be invested at 2, 3, 4, or anything up to 10 per cent., and that no one can say in what time the bonds will be redeemed.  That is not the position.  The Sinking Fund is used yearly to redeem bonds and, in fact, it is always invested at 4½ per cent.  It is used for the purpose of redeeming bonds and yearly drawings are provided for under the Land Act.  The money is, in fact, invested at 4½ per cent.  It is on that basis the calculations are made and it is on that basis that you are absolutely certain of the period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasLinehan" hpid="Mr. LINEHAN Mr. LINEHAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LINEHAN</NameTxt>

      <P>It was announced when we decided to adjourn until 3 o'clock on Tuesday that one of the items to be considered on that day would be the Report Stage of the Arterial Drainage Bill.  As you are aware, A Chathaoirligh, when we were discussing this Bill on the Committee Stage there was an important question in connection with it which was reserved for the Report Stage.  Perhaps you are not aware that the Local Government elections are taking place <Col N="662" /> throughout the country on Tuesday next and that many of us cannot attend here.  I cannot be here if I am going to exercise my duty as a voter on that day.</P>
