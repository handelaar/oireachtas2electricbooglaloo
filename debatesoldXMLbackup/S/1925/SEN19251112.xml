      <P>I have to read to the House the following letter which I have received from Mr. Dalton, the Clerk of the Seanad, dated yesterday:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dear Lord Glenavy,</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is with great regret that I have to inform you that I have no option but to place in your hands my resignation of the Office of Clerk to the Senate.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;As you are aware, owing to the state of my health as the result of military service, I have been, since the time of my appointment, unable to give the Senate the service which was due, and now I feel that the time has come when I must, most reluctantly, put an end to what must have been to you an impossible condition of affairs.  Unfortunately, my medical advisers do not hold out any hope of an improvement in my condition for a considerable time to come, and in fact have suggested that I should not spend another winter in this climate for some years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="946" />&ldquo;Please accept my most sincere thanks for your many kindnesses.  I much appreciate the consideration which you have at all times extended to me and your valuable help and advice, on which I have always felt I could rely.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a matter to which I would like to direct the attention of the Seanad, and it is in connection with our recent triennial election.  When the counting of the votes had been nearing its conclusion it was obvious to me, from certain observations that were attributed to the Returning Officer, that he was under the impression that his duty compelled him to hold up the declaration of the result until the 6th December next, his belief being that under the statute and regulations it would be his duty, in the event of any vacancy unfortunately occurring by death in the nineteen Senators elected, to return in place of the Senator so dying the candidate who was next in order on the voting.  I was not quite satisfied at the time that he was accurate in this, and after a very careful consideration of the statutes I came to the conclusion that he was wrong and that, once the counting of the votes had reached, in fact, its conclusion, he should there and then certify the result and publish the same in the <i>Gazette,</i> and that any vacancy that occurred after that date, and before the 6th December, should be filled by the Seanad under the Constitution as a casual vacancy and should not be left to be filled by the Returning Officer from the list of candidates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter, of course, was material, because had I allowed the thing to pass and a vacancy had occurred in the interval before the 6th December there would have been an inevitable controversy raised as to who was right with regard to the selection to fill the vacancy, and therefore I thought it my duty to bring my views to the attention of the Returning Officer.  I may say that what I am saying now in no way detracts, and I should be the last who would wish to detract, from the <Col N="947" /> credit that is due to that officer for the ability and courtesy he displayed throughout in the discharge of his novel and difficult duties.  All of us are liable to make mistakes; some of us perhaps do not acknowledge them, but in his case he at once got advice upon the position and he came to the conclusion that I was right.  Accordingly about a week ago he certified the result, so that the election was then in fact complete and the question of a possible controversy was, of course, at an end.  I mention it now for the purpose of satisfying the Seanad that as far as I was able to do it I safeguarded their rights and their position, and I mention it also so as to prevent the possibility of any similar mistake occurring in any future triennial election, when perhaps we might not have the same Returning Officer.</P>
    <P>The fact that this election was held in anticipation of the vacancies, that is to say, that it was held before the 6th December, before the outgoing Senators in fact retired and in anticipation of their retirement, has raised some complications with regard to certain of our Standing Orders, and it is for that reason that you will see on the Agenda to-day a notice of motion with a view to putting the matter right.  In the first place I will call your attention to our second Standing Order, which is the one that deals with the election of your Chairman and Deputy-Chairman. It reads in this way:&mdash;&ldquo;The Chairman and Deputy-Chairman shall be appointed at the first meeting of the Seanad to be held after each triennial election of the Members of the Seanad.&rdquo; That was, of course, drafted and passed at a time when we anticipated that these elections would always take place after the vacancies had occurred and not before, and consequently the &ldquo;first meeting&rdquo; would have been the meeting at which the newly-elected Senators would be entitled to attend and vote for that purpose.  But in the events that have happened we would be compelled, if that was not altered, to proceed to the election now, before the newly-elected Senators had taken their seats and could exercise a voice in the matter.  It is accordingly essential <Col N="948" /> that that should be changed, and a motion for the purpose is on the Order Paper.</P>
    <P>It also affected another important Standing Order, that is Standing Order 94, which provides that all Committees of the Seanad shall be deemed to be discharged at the date of a triennial election for the Seanad.  The result of that is this, that since last week, when the Returning Officer certified the result of the election and thereby concluded it, all our Committees have been automatically dissolved and have no power to meet unless reappointed.  In order to provide for that contingency in the future, on the assumption that future elections will be held in anticipation of the vacancies as on this occasion, you will find a motion on the Paper to deal with it and to provide that the Committees shall remain in office until the 6th December.  But to keep the thing perfectly right it will be necessary in addition to re-appoint these Committees, because they are defunct and will require to be revived by your motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryGuinness2" hpid="Mr. GUINNESS Mr. GUINNESS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GUINNESS</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that apply to any member of the Seanad who happens to be on a Joint Committee or Commission, such as the Commission in connection with the Greater Dublin area, or is it merely Committees appointed by this House?</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>My opinion &mdash;of course I can only give it to the best of my skill and knowledge&mdash;is that that has no application to Joint Committees, because they cannot be dissolved except by the joint operation of both Houses.  These Standing Orders must be read, I think, as only applicable to our Committees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BROWN</NameTxt>
      <P>As you have explained so fully the necessity for the alterations, I need not say any more about them.  I have only to explain what the Standing Order, as it at present stands, does and how it is proposed to alter it. The motion is:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the following alterations be made in the Standing Orders of the Seanad:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  Standing Order 2.  That the words &ldquo;each triennial election of members of the Seanad&rdquo; be deleted <Col N="949" /> and the words &ldquo;the commencement of each triennial period&rdquo; substituted therefor.</P>
    <P>(b)  Standing Order 94.  That the words &ldquo;shall be deemed to be discharged at the date of a triennial election to the Seanad&rdquo; be deleted and the words &ldquo;of the Seanad shall be deemed to be discharged at the end of each triennial period&rdquo; substituted therefor.</P>
    <P>Standing Order No. 2 at present reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The Chairman and Deputy Chairman shall be appointed at the first meeting of the Seanad to be held after each triennial election of members of the Seanad, unless the Seanad shall by resolution otherwise determine.</P>
    <P>The motion proposes that the words &ldquo;each triennial election of members of the Seanad&rdquo; should be deleted, and that the words &ldquo;the commencement of each triennial period&rdquo; should be substituted for them.  As amended the Standing Order would read:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The Chairman and Deputy-Chairman shall be appointed at the first meeting of the Seanad to be held after the commencement of each triennial period, unless the Seanad shall by resolution otherwise determine.</P>
    <P>That means that the election of the Chairman and the Deputy Chairman shall take place at the first sitting of this House after the 6th December.  The other Standing Order is No. 94, which deals with our Committees and their discharge after a triennial election.  It reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the termination of a session, committees shall continue in being until they shall have reported or been discharged by order of the Seanad: provided that all committees shall be deemed to be discharged at the date of a triennial election to the Seanad.</P>
    <P>What is now proposed is that the words &ldquo;shall be deemed to be discharged at the date of a triennial election to the Seanad&rdquo; be deleted, and that the words &ldquo;of the Seanad shall be deemed to be discharged at the end of each triennial period&rdquo; shall be substituted. Then the last clause of the <Col N="950" /> Standing Order would read:&mdash;&ldquo;Provided that all Committees of the Seanad shall be deemed to be discharged at the end of each triennial period.&rdquo;  I beg to move.</P>

      <P>I have pleasure in seconding the motion. Alterations in the Standing Orders are obviously necessary having regard to the conditions under which our first triennial election was held.  I do not know whether our future elections will be held under the same conditions&mdash; that is to say, that the date of the election shall be moved forward and the elections held at an earlier date than the vacancies occur, but whether that is so or not&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I had forgotten the terms of the Act, but inasmuch as it is apparent that it is to be permanent, it is obvious that we must change our Standing Orders to meet the situation.  What Senator Brown moves carries out the idea embodied in these Standing Orders when they were first drawn up, and the remark I make on this motion equally applies to the other amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>LEAS - CHATHAOIRLEACH (Mr Douglas)</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move that the Report of the Joint Committee on Standing Orders be now considered.  I think I can explain quite briefly the object of the Report and the reason that it was necessary to bring it in immediately. Under the existing Standing Orders persons who may apply for leave to introduce a Private Bill do so in the months of October and November. The existing Standing Orders gave permission during the first two years of the life of these orders also to apply during the months of March and April.  The two years' period will come to an end before next March and April, and questions have arisen as to what the position will be in March and April next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="952" /> The Joint Committee which generally has charge of matters relative to Private Business considered the situation and came to the conclusion that there was a general desirability that as far as possible leave should be applied for in the months of October and November. At the same time they recognised that there might be circumstances which would make it desirable that the permission to apply for a Bill in March and April should be continued and they therefore propose that the existing Order, which says two years, should be amended and provide that permission should be given, subject to the consent of the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Standing Orders.  The second proposal in the draft proposal is relatively unimportant and simple.  We are providing that there should be one taxing officer.  Generally costs are taxed by one of three and it is suggested in the amended Orders that the two Chairmen who appoint the person to act as taxing officer shall also be enabled to appoint two persons to act in his absence.  This is only a technical amendment for the purpose of expediency. If we pass this motion, I shall move three formal motions altering the Orders mentioned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BENNETT</NameTxt>
      <P>I might point out that some of us have not had an opportunity of discussing this Report and we can hardly say whether it refers to matters of urgency or not.  I think it will be better to postpone the adoption of the report until we have had an opportunity of considering it.  I cannot say at present what the amendment means.  This Report was handed to me when I came in here and I had no time to consider it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a considerable amount of reason in what you suggest, in view of the fact that it has only been circulated a few moments ago.  I have myself only seen it this <Col N="953" /> minute, and I do not think that it is so urgent that it could not wait until our next meeting.  Perhaps Senator Douglas would be in a position to tell us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>The position really is this: that the urgency affects persons applying for Private Bills who may wish to know when instructing their solicitors whether it will be possible to apply in March or April next.  The Committee, which is a Joint Committee of a representative character, met and went into the whole matter and it is actually a report from them.  If there is any great desire to postpone consideration of the matter&mdash;the only point is that certain persons have been inconvenienced&mdash;I have no objection.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OsmondGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Sir THOMAS ESMONDE Sir THOMAS ESMONDE">
      <NameTxt>Sir THOMAS ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I understand it merely amounts to this: supposing a Private Bill is introduced, and certain notices have to be given in March or April, if, in the circumstances in which we find ourselves, there is no Standing Orders Committee appointed in time to receive this Bill or to authorise it to be lodged, this amendment meets the case.  That is what I understand, and there can be no possible objection to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. FARREN Mr. FARREN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FARREN</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say that the Committee made this recommendation because of the fact that we believed it might be necessary to grant facilities for making application at two different periods in the year for lodging a Private Bill.  It was in order to facilitate the public generally that we proposed this amendment to the Standing Orders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasBennett" hpid="Mr. BENNETT Mr. BENNETT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BENNETT</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly. If it had not been a purely formal matter, I myself would have interrupted and made the objection, but having regard <Col N="954" /> to the fact that it is a purely formal matter, and that the amendments are useful, I think it would be desirable to pass them to-day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McLOUGHLIN</NameTxt>
      <P>In moving the adjournment of the House I desire to draw attention to certain aspects of the Boundary question which are exciting a good deal of public interest at present.  At the outset, I may say that I do not attach any importance whatever to the forecasts that have appeared within the past week in certain English newspapers, although these reports have caused considerable uneasiness and alarm throughout the Free State, especially in those areas which it is claimed are going to be annexed to what is called Northern Ireland.  These forecasts are such an outrage on justice that one must dismiss them at once as preposterous unless a complete violation of the Treaty is contemplated, and this I refuse to believe.  While I have not succumbed to the panic which seems to have seized several people in many parts of the country, still I confess I am somewhat disquieted by the fact that has emerged from an answer given by our respected President to a question put to him yesterday by the leader of the Labour Party in another place. According to that answer, although the <Col N="956" /> report of the Boundary Commission is shortly to be published, no attempt whatever has been made beforehand to carry out the terms of Clause 12 of the Treaty, which provides for the ascertainment of the wishes of the inhabitants before any area can be transferred. This clause is the corner stone of the Treaty, and was inserted specifically to ensure the application of the principles of self-determination and non-coercion to that section of the majority of the Irish people residing in the Six Counties.</P>
      <P>May I take this opportunity to contradict the statement that I saw lately in the Press, that the Treaty was the cause of partition.  The Treaty is not responsible for partition.  Partition was an accomplished fact six months before the Treaty was signed and the Belfast Parliament was opened by King George six months before the Treaty was signed.  The Treaty was an alleviation of partition and not the creation of it, and in Clause 12 was provided the machinery for alleviation. This has been made clear by the speeches of the Irish signatories to the Treaty.  In a speech delivered on the 3rd February, 1922, by the late Michael Collins, he said in reference to Clause 12:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Now there is nothing ambiguous about that clause.  The decision of the boundary line is a question for the inhabitants of the areas concerned to decide.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;At no time was there any question of being misled by Mr. Lloyd George.  I never went on any opinion of his on the subject.  It was a matter for the inhabitants of the areas involved and for them only.  The maps presented by the Irish Delegation to the British Delegation are clear and unquestionable.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The maps are marked on five different bases:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  Counties.</P>
      <P>(b)  Constituencies.</P>
      <P>(c)  County Council areas.</P>
      <P>(d)  Poor Law areas.</P>
      <P>(e)  Parishes according to religion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Our aim was clear.  Majorities must rule, and in any map marked on that principle under <Col N="957" /> the above headings we secure immense anti-partition areas.  If we go by counties, anti-partition has a clear majority in two of the six. Under the other headings the anti-partitionists gain very large areas in Down, Derry, Armagh, and, remember, that in the remaining area, Antrim and Belfast, there are large minorities of our people.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;These are facts, and we can only come to agreements on recognition of facts.  It is useless to think or say otherwise.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Two days previously Mr. Arthur Griffith had expressed himself in similar terms in reply to a deputation from Newry, South and East Down, and South Armagh.  He said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;He and Mr. Collins and their fellow delegates had urged the claims of these districts for weeks during the negotiations in London, and the result was that the Free State should extend over Ireland, that &lsquo;Ulster&rsquo; should have the option of voting herself out within a month, but that if she did so a Boundary Commission should be set up to decide if such districts would come into the Free State.  That was the position to-day also.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>You can see, therefore, the importance attached to this clause by Collins and Griffith, and also that the paramount object of it was to give effect to the wishes of the inhabitants by placing them under the Government they desire. How is this being done?  Rumour assigns to the procedure of Mr. Justice Feetham enlightenment on the subject&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would suggest to the Senator not to refer to the personnel of the Commission as the matter is still <i>sub judice</i> and they are the persons responsible for it.  While you may put your own construction and your own interpretation upon the terms of the Treaty or otherwise, I think it would be more judicious and perhaps more consistent with practice and procedure if you abstained from referring to the personnel of the Commission.</P>

      <P>Can I refer to them as the representatives of the <Col N="958" /> British Government and the representatives of the Free State?  I do not want, unduly, to labour or to make any attack on the personnel of the Commission, but it is very hard to deal with the Commission and leave out the personnel&mdash;to talk of Hamlet and leave out the main character. However, I will pass on.  What has been the procedure that the Commission has adopted to find out the wishes of the inhabitants?  It has been through the medium of the census of 1911.  This census gives the figures of the Protestants and Catholics in the various areas.  This, however, is not a theological question but a political one. The Secretary of the Commission has been recommended to the public as having taken part in the carrying out of the plebiscites under the Treaty of Versailles whether in Poland or in Schleswig, I forget which.  But would he be able to affirm that the Arbitration Commissioners under that Treaty ascertained the wishes of the inhabitants by the religious census of 1911? Although it is well over a year since the Boundary Commission began its work, not a single step has been taken to ascertain the wishes of the inhabitants in the only satisfactory way in which it can be done, and that is by a plebiscite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true geographic and economic conditions have also to be considered, but these could not arise until the wishes of the inhabitants had been ascertained.  To entitle the Commissioners to act on this point they must first find a conflict between the wishes of the inhabitants and economic and geographic conditions.  No attempt whatever has been made to take a vote of the population in any area.  No area has been defined as an area of opinion and the wishes of the inhabitants everywhere have been treated as naught.  I maintain that the failure to take by plebiscite the opinion of every man and woman in the disputed areas is a failure to carry out the Treaty.  I, therefore, say, as a keenly interested Ulster man, that the time has come when our Government should demand that Article 12 should not be broken by ignoring the wishes of the inhabitants.  Irish districts and Irish <Col N="959" /> counties are not to be shuttled about as islands and kingdoms were in ancient times in royal dowries.  Imaginary economics and imaginary geography cannot be allowed to be brought in to smother the wishes of the inhabitants. I have every confidence that our representative, Dr. MacNeill, will never be a party to the fixing of a Boundary that will not give reasonable effect to the wishes of the inhabitants.  His responsibility is a grave one, and it is not lessened by the fact that our Government have bound themselves to accept the findings of the Commission, although no similar declaration has been made by the Belfast authorities. I assume that our Government made that generous declaration subject to the reservation that Free State territory was not to be encroached upon, and subject to the wishes of the inhabitants being consulted in such areas as were to be transferred.</P>
    <P>But if, as is outlined in the forecasts in the Die-hard Press, advantage is to be taken of our agreement in advance, and if Mr. Justice Feetham thinks that because of that arrangement he has <i>carte blanche</i> to transfer Free State territory, overwhelmingly Catholic, without any consultation or any voice in its fate, to the tender mercies of the Orange Lodges, then I say it is time that our Government, through Dr. MacNeill, made a protest and lodged in writing a demand for a plebiscite.</P>
    <P>It is no answer to say that the Commission has no powers to take a plebiscite. They can get the powers as far as the Six Counties are concerned from the British Parliament, as the powers were got to appoint an additional Commissioner, and here in the Free State there should be no difficulty whatever, and no excuse for not taking a plebiscite. If that demand for a plebiscite is turned down, and if that protest is unavailing, I hold that Dr. MacNeill should break away altogether from the Boundary Commission, because the refusal to take a plebiscite will leave it only a palpable fraud.  If that is not done, and the Government do not resist to the death the imposition of such an outrage, then they will have forfeited <Col N="960" /> the confidence of the people, and deserve to be driven from office with ignominy. I do not want to criticise Mr. Justice Feetham or accuse him in his high responsible office of an attempt to shatter the foundations of the Treaty, but it is evident from the conclusions attributed to the Commission by responsible newspapers&mdash;newspapers in close touch with Downing Street&mdash;that there are forces at work urging that the old game of treachery and betrayal should begin again, and if they are successful we shall again witness the breach of another Treaty as large and as significant and as tragic as the breach in the Treaty of Limerick.</P>
    <P>Lord Salisbury said about the Parliament of 1782:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We had to concede the Irish Parliament in a moment of difficulty. The moment the difficulties were removed, of course we suppressed it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I sincerely trust that this policy will not prevail again.  Nobody is more anxious than I am that the friendship and good feeling which should exist between the two islands should be restored. Discontent in Ireland reacts on discontent in England with explosive results.  Whether the Treaty of 1921 is to leave behind it a harvest of beneficence or a harvest of evil depends on the letter of that Treaty being fulfilled in its widest sense.  I must say that the English Government as a Government has, up to the present, carried out that Treaty honourably, and I pray that now they will not allow it to be said or history to record that they imported an African judge to burst up its main clause.</P>

      <P>As no other Senator, apparently, desires to take part in the discussion, I now declare it closed.  Before we separate I desire to intimate to Senators present that they can now obtain their locker allotments, with the keys belonging to them, if they apply at the Clerk's Office.  The House now stands adjourned, but as far as I know it is not likely, I think, that we will have business for a meeting next week.</P>
