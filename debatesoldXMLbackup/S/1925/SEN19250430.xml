      <P>As I understand it is the intention of the Government, if possible, to wind up the proceedings of the present Session by the end of the month of June, I would like to express the hope that they will so arrange their programme of legislation that we will not be compelled to consider a number of Bills at very short notice at the end of the Session, but that they will be sent to us so as to give reasonable time to the Seanad to discuss and consider them.</P>
      <P>Another matter I want to mention is, that if the Seanad is to rise towards the end of June it is probable that we may not meet for a couple of months, and there is an election that must be held for certain vacancies in the Seanad at the end of the year.  Some machinery has already been provided for this election, but I am not satisfied that it covers all the ground.  I think it would be very important for the Seanad to appoint a committee at once which would look into this matter, consider it, and see what portion of the ground is uncovered and what additional provisions, if any, are necessary in anticipation of this election.  Perhaps some Senator would put down a motion to that effect for to-morrow, so that a committee might be appointed and got together as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I beg to move:&mdash;&ldquo;That the Dundalk Harbour and Port Bill, 1924, be considered on Report.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is not my function in any sense to describe or defend any of the Private Bills, but it has been suggested that it might be well if I were to explain briefly the position that this Bill now finds itself in, in view of amendments put down by a Senator.  Under the Private Bill Standing Orders, if at any stage of a Private Bill it is opposed, it is then postponed automatically, no discussion taking place until a further date to be fixed, or until the next meeting of the Seanad.  If then it is again opposed, it is postponed until a date to be fixed by the Chairman.  But, as I am now moving that the Bill be considered on Report, and if no opposition is taken to that motion, it does not seem to me that the moving of amendments on the Report Stage could be considered as in any sense opposed to the Bill.  It is, therefore, my opinion that the amendments could be or should be immediately considered, they having been on the Order Paper for a considerable time.  There is a further provision that if any amendment moved on the Report Stage is one of substance, or introduces new matter, it shall be referred back to the Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It does not seem to me that these amendments of Senator Farren come under that category for the following reasons:&mdash;In the first place these were amendments which were inserted during the time the Bill was before the Committee.  They were, in fact, inserted in what is known in Private Bill parlance as the &ldquo;filled-up Bill,&rdquo;<Col N="3" /> which is a Bill with agreed amendments which are submitted to the Committee by the promoters, generally as a result of agreement with opponents of the Bill, or of certain sections.  Certain matter was introduced and passed by the Committee as the Bill comes back to us, and the effect of Senator Farren&rsquo;s amendments will be to delete from the Bill certain matter which was thus introduced.  It, therefore, seems to me, having carefully considered the matter, and consulted with the Examiner on the matter of the Standing Orders, that it is now in order to discuss in the Seanad Senator Farren&rsquo;s amendments if the Seanad agrees to my motion that the Bill be considered on Report.</P>

      <P>I have no doubt that Senator Douglas has correctly stated the law applicable to this matter.  Senator Farren&rsquo;s amendments do not introduce new matter, but are amendments which, if passed, would delete matter introduced in Committee. Therefore, they do not come under the category of amendments that introduce new matter, and the Senator is quite in order I think in moving them.</P>

      <P>Before the Senator moves his amendments might I ask would it be possible to adjourn consideration of them for a very short time, as the Chairman of the Committee before whom this Bill came (Senator Jackson) is not here, but will be here in a few minutes?  I think it is important that he should be here, because I understand that some of the questions that will arise could not be fully explained if he were not here.  He has asked me to make this application.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>Since this Bill was introduced the Minister has extracted some of its worst fangs, and eliminated some of its ugliest features. When he saw it in cold blood, even he realised or was shocked at its appearance and certain of its possibilities. Notwithstanding the extensive amendments that have been made, I think the Bill still has many sinister aspects and serious possibilities.  It should be the policy of all good citizens at present to get away from that atmosphere of hatred and revenge associated with the civil war.  That is necessary in order to create that feeling of security which is so essential to the prosperity and, indeed, to the existence of the State. You do not create a sense of security by enacting an elaborate and vigorous penal code, any more than you do by multiplying in a hurried manner implements of war.  On the contrary, I think by adopting a measure like the one before the House you tend to suggest the possibility of a recurrence of all those things that make for destruction and insecurity.  It is quite plain from the general aspect of the measure that it has been conceived in a spirit of war, in an atmosphere of civil strife.  The amendments which have been suggested by the Minister himself indicate that he changed his mind considerably from the time that he first suggested the draft of the Bill to the draughtsman.  His explanation to the effect that one generally asked for more than he expects is an extraordinary explanation from a responsible Minister in reference to a Bill of this kind, where the safety of the State is concerned, and where the liberty of the subject is at stake.</P>
      <P>In my opinion, the whole Bill is ill-timed. When you are going to legislate for the future in a vital matter of this kind&mdash;one of the first importance not only to the State but to its citizens &mdash;it should be considered in a calm and collected way, far removed from the incidents with which it is intended to deal.  Otherwise, human nature being what it is, it is almost impossible, it is certainly unlikely, that a measure which will be good for the State, and at the same time fair and equitable to its individual citizens, can be enacted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first few sections, the first particularly, breathe the spirit of death in <Col N="5" /> every line.  The death penalty covers a wide range of offences, and, what is more extraordinary, is the fact that the court is allowed no discretion.  It is death or nothing.  One can quite conceive that the same offence may be, technically at all events, committed with varying degrees of guilt, and to deprive the court of discretion in any case of that kind is certainly prejudicing justice. Again I think that goes to show that the Bill has been conceived in a civil war spirit, and that if the Minister had given himself a greater opportunity of getting away from that time when he introduced so many ugly ducklings&mdash;some of them might have been necessary&mdash;he might have turned out an instrument that would make for greater safety and security, and at the same time ensure as far as that is possible that no citizen would be treated with undue severity or injustice.</P>
    <P>I approve as absolutely necessary the provision governing secret societies in the Army and police, but I would like to know how it is proposed, if it is proposed at all, to apply the Bill to present members of the Army.  It is no secret that there are secret societies within the Army and that prominent officers are members of these societies. One would like to know whether it is the intention when this Bill becomes an Act to submit each member of the Army to a test as to whether he at the present time belongs to any of these societies.  I take it this is not retrospective legislation, and if an Army officer has been a member of a secret society up to the present, he may argue that was not a crime at the time and that he could continue in the society. That may be a strange interpretation of the Bill, but it is certainly one that may fairly logically be placed upon it.  I wonder if the Minister would have the firmness to put this Bill to such a test in its practical application.</P>
    <P>The other section dealing with secret societies can in the hands of a strong anti-Labour Government be used with harshness and injustice as far as trade unions are concerned and especially in respect of trade union business that trade unionists desire to conduct in private. It is quite clear to anyone that an interpretation can be placed on certain <Col N="6" /> sections of the Bill whereby every trade union will have to make public, particularly at the request of any responsible Government authority, the nature of their proceedings.</P>
    <P>Particularly obnoxious is the sub-section referring to people inciting civil servants to refuse or to neglect to perform their duties.  At first it was argued that this had no reference whatever to trade unionism within the Civil Service.  The Minister for Finance, with his usual frankness, frankly declared that it did mean that a strike was prohibited and that to that extent it was a direct interference with trade union rights of civil servants.  Apart altogether from the merits as to whether civil servants should have a right to strike at all, I do not think this Bill is the place to deal with regulations of that kind.  The Minister for Finance has power to make regulations prohibiting strikes if he so desires under Section 9 of the Civil Service Regulations Act, 1924.  The section reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister for Finance may from time to time make regulations for controlling the Civil Service of the Government of Saorstát Eireann,&rdquo;</P>
    <P>and so forth, and any of these regulations may include prohibition to withdraw labour except on penalty of dismissal. Why is there this insinuation that the Civil Service is honey-combed with sedition?  The Minister for Justice, speaking at Dun Laoghaire on January 10th, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I would like to say of the Civil Service that if all ranks had not worked with good will and loyalty we would not be as far on the road to recovery and reconstruction as we are at present.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On the same day the Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe), speaking at Carlow, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There had never been any failure on the part of civil servants to carry out the policy of the Government as they were directed to do.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In view of these unsolicited testimonies from the two Ministers who have taken the most prominent part in defending this sub-section, it seems very strange that each of them should <Col N="7" /> consider it necessary to bring into a Bill dealing with treason a regulation that is tantamount to governing the affairs of the Civil Service.  The civil servants are undoubtedly discontented, but that is no reason to say that they are seditious.  They have been deprived of many things that their colleagues in Great Britain enjoy.  They have been deprived of Whitley Councils, and are denied access to the Minister except in a form that they very emphatically object to.  Now comes along this penal measure which, in fact, brands them as being infected with sedition.  I think that is an insult to the service, and tends to create disaffection rather than prevent it.</P>
    <P>On the whole, I think it would be better if the Minister would leave well enough alone and not anticipate all those terrible possibilities that seem to be giving him such worry.  The State is always able to deal with many of the things which the Bill seems to think possible, and it is not going to make for our credit abroad, any more than it is going to promote security and good work at home, to enact this vigorous penal code at the moment.  I do not know when it will be considered good policy to adopt towards our own countrymen with whom we do not agree the same policy of forgiveness and forgetfulness that we have adopted towards our late foreign enemies.  Surely the time must come sometime, and I think it has come now, when the same policy should be adopted in respect of enemies of the State within as has been adopted to the late enemies of the State without.  This is no mere sentiment or excess of tenderness of heart.  It is just good practical common sense and good statesmanship and patriotism in a useful although unpicturesque form.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister, because of his very keen contact with what he would term sedition and what was sedition in many forms during the past couple of years, finds it much more difficult to get away from that warlike atmosphere in which he revelled than it is for the ordinary citizen whose mind has not been so taken up with these affairs as the Minister&rsquo;s.  The citizen would thank him very much more if he did not stir up these smouldering <Col N="8" /> fires which have been settling down because of the fact that no wind has fanned their embers.  This Bill in many respects has been a godsend to certain people, because it holds out a prospect of future martyrs.  This is a great land for martyrs.  We are constantly glorifying dead heroes and starving live ones, and this offers further opportunity.  In that respect I think the Minister has undoubtedly given something to his political opponents that they should thank him for. I think if he had not taken out some of the sections which he has seen fit to take out, they would thank him to a greater extent.  It will be necessary to move certain amendments on the Committee Stage, but on the whole I would suggest that the Bill is ill-timed, and that some further time should have been given before an enactment of this kind was introduced which, on the face of it, is unnecessary now and which everyone hopes will not be necessary again for a very considerable time.</P>

      <P>With reference to the statement that it will be necessary to put down certain amendments to this Bill, I had intended to ask the House to take this Bill in Committee to-morrow.  I do not want to force that idea on the House if there is any substantial objection to it.  I mention it for this reason, that unless amendments are received by the Clerk within an hour it will be impossible to have them circulated for to-morrow. It is advisable that the amendments should be on the Order Paper.  I mention that so that if the House is satisfied to consider this Bill to-morrow it can be considered.  Some amendments have come in, and any others should be sent in at once.</P>

If we do not meet to deal with this in Committee to-morrow I do not think that we will have any other business.  I think it is rather a pity to bring Senators here for one day if we can avoid it.  I do not wish to rush the measure, but if Senators could leave it over for the Committee Stage it would, perhaps, meet the convenience of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BenjaminHaughton" hpid="Mr. HAUGHTON Mr. HAUGHTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HAUGHTON</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to endorse the remarks of Senator O&rsquo;Farrell with regard to capital punishment.  In any remarks which I have to make on the subject I do not wish to convey the idea that I am not in agreement with the common feeling of the country.  I wish to express appreciation of the way in which the Minister in charge of the Bill has endeavoured to meet the wishes of the Dáil on this subject in lessening to some extent the penalties in this Bill.  I think opinion is rife in this country, and there is a growing feeling across the water, that capital punishment should be abolished for all crime, and that the alternative of penal servitude should be largely adopted.  I would like also to remind the House, apart from agrarian or political crimes, <Col N="10" /> that there have been very few sordid cases of murder here such as have been perpetrated in other countries.  I believe that in this country we should face this question of the total abolition of capital punishment.  The majority of countries in Europe, and a number of the States across the ocean, have for years adopted this course with satisfactory results.  Across the water our sister nation, Great Britain, claims the extreme penalty for treason, murder, and the destruction of Government hospitals and dockyards.  There is a growing feeling, however, in favour of the total abolition of the death penalty.  One hundred years ago, or a little more, there were 180 offences for which people suffered the extreme penalty.  In this enlightened age the words of a celebrated legal authority sound singularly absurd.  When opposing a Bill for the abolition of the death penalty for stealing, Lord Ellenborough, in addressing the House of Lords, used these words, &ldquo;Your lordships will pause&rdquo;&mdash; this was in the year 1833&mdash;&ldquo;before you consent to a measure pregnant with danger to the security of property. The learned judges are unanimously agreed that the expediency of justice and the public security require that there should be no remission of capital punishment on the part of the criminal law.&rdquo;  On its abolition, we all know that stealing and other offences for which the death penalty was inflicted did not increase, but, on the contrary, largely diminished as social conditions improved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I submit to the Minister that it is not necessary for us to follow Great Britain slavishly, much as I personally respect its law, though not in all details such as these.  We should strike out for ourselves, set them an example, and help those who are trying to bring this much-desired reform, the abolition of capital punishment, about.  I also agree with what Senator O&rsquo;Farrell has said as to the effect of capital punishment in making heroes and martyrs of men. In my area in the south of Ireland, and I expect in other parts of the country as well, demonstrations are annually taking place for a deed that was committed in Manchester many years ago, and for which Allen, Larkin <Col N="11" /> and O&rsquo;Brien were hanged upon the scaffold, because they were members of a crowd that attacked a prison van, with the result that a sergeant of the police was killed.  Such things as that ought to be avoided, and such things as occurred only a few weeks ago when the Home Secretary, Sir Joynson Hicks, had petition after petition sent to him signed by hundreds of thousands of people pleading for the life of a wretched criminal in Hull.  The name of the man, I think, was Smith.  He fought during the great war, and proved his bravery in the battle field. Because his wife was unfaithful he killed her in a fit of frenzy.  Another man who was drunk split his wife&rsquo;s head open and received a sentence of 10 years penal servitude, while this poor ex-soldier was sent to the scaffold.</P>
    <P>I think that the Minister, and the Executive Council, should recognise that it would be much easier to obtain verdicts in difficult cases if the people knew that the extreme penalty would not be inflicted, but that a person in the dock would be sent to penal servitude for life.  Then, perhaps, in subsequent years, when the country would quieten down, the prerogative of mercy might be availed of.  These sentiments have been passing very much through my mind, and I think that the Minister would be well advised in visualising the future of this country to see, as I am sure the majority of the people of this House do, that there is a bright future before it.  We appreciate fully the improved condition of the country as compared with twelve months ago, largely owing to the services the country has received from the Ministry.  I trust, therefore, that the Ministers who have shown such amazing courage will also take their courage in both hands on this important question.  We all appreciate what the Minister has done in meeting the Dáil in this matter, and I hope that he will also meet us in abolishing this penalty of death, and accept the amendments that have been handed in substituting penal servitude for life, or such lesser sentence as the judge at the trial may deem suitable to meet the case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EarlofMayo" hpid="The EARL of MAYO The EARL of MAYO">
      <NameTxt>The EARL of MAYO</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill <Col N="12" />&ldquo;to declare divers acts of a treasonable nature or otherwise injurious to the State to be offences, and to make provision for the punishment thereof, and for other matters connected therewith.&rdquo; I do not see very well how you can deal with treason unless you have an Act.  After all, it must be admitted by everybody that treasonable offences have been committed in this country since the Free State was established.  We have a written Constitution; on the other side there is no written Constitution, and treasonable offences have been dealt with by successive Acts of Parliament, one of them a very old one indeed, which even now has not been repealed.  Senator O'Farrell spoke of sub-section (f) of Section 3, which reads as follows: &ldquo;Incites any person in the Civil Service (other than a police force) of the Government of Saorstát Eireann to refuse, neglect or omit to perform his duty.&rdquo;  Naturally, civil servants, who are paid by the Government, must, to put it quite plainly, behave themselves and not join in strikes.  I do not see why Senator O'Farrell should quote from speeches of the Minister for Finance that he made when he was not dealing with this Bill at all.  However, I do not fathom Senator O'Farrell&rsquo;s arguments in any way.  He wound up by saying that the Bill was ill-timed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole truth of it is that we must have an Act to deal with treasonable offences.  We have nothing of the kind. I have just said to the Minister, &ldquo;Have you an Act dealing with treason?&rdquo; and he said, &ldquo;No, we have not.&rdquo; One cannot allow treason to be carried on in our country.  We have had experience of it, terrible experience, and we cannot allow it to go on.  If you do not have an Act to deal with it, it will go on.  There is no use in applying a little sub-clause to general strikes, which have nothing whatsoever to do with the Civil Service.  Everybody has a right to strike; the question is whether it is sensible to do so.  Senator Haughton quoted a speech by Lord Ellenborough, made in the year 1833.  Well, hanging was very easy in those days, because people were hanged for sheep-stealing. It seems to me to be stretching the point rather far to go back to a speech made <Col N="13" /> so long ago.  Of course Senator Haughton has every right to object, as many people do, to capital punishment. Many people think that it is very wrong, and they are entitled to their opinion.  The truth of it is, that it is the law on the other side, and I am afraid that we must have that law on this side, because if we did not, it is very likely that gentlemen who commit murder on the other side would slip over here, and that is not a very agreeable prospect for people living here.  I shall support the Bill most decidedly, and I am astonished at my friends on the Labour Benches making such a fuss about a matter which is really a very serious one, because of the fact that we have no method of dealing with treason.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKenny" hpid="Mr. KENNY Mr. KENNY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>A previous speaker interpreted this Bill, in connection with Section 1, sub-section (2), in a manner that I think the context does not warrant.  Senator O'Farrell, if I understood him aright, said that any tribunal trying a person charged with any of the offences enumerated here would appear to have no option but, as he put it, death or nothing, as punishment for the proved offence.  The wording of the clause is: &ldquo;shall be guilty of treason and shall be liable on conviction thereof to suffer death.&rdquo;  I take it that that does not mean that it is not within the discretion of the tribunal to impose a lesser sentence.  The maximum certainly would be death, and there would be nothing more extreme than that.  In all legislation you will find maximum penalties that are rarely, in practice, ever inflicted.  In sub-clause (3) you find a maximum penalty of £500, which may be inflicted for a certain offence described there. In practice we find and we know that tribunals rarely, if ever, inflict the maximum penalty.  It is introduced to act as a deterrent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Persons feel that under certain circumstances that maximum may be applied, but under the fishery laws, and other laws that were made, which contain extremely high maximum penalties, from my experience I have found the maximum fine of £100 or £50 reduced to 1/-.  The offences in connection with which the death <Col N="14" /> penalty is liable to be inflicted, it will be noted, refer to the levying of war on the State.  There may be some in disagreement with the death penalty, but in the case of murder, cold-blooded, with malice aforethought, and premeditated murder, I do not think anybody will disagree with it.  One could quote Scripture in approval of the death sentence in circumstances like that.  But what does the person do who actually engages in levying war against the State?  What are the possibilities and probabilities of the policy that he incites and instigates?  What are the possible and very probable results of that policy if it should fructify or arrive at maturity?  It will result in the spilling of at least some innocent blood.  So that the person who does that knows that as a logical result of his action innocent people must inevitably be done to death.  We have these offences in connection with which the death penalty may be imposed confined to the levying of war, the incitement of war against the State, and I for my part cannot see that anything short of the death penalty&mdash; and if there were any penalty more extreme than that I would advocate it&mdash; should be meted out to the person or persons convicted of any of these offences.</P>
    <P>Coming to sub-section (3) of Section 1, &ldquo;every person who encourages, harbours or comforts any person engaged in the levying of war,&rdquo; is, I think, a sentence that may require to be amplified or qualified, because it is difficult to know what the word &ldquo;comforts&rdquo; means in that connection.  With regard to clause 8, dealing with secret societies, we have a secret society defined as &ldquo;an association, society, or other body, the members of which are required by the regulations thereof to take or enter into, or do in fact take or enter into, an oath, affirmation or declaration not to disclose the proceedings or some part of the proceedings of the association, society or body.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I was at one time a member of a society that came within that definition then, and that possibly comes within that definition now.  I was expelled from that society.  It was a very celebrated case in the law courts.  I <Col N="15" /> contested the right of those who were in authority to expel me.  It was my case against the A.O.H. Society.  It was fought out, and I think it will be in the recollection of some Senators here that it was fought out some years ago.  I know that there are some parts of the proceedings of that society that members are bound under a declaration and oath not to disclose&mdash; under a very solemn declaration. I question whether the doors of the A.O.H. Society would not be closed or that they may be compelled to alter their constitution and their Standing Orders if this Bill in its present form is given effect to.</P>
    <P>I think there can be no question at all about the Masonic Order&mdash;that so far as that society goes, in Ireland it has always been looked upon as a secret society, and I think that without any knowledge of its inner working it may possibly be found to come within the definition here.  That would be a very serious thing for that society.  I think the definition or the wording of the definition requires some alteration.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, the Bill has my approval.  It may be said that legislation should not be of a panicky character or that it should not be introduced in any special circumstances to deal with those special circumstances.  That may be a sound argument, and it may be argued that legislation should have a wider outlook and should have a wider forecast and should be of a permanent character.  I think you will find that condition of affairs in all countries owing to political and other changes and agitations.  Every Government has found at times the necessity of introducing special legislation to deal with special circumstances or with the special conditions in which they find themselves.  A Senator quoted the eulogium by the Minister regarding members of the Civil Service.  Well, generally speaking, I think it was deserved.  But those Senators who have not the knowledge possibly that the Minister or the Executive Council has, know of certain currents that are flowing even now in the Civil Service, of the doings of certain individual members of that service.  I have no <Col N="16" /> doubt that certain Clauses of this Bill which read rather drastically and seem uncalled for from the point of view of the knowledge of the general public, would be absolutely justified if the general public and if Senators knew all that the Ministers know.</P>

      <P>I suppose everybody will agree that it is desirable that the position of the State with regard to revolting citizens should be put in order.  We have gone through a very bad time, and we have had legislation, hurried legislation, very often, and legislation which, to my mind, was undesirable. I think all these rules and regulations and laws do not depend altogether on matters of principle and matters of law and points of justice, but on policy.  It is very often undesirable to put in force laws at certain periods.  I opposed these Bills for certain reasons, and I believe now as much as ever that I was justified in doing so.  I oppose this particular measure because I think it is an undesirable time, and that the conditions are unfavourable for putting it in force.  There are times when any amount of compulsion and any amount of severity may be justified.  We had it in the past, and during the period of fighting between one country and another measures were adopted which no ordinary person would justify in ordinary cases but which were justified in the particular circumstances of those cases.  Many of us did not flinch facing and supporting them in the case where they were necessary for the freedom of this country.  In the present case I do not see that it is at all wise, or that it is the proper time to bring in these Bills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everyone of us knows that there are a great many people who do not agree with us and who will not come into the Dáil at the present moment, but who would like to come in.  These people are not likely to be induced to come in by threatening measures, by threats of hanging them and shooting them and doing all such things.  The Minister, I suppose, knows that as well as I do.  There was a time when Ministers stated how desirable it was that these people should come into the <Col N="17" /> Dáil, and how much easier it would be for the country if it were so.  I think the Ministers have changed their minds; I think the last thing they wish for now, for their own political reasons, is that these people should come into the Dáil.  I must confess that I think this Bill was brought in at this particular time for the very purpose&mdash;it was just before the election&mdash;of preventing these people from coming into the Dáil.  The Minister has not spoken.  I think you, sir, suggested at one time that Ministers should explain their Bills.  He has not explained it here.  I think that is unfortunate, because there are certainly several points in it which I do not understand, and which I hope will be explained by the Minister.  Now Section 1, sub-section (2), reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Every person who, being a citizen of or ordinarily resident in Saorstát Eireann, commits outside Saorstát Eireann any of the acts mentioned in the foregoing sub-section (other than levying war against Saorstát Eireann) shall be guilty of treason and shall be liable on conviction thereof to suffer death.</P>
    <P>It makes exclusions there, very extraordinary exclusions, &ldquo;other than levying war against Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo; Now, any person living in Saorstát Eireann who declares war against the State is liable to be punished by death. But citizens of the Saorstát who are living outside the country may declare war and cause a great deal of trouble to the Saorstát without being liable to suffer the death penalty.  I confess that is a matter that I do not understand. Does it mean that if this country is invaded and if a citizen of the Saorstát goes out and joins the opposing forces and attacks this country, that he is not to be subject to any penalty? There may be some explanation of that, but I do not understand it.  I think those people who keep themselves clear, and the Seanad should take care to be guarded, should be subject to the same punishment as those who raise up a rebellion in this country.</P>
    <P>The next sub-section is rather indefinite: &ldquo;Every person who encourages.&rdquo; That person may not know anything <Col N="18" /> about it.  There ought to be some amendment of that sub-section.  Under Section 3, for certain offences against the State, such as refusing to obey certain orders from a commanding officer, the same punishment is provided.  Anybody who has had experience of military law knows that there is no offence which varies so much as that.  It might cover most extraordinary things.  It might cover the action of some person who deliberately refuses to obey the law with treasonable intent and who disobeys a direct order of a superior officer.  It also might cover the offence of a man who has some fatigue duty to carry out, such as carrying away ashes, and who, when some person says to him not to be bothered doing that, walks away and does not do it.  Both these people would be subject to the same penalty.  In all military law that I know of there is a great distinction made in cases like that.  In English military law they are put into two entirely different classes.  One would be punished by the severest penalty and the other by a light penalty.  Acts like these should be provided for under different headings.</P>
    <P>Another matter that I would like the Minister to consider is the refusal to obey orders given by a superior officer. All orders are not lawful.  A superior officer may give unlawful orders.  That does not seem to be recognised in this country, because during the last military performances here people seemed to think that if an officer gave a junior an order to commit murder, or to commit acts that he had no right to do, the junior was bound to obey.  Nobody is bound to obey an order which is not lawful.  For instance, if a senior officer orders a man to shoot into a peaceful crowd it is an unlawful order and the person who receives the order is entitled to refuse to obey it.  There are amendments of that sort necessary in the Bill even if it is passed.  I do not think that any Executive Minister should be allowed to give certain orders &mdash;I should say it is the Minister for Defence.  I wish the Minister would consider these matters and give some explanation.  Another matter which I do not understand is, that certain people are to be tried in the same way <Col N="19" /> as if they were being tried for murder. Probably there is some legal explanation for that, but to me it means nothing.  Perhaps the Minister will explain what it means.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBagwell" hpid="Mr. BAGWELL Mr. BAGWELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAGWELL</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many points in this Bill which can be considered in Committee and which it is desirable should be closely considered. Broadly speaking, I should like the Minister to know that some Senators consider this a good and necessary Bill. There could hardly be any greater crime than civil war.  Murder may only involve one death, but civil war involves many deaths, widespread suffering and unhappiness, all of which we have very recent experience of in this country.  It is true that the Bill gives power to impose the death penalty for a fairly wide range of offences, but, as has already been stated, there will be a final appeal to the Minister, and it is optional with him to say whether it should be enforced.  I doubt whether the death penalty would be inflicted where there were extenuating circumstances. Reference has been made to the abolition of the death penalty.  In my opinion it is just as necessary that that penalty should be retained for murder as it was necessary that it should be abolished for theft in the early part of the nineteenth century. Theft and murder are two different crimes.  I think it is agreed in all civilised countries that there is no greater or graver crime than murder. I think if a man takes another man&rsquo;s life it is fair punishment that his life should be also taken.  Apart from that, the death penalty is a deterrent.  I do not think any argument can be put up that penal servitude for a crime is a greater deterrent.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to the undesirability of celebrations such as took place on occasions of executions. I do not know that they do anyone any great harm.  People&rsquo;s opinions differ in every country as to political crime, and I do not think any great harm is done by that kind of expression of feeling. If a man is put into prison for murder, and if an effort is made to get him out, I think there is an advantage in having to deal with one Minister.</P>

      <P>I rather regret that I was not present at the opening of the Seanad proceedings to-day.  I had one or two questions in the Dáil, and as I thought there was a possibility of supplementary questions arising out of them I thought it better to be present myself.  I could have, of course, as Senator Moore suggested, spoken briefly in exposition of the Bill, and possibly to do so would have been helpful in the discussions.  On the other hand, the Bill has been a long time before the public and in the hands of Senators.  One Senator, I think it was Senator Moore, when speaking reminded us that the Bill was before the public when the recent bye-elections were held.  Of course, there can be different opinions as to the extent to which the Bill affected the result of the recent bye-elections.  I, of course, have very definitely my own view, as I have no doubt Senator Moore has his view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main criticism of the Bill was that it was ill-timed and unnecessary. On the question of time, the Public Safety Acts, within which the State has defended itself and dealt with certain offences over the last two years, have expired.  One of them expired in January of the current year and the other on the 26th of this month.  The legal position is, these Acts having expired, that the State has no power by which to deal with many of the offences set out under this Bill.  The Executive Council has responsibility for the safety of the State, for the welfare of the State, for the peace and dignity of the State, and, in the discharge of that responsibility is bound to come to the Dáil, and subsequently to the Seanad, for all the powers it deems necessary for the due discharge of these responsibilities. Consequently, it is simply in the routine discharge of our duty and our responsibilities to the people that we come with this Bill to the Seanad. So much for the question of time.  It is simply that the occasional temporary Acts having expired, we are faced with the situation that we require statutory and adequate power to deal with offences against the State.  One would think that the proper thing to do was to live in a world of make-believe and <Col N="21" /> to tell ourselves that these offences are not occurring and that to contemplate their occurring in future is to contemplate something so highly improbable and so much outside the range of probability that one ought not waste the time of the Seanad or the Dáil in providing for them.  That is not my conception or the conception of the Government as to the way in which we should discharge our responsibilities. These offences have occurred in the recent past, and they are capable of occurring in the future, and, facing the facts, we seek statutory power to deal with them when and where they arise, while sharing all the hopes that have been expressed that they will not arise.</P>
    <P>I am told that the Bill is conceived in a spirit of hate, conceived in a war spirit, and in the next breath I am told that it is a godsend to the opponents of the State and of the Government.  I am prepared to recognise that when the Bill was introduced many opponents of the State and many political opponents of the Government, believed that it was a godsend.  They believed that for a week, or possibly for ten days or a fortnight, and then somehow they ceased to believe it.  It gave them something to talk about.  They went up and down the country and talked about the &ldquo;green Coercion Act.&rdquo;  The people went home, however, and talked it over, and gradually arrived at the view that there must be something in this &ldquo;green Coercion Act&rdquo; which was so unpopular with certain people, and the more unpopular it was the more the average man was inclined to believe that there was something in it.  It was made, not by me, but by others, practically the issue of the nine bye-elections which were held, and seven of these nine elections resulted in the return of Government candidates pledged to support the &ldquo;green Coercion Act.&rdquo; The capital penalty in Section 1 is, of course, arguable, just as the capital penalty for any offence is arguable, and there are those who hold the view which Senator Haughton holds, that the State ought not in any circumstances take the life of a citizen.  It is scarcely opportune to discuss the question in the abstract or discuss the question in relation to any other offences than <Col N="22" /> those set out in Section I.  I would like to put it to Senator Haughton whether the offences set out here are more or less deserving of the capital penalty than murder.</P>
    <P>It seems that the man who precipitates civil war within the State is more blood guilty, and that the greater includes the less, that every hideous crime that occurs within the civil war period rightly rests on the shoulders of those who precipitate that situation.  This capital penalty attaches to the crime of levying war against Saorstát Eireann or assisting persons in so doing, conspiring with or inciting any person to levy war against Saorstát Eireann, attempting to overthrow by force of arms the Government of Saorstát Eireann, and conspiring with or attempting to take part in such attempt.  We have here a Constitution which established a democratic State, and which recognised the people as the source of political authority, and which laid it down that that authority exercised by any Government here must be the delegated authority of the people.  The first Parliament passed a measure of adult suffrage, and in its electoral arrangements made specific provisions for the representation of minorities.  One would say that, in a State of adult suffrage, and with special provision in its electoral law for the representation of minorities, there is even less excuse and less justification for unconstitutional onslaughts on the State than in other countries.</P>
    <P>This much criticised Bill is, in fact, a public safety Bill, a Bill for the defence of the people, and for the preservation of the fundamental rights of the people to be the arbiters of their own destiny, and to decide their own political issues and their right not to be bulldozed by any armed minority within the State.  I am told that it is wrong and unwise to advert to the fact that these things have happened, that we should legislate in the abstract without reference to concrete circumstances, learning nothing from our past but simply in an abstract academic way.  I disagree.  I am not much of a believer in <i>ad hoc</i> legislation. This is not <i>ad hoc</i> legislation.  It is the kind of legislation which is quite apart <Col N="23" /> from what has happened here in the last three years.  The Executive ought to have power to deal with offences mentioned in this Bill, but equally one has to have regard to the fact that there is still through the country a definite tendency towards unconstitutional action.  Many people are very busy in endeavouring to hold together a military or quasi-military organisation with a view to unconstitutional action.  There is surely a medium between living in a world of make-believe and pretending that facts do not exist and the other position of overstressing certain tendencies and circumstances. I could bring Senator O'Farrell through a foot and a half of documents captured a few weeks ago in a house in Strand Road that would surprise him, and, having read them, it is unlikely that he would stand up and make this speech he has made to-day. One does not want to make selections of these documents, and it would not be well to publish them; and it is not good, having made a selection of these documents and having handed them to the Press, to upset the tendency which exists throughout the country to settle down to a wholesome normal mentality; but, equally, we must not be supposed to be bloody-minded tyrants when we bring in legislation which, from all the circumstances at our disposal, we know and believe to be advisable.</P>
    <P>The Public Safety Acts having expired, the dilemma is this.  By what means is the Executive, with its very definite responsibilities, to deal with such offences as are set out in this Bill.  One cannot prosecute out of a void, and the position would be that many of the offences set out in the Schedule of the Public Safety Acts could be committed with impunity in the absence of some such legislation as this.</P>
    <P>I could have come to the Dáil and the Seanad and asked for a renewal of the Public Safety Acts. I did not want to do so, because I do not think that the impression ought to go out that there was still a situation in the country which demanded the renewal of the Acts which were passed in an abnormal situation, and which were referred to as emergency occasional <Col N="24" /> legislation.  Instead of doing that I asked the Dáil to take the view that the time had come to consider what permanent legislative powers should be vested in the Executive for dealing with offences against the State.  Every State, or every State I know of, has its own treason code, by which it deals with offences directed against it.  But there seemed for a while to be the view that this was the one country in the world, the one State in the universe that could do without any such code; that it had no need for it; and that the mere thought of treason or anything in the nature of treason arising here was the fantastic dream of a lunatic-and that in spite of our experiences. I do not believe that the State is likely to find itself gravely challenged here in our time, neither do I believe that the state of affairs here is going to be so peaceful and so idyllic that we will not have prosecutions for certain of the offences mentioned here.</P>
    <P>If the view be that we ought to wait until the offences occur, or until we are in the midst of such a situation, that is a view in favour of <i>ad hoc</i> legislation&mdash;that we should wait until people do something and then legislate to punish them.  Take, for instance, to get down to a practical matter, Sections 6 and 7, which prohibit unauthorised military exercises.  Is it the contention of those who oppose, this Bill, and oppose it, mark you, on the grounds that it is ill-timed and unnecessary, that a second unauthorised military organisation, not responsible to the people, and not answering to any recognised political institutions of the people, should be allowed to grow up, and that the people should be subject to the menace of such an organisation operating openly through the country? Surely it is not.  The duty of defending the people goes somewhat wider than defending them from actual physical onslaught.  It imposes on them the duty of preserving them from the fear of such onslaught.  It is part and parcel of the duty of good and sound government to see that the people can live their lives in peace, and do their business in peace, and that, quite apart from actual physical injury and wrong, they shall not be subject to the <Col N="25" /> mental worry and fear of any such attack.  Therefore, we are endeavouring to bring about a situation in which there will not be in the country any military organisation, save an organisation responsible to the people through a Minister in the ordinary way, and save such an organisation as the Minister will answer for daily in the Dáil.  Senators expressed approval of Section 8.  I was surprised at Senator O'Farrell who, while expressing such approval, asked what about the present Army and the present officers. Senator O'Farrell should surely know that in the Defence Forces Act officers take as a condition precedent to the issue of their commissions a declaration to the effect that they disclaim membership of any political society, or any secret society whatsoever, and that every officer from the Chief of Staff down to the lowest lieutenant has taken such a declaration.</P>
    <P>If Senator O'Farrell has evidence or information that any officer in the Army who has taken such a declaration is living in breach of it, I would put it to him that it is his duty as a Senator and a citizen to give such information to the Executive Council.</P>

      <P>It is since the events to which the Senator has referred that the declarations I have mentioned have been taken under the Defence Forces Act.  Senator Kenny spoke of the definition of secret societies as unsatisfactory.  I took the position in the Dáil that I was open to suggestions, and that it was no use criticising this definition without putting up one which purports to be better. I found considerable difficulty in framing a satisfactory definition, and I stand over this in the absence of some better one:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The expression &lsquo;secret society&rsquo; means an association, society or other <Col N="26" /> body the members of which are required by the regulations thereof to take or enter into or do in fact enter into an oath, affirmation, or declaration not to disclose the proceedings, or some part of the proceedings of the association, society, or body.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Senators in referring to this Section spoke of it as if it were a general prohibition of secret societies that was proposed. That is not the proposition.  It might be right or wrong, necessary or unnecessary, to do that, but it is not the step proposed in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Section is a prohibition against forming, organising, promoting, or maintaining any secret society amongst or consisting of or including members of any military or police force lawfully maintained by the Government, or attempting to form, organise, promote, or maintain any such secret society.  It prohibits the taking part, assisting, or being concerned in any way in the formation, organisation, promotion, management, or maintenance of any such society, or inducing, soliciting or assisting any member of a military or police force lawfully maintained by the Government of Saorstát Eireann to join any secret society whatsoever.  So that it might be summed up in the expression &ldquo;any member of a military or police force so far as any secret society whatsoever is concerned,&rdquo; whether it be the A.O.H., or the Ancient Order of Buffaloes, or the organisation that calls itself the I.R.A., or the I.R.B., or the Masonic Order, or any other society.  It comes to this: the members of these forces have, in the Acts regulating their organisations, definitely contracted with the Government and with the people not to belong to any such societies.  This section is prohibitive on the general public to interfere in the keeping of that contract, and officers of the Army under the Defence Forces Act, and officers of the Gárda Síochána under the Gárda Síochána Act take definite declarations abandoning the right to belong to any such societies.  We are saying to the general public, &ldquo;You must respect that position, and you must not form or attempt to form a secret society that will have amongst it those persons who have abandoned that right.&rdquo;<Col N="27" /> I have not seen the amendments that are handed in, but on the Committee Stage I will be prepared to go through the Bill, section by section, and sub-section by sub-section, and to show that nothing is being done lightly or recklessly, or in malice, or in a spirit of hate, or in a spirit of war; that we have simply attempted to set out these powers which we believe should be the permanent powers of the Executive to deal with offences against the State, actually existing, or potentially arising in the future.  It is really no reply to this Bill to say that a great many offences set out in it are not, in fact, occurring at all and have not occurred for weeks.  One Deputy pointed out in the Dáil that that might have been said about the Ten Commandments when Moses brought them down from Mount Sinai: &ldquo;There has not been a murder around here for months.&rdquo;  This Bill purposes to embody the kind of powers that an ordinary, sane Government should have for the preservation of the peace, welfare and dignity of the State. If it can be shown to me that it contains any section or sub-section embodying some strange kind of power that the Executive ought not to have, I am open to consider it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FARREN</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;In Section 15, page 8, line 52, to delete all from the word &lsquo;and&rsquo;<Col N="30" /> to the words &lsquo;the Chairman,&rsquo; in line 54.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It might be well if I explained the object of the amendment.  I am sure most Senators have not read this Bill, but the object underlying this, and the subsequent amendments, is to prevent a limited liability company from having the right to nominate a representative on a local authority.  The position, as far as I understand it, is this, that the Dundalk Harbour Board promoted a Bill.  In order to get the Bill through they had to come to agreements with persons who own a portion of the quays in Dundalk.  In the original draft of the Bill the portal authorities did not make provision that one of the companies trading to the port should have the right conferred on it by statute to nominate a representative on this local authority.  In order to stall off the opposition of one of the private limited companies in possession of portion of the Dundalk quays, who put the screw on the port authority, the authority was compelled to insert in the Bill a clause giving this limited company the right to nominate a representative under the seal of the company, who would be, ipso facto, a member of the local authority, and would have the same privileges and powers as any other member, whether elected or nominated. During the Committee Stage I objected to this clause, and the learned counsel who was appearing in support of the Bill stated that there were precedents for such a course as this.  I said that as far as I was aware it was unprecedented to confer a right by statute on any limited company to nominate a representative on a local authority.  The learned counsel afterwards admitted that he could not find any precedent.</P>
    <P>I move these amendments because of the fact that the qualifications for the franchise for the election of members of the Dundalk port authority are, in the first place, resident within a radius of five miles of the courthouse in Dundalk, living in and paying rates for a house with a Poor Law Valuation of £20, or owning £100 stock in any steamship company trading to the port.</P>
    <P>I want to draw the attention of the Seanad to the undemocratic nature of <Col N="31" /> the franchise, because in the first place the great bulk of the people who live in Dundalk and the surrounding districts and who do not own premises of a £20 valuation, are debarred from the right to elect people who control the port of Dundalk.  The livelihood of these people may depend on that port. You have the position that a person who may live in Timbuctoo but who may happen to have £100 worth of shares in any steamship company trading to the port has the franchise. Further than that, the persons who are eligible to be elected to the port authority must have the franchise or be persons owning £100 worth of stock in any of the shipping companies trading to the port.  It is perhaps the most undemocratic proposal I ever heard of in my life to confer the right by statute on a company trading in the port to nominate any person they desire to be a member of the port authority of Dundalk.  I say it is undemocratic, it is unprecedented, and it is setting up a very dangerous precedent if you are going to give any limited company a right that they shall nominate a representative on a local authority.</P>
    <P>It is a notorious fact that the port of Dublin is run by the shipping companies who are trading in the port. But if they run the port they get elected on the franchise that is in existence. There is no right there conferred on any company by statute to nominate a representative on the Board.  They must go through the ordinary form of election.  No doubt they are sure of being elected because they control the votes&mdash;some of them control 1,500 votes.  In Dundalk, however, they do not even go through the formality of being elected.  There they seek to get the right by statute for a company to elect under seal a member of the port&rsquo;s authority, even while the majority of the people who live in Dundalk have not the right to vote for the election of anybody.  Was there ever anything so undemocratic in any democratic country?  I ask the Seanad to consider what is at stake in this.  I have no animus in the matter.  I have not mentioned the name of the company.  It <Col N="32" /> is not a question of animus.  It is a question of principle.  There is a big principle at stake.  I ask the Seanad to support the amendment down in my name, which means that no company shall have a right conferred on them by statute to have a person elected to act on the port authority of Dundalk. They have, as I said before, the means of being elected in the ordinary way without having conferred on them the right of directly nominating a representative.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'ROURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment moved by Senator Farren. The proposal in the Bill is a most undemocratic proposal, to have a limited company nominating a member on the Harbour Board.  There is another phase of the matter to which I wish to draw the attention of the Seanad. Dundalk is the natural port for shipping cattle and perishable goods for the North Midlands and a good portion of Ulster.  It has not, up to this, been able to get that traffic owing to being dependant on tides.  As a result of this Bill the Harbour Board will be in a position to clean the river sufficiently to enable boats to come up at any stage of the tide.  That is absolutely necessary in order that the cattle, eggs and butter from that area should pass through this port, because, if not, the rival port at Greenore is bound to get this traffic.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'ROURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit it is, because the company who owns the rival port of Greenore is the company that is to be allowed to nominate this representative on the port of Dundalk. Now, the more the port of Dundalk is developed the more trade will be done there and the less trade will be done in Greenore.  The company that nominates this representative is the Dundalk, Newry and Greenore Steamship Company.  They have a very up-to-date port at Greenore, with a daily service to Holyhead.  They have a large amount of traffic there which legitimately should go to Dundalk; if Dundalk were properly developed they would lose that traffic, and now it is seriously proposed in this Bill that that <Col N="33" /> company should nominate a man on the Dundalk Port Authority whose direct interest it would be to prevent the development of the port.  It is absurd. It is against the interests of Dundalk, and I wish very strongly to support the amendment, and I hope the Seanad will approve of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurJackson" hpid="Mr. JACKSON Mr. JACKSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JACKSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Committee considered every clause carefully. It is only fair to Senator Farren to say that he did draw attention to and object to this clause.  There are one or two points that I just want to bring before the Seanad, and one is that there is nothing exceptional in the mode of election or qualification so far as harbour boards are concerned.  The very same restriction as to qualification of electors appears in Sligo and in a great many other places.  When the Local Government Bill of 1898 was being passed through the House of Commons this very question was brought up with a view to having the mode of election to the port in the same way as those to the municipal bodies.  The reason given there exists to-day, and that is, that a port authority is in a slightly different position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the members connected with the Harbour Board do not take any interest in their trust, or if they neglect the interest of the port in any way, they might bring very serious loss upon the whole community.  In other municipal undertakings it is more a question, perhaps, of getting into debt or being extravagant. But the neglect of the port might mean cessation of a great deal of employment in the whole district. With reference to the question of representation for this company, it must be borne in mind that the company has spent a considerable sum of money.  I think it is in the interest of the community to see that they would continue to take an interest in the port of Dundalk. Both Newry and Dundalk are in very close competition with Belfast, and it would be a great pity if anything would happen to throw back in any way the propriety of these two ports in the Free State.  It is very easy to turn away trade, but it is not so easy to get it back again.  It must be clear to the Seanad that it is to the interests <Col N="34" /> of the Commissioners to do what they consider best in the interests of the port.  If they thought any harm was likely to be done by the appointment of this single representative, amongst 15 or 16 Commissioners, they would have made their protest long before this.  I have no object in intervening except to see that the prosperity of the port of Dundalk would increase in every way.</P>
    <P>Senator Farren mentioned that there was no precedent for this.  In connection with the Carlingford Lough Commissioners, in the Act of 1864, confirming a Provisional Order of the Board of Trade in the same year, the Newry and Greenore Railway Company were empowered to appoint two Commissioners and the Dundalk and Greenore Railway Company were empowered also to appoint two.  These rights are now exercised.  It will be remembered that under the Railway Directorate Act the London, Midland, and Scottish Railway Company were empowered to appoint a director on the Board of the amalgamated company.  There are one or two other precedents that I could show the Senator.</P>

      <P>Senator Farren was a member of the Private Bill Committee which considered this Bill.  He, no doubt, put his views very fully before the Committee, and the Committee apparently decided against him.  I have myself been a member of several Private Bill Committees, and I have not always agreed with their decisions, but I think it would be subversive of Private Bill legislation altogether if a member of such a Committee, because he was disappointed with the decision&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly I could make the matter clear by explaining <Col N="35" /> that this was introduced in what is known as the &ldquo;filled-up Bill,&rdquo; which is always submitted to the Committee on behalf of the promoters and which frequently includes certain agreements reached between the promoters and certain opponents of the Bill.  The Committee can accept that filled-up Bill or reject it.  If there was no mention on behalf of any member of the Committee to remove the portions, that meant acceptance by the Committee. It did not mean that there was a division or a vote taken, but it did mean that it was put before the Committee and not objected to by them, and, therefore, accepted as far as this House is concerned.  I do not think there is any Standing Order to prevent a member of a Committee from moving a further amendment when the Bill comes before this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamBarrington" hpid="Mr. BARRINGTON Mr. BARRINGTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BARRINGTON</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit it is subversive altogether of the principle of Private Bill legislation.  These Bills are referred to a Committee for consideration and very considerable expense is incurred in bringing the Bills before the Committee, where they are thoroughly discussed.  When a decision is arrived at that some member does not approve of, if the whole question is again raised in this House, it is subversive altogether of Private Bill legislation and would be contrary to the public interest.  It would, I think, be likely to retard the introduction of Bills.</P>

      <P>As against what Senator Barrington has said, if the decision of a Committee was always to be taken without challenge, it would be possible for a Committee to approve of some particular legislation which might not be desirable.  If the decision was never reviewed it would make for very bad legislation, and it would be a very dangerous precedent to establish. The decision of every Committee should be subject to revision and approval. Committees are appointed to consider Bills thoroughly, but their decisions should come up for revision and acceptance in the Seanad.  To say that we should never reconsider the decisions of such Committees seems to me <Col N="36" /> to make sound practical Private Bill legislation impossible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamBarrington" hpid="Mr. BARRINGTON Mr. BARRINGTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BARRINGTON</NameTxt>

Might I also point out that the question Senator Farren has raised was not raised before the Committee, so that I think it is in order.</P>

      <P>I was a member of the Joint Committee that considered this Bill, and while I am not interested in what Senator Barrington said about the good taste, if I may so describe it, of Senator Farren in bringing the subject again before the Seanad, I am interested in this Bill.  I am opposed to the amendment proposed by Senator Farren for this reason, that we have too much criticism in this country.  No one seems to want to do anything, and the moment anyone seeks to do anything you have scores of critics getting up and wanting to prevent them.  This Bill was initiated by people in Dundalk where a lot of different interests were concerned.  The promoters of the Bill wished to get these to work in harmony under one port authority.  There were a lot of interests involved, and the Bill, if it came before the Committee in its original form, would have given a great deal of trouble.  Prior to coming before the Committee certain matters were arranged between the conflicting interests so that it came on as an agreed measure.  It seems to me that it is simply a commercial undertaking for the promoters of the Bill to <Col N="37" /> agree to the proposition of the Dundalk and Newry Railway Company to have the right of appointing one of eighteen commissioners who will work the Bill.  There were seven or eight members, if I remember, on the Joint Committee, and Senator Farren was the only one to introduce this objection, which was quite a good one, on principle, to the appointment by this company of a director.  I think I am right in saying that the Bill left our hands without any vote being taken. If it could be proved to Senator Farren&rsquo;s satisfaction that there was a precedent for such action, I think he said he would agree to it.</P>

I appeal to the Seanad not to throw the Bill back to the promoters after all the expenses they have incurred.  They are endeavouring to do something for the country.  Dundalk is the most northeasterly port in the Free State and is going to be an important competitor with the port of Belfast.  Newry is a very important competitor with Dundalk. The object of the Bill is to put Dundalk in a position to deal with English traffic for that portion of the Free State.</P>

      <P>I beg to move:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;That in future it shall not be the duty of the Cathaoirleach to rule whether Bills or motions before the <Col N="39" /> Seanad are an infringement of the Constitution, and that the Standing Orders Committee be requested to propose such alterations in or additions to the Standing Orders as will give effect to this resolution.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I must at the outset ask to be allowed to state that I move the resolution believing that if such a power were inherent in the Chairman it would infringe the sovereignty of the Seanad and the sovereignty of the people. Whether one is led to the conclusion that it is more or less inherent in the person of the Cathaoirleach to rule out a motion, it is public knowledge that on a message from the Dáil his ruling was that such a message was in violation of the Constitution.  Among other reasons that was held out why such a message should be ruled out of order, the Cathaoirleach, in his very able, interesting, and highly controversial address, said: &ldquo;Since this message was received I have given it many very anxious hours of study and consideration, and I have arrived at a definite, clear and distinct conclusion that any such message would be out of order on the part of the Seanad and would be in direct conflict with the Standing Orders, and would be a direct violation of the Constitution.&rdquo; One can visualise the time when we would have a Chairman, not so versed in constitutional law as the present Cathaoirleach, but who might cause a situation which would inflict grave injury on our Constitution.</P>
    <P>In passing, perhaps I may be allowed to state that the resolution before the House is not the resolution which I originally tried to have moved.  It has been considerably watered down and, I think, that after that watering down it will be accepted by the Seanad.  My motion was ruled out by the Cathaoirleach without any attempt being made to allow me to amend it.  Under Standing Order 17, if I read it aright, one of the powers of the Cathaoirleach is to amend a resolution after consultation with the Senator, who has power to withdraw it if he so desires.  I have read as carefully as I could that Standing Order, and I see no provision made whereby such resolution should be <Col N="40" /> ruled out of order without power of revision being given by the Cathaoirleach to the Senator to amend it.</P>

Next day the same motion was put down in the name of Senator Bennett, and on examining this motion I saw that it contravened our Standing Orders.  He had, unfortunately, gone away to the country, and I wrote a letter to the Senator pointing out in what respect it was out of order, and saying that if he came to me I would be only too glad to help him in putting it in such a way as would comply with the Standing Orders.

Apart from that, the Cathaoirleach has one view and I have another.  The important point is that in his ruling on the matter of a Message from the Dáil he used the words I have quoted.  I and many others in this House can visualise the day when a chairman not so versed in the law, not so great a constitutional lawyer, and not so anxious possibly for the dignity of this House, may use this power created by precedent, and may inflict an injury on the sovereignty of this House, and the sovereignty of the people.  What did in effect happen was that a Message from the Dáil, for which provision is made in our Standing Orders, was ruled out of order because in the opinion of the Chairman it was in direct violation of the Constitution. Towards the end of his able speech he said: &ldquo;Therefore I am satisfied and so decide that this resolution in its present form seeks to ask the House to do something which it ought not to do, and this resolution, if passed, would be in distinct violation of the Constitution, and would be a very dangerous precedent.&rdquo;  What is the provision in the Constitution for a violation of the Constitution?  Who is the authority to decide whether there has been a violation of the Constitution? That is amply safeguarded by Article 65 of the Constitution, which says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The judicial power of the High Court shall extend to the question of the validity of any law having regard to the provisions of the Constitution. In all cases in which such matters shall come into question the High Court alone shall exercise original jurisdiction.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore any citizen who feels aggrieved with any action of the Dáil or Seanad has his redress in the High <Col N="42" /> Court.  Any citizen who feels aggrieved by a ruling of An Ceann Comhairle or the Cathaoirleach has no redress there. I say that a ruling given in contravention of Article 65 infringes on the rights of the citizen, and that ought no longer to be in the power of the Chairman of the Seanad.  All power in Ireland is derived from the people of Ireland&mdash;legislative, executive and judicial&mdash;and these powers are preserved in their entirety by reference to the High Court of any matter in law which that citizen believes is in contravention of his rights.  What is my position, or your position, if some future Chairman of the Seanad rules a matter out of order which infringes on his constitutional right?  There is none.</P>
    <P>There is nothing under the Constitution to prevent him from challenging in any way the ruling of An Ceann Comhairle, or of the Chairman of the Seanad.  Therefore, to my mind, if it is in the power of the Chairman of this Assembly to make a ruling which is unconstitutional, this Seanad has no power to get that error made by him corrected.  Messages between the two Houses are more or less matters of courtesy, and are dealt with as such. It is laid down that a message from one House to the other shall be put on the Orders for the day.  What did occur in the other House when an amendment of ours was discussed?  The action taken by An Ceann Comhairle on that occasion was a little enlightening.  This was an amendment to the Local Government Electors Registration Bill, 1923, from the Seanad.  The amendment was:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To add at the end of Section 2 the following:&mdash;&lsquo;Provided always that nothing in this section or in any existing enactment shall entitle a person to be registered as a Local Government elector for any year in with the rates for which he or she is legally liable on the 31st March, immediately preceding the 15th of November are unpaid.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>An Ceann Comhairle, in bringing that amendment to the notice of the Dáil, was satisfied, apparently, that it was outside the jurisdiction of the Seanad to do any such thing.  I take it he was empowered to rule accordingly. <Col N="43" /> What did he do?  These are the words An Ceann Comhairle used:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In connection with the amendment passed in the Seanad to this particular Bill, the Local Government Electors Registration Bill, I desire to point out to the Dáil that the amendment, in my judgement, is outside the scope of the Bill.  The Bill is one relating to the preparation of the register of Local Government electors. It deals with the preparation of a register of people who are qualified to vote, and with the setting up of machinery.  The Bill does not touch the qualification to vote.  It enacts in Section 3 that a certain section of the Representation of the People Act shall not apply.  That is merely a change of date, but it still leaves six months residence essential for a vote.  The date before which a person must have resided in a place is merely altered, so that this amendment which deals with the qualifications of voters seems to me to be outside the scope of the Bill.  As the matter is one that concerns the relations of the Dáil and the Seanad I merely state my opinion, and leave it to the Dáil to take any action that they think fit.  The amendment will be considered in Committee.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The message from the Dáil to this House on a most controversial subject was treated with much scantier courtesy. I am not sure that it is not inherent in everyone of us at all times and on all occasions to stand up here and give our opinions on any matter that we think essential, and we do in effect put our views before the people in the strong hope that they will go home to them and that our advice will be taken.  I want to make it clear that in future no matter shall be ruled out of order solely because it is an infringement of the Constitution.  I believe that to so rule is ultra-constitutional. To rule that the matter is against the Constitution is, to my mind, a question for the court, and is not inherent in any individual in the Dáil or Seanad to do so.  I have the temerity to assert that opinion, and if my assertion is correct, then I ask the House to emphasise the fact for all time <Col N="44" /> that by our Standing Orders, until they are amended, and they are likely to be amended on this point, when any matter is before the Seanad it shall not be the duty of the Cathaoirleach to rule whether in the case of Bills or motions that they are an infringement of the Constitution, and that the Standing Orders Committee be requested to propose such alterations in the Standing Orders as will give effect to this.  I move the resolution solely because, from my reading of An Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s speech, he apparently thought it his duty to rule a thing out of order on particular grounds.  He ruled on far broader grounds: He ruled it on the grounds that Private Bills were the inherent right of every free-born man, and they are the inherent right of every free-born man.  He went on further to tell us that these rights are derivable under the common law, and so they are.  Who are the interpreters of the common law?  Are we, as the Seanad, or is the High Court, as defined by the Constitution?  These considerations arise, and I think that for the settlement of this it would be better that such a motion as this, which would clarify for all time the position, ought to be accepted, and I am quite sure that the Seanad will have little difficulty in agreeing with me that such a resolution is essential.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OsmondGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Sir THOMAS ESMONDE Sir THOMAS ESMONDE">
      <NameTxt>Sir THOMAS ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion.  I do so because I believe very strongly that this House has a right to discuss every matter which affects the well-being of the citizens of the Saorstát.  I do not think it is fair to place upon the shoulders of the President of the Seanad, or of the Dáil either, if that could be imagined, the responsibility of having to prevent, or seemingly to prevent, discussion in either House on matters of public importance. I hold that both these Houses, making together the Oireachtas or the Parliament of Ireland, have not only the right, but they have the imperative duty, of discussing, considering and passing judgement upon every matter and thing affecting the material interests of the country.  I do not think that it is fitting with the dignity of the Seanad of the Free State that it should be unable to discuss questions in which <Col N="45" /> the public take a deep and an abiding interest, and I do not think that this Seanad can escape from its responsibility by any pretext of limitation of Standing Orders.  I hold that the Oireachtas is the supreme authority in all material matters, subject only to the Constitution and the law.  It may be that the Oireachtas will find it advisable to limit its own interests, or to limit the application of its powers in some particular direction, but if so it must do it by an Act, an Act that can be repealed, and it is not competent for either of the component parts of the Oireachtas to limit its interests over the affairs of the Free State by anything short of a legislative enactment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us suppose that the Dáil and the Seanad do wrong in legislating; let us suppose that they inflict an injury upon, or do an injustice to, any citizen or any body of citizens.  I hold that the remedy of the citizen, or the body of citizens, and the safeguard against any such conceivable injustice is to be found in the Constitution itself, which directs that the courts shall be the decisive factors in matters of this kind, and that if any injustice has been done to any citizen, or any body of citizens, the courts are there to afford a remedy.  I hold that view and I think that is covered by the Constitution.  I may be wrong.  If I am wrong I think there would be a universal demand by all sections and conditions of people that that wrong should be rectified and that the courts should always be at hand to protect the rights and the liberty of the citizen.  But I do not imagine for a moment that under the Constitution that security is denied.  It is for these reasons that I support the motion. I think we must make it perfectly plain that every matter affecting the interests of the country will be discussed, considered, and, if necessary, decided upon by the Oireachtas.  I do not think that it is dignified for us to say that our Standing Orders prevent us from discussing a certain question and that we should throw the responsibility upon the shoulders of the Cathaoirleach.  I think that this House has shown that it has the courage of its convictions and that it is prepared to <Col N="46" /> discharge its duties quite regardless of consequences.  I hope that it will pass Senator Bennett&rsquo;s motion.</P>

      <P>May I just say at the outset that Senators will pardon me if I stand in front of the Chair, because I cannot very well face the light, although I can face the Seanad.  I want the Seanad to discuss and consider this matter wholly apart from any present consideration of my position, but at the same time want them to recollect that they themselves, unasked by me, imposed upon me the responsibility of being the sole judge of order on all questions in this House.  I did not ask for that power; I accepted it loyally and I have endeavoured ever since to act upon it.  In addition, like every other Senator, I took a solemn oath to bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution, and I have never failed to have regard to that oath in attempting to discharge the duties which you imposed on me.  I am quite conscious of the fact that when I accepted the post and the great honour you conferred on me some three years ago, that I was to discharge all the duties that you prescribed for me, and I quite realised that in the course of time you might change your views as to what these duties should be, and their extent and nature.  Therefore, I shall have no grievance, whatever conclusions you may arrive at with regard to this motion. But subject to this limit, that in view of my obligations to my oath, which, in common with every other Senator I have taken, if your restrictions were of such a character as to prevent me or make it difficult for me to carry out that obligation in the Seanad of being loyal and true to the <Col N="47" /> Constitution, I of course, would have to reconsider my position, and I have my remedy.</P>
      <P>Having said that much, let me say that I have no cause at all to complain of anything that has been said, either by Senator Bennett or Senator Sir Thomas Esmonde, and I can quite realise that from certain points of view, the Seanad, or some Senators, may think that the ruling on questions which may involve an interpretation of the Constitution is too great a responsibility to impose on any one individual. What I shall only direct your attention to is this, that if you are going to make a change, see that you will make a change that will be workable, and that will conduce to the dignity, order, and regularity of this House, because I think I will convince you in a very few moments that if anything like what Senator Bennett proposes were to be adopted, there is an end of all its regularity, and an end of all its dignity and an end of all its usefulness. You will observe that he proposes that in all matters arising upon a Bill or a motion which involve an interpretation of the Constitution, the Chairman is to pronounce no decision.  That is to say, that he is not to pronounce a decision either way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, the whole effective powers of the Seanad have to be exercised either through a Bill or a motion; they cannot exercise their powers in any other way; their powers are confined to dealing with Bills or to moving motions. Therefore the Senator&rsquo;s proposition covers the entire ambit of your effective powers of operation.  Recollect that.  The motion does not propose any substitute for your Chairman.  It does not state how these important questions are to be decided, or by whom, and let me now just ask you to picture, by some illustrations, the state of confusion and chaos to which your proceedings would be reduced under any conditions of that kind.  I have heard with interest and amusement during the last few weeks the astounding proposition that this House is sovereign in itself.  Well, if the Seanad would like to test that I suggest that we introduce and pass a Money Bill, and see what the Dáil will have <Col N="48" /> to say to it.  Does it mean that this House is sovereign in itself, and can overrule the Constitution, can set aside the Treaty?  Well, if you were to tell that to an American or Canadian lawyer I think he would grow pale with envy at the rights of this sovereign Seanad.  But let us take it now by way of illustration and let us see what would happen.  The Senator puts down a motion impugning, perhaps, the conduct of one of the judges of the courts of the Free State.  Under ordinary conditions and under my present powers I would at once and peremptorily rule that out of order.  I should have no power to do so in the future if this proposition of Senator Bennett&rsquo;s is accepted, because the constitutional theory is that you cannot impugn the conduct of judges in the Free State by reason of the provision in the Constitution, which declares that the judges are to be independent in the exercise of their functions.  Therefore, if I were to rule out any such motion I would be interpreting the Constitution.  But I could not, if I were asked, say that the motion is even in order, because Senator Bennett&rsquo;s proposition is that the Chairman shall not be at liberty to pronounce any decision&mdash;that is, either for or against any motion, where it involves any question under the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Take another illustration.  A Senator moves a motion impugning the conduct of the Governor-General.  Under my present powers, and if this motion of Senator Bennett's is not passed, I would at once rule that that was out of order.  I cannot do so in the future. Who is going to do it?  I cannot do it. Senator Bennett's motion does not suggest anyone else to do it, and consequently a Senator would be entitled to insist upon moving and discussing such a motion.  But let me come to a closer analogy.  Supposing a Senator put down a motion that the Standing Orders Committee be instructed to frame a Standing Order dispensing with the oath taken by Senators.  That would be a clear alteration of the Constitution. Under Senator Bennett's motion I would be powerless; I would not be able to rule that in order or out of order, and the Senator would be entitled to insist upon moving and discussing <Col N="49" /> it.  Who is to stop him?  That is one of the results.</P>
    <P>Let me point out that the Senator is entirely in error, and I think I shall convince him of that, and so is Senator Sir Thomas Esmonde, in saying that under these conditions the matter could be set right by the courts.  If that were so, I should never have made the ruling I did, because I have stated more than once in this House that I did not rule sections or clauses of a Bill to be out of order as a violation of the Constitution, because if they are violations of the Constitution and are included in a Bill they can be reviewed by the courts. But it was as plain as anything could be in the English language that that provision in the Constitution only applies to laws, and not to motions, and for this obvious reason, that the wise and expert men who were parties to the framing of that Constitution never dreamt for a moment that an attempt would be made to legislate by resolution, or that an attempt would be made to take away by a Standing Order public rights fortified and sanctioned by the usage of centuries.  They never contemplated that; the thing never entered into their heads for a moment to conceive as possible, and accordingly when they came to provide a safeguard in the Constitution, what was it?  It was a safeguard that all laws passed by the Oireachtas may be reviewed in the High Court.  Is this motion a law? Was this resolution passed by the Dáil a law?  It was intended to usurp the place of a law, but it was not a law, and that was my whole contention.  The moment that you proceed, if the day ever comes, to sanction the use of a resolution for purposes of legislation, and the use of a bye-law to kill a public right, then all I say to you is this, and I say it with a full sense of responsibility, upon that day you will have torn the Constitution into pieces.</P>
    <P>Why do I say that?  You have, in the first place, avoided the assent of the Governor-General.  If you take away this right of divorce, I care nothing about it.  I would have given the same ruling no matter what the question was that arose.  But, if you once establish that this House and the Dáil in conjunction <Col N="50" /> can take away a public right and destroy any public right by a mere Standing Order, then I say you have torn the Constitution to tatters.  You have, in the first place, done away with the necessity for the Governor-General's assent; in the next place you have done away with his power of holding up a Bill for a year.  Then again, you have deprived the Seanad and the Dáil of the power of having a referendum upon it, which is conferred upon them in the case of every Act of Parliament; and last, but not least, you have ousted the jurisdiction of the courts. That is the most important matter in connection with the whole thing.  Here I want to make it plain, if I can, to Senators Bennett and Sir T. Esmonde that a motion substituted for legislation can never be made the subject of investigation in the courts.</P>

      <NameTxt>LORD GLENAVY</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand what the Senator really means?  What is the position?  I do not want to go into this controversy about divorce, because it is a side issue. As I said, I would have given the same decision if the right taken away had been the right of personal liberty, the right of trial by jury, or any other right you wish to mention.  You only drag a herring across the trail if you want to get this discussion to hang round divorce.  Divorce is only an illustration of the principle.  What I am simply pointing out as a proposition that is incapable of contradiction is, that throughout the whole history of the British Constitution, the Canadian Constitution, and the American Constitution, there has never been a case in which they attempted to legislate by resolution, and there has never been a case in which they attempted to take away an existing right by a Standing Order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senator Sir Thomas Esmonde has asked me whether this right was not gone&mdash;that is the right of bringing in a Private Bill for divorce&mdash;let me <Col N="51" /> point out that, so far from it having been gone, the Government of this country recognised its existence three years ago and set up a Joint Standing Committee to devise Standing Orders to give facilities for these Private Bills, thereby recognising their existence, recognising the fact that they were still part of our Constitution.  Otherwise, their action in setting up a Joint Committee to provide machinery for facilitating these Bills would have been a childish action upon their part.  Therefore it is beyond controversy&mdash;and President Cosgrave himself plainly and frankly admitted it&mdash;that this right of Private Bill legislation is part and parcel of our Constitution.  He said so.  It is because they want to limit one particular portion of that right, namely, this divorce <i>a vinculo</i>, that the resolution of the Dáil was passed.</P>
    <P>Leaving out the question of divorce, as I say it all comes back to this: where is there any trace of authority to be found for the position that you can substitute a resolution for legislation and that you can kill the existing constitutional right by a mere Standing Order?  Why, we have examples here of Bills sent up to us of the most trifling character, making the most trifling alterations in existing laws.  That has to be done because by the constitutional practice and tradition of centuries the only way Parliament can proceed is by legislation.  The very idea and essence of Parliament is that it does its work by Bills, by legislation, and the moment you substitute for that, and put in its place, a mere resolution, passed at a single sitting, perhaps without notice, or with a few days notice, you upset the whole Constitution and, as I say, you nullify and destroy at least one half of the clauses in your Constitution.</P>
    <P>Let me just give one or two illustrations, because this is not the first time this question has arisen.  I have had to rule on questions that involved the interpretation of the Constitution before now, and on each occasion that I did make the ruling it was accepted with approval and acclamation by the Seanad.  Why?  I am afraid to say that it was because they were anxious <Col N="52" /> that the ruling should be on the lines on which I gave it.  It did not conflict with their own views; it fell in with their views, and I was a Solomon on these occasions.  Now, because I have made a similar ruling in a matter in which they feel very strongly themselves, I am anathema.</P>
    <P>Let me illustrate that.  There was a Bill brought in dealing with the fishery laws and an amendment was moved in the Seanad restricting the power of the Executive to remit penalties.  The Executive took power in the Bill to remit penalties imposed, and one of the Senators&mdash;I think it was Senator Sir J. Keane&mdash;moved an amendment restricting the power of the Executive. It was carried by a large majority. That went back to the Dáil, and in the Dáil the Attorney-General attacked it and said it was an illegal act on the part of the Seanad, because they were interfering with the Crown's prerogative of mercy; that they had no right by any amendment of theirs to encroach on the Crown's prerogative of mercy.  It came back to the Seanad and they naturally asked me: &ldquo;What do you say to this?&rdquo; I said: &ldquo;That is all wrong; there has been a mistake on the part of the Attorney-General as regards what the law is.&rdquo;  The law has been settled and is known now to be settled for the last two hundred years to this effect: that the Crown had no prerogative of mercy where the penalties go to private individuals, because otherwise it would interfere with private individuals' rights.  They have the prerogative of mercy where the fine is payable to the Crown, as the Crown can remit its own fine.  Under the licensing laws, the fishery laws, the taxing laws, the income tax laws and the smuggling laws, all these penalties are earmarked, some for the complainant, some for the boards of conservators, some for other people; and the law always has been that as regards them the Crown has no prerogative and has no rights except what Parliament confers upon it, and that Parliament, in conferring those rights, may limit them in any way they wish.  On that occasion&mdash;I am not saying this by way of boasting but simply by way of illustration&mdash;I saved for all time for this <Col N="53" /> House the right to intervene and put limits upon the Executive's claim to remit penalties.  If I had not intervened the precedent would have been established and the right lost for them. What is to happen in future if Senator Bennett's motion is carried?  Will I be at liberty to intervene?  Certainly I shall not, because it would be said I was interpreting the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Let me give you two more illustrations which I think should bring the matter, perhaps, even more closely home to the Seanad.  When the Public Safety Bill was brought into the Seanad there was a provision in it enabling District Justices to convict summarily up to eighteen months' imprisonment. Senator O'Farrell denounced this as a violation of the Constitution, because the Constitution says that all but minor offences should be dealt with by a jury, whereas in this emergency Bill, District Justices were given power to impose eighteen months' imprisonment for certain offences without a jury.  Senator O'Farrell's point was that this was a violation of the Constitution.  The Attorney-General was present, and when the point was put to me by Senator O'Farrell I said that in my opinion he was right, and that it would be essential in order to put this right that a clause should be put in providing that they were only to have this power in any case which they judged was a minor offence.  The Attorney-General who, I am bound to say, was always amenable in these matters, at once admitted that I was right.  He gave in and made an alteration in the Bill.  Once this motion of Senator Bennett's is carried I cannot do that.  My hands are tied.  Who is going to call attention to it?  Who is going to correct it?</P>
    <P>I come to a final illustration, and it is a very important one, because it is identical almost with the ruling that I gave on the occasion of the divorce resolution. In the Judiciary Bill the Dáil put the salaries of the District Justices on the annual Estimates, whereas they made the salaries of the High Court Judges and the Circuit Judges a charge on the Central Fund.  Some Senators may not realise the difference that that means.  If the salaries are charged on <Col N="54" /> the Central Fund they are voted automatically and cannot be disputed.  If they are voted from year to year and put on the annual Vote the Vote can be challenged every year.  That was the position when the Bill came to the Seanad.  Some Senator said: &ldquo;This is not right.  It is putting the District Justices in a false and invidious position.&rdquo; An amendment was moved transferring their salaries also to the Central Fund.  The Attorney-General was not present when that was done in Committee, but when it came up on Report he was in his place and challeneged the jurisdiction of the Seanad to make this amendment.  He did so on two grounds.  First he said that a resolution had been already passed by the Dáil appropriating the moneys in this way.  That is to say, appropriating portion as a charge on the Central Fund for the High Court Judges and making the salaries of the District Justices an annual Vote on the Estimates.  &ldquo;Therefore,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that resolution is binding upon this House and you cannot go behind it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He also suggested that although it was not a Money Bill, yet, as this was a financial clause, the Seanad had no power to interfere with it.  That raised two very important questions that went to the very root of the power of the Seanad in matters of finance, and after most careful consideration I ruled that the resolution in no way bound the Seanad, because the Constitution says that the money is to be appropriated by the Oireachtas and to be appropriated by law, and that the resolution was not law.  I also said that under the Constitution the Seanad was at liberty to make any amendment it liked to any Bill other than a Money Bill and that as this was not a Money Bill they were entitled to amend the financial clauses. I said: &ldquo;These are very important matters; it is a big responsibility to be asking me to determine them and I would suggest that you should refer them to a strong small select committee and ask them to report on it for you.&rdquo;  Accordingly, they appointed Senators Douglas, Brown, and O'Farrell, along with myself, to go into this question.  I have that report in my hand, but it is sufficient to say that the <Col N="55" /> committee unanimously upheld my ruling in every point and particularly emphasised the fact that you could not legislate by resolution; that the resolution appropriating money was no good, and was ineffective because the Constitution said it was to be done by law, and that you can only act by law by legislation and not by resolution. The report containing that statement was brought up before the Seanad and was unanimously adopted.</P>
    <P>Now my powers are to be taken from me, because a similar case having arisen, I acted loyally in accordance with that report and carried out the directions given me by the Seanad that unanimously adopted it.  I do not say this for the purpose of recrimination or to try and make a debating point over Senator Bennett or Senator Sir Thomas Esmonde.  I am doing it solely, believe me, in my heartfelt interest in the future welfare of the Seanad and the regularity of its proceedings. I have no other interest to serve.  I do not care a fig about this divorce resolution.  I do care for the honour of the Seanad.  I do care for the dignity and utility of whoever is to fill my place.  I say that unless you provide somebody&mdash;I do not care who, be it your Chairman or anyone you wish&mdash;to guide and direct you as to whether matters are or are not outside or inside the Constitution, your whole proceedings will be reduced to a state of hopeless chaos.</P>
    <P>I have nothing to add except to say, in conclusion, and I say it with full honesty and frankness, that personally I should be glad to be relieved of the responsibility of deciding these questions. If the House were to determine at this moment to give me the benefit of a strong but small committee whom I should consult on these matters and whose decision I should loyally and implicitly follow, I should be pleased. I think that would be an advantage to me and to the Seanad, but do not leave the Seanad in the position that you are going to have no one responsible for making decisions on law and order so that when a Senator gets up when a Bill is going through the House and asks, &ldquo;Would I be in order, Mr. Chairman, <Col N="56" /> in moving the following amendment,&rdquo; for the future I will have to say, &ldquo;I cannot answer you.  That is a matter that involves an interpretation of the Constitution and I cannot answer you.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What did Senator Sir Thomas Esmonde say?  I thoroughly and heartily agree with his sentiment.  He said this House had no right to limit in any way its power to legislate.  What would it have done if it had passed that divorce resolution?  It would have prevented itself legislating upon divorce Private Bills because it would have excluded them from its legislative powers altogether, so that it would have deliberately reduced its own powers of legislation conferred upon it under the Constitution.</P>
    <P>That is the whole position as it seems to me.  If you are not satisfied with present conditions, give me the benefit of a small but strong committee and I will welcome it.  Let my decision be subject to their approval.  If they approve of my decision, let it stand.  If they disapprove, let the Seanad decide. In your own interest and as trustees of the rights, dignities and powers of this House, I implore you to see to it that you do not leave it in the position that any motion can be discussed and passed and that any Senator can move anything at his sweet will, even though on the face of it it is a palpable invasion of the Constitution or even of the Treaty itself.  You would be stultifying yourselves, betraying your trust, and above all, may I respectfully say, in my opinion, you would be betraying your oath, because each of you has sworn that you will bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution.  You put yourself in the position that you must sit down and tamely listen to motions and discussions that are absolutely and plainly out of order.  I now leave the matter in the hands of the Seanad.</P>

      <P>It is rather difficult for me to rise after a practised judge and advocate, but it seems to me that there are certain fallacies at the root of his argument.  I agree with him that we ought to discuss this matter in a perfectly friendly spirit and without any recrimination whatever. <Col N="57" /> I suppose that everybody is agreed that the Chairman does not make rulings with any animus or personal feeling, and that he only did what he thought he had a right to do.  The only question is whether he had that right, or whether he ought to have that right under Standing Orders.  In making his statement he founded his claim on the Standing Order which states &ldquo;The Chairman shall have complete authority to be the sole judge as to questions of order.&rdquo;  That statement seems to be very definite when left to itself, but there is a second paragraph which goes on to explain that he will have power to suppress disorder and so on.  Of course, there arises the question as to what order is and what it is not.  There are a great many meanings for the word &ldquo;order.&rdquo;  It may mean boisterous, riotous conduct.  It may mean procedure slightly contrary to Standing Orders.  Order may also mean a matter of sequence.  I do not think that the Standing Orders are very clear on that point.</P>
      <P>I think it is possible and very probable that when it is said that the Chairman shall be the sole judge in matters of order it means the sole judge in the matter of suppressing disorder.  The second paragraph, in my opinion, qualifies the first.  I do not think that any Senator at the time&mdash;certainly I did not&mdash;when that was being drawn up, give any authority to the Chairman to decide any question he likes on matters affecting the Constitution.  There are other orders in regard to that which are a little indefinite, but none, so far as I can see, gave him that authority which he claims and which apparently he has accepted.  Passing away from that, the next question on which he based a great deal of his speech was the question of a resolution as against the question of an Act.  What happened in that case?  I think the best way would be to read the statement he made in that speech.  He said that a resolution was not legislation, and, of course, he was perfectly right, as it is not legislation, but it did not claim to be legislation. All it claimed was that a resolution would guide the conduct of the Seanad at a certain time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel MOORE Colonel MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>To prohibit and to regulate is the same thing.  It had a perfect right to do so.  The Seanad has a perfect right to draw up regulations over a period dealing with certain matters. The Dáil has the same power. Here is an example which the Chairman gave at that time, and it makes the matter very clear.  The Chairman said that he wondered what the House would think if a powerful Government, controlling a majority of both Houses, were to send to this House a Message asking it to agree to a resolution that in the case of a particular person accused of high treason he would not be entitled to a jury.  The implication is that if such a resolution were passed the man would be tried without a jury, but no such thing would happen.  A resolution would not be legislation, and therefore no such thing would happen. It merely binds the Oireachtas to act in a particular way.  The courts would say that this is not legislation and the man would be tried by jury in spite of the resolution.  Some statements are mere rhetorical arguments to influence the feelings and sentiments of Senators. We have listened to a good deal of rhetoric to-day from a very skilful advocate, and I do not know that we are capable of using the same rhetoric. It seems to me to be a perfectly plain resolution to guide the Seanad in a particular matter.  I do not want to go too much into the question of divorce. I will pass from the question of resolution to that of the Constitution, which is a very important matter.  The question is as to whether the Chairman has a right to decide whether a particular matter comes within the Constitution or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Article 50 of the Constitution states that the Constitution is not stabilised. <Col N="59" /> On the contrary, it states the opposite, that it can be altered.  That Article states: &ldquo;Amendments to this Constitution within the terms of the Scheduled Treaty may be made by the Oireachtas,&rdquo; and so on.  &ldquo;No such amendment made after a period of eight years from the date of the coming into operation of the Constitution shall become law unless,&rdquo; &amp;c.  Any such amendment may be made within that period of eight years by way of ordinary legislation. It is not claimed to do that by resolution. Resolution has no power whatever over any law in the country.  It regulates the procedure of the Oireachtas on a particular matter, and it has a perfect right to do so.  When one of the coercion Acts was passed I raised the question as to whether it was constitutional or not.  The Minister in charge said that it was within the Constitution, and that if it were not it would have no power, as the Constitution was the touchstone of every Act of the Oireachtas.  It happened that a person was put into prison under that regulation, but the Court of Appeal decided that it had been done contrary to the Constitution.  The judges said that it would be ridiculous to state that it would be anything but contrary to the Constitution.  The court referred to the fact that it could not repeal the Constitution but that that particular law did amend it.  This Constitution is a fluid matter.  The only point on which the Constitution can be challenged is as to whether it is within the Treaty or not, and such constitutional point can be decided only by the High Court, and not by the Chairman. The Chairman's position seems to be to give advice to the Seanad.  On many occasions he has advised the Seanad that matters were contrary to the Constitution.</P>

      <P>As I have said, over and over again, the resolution merely binds the action of the Seanad. It does not have any legislative effect whatsoever.  I am in entire agreement with the Cathaoirleach on that.  It is <Col N="60" /> very clear to us at least that no individual ought to have the power to give a ruling preventing the Seanad discussing a matter of this sort on the plea that it is contrary to the Constitution. I think it would put the Seanad in a very difficult position if it did so.  Especially in regard to matters from the Dáil, if they could be rejected by the Chairman without discussion of any sort it would be a very great slight on the Dáil, and, in my opinion, it would not be advisable that it should be done in future.  Whatever may have been done in the past was done, perhaps through a misunderstanding of Standing Orders, or perhaps the Standing Orders were not clear, but in future, in my opinion, that should not be done.</P>

      <P>As you have suggested it, I now move the amendment in my name as it appears on the Order Paper, with one small verbal amendment, to which I shall call attention later on. The amendment on the Order Paper is:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To delete all after the words &lsquo;and that' in line 3 and to substitute therefor the words &lsquo;a new Standing Order be inserted at number 31a of the Standing Orders as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;If in the opinion of the Cathaoirleach any matters before the Seanad arising on any Bill or motion involves a question of an infringement of the Constitution, the Cathaoirleach may, if he shall think fit, advise the Seanad thereon and the Seanad shall determine such question in the manner and subject to such conditions as shall be prescribed by Standing Orders.' &rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I move this amendment because of the very grave results which, I am satisfied, will follow if Senator Bennett's resolution is carried in its present <Col N="61" /> form.  The position of the Seanad in this matter is quite clear.  We can by resolution deprive the Chairman of the duty of ruling either a Bill or motion out of order on the grounds that it is an infringement of the Constitution. Our present Chairman has told us very frankly that he would be glad to be relieved of that responsibility. Now that is what we are asked to do by Senator Bennett.  The question is, and it is a very serious one, is it wise for us to do it in the form in which we are asked to do it?  As I have said, that is a question which, it seems to me, is of supreme importance to this House, and it is a question on which will very largely depend the future credit and the future utility of the Seanad as one of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>For that reason, I would very strongly urge Senators to consider this question absolutely, apart from the incident which has been the occasion of this motion being introduced to-day. Let us get rid of the incident, and the questions which have brought about the motion, and let us discuss this in view of its supreme importance to the future utility and credit of this House. I would like to explain as shortly and as clearly as I can why I impress upon you that this is a matter of supreme importance for this House.  Under Article 2 of our Constitution, the authority of the Seanad as one of the Houses of the Legislature, must be exercised in accordance with the Constitution, and each one of us has taken an oath that we will bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution.  Therefore, the question as to whether a Bill or motion involves an infringement of the Constitution is a question of vital importance. It has arisen, as Lord Glenavy has reminded us, more than once.  It is bound to rise in the future from time to time.  When it does arise, as arise it will, what will be the position of this House if Senator Bennett's resolution is carried in its present form?  I will refer for a moment to the composition of the Seanad.  There are 60 of us, drawn from all walks of life.  We are very largely busy with our own affairs, and most of us are untrained in the only training which would really fit us <Col N="62" /> to deal with Constitutional questions. If we pass the resolution, in the form in which Senator Bennett has moved it, and a Bill or motion involving a question of the violation of the Constitution crops up, who, as Lord Glenavy has asked, is to call attention to it?  How is this House, composed as it is, to proceed to determine it?  The position of the Seanad will be absolutely hopeless if this resolution is passed in the form in which it is moved.  It is for the purpose of avoiding this result that I have framed and moved this amendment. My suggestion as to how it may be avoided is this, and it carries out the suggestion which was made by Senator Lord Glenavy: When a question of this kind arises, I think the Chairman should be entitled&mdash;and I go farther and say it would be his duty&mdash; to advise the Seanad, and, having done so, the question should be referred automatically to a committee for consideration. If the committee report in accordance with the advice which the Chairman has given to the Seanad, then he should rule in accordance with that advice.  If the committee report contrary to the Chairman's advice, then the discussion on the Bill or on the motion should proceed.</P>

      <P>This committee should be a very strong one; it should be a standing one&mdash;that is, it should be appointed annually and appointed for this purpose so that it will not be appointed on any occasion <i>ad hoc.</i>  It should be a permanent committee.  It should be very carefully chosen and should not contain more than five or six Senators.  However, that would be for the Seanad.  The advantages of adopting a suggestion of that kind are these: In the first place it would ensure <Col N="63" /> the question of the infringement of the Constitution by any motion or Bill being raised, because it would be on the Chairman that the duty of the liberty to do so would rest.  In the next place, it would give time for its consideration by the Seanad, because these questions are of very great difficulty and they could not be properly considered or properly determined by the Seanad on the spur of the moment.  In addition it would give the Seanad the advantage of the considered opinions of the committee.  All this procedure can be carried out by the Standing Order.  The form my amendment takes is this: It would delete all words after &ldquo;and that&rdquo; in line 3 and substitute therefor the words &ldquo;a new Standing Order to be inserted at Number 31a as follows,&rdquo; so that the way that Senator Bennett's motion would then read would be as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That in future it shall not be the duty of the Cathaoirleach to rule whether Bills or motions before the Seanad are an infringement of the Constitution, and that a new Standing Order be inserted at No. 31a of the Standing Orders as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;If in the opinion of the Cathaoirleach any matter before the Seanad arising on any Bill or motion involves a question of an infringement of the Constitution, the Cathaoirleach may, if he shall think fit, advise the Seanad thereon, and the Seanad shall determine such question in the manner and subject to such conditions as are prescribed by the Standing Orders.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The words &ldquo;shall be&rdquo; in the last line of my amendment are changed to &ldquo;are.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I am moving it in the form in which it is on the Order Paper, with the alteration of the words &ldquo;shall be&rdquo; to &ldquo;are.&rdquo;  The reason that I could not put that into the amendment is obvious.  The amendment had to be put in a form which could not inform the Seanad what was the idea or the <Col N="64" /> suggestion I had underlying it.  I would, perhaps, suggest to the Seanad that that is the best idea.  This suggestion was first made by Senator Lord Glenavy and now by myself, and it is a suggestion which ought to be very carefully considered.  We ought not do anything in a hurry.  I would suggest that if my amendment is seconded, it would be a wise thing for us to adjourn the further consideration of the motion and the amendment until we meet again next week.  In the meantime we can think over it, because it is a suggestion which, if it is carried out, will be a Standing Order, and which will affect our procedure for the future. I therefore do suggest to the Seanad that it might be well, if my amendment is seconded, that we should adjourn to-day without further discussion and resume the discussion on next Wednesday.</P>

      <P>I rise to second the amendment moved by Senator Brown. I confess I do it with no great enthusiasm but as the lesser of two evils. The effect of either makes the Seanad the ultimate judge of the Constitution, whether a matter coming before it is constitutional or not, and from the practical point of view that does not appear to me to be very desirable.  This is an issue as to whether something constitutional or not is likely to be raised on matters about which feeling runs high.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everyone is not fitted to give a judgment on a constitutional matter.  It requires very much study, and it requires training to do it well.  So that in a matter like this, even if everyone were in a very cool frame of mind, I think it would not be at all likely that such a system would work well.  Also, in the matter of that kind individual responsibility is superior to corporate responsibility.  I think I can say that this motion is not the result of a prolonged study of the Constitution and the constitutional aspect of this question, but it has arisen out of the strong passionate feelings engendered by the question of the consideration of divorce facilities.  I agree with the mover in one thing only&mdash;the possible danger of leaving complete authority in deciding matters of a constitutional <Col N="65" /> kind in the hands of some Chairman.  It seems to me rather curious that the issue should be raised while the particular Chairman whose decision is under discussion holds the Chair.  He is a distinguished lawyer, eminently suited to give a good judgment in a matter of this kind.</P>
    <P>I would venture to guess that he has not lost professional pride to an extent which would enable him to be moved by any desire except to interpret the Constitution with meticulous accuracy. There are other reasons that deserve consideration.  We are a new House and we have not any very long-standing traditions behind us.  The proceedings have been remarkably free from party animus, and although, of course, it is true that we have the great advantage of having no organised parties, there is a great difference of opinion on many subjects, and our proceedings are always exceedingly orderly.  I think, as far as has lain in the Chairman's power, the business has been conducted with great convenience, with the utmost decorum and with very little heat.  We have had no scenes, and for that I think the Seanad is very largely indebted to the experience and ability of our Chairman. We are lucky that we have a Chairman with such qualifications.  I am seconding this amendment because I suppose there is no hope of the substantive motion being withdrawn.  I am very glad to second it because there is an immense difference between the two, and I think the motion has in it the great danger of reducing the House in a very short time to a by-word and a laughing stock.</P>

      <P>Senator Bennett has raised a very serious question indeed.  It has been attempted before in an indirect way, but this time he has raised it in a serious manner.  I should like to say that it is very difficult after listening to Senator Bennett's speech to know what he really meant and what he is suggesting.  He suggested nothing in place of the ruling of the Chairman.  What he did say was that there was a High Court and we were to go there if, as citizens of the Free State, we were aggrieved because our Chairman ruled something out of <Col N="66" /> order that a Senator proposed.  Senator Bennett's resolution is divided into two parts.  He says that it shall not be the duty of our Chairman to rule whether Bills or motions before the Seanad are infringements of the Constitution, and then, which is a quite separate thing, that the Standing Orders Committee be requested to propose such alterations in our Standing Orders as would give effect to this resolution. Lord Glenavy instanced many cases in which there would be tremendous confusion when his authority was done away with.  It is no good my repeating them now.  One thing is clear to my mind, and must be clear to the mind of the Seanad and the Chairman, and that is, you cannot legislate by resolution.  That is what Senator Bennett's motion attempts to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>The EARL of MAYO</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, that is what is attempted to be done by Senator Bennett's resolution, and I believe that he intends to go to a division on that.  I should like to say something more with regard to what Senator Lord Glenavy has said, and I want to draw the attention of the Seanad to Article 21 of the Constitution, which reads: &ldquo;Each House shall elect its own Chairman and Deputy Chairman, and shall prescribe their powers, duties, remuneration and terms of office.&rdquo;  Senator Lord Glenavy clearly said that when he exercised his powers here, when we were rather in a state of flux here at the beginning of the foundation of the Irish Free State, that we accepted his ruling, and he made a great point of that.  I remember it perfectly well, and you cannot go back upon that.  No one can go back upon that.  Now, what is this attempt of Senator Bennett's?  It is an attempt to sweep away all that, and to substitute the judges of the High Court, if any citizen of the Irish Free State felt he or she had a grievance. Senator Sir Thomas Esmonde, with whom I perfectly agreed as to what he said in one respect, said that the Seanad and the Dáil were the supreme authority subject to the Constitution and the law.  Why, this resolution wants to alter the Constitution. I see he shakes his head, but there has <Col N="67" /> been no answer whatever to Senator Lord Glenavy's speech.  I should like to hear a Senator get up to answer him.  I expect he would have to be a better constitutional lawyer.  The amendment leaves us where we were.  I agree with Senator Bagwell, who said he would like it to be a little stronger.  I hope the division will be taken on the original resolution.  I do not know what is behind all this.  People interested in this divorce business seem to be tapping on the shoulder those who wish to vote for Senator Bennett's resolution.  What does it all mean?  Does it mean that they wish to have a Chairman who is more ductile and pliable to their wishes than the present one?  Do they want a man who will not uphold the dignity of the Seanad?  Do they want a man who will not uphold the Constitution, or who will even allow judges' decisions and the findings of juries to be discussed here?  That would mean an end to all order in the country.  We want order in the country.  I have said that over and over again.  Do not let us begin quarrelling when we are just settling down, just after we have been considering a Treason Bill which is absolutely necessary in present conditions. I hope I have not offended the feelings of any Senators.  I look upon our Chairman as a man who knows what work is and who has stuck to his work.  I have known him for many years, and he stuck to his work in good and bad times.  I shall vote against the resolution and against any other resolution put forward that interferes in any way with the rights of the Seanad and tries to legislate by resolution.</P>

      <P>I think we will have a better chance of arriving at an intelligent and statesmanlike decision on this question if we try to avoid personalities. This is not a personal or party question.  At the same time, it is an exceedingly important question, because it is one with which we shall almost inevitably be faced right through the future.  For that reason I am very loth to cast my vote either for or against any motion that would <Col N="68" /> tend to bind us or our successors, without giving it very careful and considered thought.  A misunderstanding has got abroad that this is a sort of battle between those who were in favour of giving divorce facilities and those who were not.  I think a certain section of the Press is responsible for that misapprehension.  The ruling of the Cathaoirleach had nothing whatever to say to the merits or otherwise of the subject of the motion before the Seanad, and I hope everybody both inside and outside this House will get it out of their heads that the principle of divorce or otherwise is at all involved.</P>
      <P>As to how this question of the alleged infringement of the Constitution should be dealt with, we are agreed that whoever the deciding authority is, it is not the desire of the Seanad to be constantly or at all infringing the Constitution. The Chairman for the time being may be an exceedingly good constitutional authority, or he may be quite the reverse.  The Seanad as a whole may be better or may be even worse.  Consequently, we have to consider who should be the deciding authority that is to prevent us from passing either Bills or motions that may afterwards be possible of being challenged in the courts.  Personally, I am absolutely in favour of everything being ruled out that can be challenged in the courts, if it is alleged to be an infringement of the Constitution.  On that particular ground, I unhesitatingly approved the ruling of the Cathaoirleach on that occasion.  While I had my own opinion with regard to divorce facilities, I did, and do, object to the method of approach suggested, because I believe the decision, while it was tantamount to legislation as far as matrimonial affairs were concerned, did not admit of its being afterwards challenged in the High Courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For many reasons I find it very difficult to make up my mind, and I think we might argue for several hours and still fail to convince each other or, above all, fail to arrive at a proper and statesmanlike solution of the question that would be a proper guide in the future.  Consequently, with the leave of the Seanad, I would move a motion which is a compromise between <Col N="69" /> the resolution and the amendment, but still does not prejudice the views expressed in either.  It is to this effect:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That the Seanad requests the Standing Orders Committee to consider additions to or amendments of the Standing Orders calculated to deal with questions arising as to whether any Bill or motion before the Seanad constitutes an infringement of the Constitution and to submit its proposals to the House.</P>
    <P>In other words, that asks the Standing Orders Committee to consider in all its bearings the best method of dealing with a position such as we were faced with on the occasion under discussion. It will require very careful and long consideration.  It may be necessary to take legal advice in the matter, but certainly we are more likely to get a scientific and statesmanlike consideration of it in a committee than in the House as a whole.  The findings of the committee can be submitted to the House, and every Senator will have an opportunity of considering them when they are put down in a proper form in black and white, and of either rejecting them, approving them, or amending them.  We are more likely in that way to arrive at a decision that will be acceptable to all people of good sense, and to people of patriotism for that matter, and that will be workable in future.  I earnestly commend that immediate solution of the question to the Seanad.  I would ask them not to commit themselves and not to come to a decision without consideration which will bind the Seanad in future and may affect our successors to a very considerable extent in a matter of first import&mdash; ance.</P>

      <P>Had I been a free member of the House and not confined by my obligations in the Chair, I should say that the suggestion made by Senator O'Farrell is the one I would make, as I think this is a matter that requires very, very careful thought.  Anything we do now we ought to be able to stand over.  I think it would be very desirable that this Committee should have an opportunity of going into it very carefully, and that the House should have an opportunity of deciding on their recommendations.</P>
