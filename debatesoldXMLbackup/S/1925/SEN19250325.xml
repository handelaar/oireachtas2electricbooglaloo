      <P>I think I ought to read the following communication which I have had from the Executive Council.  It reads as follows, and is addressed to the Clerk of the Seanad:&mdash;</P>
      <P>There are five Bills at present before the Oireachtas which, in view of the Easter Recess, are urgent.  They are as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  The &ldquo;Police Forces Amalgamation Bill.&rdquo;  The Report Stage of this Bill has been passed in the Seanad. The Bill has to come back to the Dáil to deal with the one amendment inserted in Committee Stage.  It is necessary that this Bill become operative from the beginning of the financial year, and consequently the Minister for Justice is anxious that it should become law not later than 2nd proximo.  I understand the Seanad is meeting on 25th inst, and if the Final Stage is concluded on that date, and the Bill returned to the Dáil in time to enable the Dáil to <Col N="978" /> deal with the matter on the same day, we will be able to just keep to this programme.</P>
    <P>(2)  The &ldquo;Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Bill,&rdquo; which it is essential should become law on 31st instant, as the previous Acts expire on that day.  This Bill has passed the Second Reading in the Seanad, and I trust that the Seanad will find it possible to deal with all the remaining stages and to pass an Emergency Resolution before the 31st instant.  An Emergency Resolution is required because even if all the stages were passed in the Seanad on 25th instant, there would not be sufficient time to allow the seven days provided under Article 47 of the Constitution to run.</P>
    <P>(3)  &ldquo;Firearms (Temporary Provisions) (Continuance) Bill.&rdquo;  This Bill has not yet passed its Committee Stage in the Dáil, but we intend to complete all stages on the 25th instant.  The present Firearms Bill expires on the 4th April, and we hope the Seanad will facilitate us by putting this Bill through on the 27th instant.  It is merely a continuing Bill to regulate the possession of firearms until certain permanent legislation can be fully considered.</P>
    <P>(4)  &ldquo;Summer Time Bill,&rdquo; which passed through all its stages in the Dáil on the 18th inst., should become law about the 8th April, and we would be much obliged if the Seanad could finish it before the Easter Recess.</P>
    <P>(5)  &ldquo;Dail Eireann Courts (Winding-up) Bill,&rdquo; which passed its Second Reading in the Seanad on 18th March, must be law before 30th April, as that is the date fixed for the transfer of functions.  This means that it must be passed by both Houses on 22nd April.  The only urgency of this arises from the fact that the Seanad will probably not be meeting between the 3rd April and 21st April, and in order to prevent disappointment it would be well if all the stages were finished before the adjournment.</P>
    <P>Of course I should also mention that the &ldquo;Central Fund Bill&rdquo; will be going up to the Seanad probably <Col N="979" /> at the end of this week.  This will provide for the Vote on Account for the Services for 1925-26.</P>
    <P>I shall be much obliged if you will mention these matters to the Cathaoirleach, and convey the Government's request that he will facilitate them in dealing with the Bills mentioned.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>These, of course, are matters for the Seanad to in with the views of the Executive deal with.  I presume we will fall Council as far as possible.  What I was contemplating myself was the possibility whether if after meeting to-day, and perhaps to-morrow, we might not adjourn until Saturday.  Perhaps by holding a meeting on that day we might be able to put through the remaining stages of any of these Bills that then stood over.  Anyway we can see what progress we make to-day, and then, before the adjournment this evening, I shall mention the matter again.</P>

      <P>I again wish to offer opposition to the passing of this Bill on behalf of the agricultural community. Its operation will deprive them of a most valuable hour during the day for the purpose of their work.  I think, before we provide for the amusement, or recreation, of people, that it is far more necessary to provide for the means and the sustenance of the people in the country.  I think it is more important that the food production of the country should be increased, so that we may be able to remedy the situation that at present exists by reason of our trade balance being so unfavourable to us.  It appears to me that recently we are paying more attention to amusements than to work.  The passing of this Bill will deprive agriculturists of an hour each day for doing their work.  The measure is, in my opinion, <Col N="980" /> one that will tend to create a great loss to the country.  I propose to vote against its Second Reading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasBennett" hpid="Mr. BENNETT Mr. BENNETT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BENNETT</NameTxt>
      <P>If I thought there was the least possibility of my opposition being successful, I certainly would oppose this Bill, but to offer opposition to it seems to me like beating against a thoroughly fortified position.  On behalf of the agricultural community, I desire to say that I think the people in the towns owe them a big debt of gratitude for the sacrifices they are making in accepting the measure.  The amenities and convenience of the agricultural community are not being considered at all.  Of course they will get over the matter in a slip-shod way, simply by breaking the law and by keeping the time that God gave them.</P>
      <P>This measure means a severe imposition on the agricultural community, and I think some tribute is due to them from citizens who will share its benefits for enduring all the inconvenience which it entails on them.  I hope citizens in towns who will enjoy the benefits conferred under this Bill, will realise the debt of gratitude they owe to the agricultural community who have so willingly submitted to this imposition on their time for the sake of the townspeople.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. COUNIHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking as a farmer, and not as a representative of farmers, I desire to support this measure.  As a farmer, I never found that the Summer Time caused the least bit of inconvenience to anyone engaged in agriculture.  There is no compulsion on any farmer to adopt Summer Time, and I think it is only in very few cases that they do adopt it.  For that reason, I do not see why farmers should try to deprive the town dwellers of the benefits which Summer Time undoubtedly confers upon them.</P>
      <P>Question &mdash;&ldquo;That the Bill be read a second time&rdquo;&mdash; put and declared carried.</P>

      <P>The position is a little difficult, and there is urgency about this, because if this measure is to be enforced on the 8th April it would, of course, have to be passed before that date.  There may be difficulty in getting a meeting of the Seanad during the week immediately preceding Easter, and it might be considered inconvenient to ask Senators to attend during that week.  The principle of this Bill has been accepted by the Seanad on three or four previous occasions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>I have great sympathy with the objection.  We have complained about it more than once.  It is obvious that with regard to most of these Bills they might have been considered at a much earlier stage and might have reached us in time to <Col N="982" /> provide an ample opportunity for full and proper discussion.  I can quite understand the position as regards the financial proposals.  They may have to be kept over to a very late stage, but with regard to a Bill, like the Summer Time Bill, there is no reason why it should be hung up until the last moment. We are faced now with the position that it was hung up, and we have to meet and deal with that position. However, as the principle of this Bill has been approved already, on two or three occasions, I do not see that there is much cause for grievance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>There were some reasons for the delay.  One is the difficulty that arose in arranging that dates should be uniform in all the countries affected, but what I rose to say was, that if representatives of the agricultural community wish to have time to put down amendments to this Bill I do not think that those in the majority should try to force it through to-day. For my part, I should like to see the Bill through.</P>

      <P>As a general rule, I am not an apologist for the Government, but this Bill leaves no room for argument.  It is the third time it has come before us.  It is a Bill that confers a great boon upon town dwellers. It is a Bill for effecting economy as well as everything else.  As a general principle, I do not approve of Bills being rushed through, but we must admit that the Government was in a difficulty in connection with it, inasmuch as they were endeavouring to arrange a uniform date with other countries.  For these reasons, I think the Bill ought to be allowed to go through now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the motion standing in my name, I am very anxious that the Minister responsible should be present, for this special reason: Some months ago I called the attention of this House to the General Order of County Boards of Health, Accounts Order, 1924, and asked the House to accept the view that certain of these forms would be found unworkable. That has turned out to be the case.  No Minister was present when I raised the point and I feel that if a Minister had been present the unfortunate occurrence that has since followed, and which is the subject of my motion, might have been avoided.  I am anxious that the Government should be represented here in order that we might see <Col N="985" /> what they have to say with regard to this matter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir JOHN KEANE Sir JOHN KEANE">
      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall make my statement.  The motion I desire to propose is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Seanad wishes to call the attention of the Executive Council to the alteration of certain Forms contained in the Schedule of the County Boards of Health Accounts Order, 1924, laid on the Table of this House on the 20th March, 1924, in pursuance of Section 20 (4) of the Local Government (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1923, and to the fact that copyright has been granted to a private firm in respect of such altered Forms; and that the Seanad further expresses the hope that steps will be taken to prevent the recurrence of such irregularities.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of this motion is to call the attention of the House to certain alterations &mdash; I submit irregular alterations &mdash; which have been made in the General Order entitled &ldquo;County Boards of Health Accounts Order, 1924.&rdquo;  This is a statutory Order, and it was laid on the Table of this House on or about the 19th March, 1924.  The Clerk being away, I am unable to find the precise date upon which it was laid in the Seanad, but it was laid on the Table of the Dáil on that date, and I would ask the House to assume that it was laid here at the same time, as papers usually are.  It is laid under <Col N="986" /> the provisions of the Local Government (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1923, Section 20 of which states:&mdash;&ldquo;The Minister may make rules for carrying this Act or the county schemes made there under into effect, and in particular for regulating&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Sub-section (2) says:&mdash;&ldquo;The Accounts Audit and Annual Estimate of any public body established by a county scheme....&rdquo;  Sub-section (4) is as follows&mdash;&ldquo;Every Order made by the Minister under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made, and if a resolution is passed by each House of the Oireachtas within the next subsequent twenty-one days on which either House has sat, annulling such Order, such Order shall be annulled accordingly, but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done under such Order.&rdquo;  No such resolution was passed, and in due course the Order came into operation.</P>
    <P>I would again refer to the fact that I called the attention of this House to the schedules of that Order, and pointed out that they were unnecessarily involved and complicated, and, if they did work, they would be unsuitable, and would have to be strained for the purpose for which they were designed. What subsequently happened is not clear, or rather the exact sequence of events is not clear.  It transpired that these statutory forms were radically altered, and no amending Order was laid.  That is wholly irregular.  It appears to involve a breach of the privileges of this House, and if this whole procedure of administrative regulation, safeguarded by the laying of Orders, is not to be observed, we do not know where we are.  It is an important matter, as we are giving very wide powers of regulation to the Government under modern legislation. One new form appears to have been substituted to take the place of Form 40, which was a schedule to this Order. It is a complete change in form, not merely a minor change.  This form has been copyrighted by a private firm of printers, or rather it bears a copyright inscription or number which, I assume, is a valid copyright.  The other forms, Nos. 37 and 38, have been <Col N="987" /> superseded by a form which I hold in my hands, and which also appears to have formed the subject of a copyright. The facts appear to be perfectly simple, and the irregularity appears to be one of a gross or somewhat substantial nature.  For that reason I would ask the House, trivial as the point may be in actual effect, to take a serious view of the principle involved, which is a violation of their privileges.  I would like to ask the House, if they accept the view that this is a serious matter, to allow the motion to be adjourned until the Minister can be present, and when we can hear what the Government have to say on the matter.  Mine is only an <i>ex parte</i> statement and there may be some valid explanation.</P>

To pass this resolution without hearing what the other side of the question may be would, I think, not be proper.

      <P>That concludes our business.  I want again to call attention to the memorandum I received from the Executive Council.  It <Col N="988" /> deals with six Bills.  I will take them again in order, for we have disposed of two or three of them.  The first is the Police Forces Amalgamation Bill, and number two is the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Bill.  These we have passed and we will have nothing further to do with them.  Number three is the Firearms (Temporary Provisions) (Continuance) Bill, and the statement I have received is that all the stages of this Bill will be concluded in the Dáil to-day.  Number four is the Summer Time Bill, which has been disposed of in this House to-day and will not come back to us.  Number five is Dáil Eireann Courts (Winding-Up) Bill, which we have passed through Committee to-day and, therefore, we will be able to dispose of the remaining stages at another sitting.  The only matter left is the Central Fund Bill, which the Government expect to get through the other House by Friday. What I wish to get the assistance of the House upon is, would they prefer to have a meeting next week for the purpose of disposing finally of these matters, or would they prefer that the House should be adjourned now until 11 o'clock on Saturday.  I want, of course, to consult the convenience of members, for it might be more convenient for some members to stay over until Saturday rather than go away now, and come back long distances from the country next week.</P>

      <P>Arising out of this question, could we have any indication of the procedure that will be allowed on the Finance Bill?  I think the procedure adopted on the Appropriation Bill last year was found to be somewhat inconvenient.  It was desired to discuss a number of questions, <Col N="989" /> and the discussion had to be done in a somewhat hasty manner.  Some of us feel that we ought to have more deliberate discussions on these financial matters, for it is the only opportunity this House is afforded to deal with the broad administration of the Government. The Central Fund Bill affords that opportunity, and the Appropriation Bill later on.  If you are going to permit a discussion on the Central Fund Bill, perhaps it might take more time than might be contemplated.</P>

      <P>I understand this Bill is required to be passed before the 1st April, so that if we do not meet until the 31st March there will not be much time for discussion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir JOHN KEANE Sir JOHN KEANE">

      <P>Could not some committee of the House meet and possibly advise on what procedure we might follow when we come to the Appropriation Bill?  It will be recollected that when we came to the Appropriation Bill last year we had to adopt a very inconvenient procedure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it there would be no objection whatever to a general discussion on finance on the Committee or other stage of the Central Fund Bill. I think it is reasonably certain that it is almost beyond the powers of anybody in the Seanad to propose any recommendation with regard to the Central Fund Bill.  It is largely a formality, but that will not prevent a discussion on the matters which come within the scope of that Bill.</P>

      <P>I think it would be well worth while to refer that to a sub-Committee of the House so that they might go into the whole question of the Central Fund and the Appropriation Bills to see whether a better opportunity could not be afforded the House to consider them.</P>

      <P>Regarding the suggestion of Senator Sir John Keane, which you approve of, and which I am quite sure would commend itself to the House, I would like to suggest that a special Committee be appointed now that might meet on Saturday and report to the House on Tuesday.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that would be rather hasty.  If you want to refer it to a Committee there is more than the Central Fund Bill.  There are other points regarding our method of dealing with finance matters lately which ought to be included.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>I think what Senator Barrington has in mind is that it should be a Committee for this particular Central Fund Bill; in other words, that some Members of the House should take upon themselves the trouble of looking into this Bill and seeing what <Col N="991" /> matters they would recommend for discussion when the Seanad next meets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not the intention in my mind.  It is a question of procedure.  We get the Appropriation Bill late in the year, and we do not have the opportunity of dealing with the matters satisfactorily.  My object is that some opportunity should be afforded for discussing the matters in detail, but not in such great detail as in the Dáil.</P>
