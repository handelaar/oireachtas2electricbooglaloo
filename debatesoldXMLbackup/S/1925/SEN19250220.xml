      <NameTxt>Mr. De LOUGHRY</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to propose:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 61, sub-section (3), page 29, line 6.  To insert after the sub-section two new sub-sections as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4)  The council of any county may arrange with the council of any urban district in such county or of any county borough adjoining such county for the use of all or any of the purposes of the said Acts by the whole or some specified part of the county of any part of the building or of the library facilities of any public library situate in such urban district or county borough on such terms as may be agreed upon between the council of the urban district or county borough in which such library is situate and the council of such county.</P>
      <P>(5)  The powers given by the last preceding sub-section shall be without prejudice and in addition to, not in derogation from, the powers given by section 3 of the Public Libraries (Ireland) Act, 1894 (as amended or extended by any other enactment, including this section), by section 4 of the said Act and by the next succeeding sub-section of this section.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="827" /> I am not convinced on the question as to whether there were powers under previous Library Acts to give urban councils and borough councils power to sub-let their libraries&mdash;in other words, to give rural districts library facilities. There is power, of course, to amalgamate urban districts with county districts, and urban districts like Kilkenny are quite satisfied and anxious that the rural population should have the advantage of their library.  I think if the Minister could tell me that that power exists already it would be all right.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. BURKE Mr. BURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>I really believe that we have these powers.  However, it is no harm to have them mentioned specifically here, and I am willing to accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>There is nothing new in this amendment.  The object of it is to remove the provisions of the next amendment from Section 61, which does not apply to the City of Dublin. This provision was inserted specifically with a view to having it in operation in the City of Dublin.  We find that this section is excluded from the City, and in order to have it operative there we have to have this amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Amendment 50 (Government amendment):&mdash;</P>
      <P>New Section.  Before Section 62 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>62.&mdash;The powers of a library authority under the Public Libraries (Ireland) Acts.  1855-1920 shall include power to incur expenditure out of the library rate on the provision of public lectures and exhibitions (whether admission to such lectures or exhibitions is free or subject to such charges and conditions as the <Col N="828" /> library authority may determine) and libraries in schools.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacLYSAGHT</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg leave, in the absence of Senator Dowdall, to move this amendment.  It reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>New Section.  Before Section 62 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>62.&mdash;(1) The council of any county, county or other borough or urban district, or the commissioners of any town may, either alone or jointly or in combination with any one or more other such councils or commissioners, advertise and may expend money in advertising, by the insertion of advertisements in newspapers or by means of posters, placards or otherwise as they think fit, the advantages and amenities as a health or pleasure resort of such county or any part thereof, borough, district or town, or, in the case of joint or combined advertisements of an area comprising the whole or any parts of the respective counties, boroughs, districts and towns of the several councils or commissioners so joining or combining.</P>
      <P>(2)  The council of any county, county or other borough or urban district or the commissioners of any town may with the approval of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health pay such annual or other contribution as they think fit to the funds of any association.</P>
      <P>(a) formed for the purpose of advertising the advantages and amenities of places in Saorstát Eireann or any part thereof as health or pleasure resorts, and</P>
      <P>(b) approved of by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and</P>
      <P>(c) required by that Minister as a condition of his approval to have its account audited by an auditor of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Provided always that every contribution made under this sub-section to the funds of any such association shall be expended by such association in accordance with a scheme approved <Col N="829" /> by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and not otherwise.</P>
    <P>(3)  The expenses incurred under this section&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) in the case of the council of a county, shall be defrayed out of the county funds and raised by means of the poor rate as a county at large charge, and</P>
    <P>(b) in the case of the council of a county or other borough or of an urban district, shall be defrayed out of any rate or fund applicable to the purposes of the Public Health (Ireland) Acts, 1878 to 1919, in like manner as if they had been incurred for the purposes of those Acts, and</P>
    <P>(c) in the case of the commissioners of a town, shall be raised by means of the rate levied by them under section 60 of the Towns Improvement (Ireland) Act, 1854, but shall be excluded in ascertaining any limit imposed by law upon such rate.</P>
    <P>(4)  The amount of the rate raised by the council of any county or county borough for the purposes of this section shall not exceed one penny in the pound, and the amount of the rate raised for the purposes of this section by the council of any borough, other than a county borough, or of any urban district or by the commissioners of any town together with the amount of the rate raised for the said purposes by the council of the county in which such borough, district or town is situate, shall not exceed threepence in the pound.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment refers to health and pleasure resorts.  It was proposed by Senator Dowdall on the Committee Stage.  The Government agreed with the principle and they suggested that it should be amplified.  I understand that Senator Dowdall has consulted with the Government, and that the amendment on the paper is acceptable to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>We want to be perfectly sure that this amendment is not going to operate in this way&mdash;that an urban council would strike a rate for the advertising of its own town. and that that rate would be distributed over the whole county or over any area outside that urban district.  Would the Minister briefly explain whether that would be the effect of this amendment? As it stands it is rather complicated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. BURKE Mr. BURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>An urban district has no power to strike a rate except on its own district.  Unless the county council was anxious to participate in this it would not be bound to strike a rate for the benefit of the urban districts. I do not think you need have any fear of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir JOHN KEANE Sir JOHN KEANE">
      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>So, if any rate is to be spread over the whole county it must be definitely struck by the county council?</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>That, apparently, is so, because the new Bill says: &ldquo;Provided... the council may contribute.&rdquo;  It does not say &ldquo;may levy a rate.&rdquo;  It is that it may make a contribution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasLinehan" hpid="Mr. LINEHAN Mr. LINEHAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LINEHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I object to the county council having the power to put any further rate on the ratepayers. There is a rate of 3d. in the £ for the purpose of advertising these watering places.  Now that the urban councils will be so strongly represented on the county council, there is some danger that they would force the county council to agree to this rate.  I think there is no necessity for placing on the county council the duty of advertising watering places in urban districts in their county.  I object to the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>You are right, Senator, in so far as the section does provide that any contributions to be made by county councils or other body outside the body advertising the place, shall be defrayed by raising a <Col N="831" /> rate on the county at large.  You are right as regards that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasBennett" hpid="Mr. BENNETT Mr. BENNETT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BENNETT</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasLinehan" hpid="Mr. LINEHAN Mr. LINEHAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LINEHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I object all the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMoran" hpid="Mr. MORAN Mr. MORAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the people of this country have the opportunity of a life-time at present for advertising the tourist resorts of the country. A new scheme has been started in America and in other countries.  In recent times these countries have lost a lot of the emigrant travel they had in the old days on account of the restrictions on emigrants.  Consequently they have looked around to see in what way they could make good that loss. The railway companies and the steamship companies have come together and offered special facilities to the descendants of those who in the past they carried to the United States, to come back and visit the various European countries to which their people belonged. Recently I was a member of a deputation that saw the representative of the various shipping companies and who also spoke on behalf of the associated companies and the Canadian Pacific.  They gave a guarantee that any literature that we produced and sent to them will be distributed from the Atlantic Coast to California, and from Canada to Mexico.  If we take advantage of that we have an opportunity that may not arise again of getting our health resorts advertised cheaply.  For that reason I support the amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment declared carried.</P>
      <P>Amendment 52.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianORourke" hpid="Mr. O'ROURKE Mr. O'ROURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'ROURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to propose:</P>
      <P>New Section.  Before Section 63 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;63.&mdash;It shall be lawful for the Minister in such cases as he may think fit to grant to any new buildings erected on old disused sites or to any existing factories or warehouses <Col N="832" /> which, owing to their dangerous condition are in need of repair, immunity from re-valuation for a period of five years after the erection or rebuilding has been completed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It would be a great thing at present for employment if we could get this section put into force so that there would be no increase on the valuation for five years.  The building trades at present are in a bad way, and it is no encouragement for any man to start building owing to the high cost of materials.  If we had a section of this kind in the Bill, that there would be no increase in rates for five years, it would help us.  The principle of this amendment was well received by the Seanad on the Committee Stage on the last occasion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasBennett" hpid="Mr. BENNETT Mr. BENNETT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BENNETT</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>You state that what you are aiming at is that they should have immunity for a certain period from rates.  What you propose here is &ldquo;immunity from re-valuation for a period of five years.&rdquo;  Is there any reason why re-valuation should not take place, provided it was not to come into force for a period of five years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianORourke" hpid="Mr. O'ROURKE Mr. O'ROURKE">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, your amendment would prevent premises being re-valued for five years, whereas what you want could be provided for notwithstanding any re-valuation, by saying that no rates should be levied on the valuation for a period of five years.  That would still allow the re-valuation to go on.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. BROWN Mr. BROWN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BROWN</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 52 (a):&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Before Section 63 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="833" /> 63.  (1) In this section the expression &ldquo;new building&rdquo; means either</P>
    <P>(a) a building, the erection of which was or shall have been begun and completed during the period from the 1st day of April, 1920, to the 1st day of April, 1927, or</P>
    <P>(b) a building, the structure of which has been substantially enlarged or improved, and such enlargement or improvement was or shall have been begun and completed during the period aforesaid.</P>
    <P>The expression &ldquo;exemption year&rdquo; means (i) in relation to any new building which is exempt from re-valuation under the provisions of Section 7 of the Dublin Reconstruction (Emergency Provisions) Act, 1916&mdash;any of the local financial years between the 1st day of April, 1929, and the 31st day of March, 1933; (ii) in relation to any new building which is exempt from re-valuation under the provisions of Section 8 of the Dublin Reconstruction (Emergency Provisions) Act, 1924&mdash;any of the local financial years between the 1st day of April, 1930, and the 31st day of March, 1933; (iii) in relation to any other new building&mdash;any of the local financial years between the 1st day of April, 1926, and the 31st day of March, 1933.</P>
    <P>(2)  For the purposes of the assessment and levying of any rate raised by a local authority for the service of any exemption year, and subject to the provisions of sub-section (3) of this section, the valuation of every new building under the Valuation Acts shall be deemed to have been reduced by one-half.</P>
    <P>(3)  The preceding sub-section shall not have effect in the case of any house erected under the Housing of the Working Classes (Ireland) Acts, 1890 to 1921, the Labourers (Ireland) Acts, 1883 to 1919, or the Housing (Building Facilities) Acts, 1924.</P>
    <P>(4)  If any doubt, dispute or question shall arise as to whether a building is a new building within the meaning of this section, such doubt, <Col N="834" /> dispute or question shall be determined by the Minister, whose decision shall be final.</P>
    <P>It proposes to add a new section, and the object of the new section is to encourage building, and to encourage building quickly, owing to the great want of employment at present.  It proposes to do this, not by preventing the valuation of a new building being altered, but by preventing the rates being struck in each financial year on more than one half of the valuation, and that is to last until the end of the financial year, that is the 31st March, 1933.  I may say that it brings within the scope of this section any building which was erected, or even reconstructed, and the building completed before the 1st April, 1920, because under this section houses which were built, or rebuilt or reconstructed after 1920, and before the passing of this Act, will get greater benefits from the remission of rates under this Act than they would otherwise.  What the section does first is to define what a new building is, because the section works on the definition of a new building, and a new building is defined in sub-section (a).</P>
    <P>In this section the expression &ldquo;new building&rdquo; means either a building the erection of which was or shall have been begun and completed during the period from the 1st day of April, 1920, to the 21st day of April, 1927.</P>
    <P>The 1st April, 1927, is put there for the purpose of giving this benefit to the people who hurry up in building, and, therefore, it gives them two years, and in order to get the benefits of this Act the new building must be a building which is erected within the next two years.  That is the first half of the definition of a new building, and the other half is</P>
    <P>A new building, the structure of which has been substantially enlarged or improved, and such enlargement or improvement was or shall have been begun and completed during the period aforesaid.</P>
    <P>That is between the 31st March, 1920, and the 31st March, 1927.  That definition provides for an entirely new building, or a reconstructed and improved <Col N="835" /> building.  Then we have to go on defining in order to make things clear and watertight.  The definition of the term &ldquo;exemption year&rdquo; is any financial year during which these new buildings are to be exempted from rates to the extent mentioned lower down.</P>
    <P>With regard to the definition of &ldquo;exemption year,&rdquo; the exemption under the Dublin Reconstruction (Emergency Provisions) Act, 1916, is a better exemption than they are getting under this Act, so it is preserved to them down to the end of the last year under which they get exempted under that Act. That is why in those cases &ldquo;exemption year&rdquo; means exemption after any year from the 1st April, 1925, to the 1st April, 1933.  The definition goes on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>In relation to any new building which is exempt from revaluation under the provisions of Section 8 of the Dublin Reconstruction (Emergency Provisions) Act, 1924&mdash;any of the local financial years between the 1st day of April, 1930, and the 31st day of March, 1933.</P>
    <P>That is for the same reason because the exemptions under that Act go on until the 31st March, 1933, and the first exemption for this building will begin on the 1st April, 1920.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, exemption in relation to any other new building&mdash;any of the local financial years between the 1st day of April, 1926, and the 31st day of March, 1933.</P>
    <P>The reason the 1st April, 1926, is fixed and not 1925 is this:&mdash;That the rates have been assessed and struck for this year, and that cannot be helped, so it is beginning to operate in 1926, that is the next financial year in respect of which it can be worked.  Having defined a new building and exemption the definition goes on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>For the purpose of the assessment and levying of any rate raised by a local authority for the service of any exemption year, and subject to the provisions of sub-section 3 of this Section the valuation of every new building under the Valuation Acts shall be deemed to have been reduced by one-half.</P>
    <P>That is, no matter what is the valuation <Col N="836" /> appearing in the rate-book, any new building within the definition of this section will only be assessed during these exemption years at half the actual valuation.</P>
    <P>Sub-section 3 says:&mdash;The preceding sub-section shall not have effect in the case of any house erected under the Housing of the Working Classes (Ireland) Acts, 1890 to 1921. the Labourers (Ireland) Acts, 1883 to 1919, or the Housing (Building Facilities) Acts, 1924.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. BROWN Mr. BROWN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BROWN</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The reason for not allowing this section to have effect in the case of a building erected under the three sets of Acts mentioned is this: The Housing of the Working Classes Act is an Act which is worked by the local authorities, and there is no use in exempting them, for they are the people who pay the rates, and they are the people who receive the rates.</P>

      <P>We will discuss that later on.  The Labourers (Ireland) Acts, 1883, are in the same position. They are also houses built by the local authorities.  The reasons for leaving out houses erected under the Housing (Building Facilities) Act, 1924, is this: That under that Act the rating authority has the option of remitting rates in a certain way for nineteen years. That is optional, but the Minister can direct them to do it, so it is in his hands.  For that reason also I ask that that Act be excluded from the operation of this Section.</P>

      <P>Under sub-clause (2), as I understand, no matter what valuation appears in the valuation list, any premises that come within the definition of &ldquo;new building&rdquo; year, that valuation is deemed to be reduced by one-half.  How would that work out?  Take the case of a building enlarged or improved, and which therefore has become a new building within the meaning of this, there is no increase in the valuation, and then it is reduced by one-half.  Supposing the building <Col N="837" /> next door, which has been enlarged, has its valuation increased, it does not get the same advantage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. BROWN Mr. BROWN">

      <P>It does not get the same advantage.  It gets a reduction of one-half on its new valuation, and it is only in the case of a building very largely improved that it can have that effect.  There is no way in which it could be drafted so as not to have some sort of an anomaly, but, on the whole, it will be of great benefit to people building, and who give employment within the next two years.</P>

We see what the Imperial Government have done in this direction, and we think that our own Government ought to be as generous and to give as good advantages as have been given in the 1916 Act. Senator O'Rourke's amendment does not ask the Government to shed any revenue whatever, and neither does it ask the local authorities to shed any revenue.  We quite agree that the revenue ought to be paid on the existing valuation.  What we want is that there would be no valuation for a period of five to seven years.</P>

      <P>Precisely.  Of course <Col N="838" /> everyone in this House knows that the present cost of building is at least two and a half times what it was in 1916. That is a load which few men are in a position to face.  It means in ninetynine cases out of a hundred that all the spare cash and the reserves a man has will go into that building.  You cause disturbance to business during the operation of building, because a man's business will be upset owing to having to pay such an enormous price as the cost of building entails, and he would be in no position to pay on the new valuation, probably three times the existing one, for a term of at least seven or ten years.  Another advantage, the greatest advantage of all, would be that it would be a substantial relief to the builders of new warehouses and new factories, or in the reconstruction of old ones, and it would give an immediate impetus to building. It would also help a lot of other industries besides the building trade. The probability is that half the people unemployed at present would be absorbed in these new buildings.  I think there could be nothing better for the State than to set such building operations in progress.  It would give a new aspect to Cork, Dublin and elsewhere, where there are, unfortunately, so many of these destroyed areas.  It would inspire confidence in the people who might be called upon&mdash;I am not speaking officially&mdash;to subscribe to a new loan in the immediate future.  Nothing would give more confidence in this country at present than the sight of expensive buildings going up.  If the Minister could see his way to amend Senator Brown's proposed section and make the buildings immune from any extra valuation in respect of local rates for a period running to 1933 it would inspire great confidence in the minds of people who want to build, and of builders, to proceed with the work. If he could see his way to give immunity from increased local rates up to that time I think he would find that there would be an enormous impetus to building during this and next year.</P>

      <P>As I understand, Senator Brown's amendment would be much more liberal, and I will tell you why.  As Senator O'Rourke's amendment stands all that it would accomplish would be this, that rebuilt or reconstructed premises would pay rates just as before, but only on the old valuations.  Senator Brown proposes that in the case of a rebuilt building, for example, a factory, it should only pay rates on one half of the new valuation. There may be a re-valuation, but in any case, take it on the new or the old, it would seem to be a much more liberal allowance than any that would be derived under Senator O'Rourke's amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MORAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a case of killing the goose.  I look upon the Valuation Office as being the absolute cause of the decay in the city.  Let me explain what I mean.  The <i>modus operandi</i> is as follows: you want to repair or improve a building, or erect a new building, and you lodge your plans with the Corporation.  These plans are passed, and you go on with your building. When it is completed the Valuation Office comes down like a wolf on the fold and they revalue your premises without any consideration regarding the men on either side of you, whose valuations may have been in existence for twenty or thirty years.  Up your valuation goes.  When there is a re-valuation, as there was in 1916, they do not, as they did not then, take cognisance of what they have done perhaps fifteen years previously; you are rated <i>pro rata</i> on your existing valuation.  The result is that people have got thoroughly tired of improving their property in the city, so much so that it is falling into decay, right, left and centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister would take his courage in both hands I could prove to him, I think, that he would lose nothing by a total remission of anything in the nature of increased valuations for a period of years.  It would not cost the Corporation anything; they have already to light and to cleanse, and they have already paved the thoroughfare concerned.  It would not be as if they had to open new thoroughfares; they are there already. But they would be building up a reserve for five or seven years to come, as the case may be, and in the meantime they are helping to improve the city and they will be deriving a profit from another source.  People go to the Valuation Office and say: &ldquo;You will have to revalue our places; we are going to rack and ruin.&rdquo;  The valuation in such a case is reduced, and consequently the Corporation loses in that quarter what they gain in the other, and meanwhile the city is falling into decay.  I think if the Minister could see his way to arrange that in the case <Col N="841" /> of improvements to an existing building it would be exempt from an increased valuation for the time being, it would mean a great deal to the city and to employment in it.</P>

      <P>There is a great deal of force, I think, in what you say, but I do not think that is the fault of the Government.  It arose out of a discussion in Committee on Senator O'Rourke's amendment, and I think that Senator O'Rourke himself acquiesced in allowing the matter to stand over so that the Government might look into it.  You could move to re-commit the Bill in order to reconsider it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FARREN</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not care to do that, but I think it is not reasonable to suggest at this stage that we should be faced with an amendment of such a drastic character as this.  Senator O'Rourke's amendment was easily understood, but I do not think that anybody except a highly skilled lawyer could understand Senator Brown's. When we discussed the matter in Committee it was on a question raised on Senator O'Rourke's amendment, that in the case of a new building there would be no re-valuation for a period of years.  That was quite simple, and everybody understood it.  But Senator Brown comes along at this stage and proposes to make it retrospective to 1920.  That is a very important thing, and you must remember that certain buildings have been erected since 1920. They have been re-valued at their proper valuation, and rates have been paid on them.  Will these people have to get a refund of the rates they have already paid?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FARREN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not opposed to doing something in this regard, but I want to see fair play all round for the ratepayers as far as it is possible.  We have always to remember that the local or the national authority requires a certain amount of money to carry on services, and that in this or any other city the local authority requires a certain amount of money for essential work for which they have budgeted. If you exempt certain people from paying their fair quota you will make others pay more than their fair share.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMoran" hpid="Mr. MORAN Mr. MORAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORAN</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. FARREN Mr. FARREN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FARREN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am offering my opinion.  Every local authority requires a certain amount of money to carry on essential services, and if some people are exempted from paying their fair share it follows that other people must pay more than their fair share.  This amendment proposes to relieve certain people of their responsibilities, and would throw portion of the responsibilities which should have been theirs on to the shoulders of other people. Another important point on which I would like information is in connection with a reference made to the Dublin Reconstruction Bills of 1916 and 1924. Is it proposed to extend the period of exemption in both these cases?  The year 1933 is mentioned.  Is it proposed that after getting the full benefit of the 1916 Act and the 1924 Act, which, I think, brought them up to 1930, they will get a further exemption for three years?  That is a most important point. We thrashed this thing out fairly and squarely on the Dublin Reconstruction Bill, 1924; the other Bill was promoted <Col N="843" /> in the British Parliament.  I was on the Committee of the Dublin Reconstruction Bill, 1924; we discussed the matter fully and came to a practically unanimous decision, which was accepted by the House and passed.  I think if we were to go beyond the terms of the 1924 Act it would not be fair.  If that is intended, I will oppose it.  I do not think it is playing cricket, or that it is fair to get over what we did in the 1924 Reconstruction Act, or what was done in the 1916 Act.  We should not be generous to some people at the expense of others.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. BROWN Mr. BROWN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BROWN</NameTxt>
      <P>The additional Acts are the Housing of the Working Classes (Ireland) Acts, 1890 to 1921; the Labourers (Ireland) Acts, 1883 to 1919, and the Housing (Building Facilities) Act, our own Act, of 1924. Under the two first-named sets, the local authorities who have built these houses are the owners of them, and would be responsible for them.  It would really only be a matter of bookkeeping.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. FARREN Mr. FARREN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FARREN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not correct, with all respect to Senator Brown.  I want to point out to him that if he would be generous he would be unknowingly doing an injustice to people occupying working-class houses, because the Corporation are letting these houses and are selling them to the tenants.  Therefore, it is the tenants who will be paying the rates.  They are becoming owners.  They pay weekly, monthly, quarterly, or yearly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. FARREN Mr. FARREN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FARREN</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and the calculation for the payments is based on rates, ground rent and everything else, so that, I think, that would be inflicting an injustice in their case.  I would like to know from Senator Brown whether or not he is increasing the exemptions under the Acts of 1924 and <Col N="844" /> 1916, because, if so, I think it would be most unfair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamBarrington" hpid="Mr. BARRINGTON Mr. BARRINGTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BARRINGTON</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that the whole discussion has turned on the point as to whether the improvements that will be effected in the future are to be taxed or not.  Senator O'Rourke's proposal would exclude that, because he proposes that no re-valuation shall take place for a certain period of years.  Senator Brown, on the other hand, proposes that the re-valuation should take place, but that when it had taken place rates on only half the valuation should be charged. It seems to me that the Seanad is, perhaps, not aware that a precedent exists for having no re-valuation, with a view to inducing people to do work which otherwise they might not do. Unless you give people some inducement it is highly probable that the work they do will not be as good, will not be as ornamental to the city, as if they got exemption, and a precedent does exist in the case of reclamations. The law, as far as I know, with regard to reclamation is that where people reclaim land which has hitherto been, we will say, covered by the tide, or anything of that sort, no valuation of the reclaimed land is made for seven years.  If a similar clause could be put into this Bill, I think it would meet the case.  I do not know whether Senator Brown would be prepared to accept an amendment to his amendment to this effect: If instead of saying &ldquo;have been reduced by one-half&rdquo; it read &ldquo;shall be deemed to be the valuation before the reconstruction was commenced,&rdquo; it would exactly meet the case made by Senator O'Rourke, would fall in with the views of other Senators who spoke, and would, in my opinion, be of great benefit to the city at large, inasmuch as it would induce people to do work which they would not otherwise do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another point which requires to be cleared up regarding the retrospective character of this amendment.  As I read the amendment, it means that any building &mdash;that is, a building coming within the purview of the amendment&mdash;which was started after the 1st April, 1920, and completed since that period, will be <Col N="845" /> entitled to the benefits to be derived from this amendment.  For instance, a number of tobacco factories have been built in this city during the last year or two.  They do not come under any Reconstruction Act.  Do I take it that these buildings will derive the benefits to be granted under this amendment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. BROWN Mr. BROWN">

    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I can quite imagine that the Irish tobacco factories, such of them as have been in existence previously, will have undoubtedly a grievance in that respect on the grounds of subsidising one factory as against another.  I think it would be much better if there were no retrospective provision in the amendment, because I take it the desire is to encourage new building, and if that is the case you are not going to encourage it by giving exemptions to those places which have been already built.  Then, in respect of reconstruction, you are not going to help that, because these buildings have already got certain exemptions, better than those now proposed, and you do not propose to interfere with those, but merely to add a few years to the period of exemption later on.  Likewise, in the case of the 1916 buildings, you do not propose under the amendment to interfere with them, except to extend their period of exemption by a few years.  Therefore, I think the retrospective character of the amendment would operate injuriously against existing traders and manufacturers.  If we are going to try to encourage building we should at all events leave those who have already built to enter into fair competition one with another, and let the exemption be in respect of buildings erected in the future and in respect of which no exemption or preference exists at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another point which I wish to raise on this amendment, bearing on the Increase of Rent and Mortgage Restriction Act, 1923.  Under that Act great injustice has been done in certain cases by charging rates on unoccupied houses. These houses are not houses that in any way would serve the housing need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="846" /> They are country houses, a long distance away from any population, whose owners owing to depression and other causes no longer live in them.  If they are under a certain value&mdash;I have not got the exact figure at the moment; it is in the Act&mdash;they are liable for rates whether occupied or not.  Reading this amendment in connection with the Rent Restrictions Act, what will be the basis of valuation for the purposes of exemption from rates by virtue of occupation or otherwise?  Will it be the full value or half the value?  I do not think that is quite clear.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. BROWN Mr. BROWN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BROWN</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be half the value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir JOHN KEANE Sir JOHN KEANE">
      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>That will make a certain number of houses which may be reconstructed and not occupied, during the exemption period, liable for rates, and house property owners view with grave alarm any provision that will extend what is in many cases this most unfair enactment which charges rates on unoccupied houses.  It is true this Rent Restrictions Act expires next year, I think, but during the continuance of the Act my argument holds good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. BROWN Mr. BROWN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BROWN</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a great deal or sympathy with Senators who desire a more drastic exemption from rates than is given by this amendment, but one has to do the best one can.  If I thought I could soften the stony heart of the Minister and make him go a little farther, I would be very glad to do so.  I am greatly afraid this amendment goes as far as we have any chance of getting the Minister to accept.  With reference to the points raised by Senator Farren, I think his first point was that this amendment will leave one ratepayer, that is, the ratepayer who gets exemption, to get this benefit at the expense of all the other ratepayers. To an infinitesmal degree that perhaps is quite true.  The ratepayer who gets exemption under this section will get off the sum measured by half the rates which he would otherwise pay, but it is such a small sum compared with the great bulk of the rates, that no ratepayer will be appreciably affected by it, and you cannot give relief of this kind without proceeding in that way. <Col N="847" /> It is absolutely impossible to relieve one ratepayer except at the expense of others.  He thought it would also affect the budgeting of the local authorities. It may affect the budgeting, but if it encourages building even to a small extent, and if new buildings are put up with large valuations, and other buildings are improved so that their valuations will be increased, the budget of the local authority will be very soon recouped for the loss it may suffer over the years of exemption.  With reference to the Act of 1916 and the Act of 1924, the Senator thinks that those who got the benefit of these Acts should not get the benefit of this one. The rights of those who got the benefits of these Acts are preserved under this amendment, and it was thought only fair that they should get as long a period as the others, and that the benefit should be continued for them down to the same date.  It would be very awkward having exemption for certain classes of houses for a certain number of years, and not having them all stopping at the same time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the point as to the Labourers Cottages Act and the Housing of the Working Classes Act, the whole object of this amendment is to encourage building, and to encourage building within the next two years; but you will not by exemption their rates encourage the rating authorities themselves to put up houses.  You are giving them no benefit.  Therefore, these Acts are excluded from the operation of this amendment, because they would have been no use for the purpose of the amendment, which is to encourage building.  With reference to Senator O'Farrell's suggestion, that this amendment should not be retrospective, there is a great deal to be said for not making any section in an Act of Parliament, even one which gives relief, retrospective. On the other hand, there is a great deal to be said for rewarding the good citizen who had built at a time when the rates were still high and when he had no hope of getting any relief from rates.  He was a good citizen, and he should be rewarded, and it is in cases of that kind we can justify making this <Col N="848" /> retrospective.  With reference to Senator Sir John Keane's point, regarding the Rent Restrictions Act, in the case of unoccupied houses, I am afraid that that is a thing that we cannot possibly provide for in an amendment of this kind.  It is simply one of those cases that you cannot provide for.</P>

      <P>We must keep this in order.  We have the amendment standing in the name of Senator O'Rourke, and then we have the new amendment, of which notice has been given in the White Paper.  I want to say that this is a very important, a very difficult, and a very intricate matter.

      <P>We have gone fully into this matter with Senator Brown. I would like to accept an amendment something on the lines of that of Senator O'Rourke.  The difficulty is that valuation is a matter that concerns the Ministry of Local Government only very indirectly.  It is a matter for the Ministry of Finance.  They are adamant on the matter, and will not yield.  The only way I can come to your assistance is to allow some remission of the amount suggested in Senator Brown's amendment. It is not in my power to agree to Senator O'Rourke's amendment, and the same thing applies to Senator Barrington's alleged amendment.  We realise that the amendment would be better if it went a little further, and we will substitute one-third for one-half. That is going very far.  I realise there is a point in Senator O'Farrell's suggestion about the Act being retrospective. The primary object of the amendment is to encourage building. Senator Brown answered that very effectively by saying that the people <Col N="849" /> who did step into the breach at a time when it was difficult to get people to build in the country should be rewarded as doing the right thing in difficult circumstances.  On that ground I think it would be well to accept the amendment substituting two-thirds instead of a half.</P>

      <P>There is a considerable prolongation of immunity in the Bill.  Also the retrospective clauses give those people a further claim to immunity than they are enjoying already.  The immunity which they have enjoyed for a number of years is increased.  Now they are getting a prolongation at the expense of the ratepayers. I think it is just that people who want the Bill should get protection, but I want to make it clear that not only are we prolonging the immunity, but we are giving them increased retrospective immunity, which seems to me to be a great addition to the privileges granted to them already.</P>

      <P>I think the retrospective portion of this section is the most serious obstacle to its passing here.  A case has been outlined by Senator O'Farrell in connection with tobacco factories.  I am sure there are other cases comparable to this one.  Factories are already built by people here; and it was not good citizenship that brought these people here, but rather commercial interests.  They are already paying rates.  If you insist on the retrospective portion of this schedule, then you are diminishing the local revenue by that amount, and you must pass it on to the few factories that were in existence.  Consequently I think some attempt ought to be made to clear up the retrospective portion of this amendment.</P>

The view they take of your amendment is this: In the case of persons who were attracted here from the business point <Col N="850" /> of view and who considered it would be a good commercial investment to start certain factories, the effect of your amendment would be to enable them in the future to be exempt from two-thirds, and they would only pay rates on the remaining one-third.

That is why we go back to 1916, when the building costs were enormous.  You cannot give one section consideration without giving it to other people who came over here and built houses.

      <P>The section was not in the original Bill, and it does not seem to be in accordance with the spirit of the Bill.  This is not a political Bill.  It has to deal with rates, public health, pensions and matters of that kind.  I think if we begin in the Seanad to introduce politics into local bodies we will be doing a very wrong and a very unwise thing.  I am sorry that such a section should be introduced in the Seanad, as hitherto this House has been extremely liberal in its views, much more so than the Dáil, and has done many things that the Dáil did not do, such as urging the release of prisoners. I am always proud of that record, and I am sorry that the Seanad has now, for the first time, brought in a penal section.  It has accepted penal Bills sent to it from the Dáil, some of which I did not approve of, but, as far as I know, it has never introduced a penal Bill.  I think this is an unfortunate step.  New States, unfortunately, are often the most tyrannical.  Having suffered themselves, when they gain their independence they begin to penalise others. Poland, Russia, just as France in the days of the Revolution, on getting independence, became tyrannical.  I am afraid that we are drifting that way in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pledges had unfortunate results.  We all remember the old Penal Laws Bill, which excluded a certain section from Parliament.  When that was done it was said that it was not political.  As time went on such measures were repealed, as it was seen that they were bad and produced only trouble.  I could not go through all the pledges that we have had in this country for many years past.  Pledges are really no use. The first pledge that I remember was one in which the Irish members pledged themselves not to accept any tenant-right less than Sharman Crawford's. Sharman Crawford had brought forward a Bill, and the Irish members pledged themselves to accept nothing less than what he proposed.  A year afterwards, finding it impossible to get a Bill giving such terms, and being afraid of losing a Bill, which they were <Col N="853" /> told they could either take or leave, the members broke their pledge.  They were in a difficult position, and had either to break their pledge or injure the country.  If people are in a certain position, and if they see a change in circumstances, they break their pledge. Why take a pledge that will be broken as circumstances change?  A Senator who brought in the section challenged us and said that we had already taken pledges.  We have, but there was no option.  Nearly every Senator here objected to the pledge when it was brought in.</P>

It has excluded one-third of the members, and we know that everybody regrets that. Some Senators, I darésay, do not, but there is no question that the bulk of the country does.  The oath has caused us infinite trouble.  It is a pledge that was not made in this country, but across the water.  The pledge was taken by a number of people who supported the present Government.  As time went on they began to change their minds. Some of them began to see that this Government was not the Government they thought it was.</P>

      <P>I second the amendment, not because the section is a serious one, but because it is an absurd one.  I do not think it is any hardship on anyone to have to swear allegiance to the State as by law established, but I do think that it is absolutely ridiculous that the oath should be imposed on any particular set of officials if it is not imposed on the whole adult population.  This was a Government amendment, and was drafted by the Government draftsman.  Why had they not the courage to put it into the Bill originally, or move it during the progress of the Bill in the other House? They thought it would be unpopular in the other House, and they got it done here in what has been popularly described as &ldquo;the headquarters of reaction.&rdquo; The Minister, if it is put in, will go back and move, in the circumstances, &ldquo;That the Dáil agrees with the Seanad.&rdquo;  The Seanad is unpopular enough already&mdash;personally I do not mind&mdash;but I do not think it should go out of its way to make itself absurd as well as unpopular.  The section is not only a declaration of allegiance to the Free State, but a solemn oath:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>..... That I will bear allegiance to the Irish Free State and its Constitution as by law established, and that in the event of such appointment being ..... I will to the best of my judgment and ability duly and faithfully perform the duties of the ..... said <Col N="855" /> office and will observe and obey such orders and directions in relation to such duties as shall lawfully be given to me.</P>
    <P>If a clerk is being taken on by any county council he has to take a solemn oath that he will perform his duties. Obviously, the remedy, if he does not do so, is that he is dismissed.  A Civil Service Regulation Bill was passed. Why was not this oath put into that Bill?  If a profession of allegiance was wanted from the Civil Service and from people in it, that was the Bill in which it should be embodied, instead of imposing it on a particular type of official under local authorities.  I think the whole thing is absolutely childish. It is a case of bold, precocious, inexperienced boys getting hold of government, rattling toy guns and tin swords and threatening the whole community. No stable government would be in favour of imposing a ridiculous and absurd test of this kind.</P>
    <P>The amendment originally was aimed at the present occupants of posts under local authorities, but this Bill does not deal with them at all.  It simply deals with a few boys who will be taken on in the future, and the whole thing is absolutely absurd and unworthy of any dignified assembly in the world.  I hope that even though the Seanad has already passed this new section that it will see the folly of what it has done and will now see that it is deleted.</P>

      <P>This section which is now under discussion was, I believe, introduced originally by one of the Senators, and, as well as I recollect, I voted against it on the Committee Stage.  The arguments of Senator O'Farrell about the unpopularity or otherwise of the Seanad do not appeal to me in the least.  I do not think that that is a consideration that ought to sway the judgment of men, whether their proceedings are popular or not.  In any case, there is nothing in popularity.  You are a hero one day, and a scoundrel the next, so that popularity really does not matter very much.  The position the Seanad takes up in all its proceedings is, what it considers best in the interests of the country, and whether that attitude <Col N="856" /> makes for popularity or not does not sway them in the least.</P>

      <P>Senator Colonel Moore made a rather interesting speech in moving his amendment, which might lead to debating developments, but I do not propose to follow him.  He made one point which seems to me to be a very pertinent one, and that was, why single out these officials for special treatment in this matter? After all, if you are going to impose an oath or a declaration of this kind on these officials, why not make all civil servants take a similar oath or declaration?  It seems to me that we are picking out these officials to take this oath or declaration, and, therefore, as far as I can see, making an invidious selection.  Otherwise, I agree with Senator Colonel Moore that it is hardly worth while inserting a section of this kind in this Bill.  I myself have taken some oaths.  I certainly have taken a number of pledges, and I have done my best to keep them.  When I took a pledge or an oath, I did so with my eyes open, and with the full understanding of what that pledge meant. The oath to which some of our fellow-countrymen in this country take exception to-day has never had any terrors for me, because in taking that oath I was engaging to do what I would have done without any oath at all: I was engaging myself to bear true allegiance to the Constitution of my country.  I cannot imagine anything more despicable than the action of the individual who takes an oath or a declaration, and then does not carry that declaration conscientiously into effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a public functionary can see his way to accept pay from the Government of the State, and then engage in work to undermine the State, I really do not know what category I would care to place him in.  As regards this <Col N="857" /> section, I am afraid we are going out of our way to do something that is quite unusual.  The Government, I understand, have another Bill on the stocks and can make the terms of that measure applicable to all public functionaries. There is no reason why we should have all this talk about oaths and declarations in this country.  It is usual in every country in the world to have such oaths and declarations.  In the United States of America, for instance, which is supposed to be the freest nation in the world, everyone has to take an oath of allegiance to its Constitution.  You cannot even become a citizen of the United States without making such a declaration.  We allow people to become naturalised citizens here and we do not ask them to take an oath of allegiance to the Constitution of our country&mdash;a thing which, in my opinion, we ought to do.  I think there is nothing in all this bugbear about taking oaths and declarations.  It is a thing that has to be done in every country in the world, and there is no reason why it should not be done here. If we come to the conclusion that officials ought to take an oath or make a declaration, then we ought not confine that to a certain class of officials, but we ought to make it compulsory for everyone in the Civil Service, and, indeed, for everyone else in the country.</P>

      <P>I think that the Senators who have raised this discussion have shown a zeal and displayed a degree of eloquence that is worthy of a better cause.  In the attitude they have taken up they have, however, been consistent, because the men who have spoken so vehemently to-day against these proposals are the very same men who spoke vehemently against every proposal that was brought forward here to deal in a firm manner with those who were attempting to tear up the foundations of the State. Senator O'Farrell described this as a Government amendment.  I desire to say that it is not a Government amendment.  It was introduced by me originally, and I can say that I was never approached on the matter by the Government.  It was brought forward for the purpose of dealing with a scandal that existed in the county I come from, where we had <Col N="858" /> an effete and obsolete county council electing men to positions who had taken up the gun in their hands and gone out to lay the country in ashes. Things had reached such a stage that the Minister had to turn down some of these appointments, and my object in having this section inserted in the Bill was to have the scandal put an end to, of having these men holding public appointments going through the country and preaching to the people the doctrine that the Free State was founded on corruption and that they and their friends would soon put an end to it.  Senator O'Farrell said that the insertion of this new section was unpopular and absurd.  In my opinion, and I think in the opinion of the country, it was one of the most popular things that the Seanad has done since it first assembled here.  As far as I can see, the section does not penalise anyone.</P>
      <P>People seeking these public positions will know that they will have to take this oath and make this declaration.  If they do not wish to do so, then they need not, because there will be found too many people willing to come forward and comply with this requirement. I think it is a scandal that men who served their country and risked their lives in the army should now be walking about idle, while men who took up the gun and went out to lay the country in ashes should be rewarded with public positions.  I do not claim that this new section will turn disloyal officials into loyal officials, but it will certainly curb their activities, just as you put a snaffle on a restive horse or a muzzle on a vicious dog. While the snaffle does not eradicate the restiveness it still tends to curb the animal, and in the same way the muzzle restrains the viciousness of the dog while not completely eradicating it. When the officials take this declaration they will not be so prone to indulge in this offensiveness to the State which has been prevailing all over the country for the past eighteen months.</P>

Senator McLoughlin must have had an unfortunate experience in Tirconaill, but what he has described does not as far as I know exist in other places.  The real point to be emphasised is that this is not the place to bring in a measure of this kind.  Personally, I opposed all these measures, which are a British tradition.  Anyhow, if we are going to have such things we ought, as Senator Sir Thomas Esmonde said, make them apply to all branches of the Civil Service.

      <P>Under the section, as it stands, it would be absolutely impossible for any man professing Republican ideas to sign this declaration. I do not think that this House or the Dáil have any objection to people holding Republican views, provided they hold them constitutionally.  You cannot put down sedition by an Act of Parliament.  It will get expression somewhere, and in some form or other. If you go to Hyde Park in London on a Sunday afternoon, you can hear as much sedition bellowed out there as it would take a Great Western train to carry away.  The speeches are reported verbatim, but no one takes any notice of them.  In fact, these outbursts are recognised as a very salutary vent for that class of hogwash.  I must also confound to some extent the experience which Senator McLoughlin has had in his own constituency.  I have personal knowledge of officials who hold republican views, and if they were to take advantage of the information which they derive from the positions they hold they could undermine the State, do considerable damage and inflict enormous expense on the ratepayers of the country.  But these officials are still in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I always held that we should not penalise a man because of his political views.  There are republicans who are absolutely sincere in their views&mdash; some of them, at least.  I have met some of them myself, and I am satisfied that if these men were given a position under any local authority they would discharge their duties faithfully.  Some <Col N="860" /> of these men that I have met are absolutely sincere, and I know from the whole character and tenor of their lives that they would be absolutely good officials.  From a sense of honour they would not do anything contrary to what is implied in the taking up of a public position.</P>
    <P>The first implication to be taken in the case of a man accepting an appointment is that he would act loyally in that position, that he would not do anything to injure his employer, that he would carry out in a proper manner the duties assigned to him and appertaining to that position.  I would suggest to Senator Colonel Moore&mdash;I hope the Government will fall in with the suggestion&mdash;that in order to overcome the objection raised by his amendment, the declaration in the section, instead of reading &ldquo;I, the said A.B., do hereby solemnly and sincerely declare that I will bear allegiance to the Irish Free State and its Constitution,&rdquo; should read, &ldquo;I, the said A.B., will not use my position for the purpose of injuring the Free State or undermining the Constitution,&rdquo; etc.  A man with republican views could take the declaration if altered to read in that way, and there are many of them who, if elected to public positions, would, I am certain, give good, loyal service.</P>
    <P>You cannot, I suggest, constrain a man to renounce his political views and you should not penalise him for holding such views.  We do not want in any way to penalise a man for holding his views honestly and in a constitutional way.  It would be a very bad thing to attempt to do that.  Prior to the signing of the Treaty a number of us, perhaps, held very extreme views, but since the signing of the Treaty our views have become somewhat modified. These are my views on the matter, and I hope that Senator McLoughlin will agree to the substitution which I have suggested.  I hope, too, that Senator Colonel Moore will agree.</P>

      <P>There were some statements <Col N="861" /> made in the course of this debate I want to refer to.  For instance it seemed to be generally accepted that Civil Servants have to take a pledge, and the only reason it was not in the Civil Service Act is because we have power to enforce it without putting it in.  But when you are dealing with local authorities it is necessary to put in a provision of this particular kind specifically.  I was very disappointed at the attitude of Senator O'Farrell.  I consider it was a very mean way of dealing with this matter.  He, more or less by innuendo, alleged that the Minister responsible was afraid to bring forward this legislation in the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>At all events I must say I was surprised at the way the Senator put the thing.  In the Dáil we have had to take very difficult decisions in the past when the position seemed to us to justify them.  We had to stand over the execution of very dear friends when it was our duty to do so, and we certainly would not be intimidated by the possibilities that might arise from passing any measure however drastic.  And this is not very drastic.  The same testimony is due to the Seanad.  In very dangerous times they stood manfully to their guns.  The private houses of some Senators were burned down, and many were threatened, but they did not flinch, so that I think this argument is not going to count for much.  This amendment was brought forward by Senator McLoughlin.  It was he himself suggested it.  Everybody in touch with local bodies in the country knows the difficulties of the present situation. You had men going out in arms against the Government, breaking down bridges and doing everything in their power to wreck the finances and the whole strength and stability of the country.  These men have, for one reason or another been elected to positions under local authorities, and in very many cases these individuals <Col N="862" /> are using their position and influence and prestige, which they get from being in these positions, to injure the very Government that protects them in their office.  I do not pretend to believe that this amendment will in all respects be watertight.  If a man is sufficiently dishonest he can take an oath or a pledge to the Constitution and at the same time work to undermine it, and be prepared to overthrow it by armed force.  But there is one thing it will do.  It will weaken that man's prestige in dealing with other people.  The obvious retort to men of that kind who seek to build up an organisation against the State is, &ldquo;why have you taken a position under that particular Government?  Why accept their money?&rdquo;  And if he has not got sufficient faith in his own political opinions to give up that salary or remuneration nobody is going to have very much faith in his political opinions whatever they may be.  In order to secure the stability of the country it is absolutely necessary that we should have confidence in our servants, whether civil servants or servants under local authorities possessing such great powers.  I would be very much surprised if the Seanad stultified itself now by undoing what it has already done on the Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel MOORE Colonel MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>I might answer the Minister very readily by reminding him of the pledges that he and his colleagues have taken and have broken, and were perhaps right in breaking&mdash; I do not question that, because there are circumstances when it is better to break a pledge than to obey it, as, for instance, when the circumstances render it wrong to obey.  That would apply to many people as well as to Ministers. But Ministers pledge themselves to things that they are now trying to undo.  I think it is better not to argue upon these lines any more.  I am willing to accept Senator Kenny's amendment.  I think it is reasonable and fair that people should not use their position for the purpose of upsetting the state of things that brought them in.  I know republicans doing their work steadily and honestly in certain affairs.  They keep strictly within the limits of what they ought to do <Col N="863" /> although they are republicans and would not think of bringing into their business any other spirit.  That is an honest and straight way of acting, and that is what Senator Kenny suggests. I should be glad, therefore, to move my amendment with the change he suggests.</P>

      <P>I beg to move amendment 54:&mdash;</P>
      <P>New section.  Before Section 65 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>65.&mdash;The Minister shall as soon as may be after the passing of this Act issue an order with the consent of the Minister for Finance regulating the salary and fees, if any, to be paid to all persons appointed after the passing of this Act by local bodies to the service of such local bodies, taking into consideration the amount of work to be done in each case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of the amendment is that the Minister shall, as soon as this Bill passes, draw up a scale of fees for clerks of county councils.  I have got here a document which was drawn up <Col N="864" /> and laid before the Dáil giving the salaries and the fees of clerks of different county councils and I must say it astonishes me very much.  It is a most extraordinary document.  It varies so much from county to county that one is amazed how such a state of things comes about.  There seems to have been no consideration given to the matter.  In some counties the clerk gets £1,000 salary and no fees.  In other counties it is different.  In the County Mayo the salary is only £160 which, of course, is absurd, but it is made up by the clerk drawing a whole heap of fees which raises his salary from £160 to £1,300.  The comparison is simply ridiculous.  £160 a year is an absurd salary, and £1,300 is a good deal too much.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamBarrington" hpid="Mr. BARRINGTON Mr. BARRINGTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BARRINGTON</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask Senator Col. Moore whether the gentleman with the £1,000 a year salary has fees as well?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel MOORE Colonel MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>No; it seems to be balanced in some degree.  The man with the small fees draws a salary and several fees.  Here is one: County Louth, the clerk has £690 all told; in County Longford, £450; in Mayo, as I have stated, £1,300; Galway, £1,900. The clerk gets £800 salary, £150 as clerk in connection with Diseases of Animals Act, £10 as clerk to the Pensions Committee, £1,246 for preparing the franchise list, and £418 for the jurors' list.  He says his salary is reduced by £708, which he pays for clerical assistance.  When I look down the list of the other counties I find that some men have a salary of £708 and some have only £120.  Why should one county pay £780 to the clerk and other counties only pay £120?  The whole thing is made up of such a mixing of fees and other matters that it is quite inequitable.  In Waterford County they seem to me to have acted in a sensible way.  They gave what they thought was a proper salary, and that was inclusive.  All fees went to the county council.  They pay what seems to be the rather small salary of £475, I daresay it is enough.  I do not criticise them at all.</P>

      <P>In Cork the salary is £450, but it amounts with the addition of fees to £1,640; the clerks take £350 for expenses.  In Cavan the clerks only ask for £20.  Why should one man require £700 and another only £20?  The whole thing seems to me to be in a regular tangle.  I am not altogether in favour of handing over everything to the Minister, but I think that this state of affairs justifies some sort of system and order.  Some counties are large, some are small.  They can be adjusted; but some sort of an arrangement should be made, and I would leave it to the Minister to adjust these things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKenny" hpid="Mr. KENNY Mr. KENNY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>I expect the anomalies that Senator Colonel Moore calls attention to arise in this way.  Under the 1898 Act of the old regime, they drew fees under various heads in addition to their position as secretary to the county council and by virtue of that position.  Under the 1898 Act these perquisites were preserved to them. The result was that if you had to pension these officers, the Act, or those who framed it, took good care that they had to be pensioned on a liberal scale.  In Waterford we had very expensive officials.  The secretary of the county council was a very highly-paid officer.  As a result of his death we were able to effect a saving there, and, when appointing the man who took his place, we appointed him on the basis that the Minister for Local Government and Public Health has advised.  That is, they have advised all public bodies that when an opportunity occurs and a new appointment is to be made, that the salary shall be an inclusive salary. That must be done in future.  You cannot get rid of many of these officers without having to bear the expense of pensioning them.  You have, accordingly, to allow them to remain on until they reach the age limit, or until some mishap, such as death or sickness, befalls them.  In the latter event they would have to resign.  It is only in the event of these contingencies that the council would have an opportunity of adjusting the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a very good thing that there should be a fixed scale of pay marked out for every officer under the local <Col N="866" /> authorities.  There should be a minimum and a maximum salary, and then when a man is going for one of these positions he knows exactly what his minimum and his maximum will be, and he knows that if he gives faithful service, in the course of a certain number of years he would reach his maximum, and he would know how much it would be and on what scale it would be calculated.  He knows, then, the limits within which his services are to be remunerated, and I take it to be the intention of the Local Government, so far as I understand it in the matter of local appointments, that some amendment like this should be passed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. FARREN Mr. FARREN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FARREN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the word absurd could be correctly applied to this amendment because the Minister in his office here in Dublin will not be in a position to decide whether the person appointed by the local authorities to carry on the work is, or is not, an efficient officer.  Everyone knows that the proper people to pronounce on the efficiency of an officer of a local authority are the people on the spot.  I think it will be admitted that there are good and bad officers.  Some of the county surveyors are excellent officers; there may be others who are not excellent officers.  The idea that you are to give the Minister power to say what the salary of an officer should be is perfectly absurd.  As a matter of fact under the existing law&mdash;I speak subject to correction&mdash;the Minister has power, if he believes that the salary is exorbitant, to refuse to sanction it.  I do know that in certain cases the Minister has refused to sanction salaries passed for certain officials in Dublin.  If the Minister has that power what is the need for this amendment? I, personally, think it is perfectly absurd.  I do not know whether the Senator refers to workmen or not.</P>

      <P>I do not agree with some of the Senators who have spoken on this question.  I think the time has almost come when there should be something done in the way of standardisation or co-ordination of salaries paid to local officials.  Speaking generally, I did not interfere very much in the course of this debate, although I spent a great many years actively engaged in the administration of Local Government.  The reason I did not interfere was because I was anxious to expedite the passing of the Bill.  Reference has been made by Senator Farren to the capacity of the Local Government Department.  He seems to think that the Local Government Department would not be well qualified to appraise either the services of the local officials or to estimate them at their proper value.  I cannot agree <Col N="868" /> with him in that respect.  I think our Local Government Department is one of the best departments we have.  I have always held that view.  In the old days, when I had a little knowledge of the Local Government Board as a practical working Department, I had formed the opinion that it was a board that could not be beaten in efficiency I have had much experience of the English Local Government and I must say that the Local Government Board in Ireland was much better than the Local Government Board in England.  I say now that the Department is following in the footsteps of its predecessors and it is doing its best under extraordinary difficulties to carry out properly, efficiently and economically the administration of the country.  I do not know anyone better qualified to appraise the value of the work, and fix a fair salary for that work for local authorities, than the Local Government Department.  I think it would be well if some steps were taken to co-ordinate the salaries in the different counties.  We are not a rich country.  We are not like the English people, and we cannot afford an extravagant system of Local Government. My experience of our system of Local Government is that it might be more economical, and in some directions, I think, might be made more efficient.  I certainly would be in favour of giving the Minister power to regulate the salaries of officials who are being appointed to new appointments. Old officials, of course, we could not touch.  They have got their rights to pensions, but in the matter of new officials the Local Government Department might turn their attention to fixing proper salaries.</P>

      <P>I am not quite sure what Senator Colonel Moore means by the amendment, whether he intends it <Col N="869" /> only to apply to clerks, or whether it is intended also to apply to others.  As inserted in the Paper, of course, it is very wide.  I believe it will probably include other employees as well as officers. Under the Local Government (Temporary Provisions) Act, I have power to fix the salaries of important officers, including those of county secretaries.  I have adopted the grading scale for county secretaries throughout the country according to the importance of the position.  Naturally, a county secretary in Dublin would be more important, and would deserve a higher salary than a similar officer in County Louth.  I have to take that into consideration in fixing salaries.  I have sanctioned several appointments and fixed their salaries since I became Minister for Local Government, and we have in no case allowed the salary to go over £1,000.  Heretofore the arrangement was different.  An officer might be getting a small salary, but with emoluments and perquisites his income might amount to a considerable sum.  The county secretary of Galway gets £1,900, which is most unreasonable. Of course I have no power to interfere with existing salaries, but in future I will insist on having an inclusive salary, which will get rid of these anomalies that Senator Colonel Moore has pointed out.  I am adopting a similar policy with regard to dispensary doctors, fixing a minimum and a maximum salary.  In some cases the salaries vary according to the counties and the work to be done.</P>

The county secretary practically built up a salary for himself.  I suggest to the Minister that when any new appointment is being made the county secretary should not be allowed to seize it.  It is unfair that one person should have a multiplicity of appointments.  No such class of persons should have a salary of £1,700 or £1,800 a year.  That is too much.</P>

And if a majority of the people voting declare in favour of a commissioner the election of councillors shall be null and void and the Minister shall appoint a commissioner who shall hold office until the next triennial election.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This matter was discussed on the Committee Stage, and one objection to the taking of a poll or referendum was the extra cost.  If this amendment passes the extra cost would be very little beyond the printing of an additional voting paper, and if the electors of any county area, or of any city, wish to have a commissioner I do not see why they should not.</P>

      <P>In practice I do not think it would be possible to put this into operation, or, at least, that it would operate very satisfactorily. Take the town of Balbriggan, where this would mean that you would require six papers.  You would want papers for the election of town commissioners, for rural district councillors, and for county councillors, and as well as that you would want three commissioners for each of these offices. The whole thing would be very difficult to put into practice, and I think it would be very hard to get candidates for election to local authorities if the alternative was there, as to whether there should be such a thing as local representatives or not.  It would be contrary to the dignity of a man to go up under such conditions.  You would get very few men of any consequence to do so unless the straight issues were there as to whether they, or some other candidates, would be elected.  If you drag in some side issue in this way you will find it very difficult to get candidates to come forward.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 65, sub-section (5), page 31, line 23.  After the word &ldquo;held&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;(Unless at least six months prior to the date of such election a memorial has been received by the Minister signed by at least one-fourth of the electors on the register asking that a referendum be taken, confined to registered local government electors in that area, as to whether the existing administration should be continued for a further period of three years; in which case a referendum shall forthwith be taken and the costs thereof be defrayed in the same manner as the costs of the election).&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I do not know if this amendment can be considered a novelty or not, but the spirit in which it is proposed is the same as in the case of Senator Butler. This amendment is similar to the idea embodied in that proposed by Senator Barrington in Committee, which was rejected by a small majority.  It is briefly this, that if after the experience of two or three years of the administration of a commissioner the ratepayers are desirous of continuing his services they should have the opportunity and the right to say whether they want him or not.  In order to make it clear to the House I think it would be advisable to read the commencement of the sub-section to which the amendment refers:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(5)  Not later than three years after a local authority has been dissolved under this section, the Minister shall by order cause a new election of members of such local authority to be held.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is where the amendment would <Col N="873" /> be inserted.  Senator Barrington's amendment was criticiséd, because it would interfere with the rights of democracy, but surely there is nothing undemocratic in this.  Every lover of democratic institutions, I should say, desires that the opinion emanating from the ballot-box should be an educated opinion.  I see that Mr. de Valera's new policy is what he terms a mental revolution.  That, I think, embodies the idea of education.  Surely there is no better teacher than experience, and if, after two or three years' experience of the administration of a commissioner it is discovered that he has carried out his work efficiently, economically, and to the interests of the ratepayers, surely the ratepayers should have a voice in saying whether he should be continued or not.  Some Senators voted against Senator Barrington's amendment, not on the question of principle but because of the difficulty of understanding what the cost would be, and if it was costly, on whose shoulders the cost would lie.  Another objection was because of a doubt as to what new lease of life would be given to a commissioner as a result of a referendum in favour of his continuance in office. This amendment specifically states that he shall be appointed for three years if the voters on a referendum desire his continuance, and I think that, considering that it would require twenty-five per cent. of the registered electors to claim by memorial that such a referendum should be held, it is clear that in such a case there would be a serious and well-considered reason for taking such a referendum.  I think the Seanad would be well advised to consider the points that I have put forward, and I hope that it will pass the amendment.</P>

      <P>I regret that I have to oppose this amendment.  If the previous amendment was objectionable I think this is more so, because, if I mistake not, this amendment refers to cases like County Kerry, where there is a Commissioner at present, and provides <Col N="874" /> that, after the lapse of three years, the voters should be asked if such a county should be placed in the same position for a further term of three years.  Some strong criticism has been expressed in regard to the apathy that obtains throughout the country amongst voters who refuse to vote for candidates at these elections.  That is a fear which exists, especially in the neighbourhood of Dublin at present, and if different parts of Ireland are to be excluded from the privilege of having these elections periodically I think that apathv will grow, with most injurious effects. It is well that throughout the twenty-six counties, the electors from time to time should have the privilege of expressing their opinions on public questions.  I, therefore, oppose the amendment.</P>

      <P>This amendment pre-supposes that there should be two modes of carrying on local government, one by an elected body and the other by a commissioner.  I hope that in a very short time something will come in between the two, whereby the rights of the electors to exercise the franchise will be retained, even though after that body is elected, they hand over the administration to paid people. That would come in between the two, and would be quite different, but personally I could never vote for the maintenance of a pure commission and nothing else.  The franchise is there, and I think it should be availed of, and I think those elected at all events should have the power to strike a rate. It is in the administration of that in the past that fault has been found with, and I do believe that Senator Nesbitt should wait awhile.  I think this amendment is premature, because all these things are in the making, and those who are very keenly interested in these matters believe that in the future administration will take a different shape to what is has done in the past, and different, too, to the purely commission method as we know it in the City of Dublin.</P>

They will be asked to vote on a particular issue and the whole community concerned will say whether or not they like the commissioner.  That takes no freedom from them as far as I can see. The only thing is that you limit the issue to a particular one, and those who do not like it can vote against it.  They have, therefore, their freedom of exercising the franchise.</P>

      <P>I do not care to accept this amendment any more than the previous one.  As Senator Mrs. Wyse-Power pointed out, it is a rather invidious thing to accept commissioners who have only been appointed as a temporary and emergency measure. Later on it may be found expedient to adopt the policy of commissioners throughout the country, but in doing so it will be necessary to safeguard the interests of the people who have the right of exercising the franchise and to have some sort of combined system whereby the body is managed by an expert administrator while at the same time preserving the right of the franchise for the public.  I think if we accepted a later amendment which is down in the name of Senator Linehan, whereby the county council itself, with the sanction of the Minister, could appoint a commissioner, it would serve this purpose better.  I would be prepared to accept that in a modified form.  At the present moment the commissioners are mostly officials of my own Department whom I can badly spare, and I would be very loth to leave them in control of public bodies for an indefinite period, even if the electors of these particular areas were in favour of it themselves.</P>
      <P>It is merely as I say a temporary difficulty, and I do not wish to stereotype it, and for that reason I ask that this amendment should not be accepted.</P>

      <P>The two weaknesses of the present position are that we are here to exercise the franchise of the people as a whole.  Local authorities are elected on the same principle as we are elected here and as members are <Col N="876" /> elected in the Dáil.  This privilege should not be filched from them.  The present position is that it places too much patronage in the hands of the commissioner.  The people whose taxes and rates are expended by the official the Minister sees fit to appoint have no voice at all in his appointment. Patronage should not be in the hands of any man, and it is too much temptation to put in the hands of a Minister. The Minister can dissolve any of those local bodies functioning in the Free State and put in any of his friends. That is a temptation.  I do not mean any innuendo as to the present Government to which the Minister belongs. It may so happen that these commissioners may see fit to hold up progressive measures in contemplation by a local body prior to the appointment of the commissioners in order to prove how economical their administration has been, and how they are able to reduce the rates.  People may rise in rebellion at that.  Local labour men who were expecting employment under the schemes adumbrated may arise in rebellion.  The commissioners may be barring the natural progress, and it should be open to the people to have some court of appeal in order to alter the position.  I take it that this amendment wishes to introduce into the Bill means by which the people in certain circumstances can get machinery into operation for the purpose of bettering the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that on the day Senator Sir John Keane moved this motion I had to meet a deputation and I was obliged to leave the House before Senator Keane had finished.  During most of his speech he dealt with matters that were not exactly covered by his motion. There were general criticisms of the finance accounts.  I may say I am not in any very great agreement with the point of view Sir John Keane holds. Unfortunately for me, he showed me a copy of a book he wrote, and having read that book, I do not think he has a very good view on these matters.  The book was not in the nature of a reasoned exposition of a point of view but was merely a diatribe against Treasury officials, and however intelligible a diatribe may be it does not carry us much further.  The statements he made here, however moderately he spoke, were in the nature of a diatribe. He talks about public accounts as being confusing and misleading.  We have adopted a system of presentation of public accounts from the British system that has sufficed on the whole.  I do not say they are not susceptible of improvement.  I do not say the accounts we publish are as clear in every instance as they can be or ought to be. We have aimed even already at introducing improvements.  We have introduced certain changes which make matters clearer.  It cannot be expected that you can put public accounts into such a form that people who will not give a moment's attention to them, still less <Col N="878" /> people who, like Sir John Keane, are determined not to understand them, shall understand them.  If a person is determined not to understand something he will not succeed in understanding it, and public accounts must be in such a form that some little attention must be given to them before they can be understood.  A person could not be expected to understand the balance sheet of a firm if he did not trouble to know what profit and loss and other elementary things are.  Still less can a person who has not learned what is aimed at in public accounts be expected to gather it from them.</P>
      <P>Dealing with the question of an expert committee there is a great pressure of work on the officials who deal with public accountancy and finance.  We have set up a new State. Great changes have been made in administration and legislation.  Problems dealing with the apportionment of funds between Great Britain and the Free State, or Northern Ireland and the Free State, occupy time.  In the Army we had a new service.  We had great difficulties owing to the state of disturbance in the country.  That has thrown a great pressure of work on the officials responsible for those matters. It has been more important for us to do the day-to-day work, and keep some sort of order and ordinary control, than, just at the very start, to set out and adopt some new system which is a great improvement on that which has prevailed in Great Britain.  I said on a former occasion that as soon as it was possible I intended to set up a Committee which will represent the officials dealing with public accounts from the point of view of audit and from the point of view of the Treasury, together with some outside accountant to see what improvements could be effected.  It has not been found possible so far to do that, and I just wish to say that in my view the matter is not one of urgency. The urgent thing for the moment is to use as well as it can be used the system that exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know if it is worth while going back in detail on the observations that Senator Sir John Keane offered.  He said that the delay in the presentation of the finance accounts <Col N="879" /> was due to nothing but laxity on the part of the finance branch.  He referred to the fact that the statutory date was the 30th June; that they were delayed beyond that date, and that there was nothing to be done but put down the totals and publish them.  There are more than totals given in a finance account. It is necessary to give the correct and accurate figures.  Something within one or two per cent. of the exact figures will not do.  In Great Britain the figures are never presented on the statutory date.  They have all sorts of conventions there which we have not, being a free state.  What they do is to lay the cover of the accounts on the Table on the statutory date, but the actual accounts are not presented for months afterwards.  If Senator Sir John Keane will look at the latest British finance accounts he will find that some of the individual accounts are dated July 13, showing that they were not even sent to the printers until a fortnight after they were laid on the Table of the House of Commons in dummy form.</P>
    <P>There was great difficulty in getting the exact figures, recovering repayments and other matters within the time they were done.  I think it is not discreditable at all that we are able to present them in approximately the time within which they can be presented in Great Britain.  Instead of uttering these criticisms without really any study and thought, if the Senator had just looked over the British finance accounts he would have seen that there was cause for the delay, and that it was not a mere matter of setting down the totals in possession of the Finance Department.</P>
    <P>He deals with the Post Office receipts and complains that on one side we have two and a half millions, and on the other side two millions, and that it would be much clearer if we only put down what the assets would be and the nett deficit of the Post Office.  If we put down a half a million on one side the Senator would ask how we arrived at that.  The statements are statements of receipts and expenditure, and it is necessary to put down the two sides, and to show the receipts and expenditure. <Col N="880" /> Statute enacts that you put down the details.  If we did the sum in subtraction we would not have got the nett deficit on the Post Office.  These accounts do not pretend to be commercial accounts. Provision is being made for the submission, in addition to the finance accounts, of commercial accounts of the Post Office.  That brings in factors that cannot be brought in when you are merely submitting accounts of receipts and expenditure.  I do not know exactly when we will be able to publish the first commercial accounts of the Post Office.  The matter of determining a capital sum to begin such accounts has been in preparation for a considerable time.</P>
    <P>Senator Sir John Keane deals, I think, with account No. 23, in which he seems to indicate that there was expenditure after the end of the year, and that it was taken out of the grant for that particular year.  Expenditure made in any particular year must be charged to that particular year.  The £11,740 to which attention was drawn represents an adjustment between various grants.  That means that in a particular year money was paid out of a certain vote or grant.  It was discovered later that there should be a readjustment and that the expenditure should be out of some other grant. There is an issue consequently at the end of the financial year in respect of the grant out of which it should have been paid.  That figure merely represents an adjustment and is regular.  I wish to say that everything that has been done by us was done in accordance with the custom of the financial system we took over, and that nothing irregular or unprecedented was done.  I think that is the only point raised that causes any difficulty in connection with the finance accounts, and anyone who has paid a little attention to these accounts could easily have unravelled it. Obviously the amount is a very small one.</P>
    <P>The Senator referred in connection with some account to the use of the words &ldquo;written off.&rdquo;  He said the word, generally, was &ldquo;surrendered.&rdquo; Again, if the Senator had looked at the <Col N="881" /> British finance accounts he would have seen that the words &ldquo;written off&rdquo; are used.  The Senator seemed to indicate that we were doing something wrong and irregular, but he does not seem to take the least trouble to see what was done.  Surrender would be the appropriate word if you were dealing with actual cash advances, but when dealing with credit the words to be used are &ldquo;written off.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Senator referred to Account 27, which, he says, purports to give assets and liabilities of the State.  This Account again I have to repeat is a finance account, and it would be misleading to introduce an element such as the value of post office buildings, or government buildings, into it.  You cannot look at the State simply as a commercial firm carrying on.  All the assets in the country are State assets. If it comes to the necessity of falling back on our reserves, Senator Sir John Keane's property and his house would be the property of the State as much as the post office.  To attempt to pretend that the accounts of the State can be made up the same as a commercial house would be really not to make things clearer but to make them entirely misleading.</P>
    <P>There is no reason why some of the particular assets upon which the State has a more immediate claim should be brought in if we are not going to bring in all the assets to which in case of necessity it might have a claim.  These are finance accounts, dealing with cash and debit and with purely finance transactions and considerations.  They do not pretend to be any more.  So far these are matters which were scarcely covered by the motion which Senator Sir John Keane moved.  Dealing with the question of a different system of appropriation accounts and the question of accounting by units, I have already said that we have had great difficulty in doing all that we have done in the matter of public accounting, and in keeping matters right financially. We have not been able to give attention to improvements of the system, but we are prepared to do that when we find it possible to devote attention to it.  I would say, however, that, so far, the information seems to be, that it is only to such things as the <Col N="882" /> Army that this system of accountancy, which Senator Sir John Kean advocates, can best be applied.  It has been adopted in the case of the British Army, but it can be seen immediately that there is a great difference between a big army like that of the British, and a small army such as our own, an army not so much larger than the strength of the old R.I.C.  We give as much detail in regard to our army as was given in regard to the R.I.C.  It is doubtful whether a system that is worth the cost in the case of a big institution like the British Army would be worth the cost here.  To my mind it certainly would not be worth the cost.</P>
    <P>As regards the other Departments, there are not comparable units in every Department, and the system could not very well be applied to them.  One sees that it could be applied in the case of the Army, but that it would cost something, and the question is whether the benefits to be derived from applying it to the Army would be commensurate with the cost of it.  Perhaps if we had adopted a different Army system, if we had got to the stage when we might have some sort of a national defence force on a militia basis and that we had big numbers of men employed, with substantial units which could be compared, there might be advantage in having such a system.  In any case the cost of our Army was less than £4,000,000 last year, and it is going to be considerably less in the coming year. I may say, too, that we are not at the end of reductions in the cost of the Army.  Changes are still going on in it.  However, that is not a matter with which I wish to deal very much.  I have an open mind on the matter and I am prepared to introduce changes when we can have the matter satisfactorily examined.  I would not have troubled to reply in opposition if Senator Sir John Keane had confined himself to an advocacy of the change.  I might think that the change was desirable or I might think that it was undesirable, but in any case I would certainly say that I was prepared to have it examined, although I was not convinced that it was a matter of such urgency that other business of a more urgent nature should be thrown aside. <Col N="883" /> The Senator, however, utters all sorts of criticisms against the Department of Finance and against the officials of that Department, but he has not taken the least trouble to show whether his comparisons will bear examination or not.  He throws off all sorts of innuendoes that things are not being done right, but there is no basis for these innuendoes.  At the present stage, if the Senator wants to criticise &mdash;it is within his duty to criticise&mdash;he should at least take the trouble of making some study of the accounts that he is criticising, and not give the impression or attempt to give the impression or take the risk of giving the impression that things are being done wrongly and that we are not living up to standard, but that we are going outside the principles that have been laid down and acted upon in the past.  I do say that his speech, whether he intended it or not, was an unfair speech.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir JOHN KEANE Sir JOHN KEANE">
      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that I should have given the Minister grounds for introducing such a very personal aspect into this case.  I tried to state my case temperately, and evidently, so far as he is the judge, I failed.  I really do not see that it is germane to the point to drag in a pamphlet that I wrote before ever the Free State was established, in which I attacked the British methods of accountancy, as he admits in rather strong terms.  He should at least have given me credit for having attacked methods of accountancy other than those in operation in this State, and should also draw from that the obvious conclusion that I am not inspired by any special animus against our country or against our Treasury officials.  I admit that the Minister is following the traditional practice inherited from the British, but that does not necessarily mean that it is a good practice.  It may have certain advantages, but the British themselves have realised the necessity for a change, and for some time past they have had a Committee of experts sitting dealing with this very matter which I now ask the Minister to examine.  Surely that is sufficient support for my argument that the British have been doing that for some <Col N="884" /> time past.  Furthermore, this change was recommended by a Royal Commission, presided over by Mr. Herbert Samuel.  I do not think I need pursue the charge the Minister makes against me, that I am determined not to understand. I do not know how he really could read my mentality with that thoroughness.  It is unworthy, I think of any Minister to accuse his critics of dishonesty of purpose, because that is what it amounts to.  In regard to the delay, I accept from the Minister his statement that the British have equal delays.  I did not know that was so. I understood that the British published their figures although not complete. He has made his case, and I am unable to answer it at the moment.  I would suggest that three months, the time allowed by statute, is ample to afford the information asked for in the White Paper.  That, of course, is a matter of opinion of which we can all judge. This issue is raised perfectly legitimately now.  It is a year since the Seanad asked that this matter be considered by a Committee.  We did not press the Minister to take action. Surely the pressure of work and other things is no valid excuse for the delay that has taken place in appointing a Committee.  I suggest a small Committee of three people to examine this question.  At least one of these should be an outsider, so that it would only call for the time of two Government officials to investigate this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I submit the Minister did not deal with the more important specific points I raised.  There is one very important point which he did not refer to at all, and that is the Land Commission annuities&mdash;how the life-cycle of the annuities can be traced.  I submit he has not answered that and my case stands good.  The accounts do not show how these land annuities are being paid.  I hope he does not suggest that I implied that the land annuities are not paid; I believe they are, but the accounts do not show it.  One has to be very careful because everything one says may be construed as a veiled attack on the integrity of our Government and on its finance officials.  I had no such purpose in my remarks.  The Minister admits that for the first time he passed <Col N="885" /> from cash to credit in the 1923 accounts. He says it is a very simple matter for everyone to understand.  I submit it is most misleading.  For 24 pages of this White Paper it is all cash transactions, and on the 25th page the credit begins and there is nothing to explain that.  One must have a very intimate knowledge of accounts to grasp that fact for oneself.  According to the Minister the only point in my argument that stands at all is the issue with regard to the expenditure out of the previous year's grant.  I am glad for that crumb of comfort.  With regard to assets, I was unable to understand from the Minister's statement how the liabilities and assets were built up.  He says it was a financial account dealing with credit and debt. I pointed out that one of the assets is the advances for unemployment.  If it dealt with cash and debt surely liquidity is the essence of the whole thing.  If the assets taken for cash must be easily realisable, and anyone must admit that advances to the unemployment fund are not readily realisable, I submit these accounts do require more elucidation before they can be understood by the ordinary citizen.</P>
    <P>It was perhaps unfortunate that I addressed my remarks largely to this White Paper, because the object of the motion was to set up an inquiry into the expenditure side of our accounts and to recast them on modern lines. The Minister, although not convinced, seemed to think there is a <i>prima facie</i> case made out for an inquiry in the case of the army, but even there, he says, the army is so small that it cannot be compared with the British Army. But surely it is a question of relative expenditure.  I have not got the figures of the British Army, but I am sure that it will be within the estimate, and that, relatively, our total expenditure will be higher than in the case of the British Army.  If that is good in one case it is good and desirable in the other.  Of course, the Local Government Accounts are a very fertile field, but the Minister may consider they do not come within his purview.  The Army is not the only department that would be embraced by new inquiry. <Col N="886" /> The Minister is not here now to hear what I am stating and the new points that I put forward.  But again, I must dissociate myself from the charge of making another veiled attack upon the credit or the integrity of the State.</P>

      <P>I think this motion is a very desirable one, and I was sorry that the Minister made such a bad, ill-tempered attack in replying upon this matter.  I was not surprised, because on the last occasion when this matter was brought forward he seemed to think it much more important to go out and meet some deputation from the country than to sit here in the Seanad when this question was brought on. That does not seem to be the way to treat the Seanad.  I will not go into details on this motion.  The Minister said things were all right and there was no use bothering about them.  What actually happened in the Land Purchase annuities is that it is stated definitely that £2,900,000 was paid last year to the Land Purchase account but that nothing was paid this year, and they deduced from that the clear statement that there was a profit of £2,900,000 this year to the State.  We all know that is not so.  The money was paid.  I regret it was because it ought not to be paid.  It was paid, and yet the Minister claims to have saved £2,900,000 this year.  That is about as much as it is worth saying about this extremely ill-tempered speech.</P>

      <P>New Section.  Before Section 71 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;71.&mdash;The following enactments, that is to say, sub-section (1) of Section 201 of the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1878 (41 and 42 Vic. ch. 52) and sub-sections (7) and (8) of Section 51 of the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1898 (61 and 62 Vic. ch. 37) shall not apply to a contract made by a sanitary authority to pay fees for professional services.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must apologise to the Seanad for bringing up this motion again.  A fortnight ago I proposed it, and there was a certain amount of debate in connection with it, but in looking over the reports I came to the conclusion that I was misunderstood or misinterpreted or that I did not make myself sufficiently clear when I brought the matter up in Committee.  I had no idea of proposing a repeal of the section or an amendment of the section.  All I aimed at was to try and exempt certain professional officers from coming under this control.  It has caused, undoubtedly, some hardships which I have come in contact with myself, and all I asked was that this section should not apply to particular officers.  If it is at all possible for the Minister to <Col N="888" /> meet me sympathetically, then I should be quite satisfied if he would undertake to investigate any cases that may be brought before him and adjudicate upon them himself.  At present it appears to me that the law lays down hard and fast rules which cannot be passed over.  This question of the £50 contract, or services rendered, requiring a sealed contract, is from the professional man's point of view a very objectionable thing.  I have had long experience of a great number of boards not only in Ireland but in England, and I have had dealings with Governments and I never had a sealed contract with any one of them.  It was simply by order of the Board conveyed to me by their officer.  That is the method generally accepted by the profession at large.  There is undoubtedly a safeguard guaranteed to officers in that they may have a writ in their pockets and when six months has expired they may hand it in.  I do not think that is the way the profession would start at this time of the day, and if it is at all possible that there may be some modification to meet us we should be extremely grateful.  I would suggest those words myself.  I thought that possibly the prominent legal members of the Seanad, or the Minister, might devise some form of words to give some abatement of this very serious hindrance.</P>

If he has not I would like to point out that there are a great many cases in which the engineer could not possibly furnish his bill within six months, because he would not know what was due.  If the power that was possessed by the old Local Government Board is maintained by the Minister, the power of extending the time in cases where he thought it was justified, I think the case would be fairly met.

      <P>I think Senator Griffith realises himself the difficulty of accepting this amendment and deleting this very important section.  It would be a very difficult thing to make an exception in respect of professional gentlemen and to permit them to enter into contracts not under seal.  After all, that is the only way in which a local authority will have an idea of the amount of the contract and what it is for.  A contract for a sum over £50 is quite an important matter.  I do not think it would be fair, and in fact it would not be possible to make concessions in that direction.  With regard to Senator Barrington's point, I would like first to point out that the Statute of Limitations does not start to run until the debt is due, and until the creditor is actually aware of the amount of money due.  I have power under the 1909 Act to extend the limitations up to two years.  In the ordinary course it is three months.  I can understand that a case might arise for extending it for two years.  That enables me to get rid of any hardship that might arise in any particular case. With all respect, I do not think these engineers are under any disability, and I ask Senator Sir John Griffith not to press his amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to propose:</P>
      <P>60. New section.  Before section 75, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>75.&mdash;(1) Save as is hereinafter provided, all appointments to any permanent office or situation in the clerical grades of the service of a local authority shall be made by means of open competitive examination in accordance with regulations made by the local authority and approved by the Minister.  Irish shall be a compulsory subject at such examinations.</P>
      <P>(2) Every such open competitive examination shall be open to all persons desiring to attend it who are ordinarily resident in Ireland and pay the fees and possess the qualifications as to age, health and character prescribed by the regulations relating to the examination.</P>
      <P>(3)  A local authority with the consent of the Minister may by the regulations relating to examinations held under this section restrict competition to persons ordinarily resident in the area of the local authority or of an area of another local authority adjoining or comprising that of the first-mentioned local authority or may provide that a proportion of the vacancies to be filled shall be filled by appointments of persons so qualified as aforesaid.</P>
      <P>(4)  Two or more local authorities may make joint arrangements for the holding of examinations for the purposes of this section.</P>
      <P>(5)  A local authority or two or more local authorities acting jointly may enter into an agreement with the Civil Service Commissioners for the conduct of examinations for the purpose of this section by those Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(6)  Subject to the assent of the Minister, this section shall not apply to appointments made by way of promotion or transfer of a person already employed by a local authority or by way of transfer of a person <Col N="891" /> already employed in the same or a similar capacity by another local authority.</P>
    <P>(7)  Any question as to whether an appointment comes within the scope of this section or otherwise arising under this section shall be determined by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to ensure that all appointments to the clerical services of every local authority will be made through the medium of open competitive examination. I think the principles of it will be generally accepted by the Seanad. I think the details will also satisfy the various requirements.  It is an effort to deal, as far as possible, with the scandals, irregularities, nepotism, and canvassing influences that are inherently associated with most appointments made by local authorities.  Where appointments to a clerical position are not made by open competition, with certain necessary professional qualifications, it will be almost invariably found that efficiency and suitability are at a discount, and that ability to influence and corrupt is at a premium.  I am sure that every member of a local authority will welcome any provision that will free them from the very irregular and unpleasant attentions to which he is subjected whenever a vacancy of a clerical kind occurs in any of these local authorities.  The first section provides that there shall be an appointment by open competition under the regulations made by the local authority and approved by the Minister.  The second sub-section provides that the examination shall be open to people ordinarily resident in Ireland, and who pay the fees and possess the qualifications as to age, health, and so forth that may be laid down. The third sub-section provides that any local authority may, with the consent of the Minister, restrict the competition to persons ordinarily resident within the area of the local authority or that of the adjacent local authority. The fourth sub-section enables two or more local authorities to make joint arrangements for the holding of examinations. For instance, an urban council might at comparatively small <Col N="892" /> expense like to join up with two or more similar townships for the purposes of the examinations.  Sub-section 5 enables the local authority to enter into an agreement with the Civil Service Commissioners regarding the conduct of the examination.  Sub-section 6 is an important one, because it enables the council, with the assent of the Minister, to dispense with open competitive examination in respect of officers already employed by other authorities transferred to the new authority, or in the case of promotion. Sub-section 7 leaves it to the Minister to decide in cases where there was a doubt as to whether any particular position or positions come within the terms of this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. FARREN Mr. FARREN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FARREN</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to second the amendment.  I just want to say this: that this amendment has been put down as a result of the discussion that took place on the Committee Stage of the Bill when an amendment was being moved to deal with the question of canvassing, and the suggestion was made that the way to deal with it was to institute a kind of competitive examination or Civil Service examination for clerical positions under these bodies. We all must admit that heretofore, under the system that was in operation, it did not naturally follow that it was the person with the best qualifications that got the position, but the person with the most influence. In order to prevent a recurrence of this, this amendment is moved.  Now, we do know that members on public boards who have to give a considerable amount of their time to the discharge of their duties have been placed in an extremely awkward position for themselves when appointments were being made by local bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know that this system of canvassing developed into a high art. The unfortunate member of a public board, if in business in a small way, was canvassed by his best customers, who put the screw on him to get him to vote for a particular candidate. In order to protect members of public boards, and to secure that the people appointed would be the best people for the position, we bring forward this amendment.  It may require <Col N="893" /> some alteration, but if accepted it will concede a principle, and it will be easy to establish in future that positions that can be filled by competition shall be so filled, and that people with the most brains and intelligence, whether they have local influence or not, will be appointed to those positions.</P>

I think promotions in a council should be the concern of the council, and not of the Minister, and I think the test of examinations should not be applied to them.  These promotions, in my opinion, should be within the competency of the local authorities, and should not be included in this scheme.  If they are not specifically excluded there would be danger there would be some cause shown why a man should not be promoted.  The matter of promotion should be the inherent right of the council.  With that exception I have referred to, I support the amendment. It meets the case, in my opinion, in the way it should be met.</P>

When an appointment was vacant it did not always result that the best man was appointed to the position. Where it is a matter of promotion or transfer, the clause, as drafted, would, I think, give rise to some difficulty. That is not a very material point, and, generally speaking, I am in favour of the amendment and will vote for it.</P>

      <P>We are all much in sympathy with the principle of this amendment.  So far as it goes it seems to be well thought out, and very worthy of support, in the ordinary way.  In the Committee Stage I mentioned that I intended bringing a provision of this kind into the Bill, but when we started to hammer the thing out it grew to such large proportions that we found it to be necessary to deal with it in the form of a separate Bill.  I am still of that opinion.  This amendment goes a long way to meet the situation, but we have not had the opportunity to think the matter out.  There are various phrases in the amendment that might require some legal investigation, for instance, to know exactly what clerical grade means, and to know whether we should not extend the term to include professional people and others.  There are several other points in it that will require the closest investigation.  I feel the only effect of accepting this amendment now would be that when it goes back to the Dáil it would mean that a great number of amendments would come back here, to be amended again, which would delay the passage of the Bill for a considerable period.  I can promise the Senator to bring in a Bill soon which will embody the principle of this amendment, and which will give more satisfaction to him and everybody else.  For that reason I ask him to withdraw the amendment for the time being, and I will try to meet his views in a more comprehensive measure later on.</P>

      <P>This was my amendment originally, but I would like to make a few remarks on the general effect of these Orders.  Under this section the Minister takes power to make rules and regulations, and he has gone to a very considerable extent to meet the demand of the House that the accounts should be in a form capable of comparison, and further that these rules shall be laid.  In regard to the laying of rules, which has an important bearing on this point, General Order as to accounts of Board of Health, 1924, in due course was laid, and in due course, as no objection was raised, became operative.  The House will recollect I raised the matter of the unsuitability and the complexity of these accounts for practical purposes.  In these accounts, or in the order to which these accounts are scheduled, it is stated that the order shall come into operation on the 1st day of April, 1924, that rules and regulations therein contained shall on and after said day have effect in regard to the several matters to which they relate, and it is provided that the Minister for Local Government may from time to time consent to any departure from such rules and regulations. These rules and regulations have been materially varied as laid before this House.  I understand and I think there is no doubt about it that any variation of these rules and regulations constitutes new regulations and should also be laid.  No such new regulation has been laid, in spite of the fact that a totally new form of accounts has been introduced.  The origin of these accounts is obscure, and I have no knowledge of them.  These accounts are an <Col N="896" /> alteration in substance, and are essentially different from the statutory accounts which were approved by this House, and by virtue of which approval they are sacred and could not be altered.  I see in one of these accounts I have here &ldquo;Dollard's simplified series, copyright, Medical return, cut leaf pattern,&rdquo; and so on; and the other one has &ldquo;Dollard's simplified series Diet distribution book, copyright register No. 77671/2.</P>
      <P>The obvious inference of this is that the printers have acquired a copyright in certain statutory regulations which have never received the approval of this House, which by virtue of not being challenged have automatically become statutory regulations.  The question may be insignificant, but the principle is very big, and it shows what a farce a number of these rules and regulations may be if they are not watched carefully, and how this laying of papers on the Table may mean nothing at all. This is an instance of that, so that we should be exceedingly particular to see that our sovereign rights in this matter are safeguarded.</P>

      <P>I am opposed to having such a complicated thing as this put before a county council.  I think it is very hard to follow it and that it ought to be left to their discretion to elect the members of the board of health without having to go through all the procedure set out in the amendment.</P>

      <P>I think that the complication is not as great as Senator Linehan imagines.  If he reads it carefully I think he will see that any child could figure it out.  There is one thing that I did not explain on the last day, and that, I think, is very important; that is, that the county council may adopt this method, or it may not. It only says &ldquo;may&rdquo;; it is not &ldquo;shall.&rdquo;&ldquo;Shall&rdquo; occurs for the election of the county councillors for <Col N="899" /> the area, but in the grouping system they may, if they so desire, use this method, and I think you will agree that it will mean a method of proportional representation in the election of the county board of health.</P>

      <P>You were good enough to say, sir, that an amendment left over yesterday might be brought up at the later stage.  As it would involve a very considerable change of wording it may be better to do it now, instead of on the last stage.  It deals with Section 38, page 21, line 4, and it is about the break in a term of service of a pensionable officer under a committee. The principle was agreed to yesterday, but it was pointed out by Senator Bennett that it gave a better chance to the men I referred to if their service was broken.  I have a new form of words that will safeguard that:</P>
      <P>Provided that for the purposes of this paragraph the period of service of such a person shall be deemed to be continuous, notwithstanding that at any time between the 1st day of January, 1919, and the 6th day of December, 1921, such service was interrupted for a period of not more than six months owing to the committee or joint committee in whose service such person then was serving ceased to administer the said Agricultural and Technical Instruction (Ireland) Act, 1899.</P>
