      <P>Perhaps I should mention in connection with that, that I have received a request from the Minister for Industry and Commerce to ascertain from the Seanad if they would wish to have a discussion upon a motion similar to that which was introduced by him last week in the Dáil, and, if so, he would be glad if a date was fixed for it.  He asked me to ascertain what the wishes and the views of the Seanad were with regard to it.  Senators are aware that since the matter was before the Seanad a motion was introduced and discussed in the Dáil, and the Minister is quite prepared to have a similar motion proposed here if the Seanad wish.  If they think they have already discussed it sufficiently, of course that is a matter for the Seanad, not for me, but the Minister is quite prepared to have the motion introduced if the Seanad wish for an opportunity to debate it.  If the Seanad expresses a desire to debate the matter, perhaps that opportunity would satisfy Senator Sir John Keane.</P>

      <P>Of course, there cannot be a debate on this matter. A matter introduced on the adjournment is generally confined to the Senator who raises it.  He does not move a motion, but simply calls attention to a matter which he wishes to ventilate, and the Minister, if he is present, is entitled to reply.  There is no time allowed for discussion.</P>

      <P>The suggestion made by the Minister is a very excellent one.  As far as I am personally concerned, I should very much like that we should have an opportunity of discussing a resolution similar to the one submitted to the Dáil.  That apparently is the desire of the Minister. At all events, he is prepared to meet us if we wish to have that discussion. I think we ought to take every opportunity of discussing this very important question, and I strongly support the suggestion that we should have a discussion on a resolution similar to the one introduced in the Dáil on a date to be appointed to suit the convenience of the Seanad.  As far as Senator Sir John Keane's notice is concerned, he is quite at liberty to make his speech this afternoon, but I am sorry that more Senators are not here to hear it.  That will not interfere in any way with the discussion on the other motion, whenever a date is set down for the purpose.</P>

      <P>It would probably be wiser to fix a time for further discussion of this matter, as suggested by the Minister, after the Easter adjournment. Personally, I do not feel any desire to discuss it, but in view of the various discussions that have taken place since the last debate amongst Senators, and the matter that Senator Sir J. Keane wishes to call attention to, I think it is better to accept the proposal of the Minister and to have the matter debated openly in the Seanad at a very early date after the reassembly.  If Senator Sir J. Keane raises this matter on the adjournment, he will be within his rights, but I would respectfully suggest to him, in view of the understanding come to, which was not a binding understanding, but was generally accepted by Senators, it would be better if the matter were taken up after Easter instead of this evening.</P>

    <Title>HOUSING BILL, 1925&mdash;SECOND STAGE.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed&mdash;&ldquo;That this Bill be now read a second time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. FARREN Mr. FARREN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FARREN</NameTxt>
      <P>While not actively opposing the Second Reading of this Bill, I must say that I cannot give it the whole-hearted support I should like.  This Bill differs in some respects from last year's measure, under which, unfortunately, the number of houses built in urban areas was very few.  This Bill is different from that of last year inasmuch as it proposes to wipe out the restrictions placed on the selling and letting prices of houses built under it.  It is probable that under this Bill a large number of houses will be built, but the question as to who will occupy those houses is another matter.  From my knowledge of the building industry, I feel certain that if a large number of houses are not built in the urban areas under this Bill they never will be built.  Under this Bill the private or speculative builder can get a subsidy of £150 from the State and the local authority towards the building of every house.  In addition, the houses, if let or sold, will carry reduced rates for a period of twenty years.  I am afraid if we do not get houses built in sufficient numbers under this Bill, with all those advantages, that we shall never get them built.  I am also satisfied that the people who are most in need of houses will not be housed under this Bill. However, so long as anybody who is in need of a house is being housed, good work is being done, and every house built, no matter under what conditions, will in some small way help to solve the housing problem.  We can only hope that when all the people who can afford to pay the rents which will be demanded, or to buy the houses which will be built under this Bill are <Col N="1065" /> provided for, the unfortunate people living in the slums will then be attended to.</P>
      <P>It may be said that it will be mostly artisans and people of that class who will inhabit those houses.  I feel satisfied that not five per cent. of the artisans in any of our cities will ever be in a position out of their own earnings to pay the rents which will be demanded, or to purchase one of these houses under present conditions.  During the debate in the Dáil on this Bill, Deputy Wilson said that ten per cent. of a man's earnings or wages was a fair figure to put down for rent.  I would be prepared to accept that, or a little less or more.  From one-sixth to one-eighth of a man's wages is the amount generally allowed for rent.  I doubt if any artisan will ever have sufficient wages to pay the rents of one of the houses that will be built under this Bill.  Some people may say that the subsidy is being given for the purpose of providing houses for the working classes.  Other people complain that an economic rent is not being paid.  I maintain that so long as wages are kept at their present level and rents are as high as at present, the State is really subsidising the employers. If the workers have to pay an economic rent, the wages will have to be very much increased in order to enable them to pay the rents that will be charged for these houses.</P>
      <P>A particular section that was in last year's Act has been left out of this Bill.  That was a section dealing with powers that were taken regarding the purchase price of materials and the acquisition of materials.  On the second reading of this Bill in the Dáil the President stated that there was no necessity for that section nor for using the powers that it conferred, and stated that he did not think it necessary to insert it in this Bill.  I hope there will not be necessity to regret the step that has been taken regarding the question of price or the supply of materials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support this Bill for two reasons. In the first place, I want to see houses put up&mdash;I do not care under what conditions&mdash;and in the second place, because the effect of the Bill will be to <Col N="1066" /> provide much-needed employment in the building industry.  For some years I have been listening to theoretical experts&mdash;I do not know whether that is the correct term or not, but it strikes me that it is the correct one to apply to people who have been talking about houses within the last few years&mdash; preaching from the house-tops that it was want of skilled labour that was responsible for the small building output in this country.  I want to say&mdash; and I defy contradiction in this&mdash;that there is sufficient skilled and unskilled labour available in Dublin to build more houses than were ever built in any year in this country.  At the moment there are between 500 and 600 carpenters and joiners unemployed in the city, as well as thousands of unskilled labourers.  If these men were at work they could produce houses.  We are always being told by the theoretical experts that it was want of skilled labour during the last twelve months that held back the building industry, when, as a matter of fact, skilled labour was not fully employed.  The one redeeming feature that I see about this Bill is that there is great hope that in the coming year all the available skilled labour, and I hope most of the unskilled labour, will be employed in the erection of houses.  In some way that will help to solve the problem of unemployment. I sincerely hope, when the people who will get houses under this Bill have been catered for, that a serious effort will be made to house the poor people in the slums, who can never hope to be able to inhabit the houses that will be built under this Bill, owing to the rents that will be charged.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir T. ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the Senator has given this Bill his mitigated blessing.  We are all interested in the question of building.  Whether this Bill carries out all the intentions of the framers remains to be seen.  At all events, we can send the Bill on with our best wishes and in the hope that it may achieve its object.  If it does not succeed in all its objects, it will be time enough to bring in another Bill later on when conditions, as far as building is concerned, have improved. I was very glad to hear Senator Farren <Col N="1067" /> say that there was no lack of skilled labour.  I am quite certain we have plenty of such labour, and the only trouble is to find occupation for it.  If this Bill does nothing else but give employment throughout the country, I think the Seanad will welcome it.  Here as well as in England and in other countries we are suffering from a dearth of houses, so that the sooner we set to work and build houses, no matter what kind of houses they are, the better.</P>
      <P>At the outset the Senator stated that there was very little possibility of artisans buying houses that would be built under this Bill, but we do not know that that will be so.  While deferring to Senator Farren's greater experience, we may hope that some of the houses will be bought by the artisan occupiers.  I think that through the operation of thrift societies or through some method of that kind, artisans might be in a position to buy their houses.  At all events we can wish this Bill well, and we will watch its operations with interest.  When times improve, if it is found that this Bill does not do enough, another Bill may be brought in.</P>
      <P>A possibility that should not be overlooked is that of interesting foreign capital in the building in Ireland.  I have had quite a number of important inquiries from other countries as to the prospects of building in Dublin.  We should welcome such inquiries.  This Bill will be something to which we can point as one that offers certain facilities for building, and it might encourage foreign capitalists to invest their money here.  As to the remission of rates, I think it is a good proposal. Our present rating system is peculiar, inasmuch as the more a man improves his property the more he is taxed.  I suppose under the present system there is no way out of that, but I think the remission of rates in this Bill will remove certain obstacles in the way of building for some years.  I see that it takes 20 years before full rates have to be paid on houses built under the Bill. For that reason, amongst others, I hope the Bill will be availed of.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GUINNESS</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of some remarks made by Senator Farren, I should like to ask the President whether under the Bill it will be possible for a builder, speculative or otherwise, who has put up one or more houses, to exact or obtain a rack rent?  I gather from what Senator Farren has stated that there is no restriction whatever on the rent that can be levied for these houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the question raised by Senator Guinness is that if last year's Act were not repealed, as it will be repealed by the passing of the Bill now before the Seanad, a house could not be let beyond a certain figure.  That figure is repealed by this Bill both as regards selling and letting value.  The reason for the change in this year's Bill is that out of something like 3,000 houses built under last year's Act only 200 were built for letting or for sale.  I may say that last year's Act might be regarded as an experimental Act.  This year's Bill is a further experiment in the light of the experience that we gained from last year's Act.  The first thing that was evident from last year's Act was that there was much greater building activity in rural districts than in towns.  The case put up to us, as a reason why houses were not built in towns, was that we were limiting the market as regards letting and selling price, and that it would be better not to limit that market.  Although most theorists would say that it would not be good business to limit the market, but that we should be entitled to demand that the houses should be either sold at a cheap price or let at a cheap price, the real aim of last year's measure was not achieved.  The real aim was that a much larger number of houses should be built in urban areas. Strictly from the point of view of urban areas, last year's Act did not fulfil expectations.  It is more than possible that the re-introduction of last year's measure might have better results this year, but we would not have been satisfied with such results.  We came definitely to the conclusion that two things would have to be attempted in this year's measure: that local authorities should be induced, as far as <Col N="1069" /> possible within their resources, to extend their activities during the year to the provision of houses which would meet those that we had, as it were, barred out under the limitations of last year's Act, as regards sale and letting, and, at the same time, that a great effort should be made to stimulate private enterprise in the provision of houses and the sale of those houses at whatever price the market would command.</P>
      <P>At some interviews I had last year with builders, amongst others with one gentleman who, I think, had an auctioneer's business, I inquired whether if there were in Dublin one thousand houses such as would be built under the Act, would there be sale for them at the price we had stipulated, and he informed me that there would.  At the same time, I endeavoured to enlist the assistance of builders and some philanthropic organisations with a view to having houses provided.  However, the Act was not a success in such places as Dublin city.  Cork city or Limerick, but I think there was a considerable amount of activity in Waterford. About last autumn a number of members of local authorities met here in Dublin under the auspices of the Municipal Authorities Association and put it to me that it was very desirable last year's Act should be amended with a view to allowing local authorities to build under the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be within the recollection of Senators that one of the principal arguments put forward in favour of last year's Act was that we intended to resuscitate, as far as reasonably possible, private enterprise in the building of houses.  With the sums which were provided under the Act, in the first place by the Government, and in the second place at the will of the local authority, with the considerable reduction there was in rates, it was thought that it would be possible to bring out again what is called the speculative builder.  We believe the first real problem in connection with housing, that is, how to supply the immense demand for houses, ought to be our principal aim.  It is with a view to a fairly considerable provision of a number of new houses that this particular measure before <Col N="1070" /> the Seanad this evening has been conceived.</P>
    <P>As regards the activity of the local authorities, it will be observed that local authorities get £100 per house as against £75 given to an individual. Grouped with the local authorities are organisations called public utility societies.  The activities of organisations which might be classed under that particular heading have been much more successful and helpful in the matter of providing houses for artisans or for those who properly should be housed under what are called the Housing of the Working Classes Acts.  Their activities were more strenuous and pronounced than the activities of the local authorities.  Here in Dublin, where a claim might be made of good work on the part of those who are protagonists of the Corporation, one particular local company, established as far back as 1878, and ceasing its operations fourteen or fifteen years ago, has up to date even a greater number of houses to its credit than the Corporation of Dublin.  It is with a hope of reviving interest on the part of such organisations that public utility societies are grouped with and given the same advantages as local authorities under this Bill, and while Senator Farren may be quite correct in saying that the Bill falls short of his anticipations, I think if he gives a little more consideration to it, he will find, compared with last year's Act, that it is certainly an advance even from his standpoint. What was complained about in last year's measure was that the local authorities were eliminated.  We have now put them in and given them all the advantages they would have if they were in last year's Act.  In anticipation of this measure passing, I understand that the Commissioners of the City of Dublin have at present under consideration the construction of something like 1,200 houses.  I cannot express any opinion on the possibilities of activity by public utility societies or kindred organisations, but I do believe that no matter how you compare this measure with last year's one, that it is a marked advance on last year's Act. It should have better results, and it should stimulate the speculative builder, <Col N="1071" /> because there is no complaint for him now.  He can operate on the market to the fullest possible extent. There is no limitation whatever on the provision of houses.  He can take whatever price he can get, and the ultimate reduction in the price of houses can only be achieved when the supply is greater than the demand.</P>

      <P>Section 6.&mdash;To add at the end of the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5) The Council of a County Borough or of an Urban District may, on representations made to them by a Public Utility Society, with the approval of the Minister, put into force the powers conferred on them by the Housing of the Working Classes (Ireland) Act, to acquire land by agreement, or compulsorily, for the purpose of selling or leasing land to any Public Utility Society.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to empower local authorities to use the powers conferred on them under the Working Classes (Ireland) Act to acquire <Col N="1072" /> land by agreement or compulsorily for the purpose of selling or leasing land to any public utility society.  Local authorities have that power already as far as building schemes of their own are concerned, and the object of this amendment is to enable them to use that power for the purpose of acquiring land for building purposes for a public utility society. It will be seen from the amendment that that power could only be utilised with the approval of the Minister, and probably it would rarely be necessary, but at all events it would be a guarantee that unreasonable or pig-headed landlords could not unduly hold up a building scheme taken in hands by a public utility society.  We know that very admirable schemes have been delayed and rendered abortive by the unreasonable attitude of landlords in regard to giving sites.  This would prevent anything of that kind and would give to the local authority power to acquire land compulsorily if they so desire, and to lease or let it to the public utility society for the purposes of this Bill.  I think the amendment is fairly expressive.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>This power is already possessed by local authorities under Section 8 of the Housing of the Working Classes (Ireland) Act, 1919. It might be said, in fact, apart from that Act, to be in operation under the Housing of the Working Classes (Ireland) Act, 1890, where they could acquire lands for housing schemes and where it would be open to them to dispose of it to a person or persons who would promulgate the housing scheme. If there were any doubt about this under the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, it is undoubtedly right under the Act of 1919.  When I was first appointed Minister for Local Government in 1919 under Dáil Eireann, I remember circularising local authorities, and I think I laid stress that this power, which was practically unknown, might be put into operation forthwith.</P>

      <P>During the year, with regard to this point, the Local Government Department and I intend to consider the application of the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act towards small schemes in the future.  The difficulty in the way is the provision of money.  At the present prices it is unlikely that it will be possible to fund the particular sources from which this money is made available, and in consequence the Small Dwellings Acquisition (Ireland) Acts may be interfered with.  We will undertake to give the matter careful consideration during the year and see if it is at all possible to avail of the useful class of legislative facilities afforded under the Act.</P>

      <P>In connection with Section 8, I should like to call attention to an amendment made by the Dáil on the last day the Bill was before them, which, it seems to me, is conflicting with the principle which we discussed very fully in connection with the building clauses of the Local Government Act which the Dáil subsequently accepted.  It is the provision attached to sub-section 4 of clause 8, to this effect: &ldquo;The valuation of such buildings under the Valuation Acts may and when required by the Minister shall be deemed by the local authority to be the valuation which was in force in respect of such buildings.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think any such power was given to the Minister under the Local Government Act building clauses.  I do not think it is contrary to the principle <Col N="1075" /> which this House adopted in that Act and which the Dáil subsequently adopted.  I may be wrong, and probably the President will throw some light on the matter.  I suggest that the words &ldquo;may and when required by the Minister&rdquo; be eliminated so that the section shall read: &ldquo;The Valuation Acts shall be deemed by the local authority...&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I regret I was not here when the Seanad passed that particular amendment of the Local Government Act.  I know I had a load to carry in the Dáil in persuading them to accept the recommendation of the Seanad in that respect.  As regards sub-section 4 of Section 8, let us take a house the value of which is, say £X, which is reconstructed, and put into such a condition that its value is £X plus X/10 pounds In that case, if the valuation had been increased from £20 to £22, I do not think it was the intention of the Seanad that such a small increase in valuation as that and such a small expenditure upon a particular house ought to warrant such large relief as was proposed under Section 69 of the Local Government Act&mdash;that is, to be liable only for one-third of the assessment for a period of six years.  Even if it were the case, the fact is that here the money is supplied in the first instance by the Government, and at the election of the local authority by the local authority.  What the Minister seeks to carry into force here is that the cases would be weighed up in such a way as that an amount which would be inconsiderable should not warrant a person getting such a large relief from local rates as was contemplated. When the amendment to the Local Government Bill was being discussed, and when it was passed, the main case for its acceptance was the cost of building during those years was so high that a person investing in building might not be sure in the majority of those years that he was getting the market value for his money, and it was a compensation to him for the big expense he was incurring to get relief from the burden of rates.  In this case it was plain that there might be such an instance as this: <Col N="1076" /> the expense of reconstructing a house might be £100.  The State would contribute £20 and the local authority £10, and the actual cost to the individual would be only £70.  If the annual valuation were only increased by 10 per cent. there would not be an equitable case there to warrant that person getting a reduction of two-thirds of his rates for a given number of years. What is proposed by this clause is the equalisation of the matter: that, where there is minor reconstruction carried out, instead of the big slice which was proposed to be given under the Local Government Act, the old rate should stand for seven years.  In connection with the reconstruction of Dublin in 1916, and, more recently still, in 1922, I think the number of years given was eight, in one case, and twelve in the other.  This is not as good a case as that, and we are proposing to give seven years.  We believe that that will do justice to the individual and, at the same time, that it will not place an undue burden on the local authority.</P>

      <P>I desire to call attention to a matter of very simple character.  During the debate on Senator Sir John Griffith's motion, the Government, in opposing the proposal to refer the scheme of Messrs. Siemens and the experts' report to further examination, used the argument that Parliament was the right body to decide the question in its present form. On that ground, a very serious responsibility rests on every member of both Houses to satisfy himself, as far as he can, that the basis of the scheme is sound.  It is not a responsibility that can be shifted on to anybody else, and one cannot surrender one's judgment to experts, however eminent they be and however one realises one's own limitations.  Where these limitations operate, one does not profess to set up one's opinion against that of experts of eminent character, but there are several matters in connection with this scheme that any plain man, with requisite data, can form his own opinion upon.  With regard to our competence to examine this scheme, on the information available, it is quite impossible to form a reasoned judgment upon it. I refer especially to the financial provisions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I cannot allow you to discuss the merits of this scheme, save in regard to the particular matter on which you got permission to speak&mdash;the refusal of the Government to publish plans, schedules of prices, and so on.  A discussion on the general merits and finances of the Bill would not be in order at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>I was about to urge that the present information is so condensed as to be insufficient for forming a proper judgment.  Without the basic figures on which the summaries of costs are founded, it is impossible to form a reasoned opinion on this scheme and discharge one's responsibility as a member of this House. I listened to the debate in the Dáil during one day, with much interest and attention.  I was struck by the skilful manner in which the Minister handled the matter, and I was also much struck by an interjection he made when asked why he refused to publish these figures. He said&mdash;I think I am quoting his exact words, though I am speaking from recollection&mdash;that they &ldquo;might be put to improper use.&rdquo;  I suggest that by being withheld from this House they are not being put to proper use. It is our duty, if we are to deal adequately with this proposition, to make up our minds on the broad, second-reading aspect of the whole problem. I suggest that although Parliament, as a whole, seems to be satisfied with this measure, there is considerable apprehension amongst a small, but very important, section of the community at the lack of information.  That small section of the community may be called upon to play an important part in the financing of this scheme.  It is necessary that they should be educated and instructed if they are to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for INDUSTRY and COMMERCE (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I expected to hear some argument as to why plans and prices should be forthcoming. Senator Sir John Keane has simply said&mdash;it appeared to me to amount to a veiled threat&mdash;that if certain people did not get certain information then these people would not be amenable when it would come to their playing a considerable part later on. <Col N="1079" /> I do not know what that means.  If it means that there is going to be any stand on the part of banks or financial houses with regard to the financing of this scheme, then it may have to be pointed out to banks, as has been previously pointed out to them, that they do not own all the money that is in their possession.  They are merely the trustees of that money for the people who lodged it with them.  If the people who put their money there are satisfied, then we do not expect to have any trouble with the banks, but, if we have trouble with them, we are in a position to meet it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the plans and prices and their publication, I have received from Messrs. Siemens-Schuckert plans which are much more than the vague general sort of plan which is put in when a Private Bill is being considered.  I am taking this Siemens-Schuckert scheme, in relation to Private Bill procedure, as having its preamble proved, other details being about to be considered and legislation being about to be brought in to carry out the proposals. Private Bill procedure admits of the production of a certain type of plan of a very general nature, and not of much use to anybody.  We have plans of a much more detailed character than that &mdash;plans so detailed that they cannot be made public, because if these plans, in all their details, were made public, the whole ideas of the contractors would be made public.  It is surely unreasonable to say, in the same breath, that there should be open competition and that you should, previous to calling for tenders, make public the tender of the first and main contractor.  These people have lodged certain plans with me. These plans are too detailed for me to make public.  There are certain plans, however, which should be made known to people who are likely to be affected, such as landowners along the stretch where the new canal is to be.  Having got my resolution approved by the Dáil the other day, I am in a position to incur certain expenditure in getting prepared plans of the same general type as would be presented with a Private Bill.  These will be made available to people who are interested, but <Col N="1080" /> they will be plans of the type I have outlined&mdash;not the detailed plans of the contractors, which I have in my possession.</P>
    <P>The same thing really rules with regard to prices.  Private Bill procedure admits of certain vague estimates as to costs.  As Private Bill procedure really applies to private ventures, and as those private promoters may have to bear the loss themselves, I think there is not very much detail required from them.  I hold that Messrs. Siemens-Schuckert's proposals, particularly as annotated by the experts, contain much more than would be required if they were proceeded with by way of Private Bill legislation.  In so far as my promise with regard to plans goes for the future, and in so far as what has been done in regard to prices is concerned, the Siemens-Schuckert proposals are much more advanced, from the point of view of Private Bill procedure, than Private Bill procedure would warrant. If people have any fears with regard to those prices, I have again to state the position as it is: if Siemens-Schuckert cannot turn out these contracts at the prices they have estimated, then that is going to be Siemens-Schuckert's loss.  The costs are binding so far as they are concerned.  If they have under-estimated it is their look-out; we do not suffer.  If they have estimated at too high a figure, then we have our checks and we can bring these prices down, in the words of the White Paper, to &ldquo;world market prices&rdquo; or to the prices that we consider a reputable firm in any part of the world would do any part of the work for.  The matter is safeguarded, from the Irish point of view, in two ways.  If Siemens-Schuckert have estimated too low, then it is going to be their loss.  If they have estimated too high, not merely in bulk, but in respect of any particular item, we can challenge them on that item and by means of the checks provided for in paragraphs 11 and 12, can cut down their price.</P>
    <P>I see no reason for giving any details of the prices other than have been given.  We have in our possession from Messrs. Siemens-Schuckerts the schedule of prices on which their whole accounts <Col N="1081" /> were made up.  The consulting engineers employed by us&mdash;the four continental experts&mdash;have passed these as sound.  Where those prices touch on Irish conditions, they have been subjected to the examination of three or four Government Departments and they have been passed as sound.  In every way the position is safeguarded and I see no reason whatever for making either the price or the detailed plans available for the public.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BARRINGTON</NameTxt>
      <P>With reference to the statement of the Minister, I would like to point out, as one who has spent a considerable portion of his life in preparing plans for Private Bill Committees, that as regards this scheme there is nothing in existence at the present moment to enable anyone interested to form an opinion as to what the proposals are&mdash;nothing comparable to what has to be done before a Private Bill Committee.  The plans that have to be prepared to go before a Private Bill Committee are not, by any means as vague as the Minister suggests.  The Minister also referred to Private Bills as simply private ventures.  I think he must be misinformed as regards that. Private Bills refer to Government Bills as well as public ventures.  Whenever it is intended to interfere with the property or the interests of anybody, Private Bill legislation requires that plans be laid before the Committee, no matter who the promoters are, whether local authorities or the State.  I think it is only fair that the public should have some knowledge of what is proposed. From the information that is given to us at the moment, no one has any means of forming an idea as to how they will be affected.</P>

      <P>Anyone has only to read the newspapers or to listen to the speeches that were made here on the last occasion to find out that not <Col N="1082" /> one good word was said by its opponents for the scheme at all.  I imagine that the opponents of it have studied it so closely that they have saturated themselves with its ineffectiveness, so that it would be a mere waste of time to supply further information that would only confirm them more deeply in their belief that the scheme is absolutely useless and impracticable.  Of course, it is an old game to try to kill a scheme with kindness, to show that you are so deeply interested in it that you want every bit of it&mdash;in other words, that you want to dismember it and make it absolutely impossible. There are a lot of those avowing interest in this scheme from the point of view of getting information, but it would look as if their object was otherwise, and as if it was being inspired by people, not so much opposed to the scheme, as by a desire to obtain the contract for people other than the people involved.  I cannot see why there is such tremendous interest in this scheme across the Channel, except it is a desire to capture the contract for this utterly impractical scheme.  I think the Minister has satisfied the House that he has already given all the information necessary, and more than would be required in the case of a Private Bill.  If he has done that.  I think it is sufficient, and it would be surely unfair, if there is to be competition, that every detail supplied by the firm that examined the scheme and evolved it should be made public.  It would certainly place them in a false position.  Whatever more details are required should be indicated when legislation is introduced, and when this House, in its wisdom, will have power to hold up the scheme if they think that further information should be adduced. I think that is the time, instead of now, to submit details which in many respects are obviously unnecessary, except for the information of the promoters.  The threat in regard to the financiers as to the aspect especially in which they will view the scheme justifies what we have already said, that the opposition has been mainly from the point of view of interested people, or financial interests which may be affected if the scheme comes into operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>One word more, especially in reference to the remarks of the last speaker.  It is astounding that Senator O'Farrell, on more than one occasion, suggested that any comment, or, if you like to call it opposition, or even inquiry in regard to this scheme is based on ulterior motives or is inspired by self-interest.  I only speak for myself, and I strongly resent the imputation.  I am not, in any way, connected with any interest whatsoever concerned in this scheme, nor with any contractor, nor have I been approached by any interest, contractor or financier, as to what attitude I should take up. I am acting entirely on my own responsibility, and I have no ulterior purposes to serve.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand how these estimates are final and binding as maximum in view of the fact that the experts refer to variations owing to change in quantities.  Messrs. Siemens say, in their report, that where they come to bogland in the preparation of their embankments a change in quantities may have to be made.  Surely, without being an engineer, one may realise that may involve a change in quantities.  They will have to be varied and may affect the price.  I only mention that as one matter.  I have studied this report very carefully, and I could deal with the matter at much greater length if I wanted to.  I only want now to call attention to one general point, and that is, to the lack of information upon which one has to satisfy oneself on this and many other difficulties at which one arrives from an examination of this report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one point I would like to deal with. Page 80 of the experts' report contains the definite statement by the experts that these costs are to be taken as sound within a 10 per cent. variation. That 10 per cent. variation is to be taken as part of the cost with which that chapter in page 80 deals&mdash;that is, the civil constructional part.  Senator Sir John Keane referred to what he called one of many things.  He referred to the only thing in which there is any variation possible, and that variation is possible, remember, just on the point that he has stated&mdash;that quantities may <Col N="1084" /> vary.  But in all this, there are unit prices fixed for the quantities.  The quantities may vary.  The excavation work in connection with the canal may be through rock or earth, or it may be a mixture of both.  According to that, of course, there will be a variation, but outside that there is no possible variation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>

If the quantities vary, say by three hundred per cent. for the civil constructional part, obviously a change will follow.  Borings have been taken, the best possible estimates have been made, and the experts' judgment is that 10 per cent. is the amount that can be counted on.</P>

The unit price for whatever the quantity is, is absolutely fixed, and the only matter is what the multiplier is to be.</P>

That being so, the business that is at present available for us consists of the Treasonable and Seditious Offences Bill, and the Shannon scheme motion which the Minister for Industry and Commerce was speaking about, and which will be available when we next meet.  It seems to me it will not be necessary to ask the House to meet again until the 29th April, that is, the week after the Dáil assembles.</P>
      <P>On the 29th we will take the Second Reading of the Treasonable and Seditious Offences Bill.  Then there is a motion standing in the name of Senator Bennett which will appear in the Agenda for that day.  I would like the House, if they find it at all convenient, to study the Treasonable and Seditious Offences Bill during the Easter vacation, so that they may have their amendments in and so enable us to take up the Committee Stage of that Bill on Thursday, 30th.</P>
