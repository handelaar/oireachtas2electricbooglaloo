      <P>I have received a letter from the Chairman of the Board of Works with reference to a letter I wrote to him on the matter of the acoustic properties of this Chamber In this letter he writes as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;Since my letter to you of the 22nd ultimo further experiments have been carried out about this matter, and it seems clear that the trouble arises from the reverberations from the hard, smooth surfaces of the walls and a part of the floor, and possibly also the ceiling.  We have had curtains hung on the walls and the bare spaces of the floor carpeted with temporary coverings, and the Seanad will, no doubt, be able to judge at the meeting to-day whether these measures are sufficient to overcome the difficulty.  If not, we can readily extend them, and I have no doubt the room can be made satisfactory.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Inquiries have been made with regard to the date at which the furniture, carpets, and other fittings of the Chamber will be finally completed.  As you are aware, special furniture is being made which will take a considerable time, and special carpets are being woven, but I think I can promise that all will be ready by the end of September.&mdash;Yours sincerely, P. Hanson.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I would like to say with regard to this Bill that when it was in this House there was a section or clause that had been inserted at the Committee Stage, but it was deleted in this House on the motion of a Senator and deleted by a substantial majority.  I notice that in the subsequent, discussions in the other House it was stated that I, as Chairman, should there and then have directed the Bill to be re-committed to the Committee.  This seems to me to be a complete misapprehension as to what the proper procedure is.  The striking out of a clause in a Private Bill that has been inserted in Committee does not leave any subject matter for re-committal. It is only the insertion of new matter, and even, in the case of new matter, the Bill usually is not re-committed <Col N="336" /> unless the new matter is considered by the Chairman to be one of substance.  All that happened in this House was that something inserted by the Committee was deleted.  I have no experience of, nor do I know of, any case in which that has constituted a reason for the re-committal of a Bill.</P>

      <P>I came rather under the impression that the practice here was that I would rather reply to criticisms than make a preliminary statement.  The main provisions of the Bill are quite easy to explain, I think.  Under the law as it stands it is practically impossible, I do not say legally impossible, but practically impossible <Col N="337" /> to initiate any new arterial drainage scheme with any prospect of success.  The existing code is the code of 1863, and that code, in itself, never a very perfect one, was framed to suit very different circumstances from those now existing.  Since 1863, and especially since 1881, the whole economic and social life of the country has undergone a considerable change and a Bill that might be suitable enough when you had to deal with only a small number of proprietors, accustomed to look after their estates, is not so in these circumstances.  That Act, it was obvious, became more and more unsuitable since the Land Act of 1881 and still more clearly so since the Land Acts that followed.  For instance, the whole initiating expenses had to be borne by the promoters of the Bill. These were private individuals.  Sometimes these expenses were considerable, amounting to anything from £50 to possibly £200.</P>
      <P>Under the present system of landholding it would be practically impossible and unreasonable to expect that promoters&mdash;that is, the people who first move, at all events in a scheme of this kind&mdash;should be asked to put up these preliminary expenses.  Even if it were not unreasonable it would certainly not be a proposition that had much chance of success.  Then so far as the scheme itself is concerned, remember, under the Act of 1863, practically all the responsibility for the drainage and the details of the scheme, and the carrying out of the scheme ultimately was borne by the promoters.  The engineer that carried out the scheme was an engineer appointed and paid by the promoters. The central authority, in this case the Board of Works, had actually very little power to interfere.  The most they could do, was, so to speak, to vet the scheme.  Then when that scheme was through, the cost generally was paid back by means of annuities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, the social changes that have taken place in the meanwhile have brought it about that even the paying back of these original expenses in the way of annuities is exceedingly difficult.  The annuities were exceedingly difficult to collect.  It is easier to collect a charge if it is a <Col N="338" /> pretty large sum when only a few individuals have to pay it, but when, for instance, about 1,000 individuals have to pay, and when the actual charge is sometimes very small, it becomes exceedingly difficult to collect.  That is still more so in the case of the small maintenance drainage rates that have to be collected afterwards.  Sometimes in connection with that rate it might amount to 1/-, possibly one penny, and the expense of collecting a special rate of one penny is, of course, altogether too great in proportion to the amount collected.  As a result of the inherent defects of the Act itself and the accompanying Acts, and as a result of the general changes that have taken place, practicaly no scheme has been initiated in recent times.  The first move made in connection with arterial drainage was made last May, when the Oireachtas passed an Act to bring up to date the procedure for maintaining existing districts, in which over £3,000,000 was spent, and which were allowed to go into neglect.  This is a further advance to deal with the creation of new districts.  You will notice in the Bill that initiation still is with the people whose lands are affected. That is in Section 2 of the Bill.  Any six or more people whose lands are affected may send a petition to the county council.  The county council will immediately&mdash;I hope immediately&mdash; refer that petition to the county surveyor or, if they think he has too much to do, they can refer it to an engineer to make a report&mdash;not a detailed report, not a report for the purpose of drawing up a scheme, but a report on the general merits whether in reality this suggestion is worth going further with &mdash;in other words, whether it is worth the trouble of the Board of Works to send down a special engineer who has experience of drainage matters to draw up the full scheme.  If the county council takes that step it also undertakes certain responsibility, for instance, the repayment of the annuity and also the future maintenance of the drainage district if the scheme is carried through. That procedure is dealt with in Section 3.</P>
    <P>Section 4 deals with the attitude <Col N="339" /> taken up by the Commissioners; they will naturally get their expert advisers; then can decide that the scheme is not one which can be further proceeded with.  Then the scheme lapses.  After that, if the Commissioners decide that the scheme should be further proceeded with, then it is their duty to make the investigation, to draw up the scheme, and to set out the various matters mentioned in Clause 6. The rivers which have to be dealt with, the works proposed to be undertaken, the rights to be interfered with, the property to be interfered with, the various people to be affected&mdash;all that will be set out.</P>
    <P>I will draw your attention to one particular matter here, which is, to a certain extent, a new factor in this particular Bill as compared with existing drainage legislation, that is that contribution may be made by the State.  Up to the present that was not provided for in legislation.  The promoters bore the whole expense, and the improved land had to pay the whole expense.  It was recognised that at present prices that would mean practically very little drainage work could be done.  Hence the Bill takes power to allow the Minister for Finance to decide whether or not he will make a contribution to the scheme.  The next step is to notify everyone affected. That is dealt with in Clause 7, which arranges for publication in the official Gazette, and also notification to the different individuals or people whose rights are affected.  I may remark in passing that this is a complicated Bill. In some respects that is so.  The Bill itself is complicated.  We have found it, however, impossible to drop any of the particular stages.  You have to interfere with the private rights of individuals. At the same time you have to exercise compulsion, that is, if the majority in the district whose lands are affected are in a favour of a scheme of this kind being carried out, then compulsion&mdash;one man may hold up the scheme because he gets no benefit out of it&mdash;must be exercised on a number of individuals.  It is quite possible to give them an opportunity of stating <Col N="340" /> their case.  It is impossible to get away from that difficulty and not to face it.  Also, ultimately, remember it is a charge that will be made on the people whose lands are affected, and later on there is a provision that they should be allowed to decide whether or not they will have the scheme.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides for the objections that individuals have to the scheme, and section 9 deals with the hearing of the objections.  As you will see from section 11, while people are asked to vote on the scheme it does not mean that each man's vote is quite as good as another man's vote in this Bill.  It does not mean that a man who has, say, ten times as much property as his neighbour will have ten times as many votes.  What it does mean is, that if one man's land is affected ten times as much as another man's land, and that, therefore he has responsibility for ten times as much of a charge, he will have proportionately a larger vote in the decision that is come to.  It is really a vote, so to speak, on the amount of estimated benefited land that a man has.  If there is a majority in favour of the scheme, then the scheme can go on.  In section 12 the usual method is adopted of deciding what amount of compensation is necessary for public or private rights of various kinds that may be affected.</P>
    <P>As regards the money.  In the first instance it will be provided by the State.  A portion of that money will be paid back to the State, but a certain portion may be given by means of a grant.  What is not given by means of a grant will be paid back to the State, some of it in the way of annuities by the people whose lands are benefited, while other portions will be paid back by the county council if the county council undertakes to do so.  It is optional with the county council to undertake such a responsibility.  In the case of a county council that agrees to make contributions, the money will be given on loan to the county council which, just like the owners of land that is benefited, will pay that money back by means of annuities.  As to the method of repayments an enquiry will be held.  I am speaking now of the amounts for which individuals are <Col N="341" /> liable.  An enquiry will be held, and an estimate made as to the extent to which each person has benefited.  His proportion of the total annuity will then be decided&mdash;at least a proposal will be put forward.  There will be a final opportunity given to the people to protest against the award.</P>
    <P>After that the award will be made final and the people will pay their proportions as laid down in the award. Section 19 is the next important one.  It deals with the maintenance of drainage works.  It is there simply following the procedure adopted last year by the Oireachtas in the Drainage Maintenance Act of 1924.  It was found impossible in many cases to collect the maintenance rate in the existing districts by means of separate and distinct officials for that purpose.  Consequently, to put it roughly if not legally, this equates the maintenance rate and puts it more or less on a level with the poor rate.  It will be collected in the same way as the poor rate, and the county council will be responsible for the collection of it.  In that way it does not matter whether the rate is a halfpenny or £20, it can be collected because the machinery is there to collect it, but in the existing drainage districts there is no such machinery available at present.  I do not think there is any other point I need deal with.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of the Bill before the Seanad is to improve the foundation upon which rests the administration of <Col N="343" /> the law that governs our fresh water fisheries.  The fishery laws, as they stand, date as far back as 1848, and were framed in very different circumstances to the conditions that obtain at the present time.</P>
    <P>Speaking to the Seanad, I need not dwell upon the importance or the possibilities of our fresh water fisheries as a national asset.  The export value of our fresh water fish in 1924 as between salmon, eel and trout alone was something over £240,000.  It was actually more than one-half of our whole fishery export for the year.  Now, that is one side of it.  Then you have to consider the possibilities of our fresh water fisheries from an angling point of view.  It attracts to us a big number of visitors from other countries, and this forms indirectly a big money value for the State.  Now, I feel that it is possible to increase very greatly the value we derive from our fresh water fisheries, and the present Bill is aimed at getting that further value from our fresh water fisheries.</P>
    <P>The Act of 1848 divided the country into districts, and in each district it provided for a Board of Conservators. Some of those conservators were elected by the licence holders, whether the rod licence holders or the drift-net licence holders or the draft-net licence holders.  Some were appointed because of their possession of proprietary fisheries, and some were <i>ex officio</i> from another aspect.  The Act laid down at that time a scale of licences to be levied on the different engines, whether rod, net and so on.  These duties so paid as licences formed the main revenue of the Board of Conservators for fishery protection.  The functions of the Board were, of course, chiefly the protection of the fisheries, and the payment of the bailiffs to look after the rivers, and especially to look after the rivers during the spawning season.  The Board of Conservators under that Act and up to now have been rather extremely autonomous; the central department had very little control over the Board of Conservators. We hold that the Bill before the Seanad removes the defects which the experience gained from the administration <Col N="344" /> of the fishery laws has revealed in the constitution of the local Board of Conservators.  It also aims at increasing the revenue of the boards so that they may be able to carry on their duties more efficiently.</P>
    <P>Coming to the Bill itself, Part 1 deals with the elections and membership of the Board of Conservators.  It deals with the constitution of the boards by extending, first of all, the resident qualifications for members. Formerly a man could not become a member of the Board of Conservators unless he resided in the district.  We are extending that qualification for members, so that whereas formerly a person in order to become a member of a Board of Conservators had to be resident in the electoral division in the district for which he was going up, we now provide in this Bill that if he is resident in any part of the district he may be elected to the Board of Conservators for that district, perhaps even in a different electoral division to that in which he resides.  That is the difficulty we met.</P>
    <P>We have also reduced the property qualification from £100 to £50 and we have modified the voting power of the licence holders.  We also provide for the filling of casual vacancies by cooption. It is an extraordinary thing about the former Acts that there was no provision for filling a vacancy caused by death or otherwise on a Board of Conservators.  Once a man was elected he could not resign; he remained until the next election.  If a man died there was no way of filling the vacancy created by his death.  We have met that in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Part 2 of the Bill is probably the most important.  It deals with the finance question of the boards.  We are proposing to increase the revenue of the boards by two means; number one being the increase of the licence duty on rods, nets, and eel-weirs, and secondly by relief for a period of ten years&mdash;it actually works out 9½ years&mdash; of all valued fisheries from their liability for local rates and diverting the rates that would be so imposed to the pockets of the conservators for fishery purposes, that is, the preservation of the fisheries.  At present privately-owned <Col N="345" /> fisheries are like any other property valued for rates on the local valuation. We have felt&mdash;the Local Government Department thinks otherwise&mdash;that fisheries get very little in return for the amount of money paid out in that way through rates from the revenue derived from valued fisheries.  We are now proposing to stop the rates from the local authority for a period of ten years and divert those rates towards the Boards of Conservators for fishery purposes.  The local authorities will not lose very much on the whole.  Each individual local authority will lose comparatively little, while the fisheries will gain considerably.  The total rated value of private fisheries in the Saorstát is only £18,884, whereas the whole rated valuation of the Saorstát is something over £11,000,000.  That will show how negligible the whole thing is from the point of view of income. We have taken cognisance of the fact that there may be a few places where the provision under this Bill will fall rather heavier on the local authorities, as, for instance, such places as Galway and Ballina.</P>
    <P>In these places the transference of the rates on the fisheries from the local authority to the Board of Conservators may mean a serious imposition on the other ratepayers in these particular districts.  We provide for that in this Bill.  In the case of any particular local authority where the operations of this Bill would amount to more than a penny in the pound on the other ratepayers we meet the balance over a penny in the pound.  If you take an urban district with the rateable valuation of £120,000 and suppose that the poundage in that district is 15/- in the pound, the return from the rates there would be about £90,000.  Supposing in that district you have a fishery valued at £1,000, the rate on that would be £750.  That actually works out, on a rateable valuation of £120,000, at three halfpence in the pound.  The local people have to bear the penny. We make up the halfpenny, which means from us in that case £250.  In other words, from my Department the local authority would be subsidised to the extent of £250 in cases such as this. The total revenue from all sources of <Col N="346" /> the twenty-one Boards of Conservators in the Saorstát in 1923 was £10,000.  It is obvious that that is entirely insufficient for the proper patrolling and policing of our inland rivers and lakes.</P>
    <P>Under the provisions of this Bill we hope that the amount will be doubled. Given that revenue, we hope that it will be possible for the conservators to employ a better type of bailiff than they have been able to employ in the past, and that they will employ more of them.  The amount capable of being devoted to the payment of watchers and bailiffs in 1923 was £5,200.  There were something like 340 of them, and that worked out that these officials were paid at something like £16 a year. You will not get a proper type of man for that amount.  A man does not feel that the job is something that he would be worried about if he lost it, and if a man feels like that, he is not going to do the job very well.  In speaking on this point I think I should pay a tribute to the Gárda Síochána. The new as well as the old bailiffs will have their willing co-operation.  Since they went into the country the Gárda Síochána have done extraordinary work, considering the fact that they were an unarmed force at a time when poachers generally were not unarmed, and they have been doing extraordinary work towards fishery preservation.  The new type of bailiff which we hope to have as a result of the new finances will be willingly helped by the Gárda Síochána.</P>
    <P>Now we come to Part 3 of the Bill, which is aimed at restrictions on the disposal of illegally-caught fish.  In last year's Act we got after the poacher with fairly stringent penalties, but we have found that they are not sufficient.  You will not kill the poacher until you kill the person who buys his fish.  In this Bill we are trying to get after the dealer.  We insist in Part 3 that any person who deals in salmon or trout must be licensed, and in order to get a licence he must get a certificate from the local district justice as to character and so on.  We retain power to withdraw licences in certain conditions, and we insist that when a person holds a licence he shall keep a register of his sales, which can be examined <Col N="347" /> at any time by the officials of the Board or by the Gárda Síochána.  We think that that is a very important part of the Bill, and we believe that by it we are going to make poaching less attractive to the poacher, because it will be more difficult for him to get rid of his illegal catch.  Now, as regards the clauses in Part 4, many of the persons who have not been disposing of their fish locally have been sending it across Channel.  We are trying to close that loophole by insisting on packages being marked &ldquo;salmon&rdquo; or &ldquo;trout,&rdquo; and we are getting after the carriers.  That is Section 22.  The other clauses of the Bill deal purely with details of administration, such, for instance, as one empowering me to make bye-laws.</P>
    <P>Through a flaw in the Ministers and Secretaries Act, the Department of Lands and Agriculture still retains power to make bye-laws on fishery matters.  This Bill gives me that power. It is the same as regards regulations and other matters.  The Boards of Conservators have, on the whole, considering the finances at their disposal, done their work rather well in the past. We cannot, of course, excuse the fact that our rivers have not had the care which they should have had, and as a result they have not been the valuable asset to the nation which they might have been.  We hope that the Bill now before you will remedy these things, and will put our inland fisheries on a footing which they have not been on in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EarlofKerry" hpid="The EARL of KERRY The EARL of KERRY">
      <NameTxt>The EARL of KERRY</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on the Bill, which, I am quite sure, will go far in attaining the objects which he has explained, and which should put the fisheries of the Saorstát in a much better position than they have been in before as regards preservation and conservation.  I would, however, like to ask the Minister a question.  I see in Clause 13 that it is provided that the conservators are empowered to strike a rate on all fisheries within their district rated for the relief of the poor.  That means, of course, on all fisheries which are already <Col N="348" /> rated.  I would like to know what the procedure would be in the case of fisheries not already rated.</P>
      <P>My object in asking that question is that I know quite a good many small fisheries which I believe are not rated at all.  I cannot help thinking that it would be a very good thing if they paid their quota, however small, towards the preservation of fish in their districts. It is quite true that in the past it might be said that some of these fisheries were looked after by some private keeper. Many of those have now disappeared and the preservation of the fish has to be looked after by the Boards of Conservators. If the Conservators of the district are in charge of the preservation of a fishery, it seems to me that it is only right and fair that the owner of that fishery should contribute by a rate, however small.  I want to know how that can be done, whether the conservators can get the fishery rated if they think fit to do so, or whether they can approach the county authorities to get it rated in the first instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pass from that to a subject on which the Minister has been good enough to listen to some suggestions of mine, which I made some time back. That is on the matter of poisoning of fish.  He pointed out at the time that the points I made were already embodied in this Bill.  There are two or three ways in which it might be possible to strengthen still further these provisions.  I will put these down in the form of amendments which I hope will in time receive the Minister's favourable consideration.  I only now want to touch on the matter in a general way.  I do not know whether everyone here realises that the poisoning of rivers may be safely said to be the most insidious and the most deadly form of poaching which exists.  Probably most of us, especially those of us who fish, have some sympathy with the poacher who goes out with a rod and line, braves the law, and tries to catch fish, or even the gentleman who with a triangle and a piece of lead, manages to snatch a fish which he sees lying in the pool, but I think none of us have any sympathy with the poisoner of fish who destroys fish in this brutal and wholesale manner.  Perhaps I might <Col N="349" /> say something as to the way in which poisoning is carried out.  It is all too simple.  The poison employed may be, of course, something which is like lime, but the thing which is almost always used is spurge, which I believe to naturalists is known by the name of euphorbia.  It grows in parts of Cork and Kerry where this system of poaching is carried on.  A child goes out and gets a certain amount of these roots and pulls them up.  When you have got a sufficient quantity you take a little at dead of night and put it in a ripple at the top of the pool.  In two or three hours, every fish in that pool, big and little, will be dead.</P>
    <P>The next item on the programme is the collection of the fish so poisoned. This is generally done by a considerable party of men, very often armed, who go at the first streak of dawn and collect these fish which are floating about on the top of the river.  They bring them to their destination before anyone is about.</P>
    <P>All that is very simple, but very hard to check.  The point I want to make is that this poisoning, although prevalent only in a small part of the country. is particularly dangerous because it is done in small rivers, and small rivers, as everyone knows, are the favourite nurseries of salmon and sea trout. The fish prefer to spawn in the shallow water with a gravelly bottom.  The fish come up these rivers in numbers out of all proportion to the size of these rivers in order to propagate their species.  The poisoning destroys not only the fish which are in the river at the time, the matured fish, but also the future fish, because the poison does not respect age or sex, and all these small fry come up dead, even before the larger fish.  Anyone who knows anything about salmon knows that these small fry are the result of spawn which has been hatched out perhaps that year or the year before.  They are working down to the sea, and they would in due course come up again, many of them, up that same river.  If you continue to poison the river systematically you destroy the entire population, present and future, of that river.  I think that that proves another point, that the <Col N="350" /> poisoning of one river affects many other rivers in the same district, possibly even rivers in other districts.</P>
    <P>I know a particular river&mdash;other members of the Seanad may know the same river&mdash;which runs into the Kenmare Estuary.  It has been quite consistently poisoned in years past.  By right there should not be any fish in that river.  The fish keep on coming, and there is as much fish in that river as you get in other rivers.  Consequently it follows that fish bred in that river would, if they were allowed, spread over a large area, and that the stock of young salmon must be more or less of a common pool, out of which all the fisheries at particular parts of the coast are fed.  That shows that it is not a matter merely of poisoning one small river, which might be somewhat negligible, but that it is a question of this general stock of fish along the sea coast being destroyed.  From what I have said as to how this poisoning is carried out, it follows that it is extremely hard to catch the actual poisoner. I have heard of one case where the person putting in the poison was caught red-handed, but when you think that a young child can put it in, that it is a matter of only a few seconds, and that it is done always in the dead of night, you can hardly expect the very efficient Gárda Síochána &mdash;and I know they have been working very hard for the preservation of fisheries&mdash;to catch the actual person who does the deed.</P>
    <P>You have perhaps a better chance to catch those who come to take the fish out of the river next morning. They are generally operating in gangs.  The poisoning of the river is done when it is very low.  The men who take the salmon away can wade across it then and escape in that way.  I might mention that these men are generally armed, and it has been suggested, although I have not an amendment down to that effect, that in dealing with such cases the guards should also be armed.  I should think that that would be a very desirable thing.  There is a third party to the contract, if one may so describe it.  The people who take the fish, who, <Col N="351" /> as the Minister told us, are the people it is possible to get at.  There again it is rather difficult in the case of poisoned fish, which is very often disposed of from house to house in backward parts of the country where, unless you put some obligation on the receiver of the fish as well as the seller, you will find it very difficult to catch them.  I have an amendment down to meet that case, and to make such people more easily amenable to the law.  I venture to make these remarks on this subject because it is one on which I claim to know something, and I reside in a district where fishing prevails.  I hope when my amendments come on for discussion the Minister may see his way to accept some of them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.C. LOVE</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to begin by saying that when I spoke at great length on the Fisheries Bill that was before the Seanad last year I made one or two mistakes that I now take the opportunity of correcting.  I said that salmon shed from 100,000 to 200,000 ova.  That was an error.  What I meant was from 10,000 to 20,000.  As a matter of fact the Minister has stated and made it clear that salmon shed 1,000 eggs per lb of the female weight. The Bill of last year made it definitely clear that it aimed at the preservation of spawning fish.  It had my most unbounded sympathy.  If there were things with which I did not agree in the Bill I saw that its object was really to preserve salmon, and that the only way to do that was to preserve the spawning fish.  With most of what Senator the Earl of Kerry said I am in agreement.  I have no sympathy with the poacher.  I would not have the slightest compunction in dealing with an offender.  There are a class of men who are <i>bona fide</i> fishermen, who fish for a living and whose families have done so for hundreds of years.  These men are, by a bye-law, often by misnomer, called poachers.  They merely break a law which was a penal one, and I hope the Minister will introduce a section in the Bill to relieve these men from such penal conditions.  The Minister told us that the total value of fishing in Ireland was £240,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LOVE</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of the salmon caught in this country is exported, for the simple reason that salmon fetches a very big price in England.  In the English rivers salmon have become almost extinct, and that is due to the fact that England has become a great industrial country since 1848.  The rivers there are so polluted that salmon could not live in them.  The are polluted by matter cast off from manufacturing establishments along the banks, with the result that salmon fishing has fallen away greatly.  The year 1848 was a memorable year in this country.  I think the Minister will agree that people who have anything to do with Salmon fishing know that what many of the authorities held then about salmon and the propagation of its species has been completely exploded by the advance of science.  In 1860 I think there was a Royal Commission in England set up for the purpose of enquiring into the fishing conditions of English rivers, and the result is, the law which governs salmon fishing to-day.  That Act was made applicable to this country, but very strangely it occurs that in this country by that Act we have a close season of 48 hours.  In England there is a close season of 36 hours, and in Scotland a close season of 24 hours.  Of course, the effect is to deprive the working fisherman of one clear day in each week.  The salmon is peculiar, and requires certain conditions of weather to come along.  It may be, and probably is, the close day in the week when they are fishing in England that salmon come along, and the poor fisherman for the time being becomes a poacher.  If he is caught he suffers all the penalties.  I hope later on to move an amendment dealing with that, and I will ask the Minister to look at it from an angle that will be more favourable to the working fisherman. I sincerely trust the Minister will do something in the Bill to try and elevate the lot of fishermen who are badly treated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is more on the general aspect of fishing that I now speak.  I believe myself that there is only the faintest and vaguest idea in this country as to <Col N="353" /> the value of our inland fisheries.  I am not now speaking of sea fisheries, but of the inland fisheries, with which the Bill proposes to deal.  As Senator the Earl of Kerry has told us for years and years, one particular river has been &ldquo;spurged.&rdquo;  He told us how these rivers were &ldquo;spurged&rdquo; and how deleterious it was to the rivers and killed everything that came within the radius of it, and even spread to other rivers.  Yet to show how wonderfully gifted we are by nature, notwithstanding that persistent onslaught there are salmon still to be found on that particular river in Kerry.  I do not want to argue for the poacher.  He may be quite as bad as Senator the Earl of Kerry paints him, but I want to mention the wonderful wealth Ireland has in fisheries, which, if propagated and preserved, will bring back our fisheries to the very apex of their usefulness and revenue-returning capacity.</P>
    <P>It is for that reason I congratulate the Minister upon the effort he is making&mdash;though it is not a fulfilment of the promise he gave to codify all fishery laws which I thought was more than he was able to do then&mdash;but he has certainly done well up to the present and I have no great fault to find with the Bill.  With a few amendments, and perhaps a few additions, I think it will be a very good Bill.  I would like to impress on the Seanad how little we know in Ireland of the value of our fisheries, and how, after years of persistent poisoning, we are still sending to the English market as much fish as England and Scotland together, and a bit more.  That is one side of the fisheries question and we should remember, if we do suffer in this country from a lack of commercial progress, that we have some compensation left when we have so valuable a national asset as the fisheries of Ireland, almost as they were in the days of St. Patrick. I admit they are slightly hampered by the poacher, but nature if assisted and if spawning fish are preserved as this Bill intends, will provide a rich harvest from inland fisheries.  Besides salmon, eels are very valuable.  They fetch great prices.  If people could only realise what can be done by fishing a <Col N="354" /> great deal more employment would be given than at present.</P>
    <P>I think, however, the poor fisherman has very rarely anybody to advocate his cause.  He has been looked upon by everybody as a sort of criminal who is getting a little too much tether.  The opposite is the case.  In the debate in the Dáil we were told that the coast of Donegal was seething with drift nets. The Minister told us that these Donegal fishermen caught £40,000 worth of fish in five years.  When you take the number of fishermen covering the whole coast of Donegal with nets there must have been at least five or six hundred fishermen engaged in the drift-net fishing.  In five years they caught £41,000 worth of salmon.  It is clear that the value of the annual capture of these Donegal fishermen was £8,000.  I ask you to imagine, as it would be a difficult thing to calculate, what would one get out of £8,000 spread over six hundred fishermen.  It would provide a breakfast, and probably no dinner or tea.  There is plenty of room for the development of Irish fisheries from a commercial point of view, and for helping the fishermen to live and still have an abundance left for the rod fishermen.  It is quite a mistake to imagine their interests clash with each other in any way.  Again, I have to stress the importance of preserving the spawning salmon, and preserving the fish from October to December.  The real problem is to deal with the spurge. The poisoner must be looked after.  The same difficulties will occur as occurred in the past, but I really think that if the conditions of the Bill are carried out it will be a little more difficult for him to dispose of his fish than it has been in the past.  Sub-section 3 of Section 16: &ldquo;This section shall not apply to a fisherman selling fish of his own lawful capture,&rdquo; seems to me to be a little dangerous.  How are you going to prove that fish sold by a fisherman is lawfully captured?</P>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. LYNCH Mr. LYNCH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYNCH</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephLove" hpid="Mr. LOVE Mr. LOVE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LOVE</NameTxt>
      <P>If he says he caught it <Col N="355" /> you cannot prove it is the particular fish he caught.  I think that sub-section is a little difficult, and I am sure the Minister will deal with it later on.  I would like if he had given some further details about the value of fish.  I know it is difficult and dangerous to rely too much on statistics, but still I think that great stress was laid on the necessity of giving the statistics, prices and costings in other Bills.  This is a Bill which involves no secrets of State, and the State could not suffer in any way by giving us some information as to the value of the fish in Ireland, that is to say how much is to be made annually out of salmon; how much out of trout and how much out of fresh-water eels.  Salmon would require to be subdivided according to the manner of their capture&mdash;so many caught by rod, so many by drift nets, and so on.  In that way we would be able to form an opinion as to whether the drift net was causing the dreadful harm it is supposed to do.  Personally, I do not think it would make any difference in the case of Donegal fishermen, who fish ten miles from the coast with a 1,500 yards net.  I am sure they ought to be allowed bye-laws for the purpose of taking into account the width of an estuary in regard to fishing.  I am also quite satisfied that if the Minister would do what I say, it would give the Senators a better view of the value of the fisheries, and it would make them understand, what I have been endeavouring to impress on them, that notwithstanding the havoc persistently inflicted for years on the fish, the present statistics, such as they are, give an incorrect or cloudy idea of the real value of our fishing.  With these few remarks I will leave the other part of the Bill to be dealt with when we go into Committee.  I share with Senator the Earl of Kerry the privilege of congratulating the Minister on his second Fisheries Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EarlofWicklow" hpid="The EARL of WICKLOW The EARL of WICKLOW">
      <NameTxt>The EARL of WICKLOW</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister one or two small questions, not in any spirit of opposition to his Bill, but simply for my own information.  I should probably <Col N="356" /> not require the information were it not for my own ignorance.  I see it is provided in the Bill that all the licences are to be issued by conservators. Now, why should they not be issued from his own Ministry?  It would cost something to the Board of Conservators to issue these licenses, and it would mean a duplicating of work which, I think, might be done centrally.  I should have thought it would be more economical if the licences were issued by the Minister for Fisheries, and sold in the post offices in the same way as game licences are sold.</P>
      <P>Another point, which appeals to me more, is that the money coming from the licences would be always in the hands of the Ministry.  It strikes me that there may be many districts where licences are collected, and which contribute a great deal of money, and that if such money was in the hands of the Minister he might be able to allocate some of it in poorer districts in a way which would greatly benefit the fisheries of the country as a whole.  I really want to ask the Minister whether he thinks it good policy to charge fishermen who come over here in addition to £2 licence a further 10/-.  We want to encourage the rod fishermen from over seas to come and fish here. It sems to me that it will be enough to charge one licence, which will cover the whole of the fisheries of the Free State.  The Minister told us he was going to double the revenue of the Free State fisheries by this Bill.  I wish he would explain that.  I do not see where the double money is to come from.  It might be done if he put up the price for licences for nets in the same proportion as he put up the licences for rods. I think a great deal more might be paid by owners of nets, considering the great proportion of salmon that they capture in comparison with the number caught by the owners of rods.</P>

      <P>I would add a word of congratulation to the Minister on this Bill.  It is a good Bill, but I think, with the Earl of Kerry, that it could be very much improved in one or two ways.  I have some sympathy with a rod fisherman who comes over here and has to pay £2 under this Bill, and if he <Col N="357" /> moves across the border to another district he has to pay 10/-.  That is hard.  The person I have the greatest sympathy for is the poor rod fishermen, a very large number of whom I know personally in County Kerry.  There is a large number of small farmers whose farms adjoin the salmon rivers, and they have during the last few years been most loyal in the matter of taking out their £1 licences.  They are poor men, and the additional £1 would be a very serious matter for some of them. I am afraid that some of them may give up taking the rod licences and resort to poaching as before.  I think it would be well worth the Minister's while to consider if he could not bring the rod licences back to £1, or at any rate make some provision for a lower rate of licence in the case of small farmers and men of that kind, who are living near rivers on which they have been fishing all their lives.  The other licence to which I intend to refer is the net licence.  The net licence for drift nets has been reduced I understand.</P>

      <P>I am not blaming the Minister, but that is a real defect in the Bill as it has come to us, that the licence which ought to be substantially increased has been reduced.  If no one else will do it I will myself move an amendment on that matter.  I have not yet seen the amendments.  Might I also say this&mdash;the manner in which the Gárda Síochána are carrying out the protection of the rivers in the South of Ireland deserves the greatest possible credit.  The greatest credit is due to them for the work they are doing in the County of Kerry, where they have practically put down poaching in the districts with which I am acquainted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. LYNCH Mr. LYNCH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYNCH</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take the points in the order in which they have been made.  The Earl of Kerry is right in stating that this Bill only deals with fisheries that are already rated.  I will plead guilty to having in my mind what is partly in his mind, that it would be right that certain fisheries that have escaped being valued in the past, from the point of view of poor <Col N="358" /> law valuation, should be valued especially with a view towards providing the revenue during these ten years.  How we are going to do that is a thing that I cannot say at the moment.  However, it is a matter for the Commissioners of Valuation.  I think I know Kerry as well as the Earl of Kerry, and I agree with him, of course, that poisoning does undoubtedly go on there by the means that he mentioned &mdash;spurge.  I really think that one can hardly go further than we went last year in the Act of 1924.  We took steps in that Act to deal with poisoning. These are steps that we can hardly improve on.  I forget the actual wording of the Bill now, as I have not read it for twelve months, but we got after the person who took the fish out of the river, no matter how the fish were killed.  We assumed that they were killed illegally, and the person who took the fish out was very severely dealt with, and a very severe penalty imposed on him.  We took the attitude that the person who took the fish out of the river was some person who was in collaboration with the person who poisoned the river, and we assumed that if we could not catch the poisoner, that if we could catch the person who took out the fish, that we would probably be getting near the mark.  We inflicted a very severe penalty on the person who took the fish out.  This bye-law that has been referred to affects certain people on the Lee.  The bye-law can be changed without a particular Act of the Oireachtas.  I am taking powers under the Bill to make bye-laws to change or revoke particular bye-laws.  The particular bye-laws to which the Senator refers has nothing to do with the Bill.  This is a matter that can be brought forward on request for an inquiry.  The evidence from both sides will be heard. The inspector will report to me, and I will form my decision as to whether I should or should not change the bye-law which is in existence there.</P>

      <P>I do not at all agree with the Senator.  The facts are not so.  Senator Love, of course, refers to the preservation of spawning salmon. I think last year's Act dealt with that as effectively as any Act possibly could deal with it.  The penalties imposed were what you might call almost severe.  They were certainly stringent to the point of severity.  Further than that we cannot go.  We have found that that Act has been working extremely well.  It has been a very great deterrent with the amount of help that we have got from the Gárda Síochána. The Senator referred to one particular section, section 16, sub-section (3) of the Bill.  That sub-section says that &ldquo;this section shall not apply to a fisherman selling fish of his own lawful capture.&rdquo;  That was changed from the original form.  It originally stated: &ldquo;this section shall not apply to a licensed fisherman selling fish of his own capture.&rdquo;  I changed it to its present form because a brown trout fisherman is not licensed and we want to allow a brown trout fisherman to sell his capture as well as any other fisherman.  So long as a fisherman is selling fish that has been lawfully captured, we are satisfied.  I think the amendment is quite all right.  I do, of course, admit that there is a loophole there for a person who pretends he is a fisherman himself and who sells the proceeds of the poacher.  But I think that with the provisions of the Bill we will get after him.  At most, the loophole is as small as we could make it at the moment.  Now, then, he made the point as to who was to prove it.  The onus of proof lies on the person.  The man is charged; it is on him to prove that it was his own lawful capture, and if he cannot prove that it was his lawful capture, then he is convicted. Senator the Earl of Wicklow raised a question first of having these licences issued from the Central Department. There might be something to be said for that.  I think there is a great deal to be said against it.  We want to throw the responsibility for the finances on the local Boards of Conservators. Some person may say it is well to wipe out those Boards of Conservators altogether.  I do not agree, and <Col N="360" /> since we feel they should be there then we must throw some responsibility on them.  Let them have the responsibility of gathering in the finances to help them to do their work and throw on them the responsibility of using the finances for the benefit of the locality of which they are the conservators.  If people get funds rather freely from the State I am afraid their administration is loose.  The more you tie them down by some responsibility the more satisfactory results you will have.</P>
      <P>Senator Brown, I think, referred to the 10/- extra duty.  I must say I am entirely in favour of the 10/- extra from a person going into a district different from that in which he took out his licence.  In the past, anglers coming from England and other places passed through Dublin to fish in places like Kerry, Mayo or Donegal.  They went down and bought some flies at Keegan's, and they bought their licence in the Dublin area.  The Dublin Board of Conservators benefited by the fact that they bought their licence there.  Then they went down and fished in Tirconaill. They never threw a fly in the Dublin area.  Still, it was the Dublin Board of Conservators who were paid. That is inequitable.  If they are going to fish in an area they should buy their licence in that area.</P>

      <P>I do not want to control all the money.  I want to throw responsibility on the conservators.  I was asked, I think, by the Earl of Wicklow as to how we were going to double the amount of revenue the conservators <Col N="361" /> were going to get over this Bill.  Take this rating provision alone, the revenue there represents £18,884. At 10/- in the £ that is over £9,000 plus the licences that they get, which will bring it up to about £20,000.  The total amount of revenue for the year which I mentioned was £10,000. The rating alone will provide practically £10,000 under this Bill.  Then you have the increased rod licence; the extra 10/- with which we have been dealing will bring in a little here and there.  The increased licence for draft nets for the moment until Senator Brown's amendment is passed will make up the £10,000, and shows that we will double at least the amount of revenue they get.  We have not doubled the money on nets and rods.  The Senator mentioned that the draft net was £3 in 1898; we have fixed it at £4.  The original proposal in my Bill when it was brought to the Dáil was to have £4 for the first 400 yards and 5/- extra for every 200 yards.  Tirconaill drift-net men would be paying £5 10s.  The Tirconaill drift-net men got me in the Dáil, and instead of increasing it succeeded in reducing the drift-net man for any length to £2.  In other words, drift-net men with a 1,500 yard net pay the same licence duty as the man who throws a rod, even the poor rod man about whom Senator Brown speaks.  I know some of the poor fishermen in Kerry about whom Senator Brown speaks.  I am glad he chastised me for trying to impose penalties on persons in my own constituency.  We are usually accused of doing the contrary. I have not a terrible lot of sympathy with him.  The fact is, first of all, that the man who uses a rod is a sportsman, who, because he is poor, sells his fish.  If he were a fisherman for the sake of the fish he caught he would use a net, but he is not.  He pays £2 for a licence for his rod.  He gets about at least two and a half times the price for salmon which he got six or seven years ago.  The price of salmon has greatly increased.  I think it is not inequitable to increase the licence on the salmon rod from £1 to £2, and anyhow, I would be entirely against differentiating as between one person and another.  In legislation <Col N="362" /> one should hardly start differentiating between one class of the community and another who are doing the same thing.  The difficulty of drawing the line would be extremely great.</P>

I think it is right that we should allow the local bodies to accept a contract from a local person if the price at which they get the article is not in excess of the price of the official contractor.

      <P>As Senator Linehan has mentioned, this was a matter that was very fully debated on the Committee Stage.  The Senator, I think, has not quite definitely stated what the effect of this amendment would be.  In the Bill the local authority has already the power of giving a preference to a contractor, other than the official contractor, where the price is cheaper and the quality superior.  This is really a question of changing the onus.  The amendment would throw the onus on the Local Government auditor of finding out these particular cases, and whether, in fact, <Col N="364" /> the price was lower and the quality superior.  The whole tenor of the Bill has been to throw that responsibility on the officials of the local authority. The idea is, that henceforth the normal procedure should be to purchase the goods from the official contractor.  It would seriously hamper the working of the measure if the onus was to be changed, and if in every particular case the Minister was responsible for finding out whether the local authority was justified in changing from the official contractor or not.  For that reason, I must strenuously oppose this amendment. An amendment aiming at practically the same thing was defeated on the Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Chathaoirligh, before <Col N="366" /> we take up the Committee Stage, there is just one word, by way of explanation, that I should like to give to the Seanad.  After the debate on the Second Reading Stage had come to a conclusion, I was approached by a Senator from the body of the House, who asked me to develop, or to give evidence, for a certain phrase that I used in the course of the debate.  I was even unable to recollect having used the phrase, and I promised to look into the matter.  I turned up the Official Report when it became available, and I found it arose out of a matter to which Senator Sir John Keane had referred in his closing remarks. I turned up the report, and I found at column 318 that I said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I would like the Senator to find out even where the consulting engineer is called in as to the specifications, and puts up the specifications, how often is there collusion between the consulting engineer and the contractor.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I have no evidence whatever as to collusion between contractors and civil engineers, and no evidence whatever on which to base any such remark.  The remark should not have been made.  It was a slip on my part for the word &ldquo;collaboration,&rdquo; which was actually the word which Senator Guinness believes I intended to use.  I have no evidence whatever for any such charge as this, and I never meant to make it. However, I think it is better I should repudiate, definitely and clearly, any such imputation upon the engineering profession as would appear if the phrase was allowed to stand.</P>

      <P>I beg to move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>After the word &ldquo;Shannon&rdquo; in line 28 to insert the words &ldquo;or other natural resources of the Irish Free State.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am rather sorry to see my name so frequently on the Agenda, but although there are fifteen amendments in my name, they resolve themselves practically to five, because eleven of them turn entirely on the question whether the House will see my point of view that this shall be a general Bill. The object of eleven of these amendments is to carry out the spirit of my intention of trying to persuade the Government that this should be a general national Bill.  I have already endeavoured to explain to the Seanad the reasons why I have supported the Second Reading of this Bill, although I disapprove of the Siemens-Schuckert proposals which have been adopted by the Government.  My reason for supporting the Bill is that I believe in the urgent need of developing the hydro-electrical resources of the Irish Free State to the greatest extent and in the most efficient and economic manner, and because I believe that the water-power resources of this country are of such vital importance that the State should obtain supreme control of them.  The present Bill seeks to confer on the Government certain powers in relation to the River Shannon which, I think, should be extended to every river or source of water-power in the Free State.  In a lecture which I delivered before the Royal Dublin Society in January, 1922, I used these words:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I plead that this great Irish economic problem shall be dealt with on scientific lines.  Each separate river should be examined so that the maximum power may be developed from its source to its mouth or out-fall. Each development throughout the country should be carried out on standard lines, so that when the need arises, the various systems or sources of electric energy may be linked up into a united whole, increasing reliability, neutralising local shortage and ensuring a more regular supply <Col N="368" /> and load factor throughout the country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>While disappointed in regard to the policy adopted by the Government, I have felt bound to support the Government in the Second Reading of this Bill.  The amendments which I propose to the Bill are intended to convert it into a national Bill from one restricted to the Shannon.  This will bring legislation in this case into line with the spirit of the Constitution which claims these sources of power as belonging to the State.  It is only right in discussing this that I should state briefly, and explain, the general reason for which I am opposed to the Shannon scheme, apart from engineering reasons.  I do not think it would be desirable that I should enter into engineering reasons, because we are not here as a body suitable to discuss them.  The Minister has satisfied himself that everything is right by referring to the four experts. Nevertheless I should like to reiterate the statements I made that I totally disapprove of the scheme.  My principal objection to the Siemens-Schuckert Shannon Power Scheme is that it makes the supply of electrical energy for the whole of the Free State dependent on one source of power, namely, the single power station on the Shannon near Limerick.  The lighting, power and heating dependent on this station may be shut down and paralysed by the failure of the station from accident or malicious injury.  The adoption of a single power scheme is founded on an entirely false conception of the problem of providing an economic supply of electricity to the country at large from the available water-power resources of the country.  The four experts are not responsible for this.  They were asked, to use their own words, to examine and report on the scheme prepared by the Siemens-Schuckert Company of Siemens Stadt, Berlin, for the hydro-electric exploitation of the river Shannon and the electrification of the Irish Free State.  The experts were not asked what would be the most efficient and economical method of developing the electrical energy throughout the Irish Free State from the available water-power resources of the country. <Col N="369" /> The experts must, therefore, be exonerated from any blame for the adoption of the single power station on the Shannon.  We have no definite information as to who is really responsible for the proposal, but it is almost inconceivable that such a proposition should be listened to by any responsible authority, for it is impossible to shut one's eyes to the risks involved.  Among the most important customers which, it is contemplated, will be supplied by the Shannon, are Dublin, Waterford, Cork, and Galway, together with the Dublin United Tramway Company.  Is it possible that these authorities will place dependence for their supply on the one string to their bow?  Unless compelled by the State to use the Shannon monopoly, will they not continue to maintain their steam power stations on the grounds of safety, and, consequently, will only use the Shannon as an auxiliary source of supply? It is proposed to deliver electrical energy from the Shannon to Donegal, to the north-western portion of the Irish Free State, and to Connemara, within the natural ambit of the Donegal Lakes, and Lower Erne and Corrib. It is not possible that the Shannon power transmitted over such a long distance could compete economically with current generated from these local sources.</P>
    <P>The reasons why I advocated the Liffey for the first development of hydro-electric power in Ireland were: because it was one of the most attractive sources of water power which the Water Power Resources of Ireland Sub-Committee investigated; because the source of power was close to the city of Dublin, where the market was at hand, where the need was great, and as an economical proposition it could not be challenged; and because, unlike the Shannon, the development of the Liffey water power would not conflict with drainage or navigation interests, while as regards fisheries there would be interference only to a limited extent with salmon fishing, and there would be a great development of trout fishing.  It was estimated by the Water Power Resources <Col N="370" /> of Ireland Sub-Committee that there is just about 500,000 water horse-power available continuously in Ireland which could be economically developed. The catchment area of the Shannon represents only one-eighth of the area of Ireland.  It is, therefore, obvious that there are other sources of power besides the Shannon, which should be conserved and developed.</P>
    <P>The great bulk of this water-power is in the Irish Free State.  The lower Shannon, the lower Erne, the Liffey, the Boyne, the Lee, the Boyle, the Corrib, the Blackwater, and the high level lakes of Donegal, Connemara, Kerry and Wicklow are all important water-power resources which should be used economically in the interests of the country at large.  Each of these sources has its economic area of supply. From each of these centres power would radiate and gradually extend to the economic limit where contact would be made with other economic areas of supply.  These sources of energy would gradually be linked up into a united whole, increasing reliability, neutralising local shortage, and insuring a more regular supply and load factor throughout the country. It is to obtain this desired end that I am proposing the amendments to this Bill which stand in my name.  I may say that I feel very strongly on this important point, for I am under the impression that we can hope for very little progress in this direction from private enterprise.  The experiences of myself and others in connection with Private Bill legislation in this country are such as to lead me to the opinion that it would practically kill every work of this kind in the country.  It is for that reason that I am anxious that the Government should seek powers to deal with all resources of power scattered broadcast through the country.  I do not know exactly how I shall deal with these eleven amendments which are down in my name, as they really come under one category, and turn on the opinion of the Seanad in regard to the views I have put forward. I think these amendments, with your permission, ought to be dealt with together, but I do not know if I am in order in suggesting this.</P>

      <P>Before we proceed with the discussion of these amendments I should like to have your ruling as to whether these amendments are in order, because it would seem to me that if they were passed they would enormously increase the radius of the Bill.  The Bill is based on the development of one particular river in connection with which reports of experts have been brought forward, and in connection with which a regular scheme has been evolved.  The amendments, if carried, would enlarge this proposal to cover the whole of the natural resources of Ireland, and would give to the Minister power, which certainly was not intended when the Bill was introduced, and which, I think, has not been intended at any subsequent stage.  Moreover, the Money Resolution would not cover the extended radius of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been looking into this for the last couple of minutes because I did see a difficulty in connection with it.  Of course, the Senator has an amendment down to alter the title of the Bill so as to enable it to cover this extension.  It is for that reason in Parliamentary practice that when you are in Committee you leave the title to the last, because it may turn out that amendments have been introduced which enlarge the scope of the Bill and, therefore, require the enlargement of the title.  It is another matter to what extent amendments which would so materially enlarge the scope of the Bill, as these would, are really in order at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our Standing Orders do not seem to provide for it.  There is a provision with regard to the Report Stage and, apparently, in the Standing Orders the fact that an amendment, if adopted on Report Stage, would enlarge the scope of a Bill is no objection because that is contemplated.  Curiously enough we have no such order dealing with the Committee Stage.  I will read the Standing Order:&mdash;&ldquo;When a Bill has been returned from a Select Committee or from the Seanad sitting in Committee, notice shall be given of a motion &rsquo;That the Bill be considered on Report.&rsquo; In the Fourth Stage debate <Col N="372" /> amendments may be moved, including amendments by the proposers of the Bill.  If the Seanad desires, it may refer the Bill back to the Committee, or to the Seanad sitting in Committee, with an instruction that specified sections be re-considered.&rdquo;  That seems to contemplate something of the kind, but I am not prepared to rule these amendments of the Senator out of order in view of the procedure which seems to regulate committees.  That is, if the House gives it to them, they have power to enlarge the subject matter of a Bill so long as the amendments are relevant to the subject matter.  Of course, an amendment to extend this Bill to something outside the supply of electricity would have to be ruled out of order as not being relevant to the subject matter of the Bill.  I think, however, that an amendment can be moved in Committee, even though it enlarge the scope of the Bill, so long as it is relevant to the subject matter, the subject matter here being the electrification of the Shannon.  I am not very strong on it, and I will let the matter be further discussed to hear the views of Senators upon it.  I think it is akin to the subject matter.  This being a comprehensive amendment, including all the water powers in the Free State, I am bound to hear a discussion on it, although I admit that it is a big order in the Committee Stage, on a Bill dealing with one river, to enlarge its scope by extending it to deal with the whole water-power resources of the Free State.</P>

      <P>I rather hesitate about giving an opinion.  My view is that the amendments of Senator Sir John Griffith would be in order with the exception of the vital amendments to Section 11, in which he seeks to extend the expenditure of money by some sums which would be quite out of order having regard to the Money Resolution.  It seems to me that it is not out of order to extend the powers of the Bill, but to extend the amount of money that has been provided means in effect that the proposal, when put forward here, is out of order.</P>

      <P>If this motion of Senator Sir John Griffith were adopted by the Committee, and was not then rejected by the Dáil, it would of course, be open to the Minister to get a supplementary grant, would it not?  It would be open to him to obtain by resolution an additional grant to cover the extended purposes of the Bill.  It is not open, however, to this House to insert that.

      <P>The question is how far it affects the power of the Committee to extend the scope of the Bill so long as they do not touch the financial provision part of it.  That would have to be carried out in the usual way.  I think it is safer for me to allow the Senator to move the amendments.

      <P>That is the very thing I am pointing out.  I do not think if we extended the scope and the purpose of the measure we could make any financial provision for that.  That is dealt with by a different form of procedure. Assuming that the Seanad accepted Senator Sir John Griffith's amendment, and that it was accepted in the Dáil and became incorporated in the Bill, I do not see anything to prevent the Government supplementing the Money Resolution by a new resolution.

      <P>I would like to say a word in favour of the amendment, but I doubt if it will be possible to carry it out.  As Senators may remember, I proposed a motion in the early days of the Seanad in terms somewhat similar to the amendment of Senator Sir John Griffith providing for the development of all the waters of Ireland. I think it would have been better if that had been done as I see great difficulty and great trouble in carrying out this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Seanad will reject this amendment.  I hardly think the House will very seriously consider it.  The effect of it will be to give the Minister a roving commission all over the country, for the purpose of the development of electricity, without any proper control by the Oireachtas, or without knowing to what extent such transactions were likely to be successful.  We have in the report of the experts, confined to the Shannon scheme, in the investigations of Siemens-Schuckert, with the annotated report of the experts, sufficient grounds to give the Minister the authority requested in the Bill.  To expand that to all sources of natural power would be to expand this Bill far and away beyond the bounds that the Oireachtas or the promoters ever intended.  I do not think the Seanad is in a position to go into such a matter.  In moving the amendment Senator Sir John Griffith took the advantage of discussing the measure as a whole.  I do not propose to follow him in the discussion because I think his speech was largely a Second Reading one.  It opened up the whole question as to whether it was desirable to develop the Shannon, or to extend the development piecemeal to all other sources of power from which electricity could be produced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of order may be settled but I think the whole intentions of the Bill will have been very largely violated, its scope extended, that it will mean a new Money Resolution if accepted, and that the certain effect will be to delay the Bill I do not think that anyone is desirous that there should be any delay to the progress of the Bill unless those who are opposed to it on <Col N="377" /> principle.  Of course they have their remedy, but I do not think the Seanad should seriously consider passing an amendment of this kind, as if it is carried all the subsequent amendments of a like nature will be automatically carried if the House is consistent, and that will alter the face of the Bill, delay progress, and create a certain amount of chaos.</P>

      <P>It would be a pity if the Seanad were under the impression that by rejecting Senator Sir John Griffith's amendment the country would be thereby deprived of any future resources of water-power.  As far as I remember, in the Shannon Electricity Bill provision is made under the greater scheme to link up any other sources of power in the country.  Therefore, in supporting the Shannon Bill we will also be including in it what is embodied in the amendment in order to embrace fuller development, and we will be including in it and not losing any possible future sources of power as well as avoiding delay that the amendment, if adopted, would cause.  At the moment surely delay is undesirable, if for nothing else but the proposed beet sugar industry, one of the difficulties of which will be the source of power.  By the time we find out whether we were competent to discuss the money aspect of the case or not, the delay might be much greater than we imagine.  Inasmuch as the country loses nothing by rejecting the amendment and gains a great deal, I think the Seanad might see its way to reject it.</P>

Nevertheless I am opposed to the amendment and I find myself compelled to vote against it.  Apart from the reasons which Senator O'Farrell very ably put, and which I heartily endorse, the effect and objects sought by the amendment are so very wide that they are quite big enough for another Bill.  Apart from that, this is really an extension of the principle of the intrusion of Government in commercial affairs to which I <Col N="378" /> am entirely opposed.  From my knowledge of the subject I believe that the Government had much better leave commercial enterprise alone.  For that reason I oppose the amendment, as it very much increases the scope of the original Bill.</P>

      <P>I must ask the Seanad to disagree with the amendment. Acting on my advice in connection with the whole matter of hydroelectric development the country incurred the expense of feeing four experts. These four experts decisively and exclusively reported in favour of the Shannon Scheme.  This is not the time to add other developments to it. I have explained already, as Senator Bagwell has stated, that this amendment contains sufficient matter for an entirely new Bill.  I prefer this Bill without any such development, and I believe it will come earlier than a lot of people now listening expect.  That Bill can be examined in the light of the new experience we will have gained in the development of the Shannon.  I do not want to follow the Senator into each of his statements with regard to the Liffey, as I despair of getting people to examine the experts' report. The Senator said they had not been asked to report on other sources of power, but it will be found by reference to page 16 of that report that they have gone into all sources of power in the country and given their judgment. They have definitely come down and decided in favour of one concentrated station to be fed from the Shannon.</P>

Although it has become unnecessary to consider this matter, it is of such importance that with the permission of the House I shall, after looking into it, make a brief statement about it some other day.  It is one of great importance affecting our deliberations.  I know that there have been a great <Col N="379" /> variety of different opinions on the subject, and very conflicting rulings by Speakers of the British House of Commons on this very point.

      <P>Section 4, sub-section (2), to delete the words &ldquo;one month's&rdquo; in line 8 and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;three months'.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Under Section 4 the Minister is taking power to enter on land or premises on giving one month's notice.  That may operate with great hardship on individuals. Power is asked, for instance, to go into dwelling-houses, and on giving one month's notice turn out the occupants, without finding alternative accommodation elsewhere.  The Government does take upon itself to assist such persons.  Under the Rents Restriction Act a person cannot be turned out of a house unless alternative accommodation is provided.  This is a harsh power, and surely there is no great need for haste.  An opportunity might be given for an agreement to be arrived at, and where an agreement fails it does seem reasonable to give a person three months to find alternative accommodation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to a most peculiar argument, that because it is impossible to find alternative accommodation, it should be impossible to turn a person out without finding alternative accommodation, and that you should, in order to decrease the hardship, extend the notice from one month to three months.  Does the Senator think it would be easier to find alternative accommodation at the end of three months?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir JOHN KEANE Sir JOHN KEANE">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, just in that proportion.  If it is possible we would give longer notice, but if we have a clause, stating we must give three months' notice, it will lead to considerable delay.  After the civil constructional order, the excavation of the canal will be the first item.  That will not <Col N="381" /> start in a variety of places.  It will open up at some one place.  At that point the three months' provision might cause a delay once that start is made. Where is there going to be any serious inconvenience?  Maps and plans will be published, and people will have information as to what is likely to happen to them.  They will get formal information there after a month before anything will happen.  The difference between one and three months at the commencement of the work might cause considerable difficulty.  It would certainly be causing great delay in the carrying out of the scheme.  Hardship will be avoided as far as possible. With a scheme of the sort it is inevitable that a certain amount of inconvenience will be caused to people, but the extending of the notice from one to three months will not very much lessen the inconvenience, while it will make a great difference in the delay it will cause.  I hold that the enlargement of the notice to three months would hinder the opening of the works in connection with the scheme.</P>

When the time arrives, and the works have been going on, and it can <Col N="384" /> be proved to the satisfaction of any fair-minded man that that enhancement has not materialised, then, I think, it should be open to the party affected to have the case re-considered and have the compensation re-adjusted.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that this is altogether an impracticable and unbusinesslike amendment.  There must be some finality about cases of this kind.  Compensation has to be awarded according to assessment under the Acquisition of Land Assessment of Compensation Act of 1919.  The people assessing the compensation will be experts in matters of that kind.  It is quite practicable, I assume, to assess the improvements that may take place in land in regard to drainage.  That very principle has been adopted by the House to-day in respect of the Arterial Drainage Bill.  Commissioners will value the extent to which people's lands will be improved as a result of drainage, and will assess the annuity accordingly.  If that is practicable in the case of arterial drainage, it should be equally practicable in this particular case, where the improvements will be presumably arising out of the drainage, and the limitation of the flooding which now takes place.  The amendment does not state at what time within the ten years the re-valuation or revision shall take place.  Shall it be at the option of the State, or at the option of the claimant when the re-valuation shall take place?  It might turn out when a very dry year will come along&mdash;say, in the fifth year&mdash; that a tenant might reasonably show that he would be a little better off by little flooding of the land, while the next year might be an extremely wet year and he would get the full benefit of the drainage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know what farmers are.  They are no better than any other section of the community when it comes to looking for something for nothing.  If this amendment is carried, and the farmers take their lead from the opponents of the scheme, they could form an intolerable thorn in the side of the scheme for the next ten years.  They could, by their own deliberate efforts, I think, help to prove that there was no improvement <Col N="385" /> as a result of any improvements executed in or near the land.</P>
    <P>I know that many decades ago tenant farmers were taxed, and had their rents increased for any improvement effected by themselves on their own land.  If they drained their land, and thereby improved it, the landlords had power to raise their rents.  If they put in an extra window, or an extra chimney in the house, they were taxed because of that.  The result of that was that the great majority of the Irish farmers absolutely refrained from making any improvements to their lands or dwellings.  The rent would be increased if they did.  Now, is the same incentive going to be held out to farmers in this Bill?  They can now, by sins of omission, take full advantage of the improvements that can be derived from this drainage for ten years in order to be able to get more out of this than they would at the beginning of the ten years.  It would be an intolerable hindrance to the scheme, and would help to hamper it in its early years, in the years of trial, and I hope the House will not impose a restriction of that kind on the Bill by accepting this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making an argument, and the Senator can take it either as an offer or not.  Now the matter as it stands is very heavily loaded against the Government because the onus is on the Government to show that benefit is likely to accrue, and that has to be done before an arbitrator appointed by this Committee.  Are the arbitrators likely to assess unless there is very definite proof, almost conclusive proof, as to the benefit?  I hold that the clause as it stands is very definitely in favour of the owner.  It will be very seldom that any deduction will be made for compensation otherwise than on the ground that there is going to be great benefit by reason of the drainage or improvement of the water supply.  That clause already weighted against the Government is going to be further weighted by the fact, if this amendment is accepted, that there is going to be revision in only one way.</P>

      <P>I do not see how the cleverest arbitrator could possibly forecast the effects of the engineers' estimate.  I can see this not materialising. I can foresee, without being an engineer, percolation through the banks and consequent injury to the land.  I do not know what remedy in law the affected party has as against the Government.  I suppose there is some roundabout way by which you could proceed against the Government, but it is entirely <i>ex gratia</i>, and there is a risk that a person's land may prove to be deteriorated, and that he would be debarred from having it remedied by law.  If the Seanad is prepared to enact a measure of that kind it is entirely their own responsibility.</P>

      <P>Reference has been made to the farmers in the vicinity of <Col N="387" /> the scheme taking action in some way to injure the works.  I cannot really imagine what the farmers can do in the matter unless they may block the pumps that may be erected over the embankments adjoining their farms. But I do not imagine any sensible person would think the farmers would do that.  This amendment of Senator Keane's if it allowed the other party&mdash; that is, the Government&mdash;to have the option of calling for revision at the end of ten years&mdash;a revision of valuation&mdash; I think would be fair to all parties, and I think it is one that should be adopted, because no arbitrators or land valuers can be certain beforehand that their valuation as to improvement or depreciation of land will be a correct one. The amendment which is suggested by the Minister and which was afterwards withdrawn is an amendment that might meet with the approval of the Seanad.</P>

      <P>The Minister complains that this amendment is heavily loaded against the Government and that the Bill is already heavily loaded against the Government.  Every Bill with compensation in it is heavily loaded in favour of the Government. Everybody who knows anything about compensation, or has anything to do with it, knows that the unfortunate occupier has always to suffer.  There are men who argue that they are let in for high expense and trouble and that very often the expense is greater than the money they get.  That is the reason why we are anxious to protect the owner in every possible way we can, and this is, of course, very inefficient compared with what the Government can do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>We are getting into further depths.  Senator Moore objected to the Government sending down men to arbitrate about compensation and to bargain and defeat the owners of the land in the first instance. The proposition now is that instead of doing that once they should do it several times in ten years.  Are you going to subject those unfortunate occupiers several times, twice certainly, <Col N="388" /> in ten years, to the barbs of Government assessors?  There is to be a revision.  You are at least going to have not only the first encounter, but the last one.  It is going to be something additional.  The Senator backing up this amendment says he does not see how any assessor would be likely to assess benefits likely to accrue to the land by reason of these works. That is my own fear, because the assessors will say: &ldquo;This is incalculable. We do not see how we can make any calculation of any deduction that is to be made for the benefits that will accrue.&rdquo;  No deduction will be made. The clause is equitable in that if it were clearly proven that there was some benefit accruing to the land by way of drainage or improved water supply there should be some account taken as to how the compensation should be lessened on that account.</P>

      <P>I think the Senator has quite correctly explained the purpose of Section 7.  I cannot explain that section any more fully than by saying that the local authorities are not given power under this Bill to build any railways.  It is only such railways as would be authorised for the purpose of the scheme.  If I might say so, it has reference to one railway, one permanent line, one permanent construction.</P>
      <P>The permanent construction would be the line connecting the railway station at Limerick with the docks.  It is a line which Limerick has been crying out for for a long time, and it is now added in as incidental to the scheme. There will be the ordinary type of light railway constructed for the purpose of drawing contractor's material along the line of the canal.  That will not be a permanent construction.  It will disappear afterwards.  The only permanent one is the short line connecting a railway station to the docks at Limerick, and to delete the section, as Senator Sir John Keane would have it, would mean that that line of railway asked for so long by Limerick would not be built, and arrangements would have to be made to get the contractors' material in either through Foynes or, possibly, through Cork.</P>

I am making these remarks with a view to clearing up the situation.  In the event <Col N="391" /> of agreement for the working of this railway as provided by sub-section 4 with the existing company, what is going to happen?</P>

      <P>A few items have been referred to.  First of all, I have not said that the constructional railway will be operated by a local authority.  I made mention of a line to be constructed under this scheme&mdash; a certain line which will be built by me nominally, but will in fact be built by the contractors, and at the contractors' expense.  No local authority comes in there.  The local authority has really only contact with any railway under the scheme in the case of Limerick.  As to the other matter, in default of agreement the railway will not be worked.</P>

    <P>In Section 8.  To add at the end of the section the words &ldquo;Provided <Col N="392" /> always that none of the facilities now existing for navigation are curtailed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I hope this amendment will have the effect at least of getting the Minister to give a clear statement as to what is intended with regard to navigation. I have searched through all those various publications.  We are entirely in the dark as to what the Government are to do.  The experts put down a figure of £15,000 for extending quays, deepening landing places and widening out landing places.  We know nothing of what they have in mind at all.  I can see that objections will be raised to this amendment on the score that it would be quite impossible to maintain your existing facilities for navigation below Killaloe.  I agree where the river is going to be dried up in the summer, and portions of the old canal will be closed, it would be unreasonable to expect the existing facilities south of Killaloe to be maintained in their entirety.  I would be quite prepared to alter the amendment to read, &ldquo;Provided that none of the existing facilities north of Killaloe are curtailed.&rdquo;  It seems unreasonable to give the Minister power without any knowledge of what his intentions are to curtail any of the existing rights of navigation in Lough Derg or north of O'Brien's Bridge.  They will not be affected north of O'Brien's Bridge, because navigation will be improved owing to the canalisation of the river. The Grand Canal Company is a corporation with certain rights.  They have enjoyed for many years past certain powers on Lough Derg and other waters.  It seems to me we should know where we are going and we should not give <i>carte blanche</i> to the Government with regard to those powers which they have enjoyed.  This amendment will ensure that the Government cannot curtail any of the existing powers.</P>

      <P>In this connection it seems to me that a rather curious position will arise under Sections 8 and 9, because as far as I read 8 and 9, &ldquo;the Minister may construct&rdquo; is not mandatory, but permissive.  If the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is permissive in connection <Col N="393" /> with &ldquo;construct,&rdquo; it must be permissive with the word &ldquo;maintain.&rdquo; The result would be the Minister may construct under 8 and 9 any one of those works, and then let them go derelict. I think that is a serious matter, and should be looked into.  I am sure that was not the intention.  As these two clauses stand it is quite permissive. He is not bound to do any of those things.  If he is not bound to do the construction he is not bound to do the maintenance.  I think the section should run: &ldquo;The Minister may construct and if he constructs shall maintain.&rdquo; Otherwise I think it would be a great embarrassment.</P>

      <P>That is a point that can be considered by the draftsman. We had so intended.  I would like to look at it a little more in detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a phrase which covers everything in Section 8.  We can do all these things for the improvement of the navigation of the River Shannon.  If we curtail any of the existing facilities and do not better them, obviously we are not improving.  The Senator's amendment is, I suggest, a repetition of what is already in that section.  As to the question the Senator asked, there are six alternative suggestions with regard to the navigation.  A considerable number of people must have a say as to which of these alternatives is to be adopted, but not a single one of them will fail to improve the navigation. Consequently, whatever alternative be adopted, there is going to be a definite improvement of the navigation of the Shannon.  Again, a great deal will depend on what part Limerick plays in all this.  If the Limerick Harbour development is such as to allow of a big development up the river, then that big development up the river will become much more economical than if it had to depend on Limerick as at present.  A great deal will depend on a variety of people, plus the Limerick Harbour Commissioners.  In any event the navigation must be improved.  We are bound by that, I think, under the terms of the phrase used in Section 8.  As to the point raised by you, A Chathaoir ligh, I can have that phrase examined <Col N="394" /> I should say generally that the emendation would be acceptable.  I should like, however, to have an opportunity of getting the matter examined more closely as to the details.</P>

Let us take the stage we are at now with regard to this Bill.  We have gone long beyond the point at which these Standing Orders would have any effect with regard to a Private Bill. The Standing Orders referred to in the amendment have all to do with the giving of notice so as to enable people to appear and raise objections to a scheme before a Private Bill Committee. We have gone much beyond that point with regard to the Shannon scheme.  The Shannon scheme has already been definitely approved of, and what has now got to be done is to give notice to people of what is going to happen to property belonging to them, not that they can raise objections, but simply to notify them and to try to lessen the hardship and inconvenience that may have to be put on them.  Again, I say there is no analogy whatever between this Bill and Private Bill procedure.  The analogy that was attempted to be drawn is an entirely false one.</P>

      <P>It is not revolutionary, and if I could get an assurance <Col N="398" /> from the Senator that he speaks for the people of the locality upon the matter, I would be much more favourably inclined to it.  I have already got applications from the people, and I have advertised as to the laying of plans at Limerick and Portumna, and I have heard no complaint, and my views were founded upon these calculations. The total of the embankments as between Banagher and Lough Derg is thirty-one and a half miles, and of the rivers flowing into the Shannon between Banagher and Lough Derg, five and a quarter miles.  Those between Portumna and Lough Derg and tributaries about thirty-seven miles.  The lakes are seven and a half miles, and of the rivers flowing in seven and three-quarter miles.  That is fifteen miles, and the section Killaloe to O'Brien's Bridge six and a half miles.  So it seems to us, on the calculations, that taking the mileage of embankments, it would be much more suitable to have the maps lodged at Portumna than at Killaloe.</P>

      <P>I move the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In Section 11, sub-section (3).  To delete the words &ldquo;in respect of every financial year,&rdquo; in line 55, and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;on or before the 1st day of June in respect of the last completed financial year.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I ask the House to regard this as important. It is to ensure that the accounts of this very important undertaking, which goes into the realms of commerce and business, shall be rendered punctually.  We have had unfortunate experience regarding the delay in presenting accounts, and we find that even statutory provision is not sufficient, as accounts have not been rendered by the statutory date.  It is very important that Parliament and all others concerned should be vigilant with regard to the progress of this scheme, but you cannot be vigilant as regards the progress of an undertaking whose accounts come out, say, six months after the end of the financial year.  As we are going, as I submit, regretfully, into business, I think we should adopt business principles.  I think every director or shareholder of a business concern should expect to see the accounts rendered promptly.  I would ask that this date be inserted, and that it be mandatory on the Government to produce accounts, which from an accounting point of view, can quite easily be done within, at least, three months of the close of the financial year.</P>

Recently he spoke of £5 as the price for making connections, and I said £2 10s., and he accepted the £2 10s., although the whole of his argument was based on the figure of £5.  It is the same here.  At the end of his argument he now says three months.  I am quite ready to follow the commercial practice in this matter.  The accounts in connection with this scheme are going to be very big.  Are accounts always submitted <Col N="403" /> to shareholders two months after the closing of the financial year?  Consider the two months which this amendment means.  They include the Easter vacation period.  The preparation of these accounts, so far as the Government is concerned, will take some time. They have to be finally adopted, sent to the Stationery Office, again examined and sent to the Executive Council before presentation to the Oireachtas.  I am quite willing, if the Seanad thinks it necessary to have anything mandatory in the clause, to put in such words as &ldquo;as soon as practicable after the expiration of the financial year.&rdquo;</P>

The Government will have ample latitude in regard to the sub-headings, but <Col N="404" /> I hope that they will adopt the system in the &ldquo;Electrical Times,&rdquo; which gives comparable costs for all electrical undertakings on a uniform basis.  I will be satisfied if the Government undertake to publish statistics of output and costs, so that the efficiency of the scheme may be examined by all who are paying for it.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that Senator Sir John Keane will kill this Bill by trying to make it too perfect. I suggest to him that this amendment would come better in the next Bill in regard to supplies.  This is a Bill for construction, and is hardly a proper one in which to introduce an amendment of this kind.  I think the Senator is, moreover, asking something which private electrical firms do not do. Perhaps he may know of some firm which does this, but I do not know of any.  He is asking for a very high degree of accountancy, which may be desirable if it is not too big a burden to support.  The principal point seems to be that this is hardly the correct Bill in which to introduce an amendment of this kind.</P>

My difficulty has been that there are so many matters in this Bill which should be part of the Organisation Bill, logically, that it is almost impossible to separate the two.

      <P>That would give me ample justification for an amendment of this kind, and I do not understand the attitude of Senator <Col N="405" /> O'Farrell.  I have considerable experience of Government accounting practice.  Our only protection as to the success or otherwise of the scheme is a proper system of accounts, and I can hardly conceive the Government going into this scheme without a most meticulous system of accounts.  Unless they do that, there is very little use in publishing the accounts.  In regard to Senator O'Farrell's remarks that private undertakings do not publish their accounts, I would like to ask him how does the &ldquo;Electrical Times&rdquo; get hold of them?  I do not think there is a single undertaking of any importance even in the Free State&mdash;in Dublin, Dundalk. Belfast, municipal undertakings as well as private undertakings&mdash;that does not keep its accounts on a uniform system and they are all published in the &ldquo;Electrical Times.&rdquo;  I do not think that that paper guesses them.  They get them from someone, and I would ask, unless the Minister gives an undertaking to consider this matter sympathetically or to embody some provisions of this character in the Organisation Bill, that the House should accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>That summarises my objection&mdash;that I am asked to commit myself or the Government to something which has not yet been considered, something which is a matter for the Organisation Bill.  Senator Sir John Keane has anticipated certain matters because he said I have anticipated others.  The anticipation is contained in Clause 13 of the Bill which says that I shall have power to supply electricity in any quantity produced by the undertaking during the construction of the work.  That is the entire limitation placed upon me, during the construction of the work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir JOHN KEANE Sir JOHN KEANE">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making contracts, but I have not power to supply. The clause, for which the present Section 13 is a substitute, was very much debated in the Dáil, and after we had arrived at certain conclusions.  I undertook to provide a new Section 13, which met with the approval of those <Col N="406" /> who had previously objected to the clause in its original form.  The objection was, although they realised that an Organisation Bill was to come and that I had no intention to make this an Organisation and a Supply Bill, that, nevertheless, it was so widely drafted it was feared that it might operate as a Supply Bill, and consequently I put in two limitations.  I had unlimited power for the construction period during the three years.  I may enter into certain contracts within margins, and that is the long and the short of that portion of the Bill.  I explained on that point that all that was required in Section 13, sub-section (1), was power to give electricity from the plant erected during the construction period. That is from the contractors' plant to help in the construction, that we might give certain supplies locally, to a place which, owing to the number of workmen, would require an additional supply. The only matter which might be said to come within the scope of the Organisation Bill is sub-section (1) of Section 13, as amended.  The Senator's appeal to me that this amendment be withdrawn if the point is met on the Organisation Bill, clearly shows that he recognises it is not appropriate to this Bill.  The returns under this Bill will be simply nil.  There would be a nil return year by year, and nothing would be shown.</P>

      <P>After Section 11 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;12.  (1) The prices to be charged for electricity supplied shall be such as to cover</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  the cost of production, including <Col N="407" /> distribution, maintenance and administration;</P>
    <P>(b)  the amounts for interest on money raised by way of loan or by way of grant from the Central Fund, and any money paid by way of Sinking Fund towards the redemption of any loan;</P>
    <P>(c)  an adequate reserve for the replacement and betterment of machinery and plant.</P>
    <P>(2)  It shall be a general principle that the undertaking shall, so far as practicable, be carried on neither at a profit nor at a loss, and that the charges shall be adjusted accordingly from time to time.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do submit that this amendment is germane to the Bill, because the Minister is going to make a contract.  How can he do so without some indication of cost?  In fact, I think he may find himself very far out, but he has got to attempt to make some estimate of the cost on which prices will be charged, and I would ask that in making this estimate, the particulars which I have set out in the amendment should be the headline in determining the cost. Here we have a national undertaking on an enormous scale going into competition with private enterprise, certainly going into competition more or less with gas companies, which have committed themselves in accordance with the laws of the country in respect to industrial undertakings in the State. Surely this House is not going to sanction any subsidised competition with existing interests.  If we are not going to be perfectly clear on that point, we will drive all private capital out of the country, and the effect will be to draw us into the meshes of inefficient socialism. If the Government go into business, they must conduct the undertaking on business methods and submit to business conditions.  If a business is not conducted on business lines, it will soon go bankrupt but as the Government cannot go bankrupt, the law should see that they are on equal terms with private enterprise.</P>

      <P>Senator Sir John Keane, like the Communists, always harps back to first principles with a <Col N="408" /> splendid disregard of the circumstances in particular cases.  This amendment is obviously drafted because he sees the cloven hoof of socialism in the whole scheme.  He seems to depart from what are generally recognised as business methods.  I think it is not always essential to the success of a scheme that it shall be profitable from its inception.  Did the Senator ever hear of the promoter of a private firm losing for a period and being prepared to lose in the hope and in the certain prospect that eventually it would be a gain?  He seems to insist that the scheme from its very beginning shall at least pay its way, and failing this, he will, doubtless, condemn the whole scheme, root and branch, and claim that the opposition to the scheme is justified.</P>
      <P>I think without being a brilliant success at all, if it is to pay its way, the cost of current must to a very large degree be governed by the amount of supply and demand.  If you are going to insist on collecting in the first years of restricted consumption sufficient to cover all the things set out in the amendment, unless there is some immediate and big development you would probably charge the least number of consumers practically the same amount in the aggregate as would eventually be paid by a very great number of consumers as the scheme develops.  The result might be that in order to keep to the principles of the amendment you would have to charge a prohibitive price for current and by that very means prevent its development. Although it might somewhat surprise Senator Sir John Keane, I see no objection to making a profit in the transaction.  He suggests that as a general principle there should be neither profit nor loss.  I believe there may be periods when you may have to have a loss and there will be other periods when you would be quite justified, if you are able in making up that loss by the profits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am particularly in favour of a profit if that profit is devoted towards the development of isolated areas by bringing the cables into such areas where otherwise that might not be a commercial proposition, and for other <Col N="409" /> purposes of commercial development. The Senator refers to this scheme particularly as a great competitor with private enterprise.  Really private enterprise has left us where we are.  It has left our industries undeveloped and has left our seaside places unadvertised and deserted and our main industry&mdash;agriculture&mdash;one of the most backward in Europe.  We are trying by State assistance to develop that industry, where private enterprise has failed.  Senator Sir John Keane is not opposed to the principle of any assistance being granted to the development of agriculture.  I do not know if the electrical firms that are in existence can be very much knocked about and financially injured as a result of this scheme.  There are very few of them that can claim to be a great success at all except where exorbitant prices are charged for electricity.  I hope the Seanad will turn down the amendment.  The amendment seeks to impose on this enterprise something that Senator Sir John Keane would not impose on private enterprise if he himself were associated with it.</P>

As far as I see, the purport of it is to ensure that the citizens of the State shall know what is being done with their money and whether it is being well spent or not. The amendment would, to some extent, regularise what is done by the Government. If you start out by selling electricity at less than the cost of production then you are starting in the way of making the country bankrupt.</P>

      <P>The trouble about the Senator is that he has only read part of this Bill, and he leaves other Senators who have not read any of it to make remarks founded largely on his statements.  Senator Sir John Keane apparently does not know what is the limitation put upon me with regard to supply in Section 13.  I may supply any quantity of electricity produced by the undertaking during such constructional works.  Outside that I may require persons to enter into an agreement or agreements to take a supply of electricity when available. <Col N="410" /> Certain other particulars follow, &ldquo;at such price and prices as the Minister may be authorised by or under statute to charge therefor.&rdquo;  I do not know if anyone was so ever completely tied up with regard to price or prices as those operating this plant are by that clause. The Senator says it is a helpful amendment when going to make contracts.  I have to go to, say, the Urban Council in Newcastle-West or somewhere else, and say, &ldquo;I am to charge you such a price or prices as I may be authorised by statute afterwards to charge.&rdquo;  I have every limitation put on me.  I then come to the Senator's three points and his preamble.  We both agree as a solemn principle that the undertaking should be carried on at neither a profit nor a loss.  After we have come to that stage, and have a protocol on the preamble, we get down to the details of the three points.  Who is going to decide as to the cost of production, maintenance and administration?  Are we to go back to the experts' report or take Senator Sir John Keane's Second Reading speech, so as to have this thrashed out as to whether Siemens-Schuckert's prices are illusory or Senator Sir John Keane's prices are illusory?</P>

      <P>It is to provide for the supply of electricity and for purposes incidental thereto.  It is a Bill of 56 clauses, a general Bill, and an organisation Bill in one, which has many advantages, and from which you would see exactly where you are going.  Moreover, it is a Bill having regard to the existing organisations operating for the supply of electricity. I admit that there are not very many large or important ones in this country run entirely under private enterprise. It may also interest the Seanad to know incidentally that the main organisation opposing the Bill was the Victoria Falls organisation, which, although it took power to generate from the Victoria Falls, never adopted it, and is still generating power from coal. I admit that conditions may be different, but it may interest Senators to know that an undertaking which took power to generate from water finally abandoned its powers and fell back on coal.  Anyway, this is the Act that is in operation, and I submit that it is <Col N="412" /> quite fair to assume that a similar precaution should be adopted here.

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am afraid that the Minister may, and, perhaps, will, with some justification, reply that I am not playing the <Col N="413" /> game over this.  Well, Senators have a duty to perform, and must do it fearlessly. The Minister takes power to go to a local authority and make contracts, and, I have no doubt, in the exercise of his duty, he will place the most favourable light on the development of electricity in whatever area he is canvassing.  I take it he will practically bargain and say: &ldquo;If you are going to have this wonderful benefit you must engage to take so much current.&rdquo; The Minister has said himself that he has not attempted to visualise the case of a consumer.  How is he going to go to a local authority and say: &ldquo;We want you to take this stuff, but we cannot tell you what it will cost.&rdquo;  I say that any local authority that makes a contract without independent advice as to what the cost to the consumer is to be, is acting in violation of its duty to the ratepayers.  It is a serious position as I visualise it, and unless local authorities get full warning as to the economics of the scheme, they may be let in and we may have to finance the Shannon scheme out of the rates.  Imagine the effect on the rural ratepayers of taking an article in that way that could not be sold.  It would not prejudice the Minister at all to leave this over for the Organisation Bill.  By that time he will have, presumably, got to close quarters with the cost of distribution, and be able to put up a figure on the basis of the Siemens-Schuckert report, and if you go on that report you will have to charge 2/1.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">

      <P>In Siemens' report the only figure assumed in the whole of that calculation is the cost of the current to the farmer&mdash;3d.  The quantity of current to be taken and the prices to be charged to the creameries are set out.  Would it be fair to go to the local authorities and say, as far as we know on Siemens' one calculation, <Col N="414" /> if we are to charge for power, that the price of that will be 2/1, but we have not gone closely into the question of charges to people, and the cost of distribution?  If a local authority acted without proper information, I suggest that in that there will be great liability of buying a pig in a poke.  The only way to handle this question circumspectly is to allow this to come up as part of the Organisation Bill.  It will be three years before the high-tension network is in operation, and there is plenty of time to go into the matter deliberately, and try and arrive at costs, and give the local authorities some knowledge of their obligations before you ask them to make a contract.</P>

      <P>I have not listened to a more egotistical statement than we have heard just now.  We are asked to try and go into costs, and do things deliberately.  Because we do not accept what Senator Sir J. Keane sets out as his calculations, the thing has not been gone into deliberately.  I think the Senator will find himself aggravated because the local authorities do not apply for his aid in all matter of costings.  He spoke about playing the game.  I have been trying unsuccessfully for some days to find what game he is playing, but it is played on a bad assumption, that all his calculations are mathematically accurate.  We get 2/1 for light in a certain district.  It is one of a thousand alternative figures that could be put up, and it is not by any means a fair one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask, have Siemens ever mentioned the figure of 2/1 for light, except on a particular calculation which is, as I say, one of thousands?  Have they said that is the figure that must be charged?  Have they said there is no other figure that can be charged for light in that area? Surely it could be answered definitely whether they have said that price precludes any other price being charged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir JOHN KEANE Sir JOHN KEANE">
      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Minister is facing the issue <Col N="415" /> straight.  Siemens gave an instance, and only one instance, of the cost of distribution, and that was in the Mallow area.  They made no mention of alternatives.  They did not say that this was one of many others we might select.  Surely I am justified in my arguing in that case where the prospective contractors gave the information they gave of the revenue required in the Mallow rural district.  It was assumed that the creameries would use 192,000 units, at 2d. per unit, and it was further assumed that the current would be taken by the creameries partly in power and partly in light.  I have assumed the price per unit for power would be 3d.  If I made the figure for power lower, the price for light would be still higher.  People are able to draw their own conclusions. The making of an assumption does not invalidate the whole argument I am making.  The only assumption in the case is that the farmers will get the current at 3d.  In dealing with this matter it would be better if the Minister would put alternative figures before us.  That would be a more straightforward way of dealing with the matter, than by attacking me because I introduced one figure as an assumption. Every Senator is able to judge whether it is a fair or an unfair assumption to put it at 3d. for power.  If you put it at 6d. for power you know that the farmer will not take it at all&mdash;again an assumption, I admit.  If the Minister is going to local authorities to make contracts, he ought to place them in possession of these facts, or defer it until he has alternative figures.</P>

      <P>It will certainly be possible to put up alternative figures before we go out.  I asked for the figure of 3d. quoted from Siemens' Report.  It has not been quoted, and I refuse to accept the Senator as the intermediary between me and Siemens' Report, or as the intermediary between me and the consumers.  A certain sum of money has been set aside to cover the cost of wiring 300 square miles of area to bring poles past the door of every hovel in the area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator has not allowed me to complete.  Wires are to be brought past every house, and after bringing the wires past you assume a certain number only are going to take electricity.  Therefore, you have weighted the figures against yourself&mdash;we have weighted the figures in our scheme.  The wires pass the house, and assume that the houses will not take power, obviously we will not do anything of the sort.  If you imagine this room enlarged to a 300-square-mile area, and if people in the corner will not take electricity obviously we will not run it there.  Further, the 6.8, which is the basis of the thing, is built up in this way:&mdash;On the average flat rate of .8 through the country, plus 3½d. for the Mallow district, but at a 3d. rate for the rural areas, plus 3.8 for Mallow distribution, if we decide to do it, and there is any amount of reason why we should decide to charge a flat rate through the country.  Dublin industrialists say it does not matter for them whether they get power at 1½d. or 3d., that the difference is immaterial.  We will give cheap power where it is appreciated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that be the case, we will give power cheap where cheap power will be appreciated.  We will give it at the .8 through the country. You will get 4.6 instead of 6.8.  Let the Senator make his new calculations on that basis.  Instead of expending a sum of money to wire the whole area of that 300 square miles, we are only going to wire the half.  Remember that when you are dealing with the rural areas you are dealing with a fraction, 3 per cent. of the whole demand.  Three per cent. of the whole demand of electricity on the Siemens' scheme is going to the rural districts.  Let us assume that all the Senator's mathematics is correct, a large assumption; let it be assumed that all the farmers will buy power; let us assume that is correct, again a large assumption.  Let it be assumed that the <Col N="417" /> case is as bad as he made out, and you are dealing with three per cent. of the entire estimated consumption.</P>
    <P>We are to remove from this Bill a section which gives me power to do what the Senator believes we have not done so far.  We should have some idea as to alternative charges, and we should seek to amplify our knowledge by going out into the country and saying: &ldquo;Will you contract to take from us at such a price provided the Oireachtas sanctions that?&rdquo; He seeks to take away that power, and he takes it away with the object of helping me so that I may be blocked at every hand's turn. I may not go to the country and get any idea from the local authority as to what power they will take.  That is done with the object of helping the scheme.  I repeat the first thing to be done under the construction scheme after excavation of the canal is finished will be to throw out transmission lines to Dublin, Cork and Limerick.  After that there will be an investigation as to the consumers in different areas.  I must have some small power to make contracts even within the very small margins in Section 13, before I will know what proportion of the transmission line will be built.  We are not going to incur useless expenditure.  If we find there are not going to be consumers in certain areas, the lines will not be built.  There is much expenditure that can be saved, and I think I should have the powers limited sufficiently by Section 13, sub-sections (2) and (3).  I could never face the responsibility of incurring the expenditure on the transmission system other than Cork, Dublin and Limerick if I had not power to find out by way of these professional contractors what consumers there are likely to be.</P>

They proceeded to dig up the whole place. There were protests from a great many people, some of them friends of mine. Arthur Griffith went there and protested, but it was no use.  The farmer said he was paid to do it, and he intended to do it.  There was much damage done to Tara.  I would like something to be done in the case of unreasonable men of that kind, and so prevent them from destroying ancient monuments.</P>

      <P>In most cases where interference with or destruction of monuments is likely to take place under this scheme, we will have to purchase the land, and we will have to become the owners.  In the event of a monument standing in lands which we do not purchase, it would be necessary to have the permission of the owner.</P>

      <P>We have one or two important matters to deal with still, and we have got further Stages in some of these Bills to consider. I refer to Bills that have been read a Second Time.  We may, perhaps, deal with them to-morrow and take it with this other business; if that is the wish of the House, this, perhaps, would be a convenient hour for adjourning now for to-morrow.</P>

      <P>I confess that I think it is not creditable to the Oireachtas as a whole that this other matter should, at the end of three years, be still undetermined and undischarged and I think this Report should be disposed of at the earliest possible moment.  There is plenty of time for the consideration of both to-morrow. I should not like this second matter which I consider a most important question, the question of divorce, to be disposed of in a scanty House.  If it is taken on first it will secure a good attendance at 3 o'clock to-morrow.  I think we ought to take it on and dispose of it.</P>

      <P>What do you say about what I have said?  The first question on the Order Paper, as I say, is one that has been hanging fire for three years.  It is a question in which the Seanad takes great interest. They may discuss it.  They may not get an opportunity of discussing it at all at the fag-end of to-morrow evening.</P>

I am afraid that this is an indication of mixed thinking, because we could not decide in a calm, intelligent way, number nine, unless we dissociate it from any particular question.
