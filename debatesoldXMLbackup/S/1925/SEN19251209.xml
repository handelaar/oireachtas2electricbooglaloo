      <P>Before the election is proceeded with, I desire to draw the attention of the Seanad to Standing Order No. 2, which makes provision for the holding of the election and which reads:&mdash;&ldquo;The Cathaoirleach and Leas-Chathaoirleach shall be appointed at the first meeting of the Seanad to be held after each triennial election of members of the Seanad, unless the Seanad shall by resolution otherwise determine.&rdquo;  I have been asked by some Senators to suggest, for the approval of the House, that as we did on a previous occasion we should do on this, namely, elect the Cathaoirleach and the Leas-Chathaoirleach for the term of a year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacLOUGHLIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to propose the name of Lord Glenavy as Chairman of the Seanad for the next three years.  In doing so, I would remind the Seanad that I moved a similar motion three years ago.  I then stated that my object was to wipe out old political landmarks and to initiate a movement towards real peace and contentment throughout Ireland, based on a process of good-will and a realisation of the fact that we are all Irishmen, whether Catholic or Protestant, Nationalist or Unionist.  I am aware that this gesture of mine was much derided and has been much criticised both then and since, and that in the opinion of many of my friends it has not materialised; but, notwithstanding derision and criticism, my faith is not the least shaken in it, and to-day I am more convinced than ever that if the experiment of self-government in this country is to be a success, and if this State is to make any advance towards stability and material prosperity, it can only be done by our rising superior to all old bogies and all old prejudices, and by substituting for racial and soctarian divisions the ideal of an Ireland <Col N="4" /> common to all parties and to which all can give allegiance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverGogarty" hpid="Dr. GOGARTY Dr. GOGARTY">
      <NameTxt>Dr. GOGARTY</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there was a ruling that, in the case of candidates for office, there were to be no speeches in proposing them.  I think it was the late Chairman that made that very excellent ruling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMacLoughlin" hpid="Mr. MacLOUGHLIN Mr. MacLOUGHLIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacLOUGHLIN</NameTxt>
      <P>If you are referring to previous occasions I might remind the Seanad that I made a speech on the last occasion I proposed Lord Glenavy, and I do not see why I should be out of order now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Glenavy" hpid="Lord GLENAVY Lord GLENAVY">
      <NameTxt>Lord GLENAVY</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Senator Dr. Gogarty is under a misapprehension. The rule that he refers to deals with elections to casual vacancies.  I was satisfied that a strict interpretation of that rule contemplated that candidates were simply to be proposed and seconded, but I might point out that the rule had nothing to do with this election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMacLoughlin" hpid="Mr. MacLOUGHLIN Mr. MacLOUGHLIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacLOUGHLIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Gogarty should not be so jumpy.  Surely he can stand what I am going to say. To-day it is more necessary than ever for us to get all Irishmen to work together. To-day it is more necessary than ever that we should turn down and turn a deaf ear to all those who attempt to put barriers in the way of co-operation either in the shape of old political shibboleths, or of iron-clad principles.  No matter what is done elsewhere, no matter what is the force of the bad example shown us, we must be no party to such a degradation of the tone of our public life in this country as to choose men for our positions of honour and of trust by any other test than that of merit and capacity.  I think that this Seanad has no reason to regret that it gave a lead to that policy at the outset of its career three years ago by the unanimous election of Lord Glenavy as Chairman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that this House can congratulate itself in securing for its Chairman during the first trying period of its existence a man of the eminence and high judicial qualities of Lord Glenavy, who not only presided over our deliberations with wisdom and tact, but gave an example of courage and <Col N="5" /> pluck which should not be forgotten, because when we first met here, three years ago, the very existence of this House and of the Dáil was seriously threatened.  Senators were especially singled out for attack, and we had to go about at the risk of our lives.  Happily that campaign was thwarted and we can meet here to-day in peace and security, but if we can I do not think I am exaggerating when I say that no small factor in contributing to this result was the manner in which Senators, and especially the Senators drawn from the minority section of our countrymen, stood up to the threats of murder and the destruction of their homes and refused to be intimidated from accepting the invitation of our first native Government to take their place in the public life of the country. The moral effect of their courage then, when this infant State was staggering under the assault of its enemies, was immeasurable, and if to-day the Seanad is an important and valuable institution in the life of this nation it is due, to a great extent, to the moral courage and to the patriotic co-operation of those who were formerly divided from us, crowned by the manner in which our Chairman has at all times upheld the position and dignity of this House. I, therefore, ask the Seanad for a renewal of its confidence in Lord Glenavy, and I beg formally to move his re-election.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGriffith" hpid="Sir JOHN GRIFFITH Sir JOHN GRIFFITH">
      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN GRIFFITH</NameTxt>
      <P>I have great pleasure in seconding the motion.  I am not going to make a speech; I simply say that to re-elect Lord Glenavy to the Chair is the very best thing we could do as a Senate.  Lord Glenavy has acted in the Chair in a way that has won the confidence of the whole Senate.  In the last three years he has been diligent in his attendance and in everything connected with the working of the Senate and for the interest of the Senate.  In every case in which we have been attacked he has been our great prop of defence.  I have great pleasure, therefore, in seconding the motion that he be re-elected Chairman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMacKean" hpid="Mr. MacKEAN Mr. MacKEAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacKEAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I have much pleasure in bringing forward the name <Col N="6" /> of Senator T. Westropp Bennett and in proposing that he be appointed Chairman for the next three years.  Senator Westropp Bennett has been Chairman, at various times, of numerous boards in the country, and while so engaged he gained much knowledge of rural affairs and of national affairs which would be very practical in this House.</P>
      <P>While proposing the name of Senator Westropp Bennett for the Chair I do not, in any way, of course, detract from the great merits of Lord Glenavy.  Lord Glenavy is a man of commanding intellect, of great legal knowledge and of special knowledge of constitutional law, and is, undoubtedly, capable of taking the onerous responsibility of the Chair in this assembly.  Also, Senators who have come into personal contact with him will pay tribute to his generous, kindly treatment of them, whenever they went to consult him; but Lord Glenavy also has the faults of a man of first-rate ability.  On some occasions his vision, being more rapid, his intellect travels more quickly perhaps than that of others, and naturally he displays a little impatience at times with them. On one occasion, when a question of very vital importance came before this Senate, he took up an attitude which, at least, caused very considerable resentment among some members here.</P>
      <P>But it is not for any reason of a personal character that I propose that another Senator should occupy the Chair for the coming period.  It is because of the democratic principle that no Senator should occupy the Chair for more than three years, and, also, on the principle, if I may say so, that we should have a Chairman more in touch with the democratic feelings of this age and more in touch with the ideals of the men whose labours brought this House into existence.  This is why I propose the name of Senator Westropp Bennett.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator McLoughlin reminds us of the fact that when he proposed Lord Glenavy three years ago for the Chair he said that to elect him would be a splendid gesture to the Unionists of the North, and that it was, so to speak, throwing a bridge over the Boyne.  Some said it was the holding out of an olive <Col N="7" /> branch to the North; but I know the absolute futility of holding out olive branches to men of the mentality of those in whose hands the Government of the North-East corner is at the moment.  You have only to take the example of a few days ago where the Free State flag was flown opposite the Governor's house in the North, and a few days afterwards in the Northern Parliament Sir Dawson Bates said that the flag was removed and that the outrage that was committed in the display of that flag was cancelled.</P>
    <P>That is the sort of mentality you have in the North.  I am a Northerner. I know the mentality of those people and know that that is the spirit up there.  I know that any little sort of futile concession that Senator MacLoughlin or any other Senator would make to them would only be taken as an example of weakness and the recipient of this act of tolerance would be looked upon as a traitor to their cause.  I think I am not wrong in saying that there are men in the North of Ireland, and the majority of them, who think that Lord Glenavy watered down his principles when he took the Chair here and satisfied the people here.  That is the opinion that obtains there.  Now, at first, when Lord Glenavy took the Chair here, he said that he would not take the Chair if in this House there was a considerable section who did not wish him to do so.  At that time there was a considerable section who did not wish him to do so, but at that time that considerable section had not become articulate.  Here to-day I think that that considerable section will display itself.</P>
    <P>Lord Glenavy occupies the Chair in virtue of the tolerance of this Assembly, and it would be a pity if Lord Glenavy did not show an example of tolerance by standing down now, and allowing the nominee of the Party that treated him so generously then to be elected unanimously.  If Lord Glenavy goes forward and is beaten, well, it will detract from the honour and glory of his election here on the last occasion, and if he goes forward and wins it will be a Pyrrhic victory for him, and he will occupy that Chair <Col N="8" /> with the feeling of a guest who has outstayed his welcome.  I now, therefore, propose the election of Senator Westropp Bennett.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, now that Senators MacLoughlin and MacKean have made their speeches, would it be too much to ask the Seanad to stay this humbug?  If we continue this sort of thing it is absolutely bringing the House down to the level of a board of guardians.  If the Seanad is not able to make up its mind as to who is to occupy the Chair it would certainly not be a compliment to its intelligence, but we all know that the Seanad is not going to change its mind by reason of any speeches that are to be made here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. GOGARTY</NameTxt>
      <P>It is necessary to refer to the charges made about bunkum.  I have heard a certain amount of stentorian trivialities from Senator MacLoughlin which are neither here nor there.  The Chairman of the Seanad holds his seat under a three years' lease.  We are anxious to change that and to make it an annual election.  If there is no machinery to bring the Standing Orders under the survey of the House, we will have to recall the former Chairman so that this may be done; otherwise the Standing Orders will never be altered, for the simple reason that when there is a temporary <Col N="9" /> Chairman the machinery of the Standing Orders, touching this election, ceases.  I would like some ruling on the matter to tell me how to proceed if we wish to make the Chairmanship annual.  I want to dissociate myself from the suggestion that I have not had the liveliest feelings of the capable manner in which Lord Glenavy filled the Chair, and of the ripe store of wisdom and legal lore which he has brought to the disposal of this House, but inasmuch as this is a triennial election we ought to be allowed to give other members of the House an opportunity of becoming the Chairman.  I think it would be less disastrous if the period were restored to an annual term.</P>

      <P>You asked me a short time ago what was the rule. There is no rule, but the precedent here is that when a candidate is proposed and seconded for the Chairmanship only the proposer and seconder speak. I have no doubt that the House could, if they liked, upset that precedent, but I should think that having consented once to it I will have to divide the House in order to change it.  The precedent at present is that no one but the proposer and seconder speaks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="CATHAOIRLEACH CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I ought to say that I feel very much indebted for the support of those who voted for my re-election, and I must express my very deep sense of the honour they have conferred upon me.  Of course, I am not blind enough to have failed to notice that something of that heated atmosphere that is prevalent in the other House has penetrated into this peaceful chamber.  I have no remark to make either by way of retort or recrimination on that account, and certainly I am not going to take advantage of my position as Chairman here to indulge in anything of the kind. Those Senators who voted against my re-election were acting strictly within their constitutional rights, and so far as I am personally concerned they have left on my mind no sense of injustice whatsoever.  The only thing that somewhat puzzled me was that those of them who gave voice to their opposition appeared to base it entirely on the fact that, according to them, I had been a success in the Chair.  That at least is an encouragement to me, and I do take to myself the credit that, during the three years it was my good fortune to preside over this distinguished Assembly, I was able to give my rulings with firmness, without fear, favour or affection, and with a single thought of my fidelity to the oath which, in common <Col N="13" /> with every other Senator present, I have taken to bear true allegiance to the Constitution as well as to obey the Standing Orders of this House.</P>
      <P>In regard to my decisions and rulings during these three years I have nothing to say by way of explanation or regret.  I stand over them, each and every one, and in this respect I am glad to know that no single one of them, on any single occasion that I ever sought to assert or protect the privileges of this House, or of the citizens of the Free State, within the Constitution, has ever been successfully challenged. In addition I have the satisfaction at least of knowing in my heart and conscience that I never allowed myself to be diverted by a hair's breadth from the course to which my obligations to my oath and the Standing Orders dictated.  I never allowed any external pressure or influence of any sort to have any effect or bearing whatsoever on any decision I ever gave.</P>
      <P>Now that this little breeze is over, may I express my confident hope and belief that in the course of the next three years, if I am spared, I shall receive at the hands of every Senator, without distinction, the same kindly consideration and co-operation that I received during the past three years, which enabled me to conduct the proceedings of this Assembly with such dignity and decorum that not even in a single case did we ever approach to what my friends of the Press would describe as a &ldquo;scene.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of the recent election eleven of our former Senators failed to retain their seats.  I wish to express to each of them, one and all, my grateful appreciation of the courtesy they invariably extended to the Chair.  I wish also to pay my tribute to the regular and constant attendance that they always gave at our meetings and to the sense of duty which always dictated the part they played in our debates and our deliberations.  I wish to say, more particularly in regard to eight of these eleven Senators, because these eight were the original Senators of the first Senate created by the Irish Free State, that they should always be remembered with gratitude by their fellow-countrymen.  In those days <Col N="14" /> of peril and danger to which Senator MacLoughlin referred, they loyally stood their ground and by enabling the Oireachtas to function, prevented the Executive of this country from being paralysed.</P>
    <P>To those Senators who have taken their seats I wish on behalf of myself and of the House to extend our warmest and most friendly greeting.  We welcome them all because we know that each and every one of them have cast in their lot with the fate and the future of our beloved country.  We welcome them also because we know that they have played their part in the public, professional and industrial life of our country, and therefore they will be able to bring to bear on our deliberations the valuable experience so gained.  I desire to say, in conclusion, that once again I have to renew and express my deep gratitude to Senator Douglas, who, in his position as Vice-Chairman, was such a loyal and constant friend of mine.  I wish to acknowledge all that I owe to him for his great business capacity, his knowledge of the world, and his high personal integrity.  These he always placed at my service, and throughout the three years they were of constant help to me.</P>

      <P>I have the honour to propose the re-election of Senator Douglas as Vice-Chairman.  I do not propose to make anything in the way of a long speech.  I do not suppose it is necessary to do so, as Senator Douglas has been our Vice-Chairman. For the information of new Senators I might say that in proposing Senator Douglas I am proposing a man whose work in the position I have watched with great interest.  He was a member of the Standing Committee and presided over the Committee on Standing Orders, and I can say with perfect truth that no one could have worked with greater diligence than Senator Douglas.  I had no idea that he was such a good business man.  I can recommend him to the Seanad as the most diligent business man that I have met for a long time.  He has shown these qualities during the past three years and, <Col N="15" /> if re-elected, I am sure he will show them in the coming three years.</P>

It is on the merits of the candidate only that I recommend the re-election of Senator Douglas.</P>

      <P>I think it might be desirable to postpone this election until to-morrow for this reason: this Committee under the Standing Orders has to be elected on the principles of proportional representation, and, consequently, the voting and the counting of votes are a little embarrassing, and take time. I do not think the voting could be concluded to-day before the termination of our business.  In that connection I would like to ask Senator O'Farrell, particularly, and also other Senators present, what their wish is with regard to a motion on the paper that stands in his name.  The reason I refer to it is that Mr. McGilligan the Minister for Industry and Commerce, desired to attend on this motion. He is otherwise engaged and cannot possibly leave the deliberations of the Dáil to-day.  I think we can appreciate and understand his position in that regard.  He is very anxious not in any way to inconvenience the House or inconvenience Senator O'Farrell, and if the Senator could see his way to allow the motion to stand until to-morrow, we could then, while the motion is being discussed, have this voting take place for the Committee of Selection.  The officials could count the votes and declare the result during the sitting to-morrow.  Of course, I am not seeking to put the slightest pressure on Senator O'Farrell, because he is entitled to make his motion if he wishes, but Mr. McGilligan told me that he could not be here to-day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasLinehan" hpid="Mr. LINEHAN Mr. LINEHAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LINEHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is very desirable that the Minister should give some explanation of the exceptional circumstances under which this Bill is brought forward and why it is not treated in the same manner as the Arterial Drainage Act passed last year. It is brought in specially, and it is proposed to expend a sum which I am told is up to £50,000 for the purpose of conferring a benefit which is valued only at £8,860.  It is proposed in the Bill that the occupiers of the land to be improved by this drainage scheme should only pay interest on the sum of £8,000 while the ordinary tax-payer of all the other counties will be called upon to contribute some £41,000 for the completion of this work.  There may be some reason given by the Minister when he speaks on the subject why this extraordinary proposal should be accepted by the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me, looking at it in the ordinary light and from what I could gather from a study of the Bill, that it is very bad economics to spend £50,000 for the purpose of producing an improvement valued at £8,860.  I do not wish to oppose the Second Reading <Col N="21" /> of this Bill for the reason that probably the work will give so much needed employment, but on the Committee Stage I will propose that if this work is to be of great benefit to the locality, the owners of the lands benefited should pay, if not the entire, the greater portion of the cost of the work, and that there should be no sums levied on the rest of the Free State for a contribution to this work.  If this proposal is carried it will lay down a precedent that all the other counties in areas needing drainage may come to the Treasury here and ask subsidies to help them to carry on the work.  The end of it will be that the total will be of such a large amount that the finances of the Free State will not be able to stand it.</P>
    <P>The proposal practically is that the Secretary to the Department should call on his own constituents in Kerry to pay, in their taxation, a considerable sum of money for the carrying out of such work as this, whereas if any works are required to be done in Kerry there is no guarantee that the Minister for Finance will come to their assistance as he is doing in this Bill. We all know that a very large area of Ireland needs to be drained.  There are several schemes already on foot for the drainage of various districts. We all know that the Barrow scheme will cost a very large sum of money, and if we pass this Bill in its present form we will be laying down a precedent that where these works have been carried out, the people concerned, whose lands are improved, will have a claim on the public purse for assistance in carrying out such work.  As far as I can gather from this Bill, it is only proposed to prepare a scheme after the Bill has been passed.  I would much rather that a draft scheme was submitted to this House before we passed this Bill, because there are several Senators who, in my opinion, are fully competent to inquire into schemes of this description.</P>
    <P>I gather from the report of the proceedings in the other House that there has actually been expended already a sum of £10,000.  Surely we must consider that that sum of money was not spent without some plan and without some <Col N="22" /> scheme being in existence.  We cannot conceive that the Board of Works went blindly into this expenditure without having some definite plan or scheme before them which they were trying to carry out.  I suggest, before we take the Committee Stage of this Bill, that whatever plans are in existence should be submitted to the Seanad.</P>
    <P>There is a further point to be considered in connection with this scheme. I observed from returns given in the Dáil by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that the wages to be paid under this scheme, and for the carrying out of this drainage, are to be 30/- per week without any housing accommodation or without any perquisites whatever.  Now, I consider that the time to settle and arrange the details of any work that is to be carried out is before the scheme is passed.  When the scheme is going through is the time to settle the wages to be paid, and to find out whether they are sufficient or not.  Although I do not intend to oppose the Second Reading of this measure, I propose, on the Committee Stage, to put down some amendments so that the points I have dealt with may be fully discussed.</P>

      <P>Yes; but there are two or three Owenmore rivers in Sligo, and there is at least one in Mayo.  All that we have got in this Bill in reference to Sligo is that the people of Sligo are to pay for it, but if it turns out that the Bill applies to the river Owenmore in Mayo I expect that the people of Sligo will not approve of that.  What I suggest is that we should call this by some proper name such as Owenmore (Sligo), but even there you would be in difficulties, because there are two Owenmore rivers in Sligo.  I leave it to the Minister, however, to get out of the difficulty.</P>

      <P>In answer to the point made by Senator Colonel <Col N="23" /> Moore, I should say it is natural that there would be plenty of rivers in the country with the name of Owenmore, but this particular Owenmore river is in Sligo and flows into Ballysodare Bay.  The people of Sligo will not have to pay for this particular scheme any more than, as Senator Linehan would say, the people in Kerry will have to pay for it.  A certain limited number of people living along this particular Owenmore river in Sligo will have to pay, and I suggest that, whatever doubts may be in the minds of Senators on this point, there are none in the minds of the people living beside this particular Owenmore river.  It is their question, so far as the benefits and charges are concerned.  Senator Linehan raised the question as to why this particular scheme was being treated exceptionally.  I confess that one of the reasons was to prevent it becoming the precedent that the Senator feared. In reality, in this particular case, we are merely carrying out a contract that was entered into before the war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Owenmore drainage question is not, as I suggested in another place, quite as old as the Barrow drainage question, but it is nearly as old.  The first evidence I have seen in connection with this goes back to the year 1846.  It was agitated again some 30 years afterwards, and again some 20 years later.  However, it only became a real live question when the Congested Districts Board took up the matter in the year 1913 or 1914.  That Board prepared a scheme, and that particular scheme is actually in existence. They not merely prepared a scheme, but, as happened in most of these cases where arterial drainage had to be undertaken, they found it practically impossible to get the consent of everybody, and hence legislation, or what is equivalent to legislation, is necessary to compel those people who were anxious to hold out against the scheme and against improvements of this kind, to come in. It was for that reason that the scheme had to be brought within that very cumbersome code that we discussed here on a previous occasion.  I was going to say the last session, but I understand <Col N="24" /> that it is a controversial matter whether it is the last session or this session.  But it had to be brought in under that particular code.  A scheme was put forward when the people's consent was got as to the amount of money they would have to pay.  The scheme had gone to the extent of getting the consent of the people, and a bargain had been entered into to carry the scheme through by the Congested Districts Board acting as promoters and providing a loan of the money.  The scheme was at that time to have been carried out by the Board of Works.  Then an event occurred for which neither the Board of Works, the Congested Districts Board nor the people along the Owenmore river could be held responsible&mdash;that was the European War.  It was that that postponed this particular question.</P>
    <P>After the war, the Department of the old Government, the Congested Districts Board, again took up this particular scheme and again urged on the Treasury that it should be undertaken. They pointed out that a bargain had been entered into, that it ought to be carried out, that this was a congested district, and that unemployment was rife there&mdash;unemployment which continues there up to the present. They pointed out that a bargain had been made, and that neither morally nor practically could there really be an increase in the amounts that were being levied.  That was the proposition then that was before our Government when they determined that this particular scheme had to be treated separately.  As far as possible it is brought out of the code that we passed at a previous date this year. It follows on that as closely as possible. Assuming that the preliminary steps if the agreement had been taken as they actually had been taken before the outbreak of the European war, which prevented the carrying out of this particular work, it is therefore because there was a bargain, and because the bargain had been rendered inoperative by the outbreak of the European war, that this scheme is being treated in an exceptional manner.</P>
    <P>So far as the other schemes are concerned <Col N="25" /> they will all come up for discussion. As the Senator knows, under a Bill recently passed the farmers, who themselves can be promoters of a scheme, will have an opportunity of getting some help in the way of financial assistance from the Treasury.  But the circumstances there would be completely different.  There is no bargain entered into, and naturally the financial clauses will be different.  This will not be a precedent.  The Senator need not fear that.  This is carried out merely because it was a bargain.  It is merely the fulfilment of a bargain, and that is the reason it is being carried out.</P>
    <P>There were some other points raised by the Senator.  He raised the question of 30/- per week.  Now the wages to be paid there were based on a scale several shillings higher than the agricultural wages paid in Sligo. This is agricultural work, and agricultural labourers will work at it.  There is no suggestion by the people working there that the wages are insufficient, and not merely there but in other districts. I suggest that if this question comes up here it will refer not merely to this particular district of Owenmore, but to various other drainage districts throughout the country, either in connection with restoration work or new drainage work.  I put this to the Senator. If we pay a wage much above the agricultural wage&mdash;remember, the summer is the time when the work can be carried out, and the time for carrying on the work is a matter over which we have no control&mdash;if you pay these people wages much higher than are paid the ordinary agricultural labourer, you will make the restoration in existing districts, and the bringing in of new districts, economically impossible.</P>
    <P>The only other question raised by the Senator was the question of plans. Does he mean whether the plan is a technically approved plan or not?  I suggest it is not the business of the Seanad or the Dáil to carry out the administrative work of a Department. They can get rid of the Department and put other people in its place, but it is not the business of a deliberative assembly to carry out the business of a Government Department and to act <Col N="26" /> as an Executive.  Therefore, I could not consent to lay on the Table technical plans of these schemes.  Remember this applies not merely to the Owenmore scheme, but to the one hundred and twenty petitions from the County Councils in already in connection with drainage schemes.  It would apply to every one of these as well as others which would come in and, possibly also, to existing drainage work, and it could apply quite as well to the re-building of the Four Courts and the Custom House.  I am quite sure if the Senator would only reflect for a moment he would see the impossibility of my falling in with that suggestion.</P>

      <P>It seems to me, from all I heard since I came into the Senate this evening, that this is a Bill not entirely on all fours with the proposals that came before us, as the Parliamentary Secretary says, last session. In that case the County Councils were making themselves liable for the rates, but in this case there is a large sum to be voted by the public, and the whole procedure seems to be very closely allied with that class of Bill known as Private Bills and which are invariably submitted to a Joint Committee of the two Houses to deal with.  I do not know why that course is not adopted here.  I have a great deal of sympathy with, and share a great deal in, what Senator Linehan has said, and I think this would be a very proper case in which the whole Bill might be referred to a Joint Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know why a special case should be made out for this district in the County Sligo.  The Parliamentary Secretary alluded to it in connection with the Barrow, but the two cases are entirely different.  The Barrow is a very large river dealing with the drainage of a great many counties, and it is more or less a national question.  The Owenmore river is a comparatively small river, benefit from which will be derived entirely by the County Sligo, so that it is more or less a local matter. The Parliamentary Secretary also alluded to the bargain that had been come to.  It is all very well to make a bargain with people when they are to get large sums of public funds.  If they find that they are to get considerable <Col N="27" /> sums of money they are prepared to make any bargain and agree to it. It is another matter whether this House and the Oireachtas as a whole ought to agree to that bargain without fuller information.  We have not enough information here, and it seems to me a right and proper course to refer this Bill to a Private Bill Committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>EARL of MAYO</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to call the attention of the Senate to what has been said by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance. First of all he pointed out that this was an old matter; it has been inherited by the Free State from the Congested Districts Board.  It has been, so to speak, passed on&mdash;a liability attaching to that very old body which was taken over by the Free State.  Senator Barrington says he wants the matter referred to a Joint Committee on Private Bills.  If Senator Barrington wishes for a Joint Committee on Private Bills, on a matter that we have inherited from the Imperial Government, I do not see how any drainage scheme in the country is going to get through at all.  Impossible !</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will deal with another point in this debate, and that is the question of plans.  This is such a very old story. These plans were in the hands of the old Congested Districts Board and the Board of Works, and I have no doubt if the Senator wishes to see these plans they would be shown to him if he only went to the proper office to see them.  But as for putting plans on the Table in an assembly of this sort, to enable Senators to see these plans and to go into them, that reduces everything to an absurd state of affairs.  I hope Senator Barrington will not press for this Joint Committee, because really it would be impossible to deal with the business of the Free State in that manner.  Somebody said, I think it was Senator Linehan, that drainage in the Free State is a very important matter.  It is indeed a very important matter, and I say thank goodness we have got a Government that has pluck enough to come forward and to deal with a scheme well thought out and <Col N="28" /> with other schemes that are brought upon the <i>tapis</i>, I do not wish to say any more, except that I think the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance has explained the whole thing in an admirable manner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasLinehan" hpid="Mr. LINEHAN Mr. LINEHAN">

      <P>Just one question. What does the Minister's Parliamentary Secretary estimate will be the total cost of this work, including the money already spent, and exclusive of the £8,000 the tenants have to pay back?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamOSullivan" hpid="Professor O'SULLIVAN Professor O'SULLIVAN">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The total cost, including everything, is estimated roughly at £50,000.  That includes all. As regards the point raised by Senator Barrington, I think Senator the Earl of Mayo has answered his argument. There is no more interference with private rights in this Bill than in any other drainage scheme the Government will have to deal with.  The procedure laid down, where private rights are interfered with, under this particular Bill, follows exactly and absolutely, word for word, I believe, the lines of procedure which is adopted by a general arterial drainage scheme.</P>
