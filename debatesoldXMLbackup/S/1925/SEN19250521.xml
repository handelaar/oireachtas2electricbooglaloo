      <P>For the convenience of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, who will be compelled to attend the Dáil for the purpose of the Estimates of his own Department, I take it the Seanad will permit him to reply to the motion which stands in the name of Senator Sir John Keane.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="MINISTER for LOCAL GOVERNMENT and PUBLIC HEALTH (Mr. Burke) Seamus Aloysius Bourke">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LOCAL GOVERNMENT and PUBLIC HEALTH (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the last Recess Senator Sir John Keane moved a resolution which amounted to a rather serious reflection on the administration of my Department.  The resolution implied that a certain Order <Col N="190" /> which was made by my Department, and which I was under a statutory obligation to lay on the Table of the Seanad, and of the Dáil, was subsequently amended, and I omitted to lay the amended form on the Table of the Seanad and the Dáil.  The Order in question was the County Boards of Health Accounts Order.  It was an Order that was issued or made at a time when considerable changes were being made in the poor law, and when various institutions were being set up in the country to take the place of the old workhouses.  The Order was accordingly a general Order intended to be applicable to various institutions of different capacity in the country.  A certain firm or firms are alleged to have published certain account books for local bodies which are not in all respects in agreement with the forms laid down in this Order.  Now, it is no function of my Department, and it is not its responsibility to insist on any particular kind of forms being submitted by any commercial firm.  These firms prepare these forms on their own responsibility and at their own risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a local authority, for whom those forms are prepared, does not wish to accept them, they are at liberty to do so if the forms are not in agreement with the form laid down in the Order. The Order itself does not insist on a slavish following in every detail of the form that is attached to the Order.  It is an Order which lays down general lines which are to be followed in the accounts of local authorities.  Article 9 of the Order lays down that the receipts and payments of the Board of Health shall be brought to account, through the general receipt and expenditure books under heads of accounts classified to correspond with those shown on the abstract of accounts, and shall be carried to a ledger.  The form of ledger is not prescribed. It has always been the practice to allow a certain amount of latitude to accounting officers in the arrangement of the details required to be kept in the accounts relating to institutions so long as the prescribed heads of accounts are adhered to for the purpose of the prescribed form of <Col N="191" /> abstract.  Accordingly there has been no departure from the recognised procedure in this matter.  There is always a certain amount of latitude allowed to the accounting officer, and that latitude is still allowed.  It would be altogether without precedent, and it would be unreasonable for me to step in and interfere with the publishing firms preparing account books for public bodies, merely because in some details these account books happen to differ from the form prescribed in the form laid down in the Order.  That briefly is the position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir JOHN KEANE Sir JOHN KEANE">
      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>Personally, I cannot regard the explanation as being satisfactory or sound.  I put down this motion to call attention to what I am quite prepared to admit is the unnecessary rigidity in the control exercised by the legislature over those forms.  But I do contend that once these Orders are made, and clearly made, that they should be adhered to, and, if this elasticity is necessary, powers should be definitely sought for the variation.  There is nothing whatever in the Order (and, after all, that is the document on which the whole case is to be argued) to admit of these variations.  The Minister says they have, by custom, been adopted, and that there are precedents.  There may be precedents for illegalities, but that would not justify them.  It is distinctly stated here that &ldquo;the several books of accounts and forms shall be kept and filled up, and the several duties assigned and prescribed by this Order shall be punctually discharged by the respective proper officers of the Boards of Health in the manner set forth and according to the directions given in this Order and in the schedule hereto.&rdquo;  Now, in the schedule there are certain forms which are clearly prescribed, and there is no power given to vary.  The Minister contends that the local authorities can vary these forms, and that the public bodies can vary them, and that firms can seek orders from local authorities to supply these forms to them.  That may be desirable, but I submit that it is a direct infringement of the Order and the <Col N="192" /> power that the Oireachtas has conferred, and that it is bringing this procedure of laying papers on the Table into disrepute, if the Executive is allowed to vary them as they see fit.</P>
      <P>Now I come to a minor but a technical aspect of the matter.  Here I say again that the Minister's case is unsound. If there is any value to be got from accounting control under local government it must be uniform control. After all, is it not common sense, if you are to get figures from each local authority which admit of comparison between the various local authorities, that you will not get and that you cannot get accurate and sound comparisons unless all these figures are prepared on the same basis? This is, however, a purely technical point in accounting, that the basis for the preparation of the figures must be uniform in order to draw sound and firm conclusions.  If every local authority is allowed to vary the basis of its forms and the basis of its accounting, you never can get accurate, reliable units of comparison, as the Minister knows.  We have agreed to set up accounting machinery which will furnish a reliable unit of comparison, for the purpose of control.  It is through control of accounting that the power of the local elected representatives can be best exercised.  That is, I think, generally admitted by all people who have studied the matter.  Therefore, I do submit to the Seanad that no case has been made for a departure from the rule, either in law or in respect of efficient administration.  I do not propose to force this matter to a division. I have called the attention of the Seanad to the case, and if the Seanad is willing I will not go further.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>After the word &ldquo;to&rdquo; in line 19 to insert the words &ldquo;one or more.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>My object in moving this amendment is to ensure that a person may be appointed an official contractor for a limited area, and not necessarily for the whole of the Free State.  It does seem unreasonable that a firm, say, in Cork, if it wishes to become an official contractor, would have to undertake to supply a distant area like Galway, Sligo or Donegal.  There is no doubt that a warehouse in Cork would be unable to compete with firms in those areas.  I do not know whether my object is best effected by the amendment to the definition I propose, but if the Government accepts the principle so that the idea can be given effect to in the most convenient manner I would be satisfied. The case I make is that the firm need not necessarily quote for the entire State to become an official contractor. There is another point&mdash;I do not know if it arises now&mdash;bearing on that: what does supply mean?  Does it mean a delivery price, or a price at some stated depot, or the depot where the official contractor's main business is carried out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKenny" hpid="Mr. KENNY Mr. KENNY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the amendment.  There is a general feeling that the effect of the Combined Purchasing Bill tends towards centralisation, and that the large business concerns in and around Dublin would eventually get practically the monopoly of all the business of the public bodies throughout the Free State area.  That at any rate is one of the arguments put up to men like myself on public bodies.  I do not think that is the intention of the Legislature or the Minister, nor would it be a good thing. I think this business should be diffused as far as possible over the country generally, so as to promote industrial <Col N="195" /> activity and revival.  Of course, it may be argued that it is open to any firm or business concern to fill in the tender form that will be submitted to them, and if they enter into bonds they can become eligible to be put on the Government's list.</P>
      <P>That, however, would mean that they must undertake to supply such demands as might be made on them.  A firm in a town like Waterford, say, might not be in the position, financial or otherwise, to enter into such a large undertaking, though they might be able to cater for the requirements of the public bodies within the area of their own county, or two or three counties adjoining, the transport conditions of which they would be absolutely familiar with.  In another year that firm might possibly be in a position to cater for five or six counties, and so on. That would give local industry and enterprise an opportunity of establishing and developing itself.  That would tend also towards breaking down the present tendency to centralisation in and around Dublin.  That aspect of the case is one that would strengthen the hands of public men on public boards, like myself, in our support of the Government policy in regard to this Bill.  I do not think the Government can put forward any convincing argument against a suggestion of that sort.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BENNETT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Senator Sir John Keane left the impression that he did not know the effect the amendment he has proposed would have.  If he tries to ensure that the area should be delimited as regards supply, then I am afraid that would tend to injure the Bill, which is intended to benefit the people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir JOHN KEANE Sir JOHN KEANE">
      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of explanation, I am perfectly certain that the amendment covers what I want.  It is only a question as to the manner in which it should be effected, but I am perfectly clear as to what I want to get effected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasBennett" hpid="Mr. BENNETT Mr. BENNETT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BENNETT</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator wants to effect decentralisation of supply. <Col N="196" /> I think one of the objects of the Bill must be to tend to reduce prices, and in that way profit will accrue to the various public bodies.  I am of that opinion.  The suggestion has been made that small firms would not be able to enter into competition for these contracts, but we have the example which is published in the press to-day of the Minister for Industry and Commerce advancing firms money for the purposes of their business.  I think if the Minister for Industry and Commerce was satisfied that more efficient industrial development would be secured, that the firm who wished to extend its area of enterprise, as suggested by Senator Kenny, would probably receive financial help from the Government. I think that to delimit the area, as suggested for the purposes of contract, would minimise the object of the Bill, and that a reduction of prices would not follow.  For this reason, I cannot support the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasLinehan" hpid="Mr. LINEHAN Mr. LINEHAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LINEHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment.  Applicants for the position of official contractors under this Bill should be at liberty to limit the area in which they will be prepared to deliver their goods.</P>
      <P>If that is put into the Bill it will have the effect of increasing the competition and of lowering the prices that the local authorities will have to pay for their commodities, because it is quite evident that some contractors would be able to supply their own immediate locality at a much lower rate than they would be prepared to supply the entire of the Saorstát with some particular commodity in connection with which they had applied to be made the official contractors.  I, therefore, hope that the Minister will see his way to allow these applicants to limit the area, whether it be a county or a province, in respect of which they can make application to be appointed official contractors.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OsmondGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Sir THOMAS ESMONDE Sir THOMAS ESMONDE">
      <NameTxt>Sir THOMAS ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is very much to be said in favour of Senator Sir John Keane's amendment, though possibly it may be thought desirable later to alter the drafting of it to some other form of <Col N="197" /> words.  We are anxious, of course, for economies in local administration, and personally I welcome the Bill.  I think it is a good Bill, and that it will make for economy in local administration. It may happen, however, that local traders, who might be in a position to supply the local councils with perfectly good articles at a lower price than contractors from a distance, will be prevented from tendering, and also that the local councils may not have an opportunity of examining the quality of the goods with which they are to be supplied.  Of course there is always the danger that the system may do away with competition, and that, for instance, firms with large capital and highly developed business methods may be able, eventually, to obtain a monopoly for the supply of certain articles required by the local councils. I think that is a point that the Government might give some further consideration to.  It may be that they already have in the Bill safeguards against these objections, but I would urge them to consider the points I have put forward and see whether they could not do something on the lines of Senator Sir John Keane's amendment and in the direction of meeting his views, which, I think, are sound.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for JUSTICE (Mr. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think, for the better understanding of this amendment and the effect of it, it will be necessary to deal briefly with the general purpose and principle of the Bill.  The Senator is probably aware of how and why this system of general purchasing was initiated. It arose during a period, a couple of years ago, when the local authorities, owing to the loss of their annual grants-in-aid, were compelled to have recourse to very considerable economies.  A small beginning was made at the time, in the way of pooling the needs and the requirements of the various institutions through the country, by purchasing centrally.  It was found that that produced a two-fold effect: one was that it was possible by that means to give very substantial assistance to struggling native industries, and secondly, to effect very considerable economies in the expenditure of local rates.</P>
      <P>Senator Sir John Keane, speaking yesterday on the Second Reading of this Bill, said that while he would be cordially prepared to support the Government in sweeping the whole system of Local Government out of existence, he resented this Bill, and the principle underlying it, as an undue interference with the discretion of local authorities.  That seems to me to be a rather extraordinary point of view: that there must be no central control, guidance or assistance, but that whatever evils exist must be allowed to run out to their logical conclusions, and then Senator Sir John Keane and others will cordially support the Government in a complete abolition of the system of local government.  It does seem to us a more equitable course to endeavour to control and to guide the activities of local authorities in the best interests of the ratepayers.  This Bill is to that end.  I would like to read for Senators a very short list of articles showing the prices at which they were purchased locally and the prices at which they are purchased by the Central Purchasing Bureau.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="199" /> I have here in my hand the list showing the prices paid by the Tuberculosis Dispensary Committee in Tipperary as against the official central prices.  The following are some items:&mdash;Tea, without specification, 2s. 4d. per lb. local price; centrally, as per specification, 1s. 11d. per lb. Rice, without specification, 23s. 4d. per cwt. local price; centrally 20s. 3d.  Cornflour, without specification, 60s. per cwt. local price; centrally 28s.  Strawberry jam, without specification, 24s. per doz. local price; centrally, with specification, 21s. Pearl Barley, without specification, 37s. 4d. per cwt. local price; centrally, with specification, 21s.  Soap, without specification, 46s. 8d. per cwt. local price; centrally, 40s.  Carbolic soap, without specification, 52s. per cwt. local price; centrally, 34s. 6d.  Starch, without specification, 65s. 4d. per cwt. local price; centrally, with specification, 36s.  Whiskey, without specification, 96s. per gallon local price; centrally, with specification, 78s. 3d. per gallon, and so on.</P>
    <P>I could entertain the Seanad for the remainder of the evening with lists showing the enormous differences between the prices paid by the Central Purchasing Department and contracts entered into in the years 1922, 1923, and 1924 by local authorities.  Now, naturally there is objection and resistance to this Bill.  There always will be resistance to any measure that is introduced which hits any established vested interest and unquestionably&mdash;it is not denied&mdash;this Bill hits certain vested interests through the country, and these vested interests immediately become articulate by reason of intelligent anticipation of losses ahead.  There are and must be losses to certain local people, and there are and must be very substantial gains to the general body of the ratepaying community, and a thing that must always happen is that when the interests of a particular individual conflict with the interests of the great mass of the citizens of the country, the individual's interest goes to the wall. We consider that that is perfectly sound and proper.</P>
    <P>Now, to come down to the amendment, <Col N="200" /> the actual effect of the amendment, as distinct from what was urged in advocacy of it, would not be serious, because it would leave it entirely within the discretion of the Minister as to whether or not he appointed an official contractor under Section 3, sub-section (1) for a general supply throughout the entire country, or for supplies to particular institutions. I may state that the idea underlying the Bill is that contracts will be entered into for the supply of particular commodities to all the local authorities&mdash;asylums, county homes, and so on&mdash;and it is in that way that the maximum economy is effected. Obviously, if you simply limit the operations of the Bill to contracting for a particular county or a particular area, you do not get the same effects from it, and you are not able to give the same assistance to local industry as would otherwise be given.</P>
    <P>We have, for instance, on the files a letter from Pierce's, of Wexford, expressing their appreciation of what has been done for their firm by reason of the fact that they are able to contract for bedsteads for all the local institutions of the country.  They set out figures showing the number of extra men they were able to take on arising out of that fact, and generally they express very great gratitude and appreciation. You will not get that effect, and you will not be able to give, in the same measure, assistance to local authorities if you break up your contract system and confine it to small areas.  Equally, you will not be able to hold out to prospective manufacturers the same inducements as you will be able to hold out if you are in a position to say, that if they can produce an article up to standard and up to specification they have a very reasonable prospect of obtaining the contract for the supply of that article to all the local institutions in the State.</P>
    <P>Now, the resistance to this Bill is understandable and is perfectly natural. It is as natural that the people who lose by the Bill should object to it, as it ought to be that the people who will gain by it will approve of it. <Col N="201" /> Unfortunately, the great body of people who will gain by the operations of this Bill are probably ignorant of its provisions or of its probable effects, whereas the few who will lose by it are very well aware of, and very much alive to, its provisions and its consequences.  Consequently, you have a more articulate opposition to the Bill than you have support for it.  The Bill will mean enormous economics and an enormous saving of the public rates&mdash;a very necessary and desirable saving of the public rates.</P>
    <P>Further, it will put into the hands of the Government great power for the helping of native industries, for the fostering of nascent industries and, probably also, for the promotion of new industries by reason of the big contracts all over the country that they would be able to place for certain articles provided these articles can be turned out up to standard and to specification.  The effect of that latter consideration would be very largely lost if you were to confine the operations of this Bill to a small area, and if you were to say that a contract can only be entered into for a particular local authority.  The virtues in this central purchasing idea are:&mdash;(1) The considerable economy in rates that can be effected thereby; and (2) the very big support that can be given to existing local industries, and the very big incentive that can be held out for the promotion of new industries, while you lose, if not exactly by the amendment, at least by all that has been urged in favour of it, greatly in both of these two considerations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterDeLoughry" hpid="Mr. de LOUGHREY Mr. de LOUGHREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de LOUGHREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to support the amendment, and I hope the Seanad will do likewise.  I think the Bill is a good Bill, and there are great possibilities of Irish industries being benefited by it, but I have some experience of local bodies, and I do not think that the Bill is going to effect all the great things the Minister has claimed for it.  I have been a member of local bodies for over twenty years, and I would like to stress that point, because the Minister stated that the only resistance to the Bill was being made by people who had something to lose by <Col N="202" /> its adoption.  The average local council or mental hospital committee has really not such a great regard for local traders or manufacturers as all that.  They would, of course, like to spend the money in the locality where the rates are raised and paid, and that is only a natural desire, but if they are able to get some commodity cheaper in Dublin or Cork than locally, then they are going to buy it in Dublin or Cork.  The opposition does not come altogether from people who have monetary interest in this thing.</P>
      <P>The Minister read out a list that may or may not interest people without experience in these matters.  I have a little experience.  He told us of tea that was bought locally at 2s. 4d., and centrally at 1s. 11d.  We follow the practice in the Central Hospital and the County Home, Kilkenny, of taking the buying department price, say, at 2s. 4d.  We then advertise for tea from local traders at the Department's prices. We ask for so many chests of tea at 2s. 4d.  Our practice was to send the whole lot, labelled with letters or numbers to distinguish them, to an official tea-tester, and I may say these tea-testers were recognised by the old Local Government Board.  In no case did the Department's tea come out first. The local merchants were always able to supply tea of a better quality and at the same prices as the Department. There are other matters, such as soap, mentioned.  We bought soap through the Department for the County Home, Kilkenny, but it could not be used. The Department's specification must have been poor, because the soap was of a very poor quality.  Take jam.  I had a cutting from a Cork paper which I gave to a Senator yesterday, dealing with the supply of jams to the Mental Hospital in Cork and elsewhere.  This jam, served out to the inmates, was anything but pleasant.  Sickness broke out after it, and the doctor reported that there was a lot of foreign colouring matter used in the jam.  At any rate, it was decided by the Cork Mental Board to procure jam locally.</P>

    <P>I am in favour of the principle of this Bill, but I do not like the suggestion that the whole of the opposition to the Bill comes from interested parties. <Col N="203" /> It does not.  I have been engaged for many years in local administration.  I do not know much about the rest of Ireland, but in the place where I come from, and I am Mayor of my native city, we sit in the council, men from the city and men from the plough, and we thresh matters out, and public money is spent to the very best advantage. I do not like this business of suspicion of local authorities and local tradesmen, and I support the amendment if it was only on that ground alone.  We ought to give local bodies some discretion.  They will act in the best way.  There is to be an election for local bodies next month, and I do not think that we should be harassed with the idea of being regarded by the Department in Dublin with suspicion. We ought all to recognise that there is a new spirit of civic duty and responsibility, and we ought to give men who come into public positions some little responsibility and let them feel that they have some power of their own instead of always having this menace of a central authority ready to pounce upon them.  I believe they may be left quite safely to themselves.  I never saw them give anything away very softly. From my knowledge of them they make sure to get good value for their money. Perhaps there are some things that could be got from the central authority and money saved in the transaction, but there are other things that could be got locally better and cheaper.</P>

      <P>The proposed amendment, in my view, does not tend to improve the Bill, and in the discussion of these groceries we have got away from the main point which the Minister made.  As I understand it, the amendment would take away from the Minister that power of fostering discrimination that was shown in the incident of Pierce's Factory, while it would not add anything to the general prosperity of the country.  When we talk of soap and tea, and commodities for these different institutions, we are immediately up against the contrast between the middleman and the manufacturer. It is difficult to support an amendment which has not got any <Col N="204" /> definite character.  It would not be any improvement in the Bill except to narrow down the Government's discretionary power, so that my remarks must be confined to trying to see what would be the result if the amendment were carried.</P>
      <P>I may say no local authorities could compete successfully with a bureau, because freights will largely dominate prices.  There is nothing in the amendment that improves on the Government's good intention towards fostering local industry.  In other words, the amendment does not make parochial the sources of supply.  It is so shadowy and difficult to give it a character that instead of fostering suspicion of tea-testing, and increasing prices of soap, the Government is showing, by having central powers of choice, how it can raise factories.  But in the nature of things contracts must be largely decided by the price of freights, and you cannot invent a parochial factory, or cause one to spring up, so that it can meet the power of buying cheaply which is vested in a central bureau.  I think that letter of Pierce, who is not a supplier of soap or tea or anything of that nature, is enough to convince anyone that the Government has done well, particularly as it brings out the contrast between the middleman who is not doing the best for this country and the producer from the raw material.</P>

      <P>I think there is some difficulty in the way here as to Sir John Keane's amendment.  I have looked through the Bill and am under the impression&mdash;of course, I may be wrong&mdash;that there is nothing in the Bill which compels the Minister only to appoint an official contractor for the entire Free State.  If there is nothing of that kind in the Bill, then the only argument Sir John Keane can rely upon is the fact that the Minister for Justice has frankly stated that that is the Government policy and intention whenever they are called upon to put the Bill into effect.  If that is so, that intention is not going to be defeated by this amendment and, therefore, if Senator Sir John Keane wants to accomplish <Col N="205" /> his purpose&mdash;that is, that a contractor prepared only to supply a restricted area should be entitled to be selected&mdash;then his words are not strong enough to accomplish the principle he aims at, and I think the House understands the principle he is anxious to accomplish.  The particular words of the amendment will not, I think, accomplish his purpose, because it still leaves it entirely in the discretion of the Minister, and the Minister has told us that the policy of the Government will be if the Bill is passed only to appoint official contractors for the whole Free State.</P>

      <P>There will be nothing to prevent the Minister, if he sees some case for it, advertising a contract for a particular area if the consideration of transit and so on points to the desirability of that.  Consequently you have not there the expression &ldquo;official contractor means a person appointed under this Act to be the official contractor for the supply of commodities to the local authorities of Saorstát Eireann,&rdquo; but the general expression &ldquo;local authorities.&rdquo;  Normally, as I said, the probability is the contract will be for the supply of local government institutions in the State. If, in special cases, there would seem to be considerations pointing to the desirability of making a contract for an area rather than for the entire State it would be open to the Minister, under the Bill, to contract accordingly.  Now, Section 6 leaves it open to the local authorities to purchase otherwise than from the official contractor.  It puts in the proviso that in the event of their so doing they must record the reason for such departure, and satisfy the auditor that the buying otherwise than from the official contractor was justifiable other than on public grounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The thing is not absolutely hidebound and stereotyped.  If there is a case for departure, and if the local authority feels that the departure can be justified on public grounds, reasonably justified, <Col N="206" /> then they can go ahead with that purchase, recording the reason for the purchase and the considerations which caused them to buy otherwise than from the official contractor.  That must be judged by the official auditor&mdash;the propriety, or otherwise, of such departure. Senator de Loughrey entered, it seemed to me, into a wholly unnecessary defence of local authorities generally, and protested that they were expending local rates to the best advantage. They are, and have been, considerably helped to do so by the establishment of this Department.  The figures, after all, tell the truth, and are better than mere generalities.  For every institution in the country figures can be produced showing the saving effected for the rates of that area by central purchasing rather than local purchasing.  It simply stands to reason that if the local authorities of the country are enabled to pool their requirements and purchase centrally, and eliminate certain local profits that would otherwise take place, that they can spend the rates to better advantage.  I say that quite apart from the other consideration of the very substantial impetus that can be given to local industries by this process of buying.</P>

      <P>I would say with regard to what the Minister has stated, that if his contention is correct, then local businessmen should not be able to compete in any way with the larger contractors who would come in under the guarantees of the Ministry, and who could engage in mass production.  They would not be able to compete, either in the matter of quality or price, with these large official contractors.  That would appear at first blush to be beyond controversy.  A man producing in thousands can nearly always undercut a man who could only produce in hundreds. The result in practice is not found to be so.  It may be the desire of the Ministry to give the ratepayers of the Free State generally this great advantage in supplying articles to public bodies at the minimum cost, but in practice it is not working out so.  I would like to give an instance in connection with the Mental Hospital in Waterford.  I had the figures, but, unfortunately, <Col N="207" /> I forgot to bring them with me.  We took sixty articles on the official list, and we advertised for these articles.  In thirty-one cases the local contractors beat the official prices.  The local contractors did not know, as in the case cited by Senator de Loughrey, the price in the official list of the articles. How is it that in thirty-one cases the local tender was below the official price?  Evidently we might draw the conclusion that these large official contractors put in a price that suited themselves, and that they were profiteering on these articles.  That deduction might very reasonably be drawn, or <i>per contra,</i> that the local man was a philanthropist, and was selling his goods under cost price.  These are hard facts.  When the Minister quoted hard figures I quote hard facts against him.</P>
      <P>I am in favour of the general principles of the Bill.  I believe the community in general has benefited largely by the effect this matter has had on contracts generally.  It has chastened these people very considerably, and the result has been shown in the more moderate prices at which they now tender.  There is another matter that I would like to draw the Minister's attention to.  In the wording of this measure it would be almost impossible for such a thing to happen again.  What I desire to state is that during the currency of the contract the Minister has seen fit to alter the prices on the official list.  We had certainly one case, and I think two cases, of that sort in the Mental Hospital in Waterford.  We had a contract for and ordered goods at the official list price, and between the time of the order and the delivery of the goods, the invoice came along with something more in addition to the listed price.  We thought that was a mistake, but as a result of the correspondence that took place between the contractor, the local body and the Ministry, we were ordered to pay the increased price.  From a business point of view that is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>What I wanted to get away from was the tendency towards centralisation.  I believe the object can be achieved in this way.  In the amendment the main principle is to save the ratepayers from loss and to give to public bodies an article at the minimum cost.  That has not been achieved, because, as I say, these official contractors are putting in prices seemingly above what they are justified in charging. Under this system, although there is a clause stating that the local contractor is not debarred from tendering, if the public body accepts a local tender they must state the reason why they did so.  That is not sufficient to encourage local enterprise.  A local man has no inducement to extend his business, whereas if he were allowed to test his enterprise and his facilities, by taking in a few counties&mdash;taking into account the transport conditions in the county with which he is familiar&mdash;he will venture to send in a good price for three counties or one or two counties around, within a particular compass or radius.  You then encourage local enterprise. If that man makes a good thing out of such a contract, well, then, he will say: &ldquo;I will extend my business now, and I will try to cater for a wider area.&rdquo;  In that way, you encourage local enterprise and get away from the tendency towards centralisation.</P>

      <P>After all that has been said on this amendment I confess that I am quite unable to understand why the Minister did not accept it in the first instance.  I understood from him that it certainly did not knock the bottom out of his Bill; it did not even impair the functions of the Bill in any way.  If he held that it was likely to do either of these things I should certainly not support it, but he was far from saying either. It seems to be rather in the nature of registering a hope&mdash;a pious hope it. <Col N="209" /> may be&mdash;that there will not be necessarily a single official contractor for any specified object throughout the State.

      <P>I should like first of all to deal with an apparent legal difficulty, from a lay point of view.  It would appear to me to work in this way.  The definition of an official contractor is an individual who contracts to supply one or more local authorities.  Then under Section 3 the Minister gives public notice that within a specified time he will receive applications from persons desirous of being appointed official contractors for a specified time in respect of one or more specified commodities.  A party can then apply to be appointed an official contractor for one or more of the commodities.  Whether the Government accept the contract is another matter.  I see nothing in this Bill which would make it a condition that the Central Department should accept the lowest tender, and that seems desirable. I feel that as we go through this Bill we find a number of other things that will also require amendment. I am not concerned with the second reading aspect of the case that the Minister dealt with.  I do not think&mdash;it was unconscious, no doubt&mdash; that he properly interpreted my views on this.  I think he stressed it flagrantly from his own point of view, but that is perhaps legitimate in debate. He quoted a number of instances where economies had been effected in the case of recent purchases where the Government bought against specification, and the local authorities purchased without specification.  All <Col N="210" /> that is entirely irrelevant to this amendment.  It is assumed that in every case there is a specification.  The amendment does not prevent particular contractors from offering to supply the whole country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government will have in due course, I have no doubt, before them tenders for the supplying of all the local authorities, and they will also have tenders for the same commodities to a restricted number of authorities. They can choose between them, but surely if anybody is prepared to supply a restricted number of local authorities at a cheaper price than another individual is prepared to supply all the local authorities, the party who is prepared to supply the restricted number at a cheaper price should get the contract in respect of these areas, and the other contractor can be given the contract in respect of remaining areas, or if there is a legal difficulty in so limiting his contract it can be advertised again in respect of the remaining areas.  It is quite a simple matter.  Is that not the policy the Government adopts in respect of the supplying of the Post Office stores, and there is no legal difficulty?  It is just as necessary that we should see that there is economy in the administration of the local authorities as in the administration of the Post Office.  I know in the case of the Post Office stores, in the case of telegraph poles an individual is allowed to supply any number he chooses to specify, and another individual is able to supply the remainder. It does not all go to one person.  This section will restrict the area of competition, and only big people will be able to enter the field.  We know how rings are formed.  They are much easier formed if only a few firms are involved, say, in the case of any commodity like bedsteads; there are only two firms who can supply bedsteads in quantity and finance a supply for the whole country.  It is very possible that such firms will put their heads together, arrange the prices and pool the profits.  That is a common occurrence. I think this amendment does not in any way militate against the principles of the Bill.  It improves the <Col N="211" /> Bill, and for that reason I ask the Seanad to support it.</P>

That might be the entire area of the State, or it might be, for special reasons in the case of some special commodity, a smaller area.  But if the conception is that such a general invitation is to be issued and that after a contract has been entered into, the matter is to be thrown open for cut-throat competition on the part of everyone who is prepared to supply, let us say, one local authority, that is something with which the Minister would find himself in disagreement.</P>

But I find that I was accused of &ldquo;endeavouring to usurp arbitrary power,&rdquo; and when that was defined it came to this, that there is a statute which provides that the Royal Canal shall be kept in proper condition, and that I had actually refused, in spite of several letters, to carry that provision out, and had made no bones about it.  I do not know if it is the atmosphere of light opera that is about <Col N="213" /> town at the moment that has made Senator Colonel Moore take unto himself all the powers with regard to this Act, that he should become the arbitrator as to whether or not certain improvements were desirable, as to whether a particular statute was mandatory, whether I have any discretion under the statute, whether, in fact, the improvements were such as would fit in under the terms of the particular statute to which he referred, and, finally, that I had definitely decided to usurp arbitrary power.  There are a great many decisions involved in all this which the Senator brought up in his casual way. He seemed to think that it was incumbent upon him in the discharge of his duties to make this attack upon me, and he apparently considered that the safest exercise of his duties was to make his attack in my absence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is not theway to remedy a difficulty.  It is much better to have names mentioned than to have a casual charge made that Ministers were usurping arbitrary power.  That general charge was made. I must insist that it was done in my absence, even though the Senator may not have come in with the intention of saying so much as he did say yesterday, because I want to reveal to the House, and I think I can do so without any breach of confidence, that I have asked Senator Colonel Moore, in the course of discussions with him, to put down a resolution on the subject in this House, so that I could meet him openly on the points he was raising in correspondence <Col N="214" /> with me&mdash;that certain charges which he was then making in letters should, if he thought fit, be made in the House, and that I should have an opportunity of replying to them.</P>
      <P>The Senator has not seen fit to put down a resolution, as I suggested to him, or to get one moved in the Dáil, which was my alternative suggestion, and then there was this statement yesterday. The facts really are simple. There was a Royal Canal Company incorporated by an Act of 1818.  By a later Act, the Midland Great Western Railway Act, I think it was, of about 1845, certain powers of control were taken away from the canal company, and handed over to the railway company, with extra supervision by the Lord Lieutenant.  Through the passage of various other Acts and certain changed circumstances, the power of control of the Lord Lieutenant in certain matters became vested in the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Certain profits were to be set aside until a fund to the extent of £15,000 accumulated, and from that £15,000 fund repairs and renewals on the canal might be made.  But there was a discretion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Lord Lieutenant had power to direct repairs when he thought fit and proper, and, secondly, he had the power and the discretion to decide what repairs were indispensable for the preservation of the Royal Canal.  These two things had to be decided.  That decision now happens, by the passage of time, to rest with the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Repairs are to be directed when that Minister thinks fit and proper; and, secondly, he has to decide what repairs are indispensable for the preservation of the Royal Canal. The Act of 1818 has some repercussion upon the Act of 1845 and down to the present time, because when the two are looked at together it simply means that the position set up by the 1845 Act was that the Lord Lieutenant was to be in the position of safeguarding the interests of the public, as previously certain people had been there to safeguard the interests of the shareholders of the 1818 Company.  So that when the two are put together it comes to this, that the discretion of the Minister <Col N="215" /> with regard to the directing of repairs would work down to a very small point. It would mean that the Minister has to act as a prudent director would in ordering these repairs, and that could be defined as ordering repairs where it seemed to him that the repairs were required, having regard to existing and probably future traffic, and to all other circumstances affecting the canal as a separate commercial undertaking.</P>
    <P>This matter has been dragged out in correspondence between Senator Colonel Moore and my Department.  I think it started about a month after I took up office, and it has continued since.  I have not been able to get from the Senator sufficient details on which I could form a fair judgment as to whether these repairs were such as a prudent director would require to be made, having regard to these things, particularly having regard to the probable future traffic.  On that point I could get no information whatever from Senator Colonel Moore.  In fact, the position became further complicated by this fact, that the Senator required the canal to be cleared because he projected putting a fleet of a particular type of barge upon the canal, and for the provision of that particular fleet of barges he required Government assistance.</P>
    <P>I found myself assailed from two sides, &ldquo;Clear the canal so that I may put my barges upon it,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Give me money to build my barges to put on the canal which I have made you clear for those barges.&rdquo;  That is the position we have been in for many months, for over a year.  That the exercise of my power was not arbitrary I think I have shown.  That it was not even unjustified is revealed by another circumstance, that just this day I have received a letter from one of the Senator's colleagues withdrawing the original demand made upon me, and modifying it into an application that the board of control should instruct the railway company to cleanse the canal so as to prevent the propellers of their motor barges getting choked by weeds. So that the original big demand which I refused, and which refusal constitutes this undue exercise of power, as the <Col N="216" /> Senator stated yesterday, has now been modified to this, &ldquo;Clean the canal of a certain amount of weeds.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Senator has, I am sure, already learned from a letter sent out by my Department, that the canal is cleaned of weeds twice a year, and that the process costs about £20 a mile.  The canal is something short of 100 miles in length I do not think there has been any attempt shown here to usurp arbitrary power.  The matter is discretionary within the limits that I have stated.  I would ask the Senator if he cares to pursue this further to do as I have suggested to him already, to put down a motion and to let the whole thing be debated and threshed out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel MOORE Colonel MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>I will limit myself at first to what I did state, that the Minister had taken arbitrary power and that he was not carrying out the statute.  The Minister has explained the statute.  It is laid down that the railway company who were the purchasers of the canal should keep the canal in proper order, and a board of control was set up to state what that proper order was.  That board of control acted&mdash;or perhaps did not act very much&mdash;over a great number of years, but since the Commission on canals sat a board of control was nominated by the Minister.</P>
      <P>That board of control, when this correspondence ensued, sent one of its inspectors to inspect the canal.  His report was as nearly as possible to this effect, that he had gone on the canal with a motor boat, and that he had been unable to go more than four lengths of his boat without stopping to clear the weeds from the propeller, and that in fact the canal was not navigable for motor boats.  Whether a prudent director would order the canal to be cleared of weeds or not of course I do not know, but it seems to me that he would.  The Minister stated that he asked me to put down a motion here. We have had a number of motions at various times; I myself have put down several, all of which have been passed, and none of which has had the least attention paid to it by the Ministers concerned.</P>

      <P>The exception proves the rule, I suppose.  But I moved several motions which were carried unanimously, and none of which was carried out.  However, instead of moving one in this Chamber, where I consider it would not receive any attention, I asked the Deputy, whom the Minister mentioned as a proper person to bring it forward, to do so in the Dáil. He attempted to do so but found that he was precluded by certain rules, because some similar motion had already been brought forward.  But he has been waiting until the Estimates came up to ask a question with regard to it.  The Minister says it is in his discretion to do what he likes in this matter, but Ministers do not know everything. They have to trust to their subordinates and their officials, and I do not expect the Minister to know exactly the state of the canal.  He set up a board of control similar to the one set up before, and that board of control made certain recommendations.  The consulting engineer makes similar statements to the one I quoted, but the board of control send in a report to the Minister laying down what ought to be done and what should be done to clear the canal.  It laid down specifically what part of the canal should be cleared up first.  So far as that is concerned, I think the Minister, as a prudent director, would fulfil the desires of his subordinates and would proceed to carry out their wishes.  He also said it is laid down as to what reparation should be made.  That is true, but the reparation would be recommended in the natural course by the board of control set up.  I have never urged that you should go one step beyond that.  All I want to see is that the law is carried out.  I have repeated, in correspondence with the Minister, again and again, that the recommendations of the board of control should be carried out.  The Minister also says he is safeguarding the public. Throughout this correspondence he has evaded the question, as much as he <Col N="218" /> could, of carrying out any improvements in the canal, and he has done so for different reasons.</P>
      <P>If the railways were damaged it would be a serious loss to the public, and therefore he must not clear the canal, as it might take traffic from the railways.  He sets himself up in an arbitrary way to decide what sort of transport is suitable and what kind is not suitable.  At the same time another Minister is preparing to repair the whole roads of the country so that they may compete with the railways. The canal is not to be cleared.  At one stage he told me that there was a great body of opinion in this country who wished the canal to be filled up and closed altogether.  I am not sure that he advocated that, but he put it forward as a statement.  He says in his statement that he has no information as to the future traffic.  On the contrary, he was given a full statement as to what traffic they expected, and as to what rates they were going to charge. He was given a statement that our rates should be 20 per cent. below the railway rates, and he was told the number of tons we expected to carry and the amount of profit we expected out of the freight.  Large tolls would go to the railway, £7,000 or £8,000, to compensate for any capital sum they would expend.  The Minister for Finance would be able to collect large income tax out of those things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All those matters were put before him again and again.  We had two interviews with him.  I had an interview with him in company with some Deputies. We discussed the matter with him for over an hour.  He was very patient, listened well, and gave a number of good arguments.  The whole thing was perfectly useless, however. In letters I repeatedly said: &ldquo;Will the canal be cleared or not?&rdquo;  We cannot build a boat for the canal unless we know the canal is to be cleared.  He mentioned the loan.  I said: &ldquo;All I wanted at that time was that the canal should be cleared by the authorities.&rdquo; Major Millington laid it down, a man who was a former inspector and a member of the board of control.  He said he has had letters sent from one of the directors withdrawing from the <Col N="219" /> loan.  That is only natural, because for the last six months the Minister refused to clear the canal.  We are not the only people who pressed him to do this.  The county councils in Leix and in Westmeath had done so.  As a matter of fact, boatmen and other people have certain rights on this canal which are being infringed.  A great number of people are earning their living, and their rights are being infringed.  They complain that they cannot drag their boats on it, and that they have to put on two horses instead of one.  They cannot run motor boats on it.  Everyone is complaining.  In justice to all the people living on the canal who want to get their stuff cheaper by the canal than on the railway, this should be done.</P>
    <P>In the case of Ballymahon, there is no railway touching the town.  He also says that a gentleman wrote him stating that he only wanted the weeds cleared away.  That is quite true.  One of our directors resigned, and said it was hopeless in face of the continuous opposition of the Government to get anything at all.  This is a very serious matter.  As I said in one of my letters, no business can be done if the Minister says &ldquo;I consider that the law as it stands now ought not to be carried out until I have considered your prospects favourably.  The prospects of the company are not sufficient to give profit.&rdquo; Those are his words.  If the Minister is going to decide in this way I do not know how anything can be done.  We say we take the responsibility and will put in our money.  If we lose money that is our own fault.  I wish to repeat that I am not anxious to make a personal attack on the Minister.  That was my only reason in not mentioning it yesterday when he was not present. It arose casually.  Now I am in honour bound to declare what it was.  I know he thinks he is acting for the best in this matter, but I do not think he is acting wisely.  That is a matter of opinion.  Even if he clears the weeds that will be something done.</P>

      <P>It would appear from what the Senator said that the Board of Control had, taking the Senator's <Col N="220" /> reading of the Act, said to me, &ldquo;You are bound to clear the canal. Here is an estimate of the work required to put the canal into proper order.&rdquo;  The board of control said nothing of the sort.  It said, assuming that you are acting in the guise of a prudent director, and that you are going to make this canal suitable for boats of a certain type then the following will be required.  That left outstanding the point always outstanding, to which I referred in my last letter to the Senator.  On the 7th May I stated&mdash;</P>
      <P>The outstanding feature of the matter is that so far as my information goes your prospective services will be a much less economical form of transport in the industrial and commercial conditions existing, or prospective, in the area served, than the transport services at present available.</P>
      <P>So long as that is the particular point of view I have, I do not see how I can make the railway company incur the expenditure which the Senator's proposal would entail.  The Senator has spoken for a considerable time, apparently, backing out what he said yesterday, that I had refused to carry out an Act of Parliament.  If there is an Act of Parliament saying that I have to do certain things, and that it is peremptory on me, then I can be forced to do those things.  There is a definite way of getting that done.  It is obvious from the Senator's remarks that is not the case.  He recognises there is a distinction.  His only point is that I refused to be bound by his argument as to whether or not, regarding the existing and probable future traffic, there is going to be anything served by this fleet of barges.  I wish to make clear that that is the only point at issue.  The Senator said I have refused to carry out the provisions of a Statute.  The atmosphere surrounding that is that there is an Act that provides that certain action shall be taken, and that I set myself up in defiance of an Act of Parliament and say it will not be done.  That is not the case, and as long as this is clear I leave the Senator's argument until they raise it here or in the Dáil.</P>

      <P>After Section 4, to insert a new Section 5, as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The Minister shall make arrangements whereby standard samples, bearing the seal of his Department, of all articles of a non-perishable nature which have been made the subject of an official contract shall be displayed at the offices of every local authority and at the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having seen the very voluminous list of articles I ask leave to delete the words &ldquo;every local authority&rdquo; from the amendment.  As practical persons know, you cannot meditate on price. There is great temptation to buy the cheapest article, but very often it is the worst, and in the long run the most expensive.  You must have some practical and positive means of specifying quality.  You will want rules and regulations.  I do not see how you can determine quality without a satisfactory sample.  Long scientific specifications can be drawn up that it would require chemists and scientific people to determine.  I have been looking through a long list of articles for which contracts have been made in the past, and in many cases there is nothing to indicate the size, the length, or the weight of them.  The only satisfactory way to determine that is to see the article.  By doing so a contractor will know what is required, and should any local authority wish to buy they can see it.  If the Government have any alternative <Col N="222" /> proposals to meet such a point I do not adhere to the wording of this amendment.  It is absolutely certain that a mere verbal specification will not determine quality.  If it passes as it stands the Bill will be ineffective in its purpose.</P>

      <P>I wonder would the Senator be satisfied if I assured him that there is unlimited goodwill to the purpose of the amendment, and that in fact there are centrally at the Department, samples of nearly all the commodities that are centrally bought, and with regard to which contracts are entered into.  If the Senator would be content with that assurance and leave the matter to be dealt with by regulation under Section 12, I think, perhaps, it would be more satisfactory than to accept the amendment as it stands.  There are obvious difficulties about keeping samples of, say, a road engine or a steam roller in the offices of the Department.  The specifications are entered into in consultation with the most experienced officers of the local authority, and occasionally, in the case of particular articles, small consultative committees are set up.  There is every acceptance of the point of view that the mere specification, however carefully drafted, is not adequate, and that samples ought to be permanently on view somewhere.  I think if the Senator is assured that the underlying idea of the amendment is fully accepted in the Department and actually put into effect it might be met by regulations made under Section 12 of the Bill.</P>

      <P>(1)  Whenever a local authority purchases or enters into a contract for the purchase of any commodity for which an official contractor has been appointed under this Act with a person who is not an official contractor for such commodity, an entry shall be made in the minutes of such local authority stating the reasons for such purchase or contract.</P>
      <P>(2)  Such entry shall be produced at any audit of the accounts of the local authority which includes any payment for such commodity or under such contract.</P>
      <P>(3)  At any such audit, unless the auditor is satisfied that such purchase or contract was not made for any fraudulent or improper purpose or object or for any object other than the bona fide discharge by the members of the local authority making or authorising the making thereof of their duties in the interests of the ratepayers, he shall charge against such members jointly and severally the amount of any loss caused to the local authority by such purchase or contract, whether such loss arises from the price paid for the commodity or from the quality of the commodity so obtained or otherwise howsoever, and in the case of a contract if in his opinion any such loss as aforesaid is likely to result from the continuance of the contract he may declare such contract to be illegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="224" /> (4)  Where a contract is declared to be illegal in pursuance of this section such contract shall thereupon become void, and Section 12 of the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1871 (which relates to the duties of an auditor and to appeals) shall apply in the case of such contract, and the members of the local authority making such contract may be surcharged accordingly either with all payments made thereunder or with such portion thereof as may appear to the auditor, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, just and reasonable, but the persons with whom such contract was made may notwithstanding such declaration recover any sum due to him under such contract in respect of commodities supplied before such declaration.</P>

      <P>Penalties are imposed, and apparently if there is a surcharge there is no power of appeal.  If a local authority in their wisdom&mdash;and, after all, we come back to the principle that a local authority should be trusted&mdash;choose to buy a commodity either of an inferior or a better quality than the one which is the subject of the official contract, it does not seem reasonable that any penalty should follow.  There may be often a case to be made for buying a cheaper article or for buying a dearer article. If that is done, why should all this machinery dealing with auditors and penalties be introduced?  How is the injustice going to be brought home unless the offence lies in some specific act or wrong-doing in respect of identical commodities?  When you read that in connection with the latter part of the section, where penalties arise for loss of price, or for loss of time, or for inferior quality, it seems as if you are in somewhat of a morass.</P>

      <P>In order to safeguard the members of a local authority who would be well inclined to do their duty to the ratepayers and to the institution of which they are the managing directors, this amendment will make it clear that they will not be liable if they keep two main principles in view, in the event of giving the contract to a person other than the official contractor.  These two principles would be, that the price would not be in excess of the price quoted by the official contractor, and that the article or commodity supplied would not be inferior to the standard sample.  According to sub-section (3) of section 6 I think if I was a member of a local authority I would be very slow to accept a tender from a person outside the list of official contractors. Under the section as it stands, I would always have before my mind the fact that I should be getting ready to prove my innocence in order to put it before the auditor when he came to examine the accounts.  I think the amendment I have proposed is a very reasonable and just one, and that there should be no objection to its incorporation in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>The objectionable feature of the amendment is that it rather defeats the whole outlook and the whole mentality with regard to the official contractor.  The idea the Department are anxious to establish is, that once the contract is entered into with the official contractor, the normal course is that the local authority should purchase in that way, and that departure <Col N="226" /> would be to do otherwise.  Section 6 puts the onus on the local authority, in the event of departing from what the Minister would wish to have regarded as the normal course, to show cause, as it were, that that action was taken for some reason; that they considered the interests of the people for whom they were exercising stewardship.</P>
      <P>The Senator's amendment is not, of course, revolutionary to the Bill.  It is not a very serious departure from the Bill, but it affects the mentality and gets away from the idea that the normal course is to take from the official contractor with whom the central purchasing department has entered into an arrangement. It changes the onus.  Instead of the local authority being asked to show why they took this special course of buying otherwise than through the official contractor, it throws the onus back on the Minister and his Department to show specifically that the interests of the ratepayers were injured thereby, either by reason of a greater price being paid, or by reason of an inferior quality of goods being taken.  Looking at Section 6, there does not seem anything objectionable about it.  Sub-section (1) provides that where there is a departure from the procedure of buying from the official contractor in regard to an article that has been made the subject of contract, an entry shall be made in the minutes showing the cause for such departure.  The entry then must be produced at any audit of the accounts of the local authority which includes any payment for such commodity or on any such contract. Finally, sub-section (3) says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>At any such audit, unless the auditor is satisfied that such purchase or contract was not made for any fraudulent or improper purpose or object or for any object other than the <i>bona fide</i> discharge by the members of the local authority making or authorising the making thereof of their duties in the interests of the ratepayers, he shall charge against such members jointly and</P>
      <P>I think some Senator speaking to this amendment said there was no appeal from such surcharge by the auditor. Of course there is always an appeal from the surcharge of an auditor.</P>

      <P>There is this about the Senator's amendment, that I would like to add that it might be rather a formidable matter for the Minister, in the event of a wholesale disregard of the operations of this Bill, to undertake to establish a case against every local authority which departed from it on the basis of either price or quality.  I would urge the Seanad to accept the view that the better course is to take it that the normal procedure will be to buy from the official contractor, and that on a local authority taking the responsibility of departing from that course, that they should be able to make their case for that departure.  Otherwise it is simply a sapping and undermining of the whole idea.  If local authorities here and there break away and purchase goods locally, and defy the Minister to prove that in the matter of quality they did not do as well, or that the price was greater, and so on, the Act would be unworkable.  In spite of what Senator de Loughrey has said, there is considerable opposition to this whole idea of central purchasing, and one can well understand the reason. The Department has good reason to believe that the people whose interests are injured by it are prepared to put up a very determined resistance to the entire scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That being so, the Minister must simply frame this Bill in the light of the facts that are within his knowledge.  Personally I was not in the least impressed by Senator Kenny's statement that sixty articles were put up for local tender, and that in the case of thirty-one of them the people tendering locally did better.  I would require very considerable proof that the people tendering locally were unaware of the prices that the central purchasing department were paying for these articles, and I would require a great deal of persuasion before I would believe that the whole business was not <Col N="228" /> simply put through <i>ad hoc</i>&mdash;for the purpose of providing arguments against this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BENNETT</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the prices portion of the amendment went, I would not be averse to it.  I would be opposed to the amendment on the whole. I think to put in an amendment with regard to quality would open up an endless vista of difficulties.  If this proviso, &ldquo;according to quality,&rdquo; were allowed, you would have every local authority that desires it saying, &ldquo;This is the better tea.  It has the better taste and flavour,&rdquo; and so on, and, that being so, it would be quite impossible to work the Act and carry out the purpose for which it was intended.  For that reason I am opposed to the amendment. I think we cannot take it piecemeal. The question of price does not come in.  I certainly feel very strongly that if we admit the principle of quality, the Act will never be properly administered at all.  I remember quite well in the old days when it was, of course, a question of quality, we got standard samples.  You had an inmate of the workhouse getting a shawl.  A trader in the locality sent in a sample shawl, which to the lay mind was infinitely inferior.  His friends on the Board, however, said that it was better than the other, and it was accepted, though obviously it was a great deal inferior.  Therefore, I say that the question of quality is not to be haggled about in this way; it would hamper the working of the Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir JOHN KEANE Sir JOHN KEANE">
      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears that the question of quality is to arise.  If a local authority buy a cheaper article the Government may then in their wisdom or the auditor may recommend a surcharge on the basis not of prices, but of quality, and you are up against that same difficulty that Senator Bennett has indicated.  A local authority might buy tea at 3d. per lb. cheaper than through the central authority, and they might say: &ldquo;We are saving 3d. a lb.  We consider this tea is in no way inferior to the standard sample.&rdquo;  This may be carried to extremes and brought into the courts to get a decision as to whether or not the ratepayers have suffered by <Col N="229" /> purchasing tea at 3d. a lb. less than the tea supplied by the central authority. You would have serious misgivings as to how, in practice, this Bill is to work if the local authorities consider that they are justified in buying it more cheaply.</P>

So that it is not a question of their being taken by surprise six months later.  Their reasons for accepting the local tender would have to be recorded.  Assuming that the auditors would do their duty fairly and impartially, and we have to assume that, I think the local authorities are protected under this Section 6.</P>

I rather imagine that it was through an oversight that the Minister left out that very important interest in constituting this committee.  Certainly the agricultural interests will have to bear a very large proportion of the cost of these commodities, and I think it is only fair they should have representation on this advisory committee.  It is not a committee that will have any executive powers; it is merely for advising the Minister.  I think he should have the views of the agricultural interests in considering any important matter as regards the selection of commodities, and in connection with the other duties for which this committee is constituted.</P>

      <P>There is a provision in the Bill that the local authorities themselves shall contribute their quota towards the cost of this central purchasing department.  It is advisable, in order to get the full effect, to see that the overhead expenses of the <Col N="231" /> Department do not become unduly inflated, and the proposal to increase the number must be judged having regard to the fact that travelling expenses will be increased.  The Senator ought really to ask himself whether five will not be entirely adequate for the purpose, and whether any addition to that number is advisable having regard to the fact that there will be necessarily travelling expenses for the members of this body.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see any good or sufficient reason for increasing the number.  Dealing with the other amendments, the Senator asked for special representation for agriculture. I draw attention to paragraph (a), sub-section (1) of Section 9: &ldquo;Two persons shall be elected members of country or country borough councils in Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo;  Presumably the agricultural interests will be well represented on the county councils, and if not, I do not know who is to blame, except possibly the agricultural interest itself.  I simply ask the Senator whether, in view of the fact that this is predominantly an agricultural country, and that the personnel of the county council is predominately agricultural, it is necessary to make a special provision that there shall be representation for agriculture.  As a fact, most of the commodities that will be the subject of this kind of central contract system will not be agricultural produce, will not be perishable goods, and there is not, therefore, any special case that there will be a question of agricultural produce going through the central purchasing department, and so on.  Such articles as milk and vegetables are eminently more <Col N="232" /> suited for local rather than central purchasing and, in fact, in practice they are habitually so treated.  The other amendments would seem to turn very much on the question as to whether it is decided to increase that number five to seven.  I am opposed to the increase.</P>

      <P>Would you be prepared to meet the Senator so far as to leave the number as it is, and in paragraph (c) to accept this amendment: &ldquo;One person shall be representative of commerce or agriculture,&rdquo; and leave the number as it is?  That would give you the option, if you wished, of selecting an agricultural or a commercial man.  It would leave your committee the same number, and would give you the power which you otherwise have not got, to put on a representative of agriculture.</P>

      <P>Nearly everyone in the country, except the police and military, are representative of one or the other, and I am not sure that it would be scientific drafting to say that one of these representatives shall be a representative of commerce or agriculture. I think the Senator is safe enough under paragraph (a) and that he is certain to get agricultural representation there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BENNETT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be very unlikely that you would get agricultural representation.  When it comes to discussing tea or sugar, for instance, the member of the country council would say, as so and so is a tea and sugar man and understands this, he would be the best representative on the committee.  I would not be in favour of changing the number five to seven. I think a suggestion that would possibly meet the case would be to arrange it this way, that of the two elected members of the country council one shall represent agriculture.  The suggestion which I have made would, I think, meet the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasLinehan" hpid="Mr. LINEHAN Mr. LINEHAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LINEHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The argument of the Minister that agriculture would be represented under paragraph (a), that is to say, through the country councils, is one that might also be used as regards <Col N="233" /> commerce, because already we have the borough and urban councils represented.  In addition to commerce being represented under (a) and (b) you have it specially represented under paragraph (c).  It is a fact that the only function which the agriculturists will be in a position to exercise is that of paying for the commodities.  In the case of commerce it is different, because those engaged in it may make some profit from supplying goods to the institutions in respect of which they have been declared the official contractors.  I think it is absolutely necessary that the people who pay a considerable portion of the cost of these commodities should have some voice on this advisory committee.  I would be satisfied if, instead of two, there was one representative of agriculture added to this committee.</P>

      <P>I would be prepared to leave the number at five.  I draw the Senator's attention to the fact that this is not an elected committee. It is a committee of persons to be appointed by the Minister, and this is eminently a ratepayers' Bill, brought in in the interests of the ratepayers&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;rather than, as the Senator seems to suggest, a Bill in the interests of persons engaged in commerce or anything else.  The suggestion has been made that paragraph (c) should read: &ldquo;One person shall be representative of commerce or agriculture in Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo;  I was not particularly attracted by that, but if the paragraph were so worded, then, in the event of there being insufficient representation, or what the Minister would consider insufficient representation for agriculture under paragraph (a), the matter could be balanced by paragraph (c), by selecting the representative there.  For the purpose of advising him in the practical administration of this measure, which, as I say, is brought in in the interests of the ratepaying public, the Minister is not likely to select a committee whose interests would run counter to, or would <Col N="234" /> conflict with the interests of the ratepaying public, and this pressure for some special representation for agriculture, as such, is scarcely sound in the face of facts like that.  If the agricultural interests generally cannot secure representation on the country councils of the country and thereby on the General Council of Country Councils, which, presumably, will be consulted by the Minister when he is selecting this committee, well then it is simply their own fault.</P>

      <P>In Section 12, to add at the end of the section a new sub-section (2), as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2)  Any regulations made under this Act shall be laid as soon as may be before both Houses of the Oireachtas; and if either House within twenty-one days after any such regulation has been laid before it shall by resolution disallow such regulation, such regulation shall be null and void, but without prejudice to anything previously done thereunder or to the making of a new regulation.</P>
      <P>I fail to see any reason for excluding the Rules under this Bill from the ordinary process of being laid on the Table.  It is a safeguard to have regulations of this kind left on the Table. If Senators do wish to inform themselves on these matters the documents will be there and can be consulted, and if there is anything undesirable the machinery is there by which it can be brought to notice.  The regulation as regards having Rules laid on the Table has been allowed in the case of measures of less importance than this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment is not just as reasonable as the Senator claims.  If he will read down again the matters that are to be covered by these regulations he will see that they are of an administrative character, and that it would make the work of a department extremely difficult if administrative details of that kind were to be voided.  The matters covered by paragraphs (a) to (g) are not really the kind of matters that normally are dealt with by regulations laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and voidable by resolution of either House. One could, of course, go to extremes in this matter of exacting that the detailed administrative work of a department should be subject to approval.  It is a simpler thing, if there is that outlook and that mentality, to remove a Minister, and it is, on the whole, more desirable.  I do not consider that on the matters set out in these paragraphs that either the Dáil or the Seanad is <Col N="236" /> more likely to come to a just or an accurate decision on them than the Minister and his officials, and if it does come to this: that the Minister, with his officials, cannot be trusted to deal with the kind of matters that are set out there, then he ought not to be the Minister.</P>
      <P>Every day, in every Department, there are things of far more practical importance than any of the things set out there dealt with on the discretion of Ministers, and is that wrong?  You can run mad and run amok on that line of exacting that administration be brought under the microscope by the Dáil and the Seanad.  This is only the merest administration.  To say that the Minister should put this Bill into effect, and do it in a way that would render details such as these voidable after three weeks by a side wind from the Dáil or the Seanad, would be making matters very difficult for him. There would be a stage at which he would have to prescribe a regulation and act on it, and some of these regulations would be of a kind that would need to be final.  If they were voidable they would present very considerable difficulties.</P>

I do not want to accuse the people of this country of a double does of original sin, but there is no question of doubt that every country in the world has its corruption, and the more we can prevent such a thing ever creeping in here the better, and I think it is our duty to do so.  I remember very well on one occasion in America, when the question was discussed as to why the President had such a short time of office, an American Senator said to me: &ldquo;We think four years is long enough <Col N="238" /> to give any man control of the public funds.  He would be apt to get too cute at the end of the time.&rdquo;  This Bill is a new departure, and I think it would be a very wise thing to let us see how it works.  If it works well it can be renewed at the end of three years.  If it does not work well, or if there are any changes thought desirable to make in it, we can make them.
