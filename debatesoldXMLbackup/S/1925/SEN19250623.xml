      <P>&ldquo;This Act shall be construed as one with the Shops Act, 1912, and all words and expressions to which special meanings are assigned by that Act shall respectively have those meanings in this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is one that was suggested to me from three distinct legal sources.  I believe the effect of it would be to aid very considerably in the administration of the Act.  I may say that Senator Brown, who drafted the Bill originally, is of the opinion that it would be a considerable improvement. This amendment makes it perfecly clear that the phrases in this Act will <Col N="664" /> have the same meaning as in the Shops Act of 1912.</P>

      <P>I want to point out that this Bill has been rushed here. The whole procedure has been so hurried that the introducers of the Bill have even had to put forward a series of amendments.  I think we ought to postpone the consideration of those amendments for at least a week.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like to venture an opinion on that without first looking the matter up.  There is a provision that enables the consideration of matters to be adjourned on the motion of a Senator; I am not certain whether that is limited in its operation or not.  I think there is a Standing Order in connection with the matter.  It seems to me the point raised by Senator Douglas is right.  The only motion that can be made for suspending the progress of a Bill comes under Standing Order 76.  That only applies to the Second Stage or the Fifth Stage.</P>

      <P>A good deal <Col N="665" /> of legislation has been passed on this subject.  There are at least one or two Shops Acts already passed.  The object of this amendment is to show that it is not to be taken as setting any of them aside.  The advantage is that all the definitions in the former Acts will apply to this Act.  It is really a sort of formal thing.  There is nothing behind it.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is so.  Of course the Title of the Bill would have to be amended if that suggestion were adopted.  The Bill itself only purports to deal with the closing of the shops in the County Borough of Dublin and in the surrounding urban districts.  If we were to extend it to the whole of the Free State, it would be more or less on the same lines as the amendment by Senator Sir John Griffith in connection with the Shannon electricity scheme, which I was compelled to say was out of order.</P>

      <P>New section.  Before Section 5 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;5.  The provisions of Sections 13 and 14 of the Shops Act, 1912, as modified by Section 21 of that Act, shall, so far as those provisions are <Col N="669" /> applicable, have effect as if reenacted in this Act and in terms made applicable thereto.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The effect of this amendment is to bring this Bill beyond yea or nay into conformity with the general Shops Act of 1912.  It was my opinion, and it is still my opinion, that if the section was not inserted a provision for carrying out of the closing hours would be obligatory on local authorities as under the Shops Act of 1912.  This is in order to make it perfectly clear that the carrying out of the Act shall not be left to various individuals trying to enforce it but shall be left to the local authority, subject to the same provisions as under the Shops Act of 1912.  Perhaps I should point out that the Shops Act is the main Act governing the hours of the shops all over Ireland at the present moment.  If necessary, I can go further.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not too sure that this is a wise amendment. I will tell you why.  You have already incorporated an amendment stating that this Act and the Shops Act shall be read as one.  In my opinion, by that amendment you purport to incorporate all the provisions of the Shops Act of 1912, whereas by this new section you deal only with two sections of the Act. It would be argued hereafter very strenuously that the effect of the new section, including specifically two sections, shows that you did not purport to include the other provisions of the Act.  I think you should consider whether you should not modify that amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>

      <P>To delete the word &ldquo;owners&rdquo; in line 48 and to substitute therefor the word &ldquo;employers.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The owner of the shop, of course, in many cases might not be the person doing business, and it is merely to ensure that it shall be the person employing the people concerned.</P>

      <P>In Section 5, line 47, to delete the words &ldquo;at any time during the week.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think the Act as it stands might hit people in small towns who are engaged in the drapery business.  I think the Act should state that it shall not apply to a shop where the persons employed are members of the owner's family dwelling in the building of which the shop forms a part or to which the shop is attached.  Of course, I do not know how the amendment will affect the area to which this Act applies, but it might possibly affect the country afterwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I should say that I am rather glad that Senator Love raised this point on this section, because the only section of this Act on which I find any strong difference of opinion amongst those advocating it, is as to whether any person at all should be exempted.  Since the Bill was introduced I have received visits from two or three small traders who welcome a general closing at 7.30.  They were afraid that if there was any exemption it might be abused.  I am quite certain that if Senator Love's amendment were carried it would lead to a considerable amount of feeling amongst those people.  I am informed on first hand authority that there are cases where assistants employed in large firms get out at 1 o'clock on Saturday and work later on with their relatives and enable them to carry on business late on Saturday night.  That is one case that should not be exempted.  I want to exempt the <i>bona fide</i> small shop, where no large amount of business is done, and where a woman with her family, or a man with his family, carries on a small business which runs on sometimes to quite late at night but which does not interfere with the trade generally.  I am afraid if you take out the words suggested by Senator Love the Bill would not be acceptable to the interests on behalf of whom it is being promoted. It would also have the effect of endangering the passage of the Bill.  As far as the larger firms are concerned, they would not object to Senator Love's amendment.  It would make no difference to them; in fact, they would <Col N="671" /> rather approve of it, but from the point of view of the smaller people I would not be inclined to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>In this section the duration of the Act is put down as three years.  I had the satisfaction of voting for the first of these Acts in 1912, and I am very much in favour of the principle embodied, both on hygienic and moral grounds. These are most beneficial Acts.  I notice that this Act is to expire in three years. I would like to have the opinion of the Seanad as to whether we should not extend it much longer.  Why should it not be for five years?  If this Act expires in three years, I presume that a new Act will be introduced, but the operation of this Act will be found so satisfactory that everybody would like to have it made more or less permanent. I suggest that the period of the Act be extended for five years.  To have the opinion of the Seanad in the matter, I beg formally to move that the word &ldquo;three&rdquo; be deleted in line 2, Section 6, and that the word &ldquo;five&rdquo; be substituted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not the slightest objection as to whether the duration of the Act should be three or five years, in view of the fact that it is my personal opinion that before very long the whole question of the Shop Hours Act will have to be reconsidered. It was with a view to that&mdash;it obviously could not be considered now &mdash;that I put down three years, but I am quite agreeable to the suggestion of Senator Sir Thomas Esmonde.</P>

      <P>As I see the Minister for Industry and Commerce present, I want to call the attention of the House to a complication that has arisen with regard to the Shannon Electricity Bill.  Just as we were concluding our business on Friday, a discussion arose about the Arterial Drainage Bill, and it was suggested by some Senator, who said that he would be away to-day, because of matters connected with the local elections, that he would be glad if the Seanad would take that Bill on Thursday, and accordingly that was agreed to.  Then a suggestion was made that the Minister might like to have the Shannon Bill taken on Thursday.  He said, however, that that would not suit him at all, and accordingly I there and then said that the Shannon Bill would be taken on Tuesday, that is to-day. Unfortunately, Mr. O'Sullivan, our Assistant Clerk, had just been called away at the moment and he had previously provisionally settled the Agenda for Tuesday with me.  In that Agenda we had left out the Shannon Electricity Bill, and being away when this promise was given by me, he sent out the Agenda as we had provisionally fixed it, and the Agenda set out that the Shannon Bill would not be taken until Thursday.  The position is, that the Minister will be up to his neck and shoulders, if I may use the expression, on to-morrow and Thursday in the Dáil.  His estimates are coming on and are pretty certain to occupy him for the whole of the two days.  The Dáil is not sitting to-day on account of the elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have got then to accommodate the convenience of the Minister.  On the other hand, I think we are bound to consider the convenience of Senators, and more particularly of minorities. <Col N="673" /> We all know, of course, that it is the privilege and the right of minorities to pursue their opposition, if they wish to, up to the very last minute, and that will include the final stage of this Bill. Senator Sir John Keane intimated to me last week his great anxiety to say something on the Fifth Stage of this Bill, and accordingly I told him it would not be on until this week.  In that prophecy I was correct, but he did not know, and, in fact, the matter escaped my notice that it would be on to-day.  He is engaged to-day looking after the county council elections in his own county and could not be here, but he will be here on Thursday.  I would suggest to the Minister&mdash;I may say that I want to convenience him in every way because his position is a difficult one&mdash; that the matter might be met in this way: supposing we were to meet on Thursday at 2.30, and were to take up this Bill the first thing, I could then allow a quarter of an hour to Senator Sir John Keane to speak on it, and the Minister who has thrice slain the slain in this matter might perform the operation for the fourth time in another quarter of an hour.  That would enable the Minister to get back to the Dáil at 3 o'clock.  I suggest that an arrangement of that kind would be the best for all parties.  Of course, I am mainly responsible for the mistake, because I should have corrected the Order Paper. I did not notice the mistake, however, until the Order Paper had been sent out, and that is the difficulty.  Senator Sir John Keane would have a grievance if we were to take the Bill to-day, and the Minister will have a grievance if we do not accommodate him in some way.  What I have suggested is, I think, the best way out of the difficulty.</P>

      <P>I do not think Senator Sir John Keane will be made any easier if this Bill is taken to-day rather than on Thursday.  If he is to be decapitated to-day rather than on Thursday, I do not think we will be doing any wrong to him.</P>

      <P>The point is that Senator Sir John Keane did not know that the Bill would be taken to-day. As I have already pointed out, it is by mistake, for which, as I said <Col N="674" /> earlier, I am mainly responsible, that it is not on the Order Paper to-day.  We have minorities in this House, and we have had instances, and very proper instances, in which minorities have persisted in their opposition up to the very last moment, because it was a matter of principle with them.  I am anxious to protect these rights of minorities, and if we can come to an arrangement which will produce the minimum of inconvenience to everyone concerned I think we ought to adopt it.</P>

      <P>To me it does not matter in the least whether the Bill is taken to-day or on Thursday, but I am aware that several Senators, at great personal inconvenience to themselves, have cancelled appointments which they had made for to-day in connection with the Local Government elections and have come here instead.  Some of them are complaining that, after coming here, they should be told that the Bill is not to be taken to-day.  As far as I am concerned, I do not mind in the least.</P>

      <P>I have explained how the mistake occurred and have taken the blame for it on myself. It was a matter of absolute indifference to me when it came on, but inasmuch as Senators will be here again on Thursday, I think, in view of what I have said, that it ought to be taken that day.  I would like to hear what the Minister has to say on the matter.</P>

      <P>I must say that I was rather disappointed at finding that this Bill was not to be taken to-day, but the explanation that has been given sufficiently accounts for that, I think.  I would like to say, however, that I am in rather a difficulty as regards my Estimates.  It was only to-day I heard that my Estimates may not come on to-morrow in the Dáil. That means that my preliminary statement on the Estimates will not be taken until Thursday.  There is one Estimate at present under consideration in the Dáil, the discussion of which is due to be resumed to-morrow.  With the leave of the Dáil the further consideration of that Estimate might be postponed until <Col N="675" /> Thursday, during which time I might be able to get here to discuss the Shannon Bill with Senator Sir John Keane. He appears to be the only Senator anxious for a further discussion on the matter.  I would ask the Seanad to remember that I am completely in the hands of the Dáil in this matter.  If the Dáil does not agree to-morrow to postpone the consideration of an Estimate already entered upon, then, of course, I cannot force it to take a course which I would otherwise suggest. If it does indulge me in that to-morrow, and if that Estimate should be postponed until Thursday, then I may be able to get here.  In that event 3 o'clock on Thursday would suit me equally with 2.30.  I am afraid that half an hour would scarcely be sufficient to allow for the discussion here on the Fifth Stage of the Shannon Bill.  Leaving it in that way, I shall do all I can to be here on Thursday, but I am not able to promise that on that day I shall be relieved by the Dáil from going on with my Estimates there.  I am entirely in the hands of the Dáil, and cannot give any assurance that I will be here on Thursday.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;(3)  Any person who shall, after the expiration of two months from the commencement of this Part of this Act, buy any salmon or trout from any person whom he knows or has reason to believe to be selling the same in contravention of this section shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding ten pounds.&rdquo;</P>

      <Col N="679" /> Section 26.  Before sub-section (3) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(3)  Whenever the Minister by an order made under this section alters the boundaries of or subdivides any fishery district or unites two or more fishery districts, or creates a new fishery district, the Minister may by the same order or by a separate order (which he is hereby authorised to make) direct that all or any specified part of the moneys and other assets which at the date of the order are in the hands of the board of conservators of any fishery district affected by the order shall, subject to the liabilities of such board, be disposed of in such manner as the Minister thinks proper to direct and specify in such order, and when any such order is made the moneys and other assets to which it relates shall, subject to the said liabilities, be disposed of accordingly.&rdquo;</P>

The condition of Bills <Col N="681" /> at present progressing through the other House is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The Industrial and Commercial Property (Protection) Bill, 1925 has passed its Second Stage.  It is a Bill in reference to which a Joint Committee has been appointed for a preliminary report.

    <P>There is the Beet Sugar (Subsidy) Bill, and I understand it is likely to reach its final stage to-morrow in the Dáil.  In that event, although it would be a day premature, perhaps it would at the same time be convenient that we should put it on the Agenda for Thursday for Second Stage, because if it is intended that this Bill should pass before we rise we had better get to grips with it as soon as possible.  It will be on the Agenda on Thursday, and if there is no objection raised by any Senator who wishes for further time we might take it.</P>

These two Bills will come before the other House <Col N="682" /> to-morrow.  They are plainly urgent, and I propose to put them in on Thursday for Second Stage.</P>
    <P>There is a Bill called the Adaptation of Charters Bill.  I do not know whether it is urgent or not, but it has not passed Committee of the other House and may not reach us in time this session.</P>
    <P>There is a short Bill dealing with the payment of members of the Oireachtas and dealing with the question of income tax.  It has not yet got beyond the Second Stage, but I understand the Executive Council is anxious at present to dispose of it.</P>
    <P>There is the Local Government (Rates on Agricultural Land) Bill, 1925, which has only passed the Second Reading, and then there is the National Health Insurance Bill which likewise only passed the Second Reading.
