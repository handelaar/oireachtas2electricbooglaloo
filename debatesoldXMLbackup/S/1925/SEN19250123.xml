      <P>I move:&mdash;In Section 3, sub-section (3), line 22, after the word &ldquo;examined,&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;and subjected to a test for tubercular disease.&rdquo;  The amendment gives power to the Minister&mdash;though it does not compel him&mdash;to have bulls tested for tuberculosis.  I consider that in the case of this disease, which is the worst disease, by far, that cattle suffer from, there should be a regulation as to the testing of bulls that are being licensed, to ascertain whether the disease is present or not.  I observe by the section which it is proposed to amend that the Minister &ldquo;may&rdquo; cause these bulls to be inspected and examined.  My amendment increases the power of the Minister and enables him to arrange for a special tubercular test in any cases in which he or his inspector thinks it desirable. I trust the Seanad will accept the amendment and endeavour, by this means, to limit to some extent the ravages of tuberculosis amongst cattle.</P>

      <P>As the clause stands at present, the Minister has the power that it is sought to give him.  The Minister has power under this to have bulls &ldquo;inspected and examined.&rdquo; That would include, of course, examination for tubercular discase, as well as for any other disease.</P>

      <P>There seems to be a misconception as regards the transmissibility of tuberculosis.  If one is to make it incumbent on the Government to examine every bull in the country for tuberculosis, you will be up against two things: first of all the test gives the same result whether the animal is tubercular or not, and secondly, there is the absolutely superfluous nature of the test, in view of the fact that you do not transmit tuberculosis from bull to cow.  The tendency might possibly be the transmission of tuberculosis to a human being&mdash;I suppose that is the reason of this amendment&mdash;by milk, but it is not always provable that you get pulmonary tuberculosis from milk.</P>

      <P>The Senator's amendment does not propose to make this examination compulsory.  It only proposes to give the Minister power to have an examination and to test the presence or absence of this disease if he so wishes.  The amendment does not make the examination compulsory in every case.</P>

      <P>If the intention is to leave it to the Minister's discretion, I think he can be trusted to use his discretion in an economical manner.  As regards eugenics, I would not be opposed to their introduction into this country.  In fact, I would apply them even beyond cattle.  I do not wish to take up the time of the House on a matter which may be safely left to the discretion of the Minister but I question its utility.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE (Mr. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>As you pointed out, A Chathaoirligh, the discretion is there already.  The Inspector may, or may not, have an animal examined and tested for tuberculosis. The question then arises, whether there is any advantage to be derived from putting in specific words to that effect. The power is implied in the Bill. Senator Gogarty touched on a point <Col N="147" /> which has some bearing on this question. The calf from a bull, which would be slightly tubercular, might be a reactor to the test, yet might be absolutely all right.  The test is not infallible, or anything like infallible, and you may give an impression, if you put in specific words in the Bill&mdash;an impression that you do not want to give &mdash;that owners of pedigree herds must have their bulls tested for tuberculosis by this method, and that in any case where there are reactors they will be refused a license.  There might be a good deal of publicity about it, and a lot of good bulls might be sent out of the country for that reason.  In view of the uncertainty of the particular test, and that a bull may be a reactor and at the same time all right, and in view of the fact that the power is there already, if in any case it is thought desirable to use it, I suggest it would be better not to put in these words.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LINEHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the Minister's statement, I ask the leave of the Seanad to withdraw the amendment. In answer to Senator Gogarty, the object of my amendment was certainly, in the first place, to protect human life, but it was also for the purpose of protecting the herds of the country, because I am aware that this disease is most injurious to the cattle of the country.</P>
      <P>Amendment by leave withdrawn.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardButler" hpid="Mr. BUTLER Mr. BUTLER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BUTLER</NameTxt>
      <P>I move to add at the end of section 3, a new sub-section (5) as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(5)  The purchaser of a pure-bred bull or ram from an owner outside the Free State shall, on the production of a certificate from a qualified veterinary surgeon that he is free from disease, be entitled to bring the said bull or ram into the Free State and to get a licence under section 3 of this Act.</P>
      <P>As the Bill stands at present, if a farmer purchases a bull outside the Free State and brings him in without a license he is liable to a penalty.  I think the farmer should have the right to buy a bull outside the Free State, bring him in, and then get a licence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BENNETT</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the amendment, but I think, on account of foot-and-mouth disease being so rife elsewhere, that if we brought in bulls we would have to arrange for quarantine.  Subject to that condition, I think the amendment ought to be accepted.</P>

      <P>I do not think the amendment can stand as it is. If there is a prohibition of imported cattle from England or from Scotland, or from parts of England or Scotland, you could not make an exception in the case of bulls for which a certificate of soundness and freedom from disease is produced.  I do not think the amendment can stand as it is.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel MOORE Colonel MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated in conversation with me one time that he thought it probable that a quarantine station would be established here, so that under certain circumstances cattle could be imported from the other side.  When he is replying, perhaps he would refer to that.</P>

      <P>Would not the difficulty suggested by Senator Sir Nugent Everard be met if the words, &ldquo;subject to the regulations in existence at the time&rdquo; were inserted in the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>This particular amendment is really legislating for something that the Bill is not dealing with.  It is cutting into a very important series of laws and regulations dealing with the importation of cattle from abroad into Ireland.  These regulations are extremely important, and raise very important questions, and I do not think it is sound to interfere with that body of legislation merely as a side wind in a Bill like this.  That is what this amendment does.  There may be considerations which we do not think of at the moment, and which would arise immediately when discussing the specific question of the importation of cattle from England into Ireland, and which we may be interfering with in a way we do not intend by an amendment like this.  Take the amendment as it stands.  It would mean that so long as there is a certificate that the animal is not diseased, he must come in. <Col N="149" /> That immediately interferes with the present procedure, by which not only must we be satisfied that the animal is not diseased, but also that he has not been in contact with diseased animals. It would mean that when you get a certificate that the animal is not diseased you are compelled to issue a licence. When the bull comes over, he may be a bull that would be refused a licence on the ground that his standard of fitness and quality is not up to the mark.  The point that Senator Butler has in mind apparently is, that as the section stands at present a bull which costs £500 or £600 or £1,000 may be landed at the North Wall, and the owner has then an unlicensed bull, and technically commits an offence.  We can meet that point in this way.  An inspection can be made of a valuable bull like that on the other side, or even a licence can be given.  If application is made in respect of a pedigree bull or a bull of that sort a licence can be given, and the bull can be examined at the North Wall, and if he does not come up to the standard the licence may be revoked, so that you can cover the technical offence.  If there is no other point that the Senator wishes to cover except that as the Bill stands you commit a technical offence by importing a bull without a licence, you can get over that point by this procedure of giving a licence for the bull, examining him after he lands, and revoking the licence afterwards, if necessary.  If you can meet that point by that sort of procedure I would suggest that the Senator should not press an amendment which, after all, cuts into the whole code of legislation dealing with the importation of cattle from England to Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel MOORE Colonel MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say something about the quarantine station?  There is one in the North of Ireland, I understand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator asks me to say something about a question which could be debated for hours and hours. It is a very contentious point.  People will say: &ldquo;Why not have a quarantine station here?  You could then have free entry of live stock.&rdquo;  If you have <Col N="150" /> a quarantine station, and you keep your bulls in that quarantine station for the incubation period of foot and mouth disease, then importers of bulls will know exactly where they are when they are purchasing them.  They will know they can bring in the animals provided they are kept for a certain number of hours, days or weeks in the quarantine station.  That is one side of the picture. The other side of the picture is that we cannot take chances, even one in a thousand, of introducing foot and mouth disease here, and if we ever had a quarantine station here, resulting in the free entry of live stock into Ireland, at least as far as the quarantine station, and if an animal was found to be infected in the quarantine station, imagine the confusion it would cause. Probably the ports would be closed for a period.  Perhaps in a few days or a few weeks or months, foot and mouth disease would occur outside the quarantine station.  It would have got out, and everybody would say, perhaps with some truth, that all this came by having a quarantine station here.  A quarantine station means, after all, a quarantine for animals that may be diseased. That is the whole purpose of the station. If, in fact, it fulfils its functions, and if an animal were found diseased, see what might happen.  The infection might get out, or might be taken out by a veterinary surgeon, or by birds. We do not know how it would spread, and you may infect a large part of the country and keep the ports closed for months or weeks.  These are the two sides of the question.  On the one hand it would place the importers of cattle in a position in which they would know when they are buying the exact regulations governing the importation of cattle, and they would know how long they would have to keep the cattle in quarantine.  On the other hand you have the danger of spreading the disease from the quarantine station.  I am not coming to a decision on that question. I leave it to the Seanad.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister have any objection to Senator Butler's amendment if it read: &ldquo;The purchaser of a pure-bred bull or ram from an owner outside the Free State <Col N="151" /> shall, on the production of a certificate from a qualified veterinary surgeon that he is free from disease, and upon such other conditions as the Minister may require&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The only objection I have to it is this.  That seems to cover it, but, on the other hand, this code of regulations dealing with the import of cattle from England to Ireland is very voluminous, highly contentious and very important, and you are really legislating to alter that particular code.  You may be doing it not for any reason which arises out of the import of cattle but to meet the technical point in the Bill.  I think it would not be well to put in an amendment of that sort.  As the Bill stands we can make arrangements to give the licence on the other side to a pedigree bull and we have a free hand to revoke the licence for the bull if it is not up to the standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardButler" hpid="Mr. BUTLER Mr. BUTLER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BUTLER</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be satisfied if the Minister gave permission for a bull to be examined here or on the other side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>What would happen in practice is that they would be landed here and inspected at the North Wall on the ship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardButler" hpid="Mr. BUTLER Mr. BUTLER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BUTLER</NameTxt>
      <P>So long as it is not an offence to bring in a bull I am satisfied.  As the Bill stands it is an offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Undoubtedly it would be an offence if the bull were landed at the North Wall without a licence. A first-class bull is bought in England and landed at the North Wall.  Some one has a bull, to which this Act applies, without a permit.  Therefore, there is a technical offence.  The man is not a criminal yet; he has not been convicted, but we can meet that point by giving a licence without examination. Then we have still a free hand because the bull may be examined and the licence may be revoked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamBarrington" hpid="Mr. BARRINGTON Mr. BARRINGTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BARRINGTON</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of what the Minister said, would not the case be met by leaving it &ldquo;to bring <Col N="152" /> a bull or ram into the Free State&rdquo; so that it would read: &ldquo;who would be free from disease&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. BROWN Mr. BROWN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BROWN</NameTxt>
      <P>Would not the difficulty be met if the Minister undertakes to bring in a regulation that he will issue licences to bulls coming in? The moment the bull comes over here the licence will operate to prevent him committing an offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see any objection to giving that, but there may be some considerations which we will discuss on Report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>That is exactly what I had in my mind because such conditions as may be prescribed will, of course, involve the making of a regulation.  &ldquo;Prescribed&rdquo; is defined under the Act to be prescribed by regulation.  Therefore, if the words were &ldquo;subject to such conditions as may be prescribed,&rdquo; that would cover the point made by Senator Brown, because &ldquo;prescribe&rdquo; means prescribed by regulation.</P>

      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Question&mdash;&ldquo;That Section 3, as amended, stand part of the Bill&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 4.</P>
      <P>(1)  Where the Minister is satisfied that a bull in respect of which a licence has been granted under this Act is&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  calculated to beget defective or inferior progeny, or</P>
      <P>(b)  affected by any contagious or infectious disease, or</P>
      <P>(c)  affected by any other disease or defect prescribed as a disease or defect rendering a bull unsuitable for breeding purposes, the Minister shall revoke the licence granted in respect of such bull.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  Except in the case of a pure-bred bull (entered or eligible for entry in a prescribed herd-book) the property of one person and used exclusively for the service of cows the property of that person, the Minister <Col N="153" /> may at any time suspend or revoke a licence granted by him under this Act if he is satisfied that the bull to which such licence relates is of a breed or type unsuitable for the district in which it is kept.</P>
    <P>The following amendment stood in the name of Colonel Moore:&mdash;&ldquo;In sub-section (2), to delete the sub-section.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel MOORE Colonel MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir JOHN KEANE Sir JOHN KEANE">
      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a similar amendment down, but I do not think the same thing has been debated.  I move to delete sub-section (2).  I should like the Minister to tell us whether he has given any consideration as to the period in which he intends to reinspect and examine these bulls.  If on the strength of these things an owner has certain class of stock in a district and has got a valuable bull which has suddenly overstepped the border line as decreed by the Director-General of Breeding, and that this dangerous tendency has to be checked, this man's valuable bull has to be done away with or removed into another district.  I think that is arbitrary and that compensation should be considered.  He has been given a licence and a certain guarantee that that bull can stand for service.  If some one comes along and prescribes a service I think it is going further than the previous section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir NUGENT EVERARD</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Senator Sir John Keane is making a great mistake not to give power to the Minister to revoke a licence because the use of the bull may show he is inflicting an injury on the cattle of the district and certainly be introducing disease or getting an inferior stock.</P>

      <P>This amendment does not affect the disease section.  The amendment does not in any way take away the power of the Minister to revoke these things for disease.  This method of regulation has gone so far that you get into a maze of regulations and do not know where you <Col N="154" /> stand.  With the consent of the House I withdraw the amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>(3)  A demand for the production of a licence shall be deemed for the purpose of this section to have been made to the holder of the licence if such demand is made verbally at the place where the bull to which the licence relates is kept to any person <Col N="155" /> in the employment of the holder of the licence and having the care, custoday or charge of the bull.</P>

      <P>Section 5, sub-section (1) (c), line 61.  &mdash;After the word &ldquo;bull&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;save where no charge is made for such service.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This section binds a holder of a licence to produce it on certain occasions to certain persons.  I think there is no necessity for the retention of paragraph (c) in the section except in cases where, from time to time, bulls are got for service on the payment of a fee.  There are several cases where farmers send their cows and get the service of a bull free of charge, and I think it would not improve the happy relations that exist between farmers if the owner of the bull was obliged to produce a licence to the man in charge of his neighbour's cow. I suggest the amendment covers the point by omitting the necessity for the production of a licence in any case where the service of the bull is given free.</P>

      <P>He may have the duty, perhaps, of minding the bull or something of that kind, but he may not know whether there was a licence or not for the bull, and he would not be able to furnish the Inspector with the licence.  I think a demand might be made in a more reasonable manner than that, that is, to leave notice at the owner's place that the licence was required to be produced within a certain period after the visit of the Inspector.  I know cases where messages have been given to employees that are never conveyed to the owner. I think this is not necessary because a demand can be made in a much more reasonable way.</P>

      <P>I think there is some point in what Senator Linehan says, though I do not think he is right in asking to delete the sub-section.  It is a little loose and wide when you say, &ldquo;any person in the employment and having the care,&rdquo; etc.  If you said a person who ordinarily has the care, it might meet the case.  I merely throw that out as a suggestion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be sufficient difficulty in the administration of the Act without taking out that provision. If the owner of the bull has the care and management of the animal, you are putting on him the duty of producing the licence on demand.  If he does not happen to be there at the time there is a good excuse.  If he is away, you have to wait until he returns.  So far as the Civic Guard or the Inspectors of the Department are concerned, if the owner of the bull, who has charge of the bull, does not happen to be present, they have to wait until he comes back.  It usually happens that somebody else is in charge.  It may be one man this week, and another man next week.  That, of course, would not occur in the case of a good pedigree herd.  I am taking the case of the ordinary farmer, where the same man would not be in charge of the bull two <Col N="158" /> months consecutively.  In any event, if it is not the owner of the bull that is in charge for the purpose of the section it is somebody else, and he should have the licence.  All this section means is, it puts the onus on the owner of the bull to see to it that whoever is in charge of the bull, whether himself or anybody else, is in a position to produce the licence.</P>

      <P>Sub-section (2), line 42:&mdash;To delete the word &ldquo;a&rdquo; and substitute therefor the word &ldquo;sale.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is rather an important amendment from my point of view.  As the Bill stands, on every sale of a bull you would be compelled to get a new licence which will probably cost 5/-, because the maximum amount under these Acts generally becomes the minimum amount.  There are continual sales of bulls.  Bulls after their period of usefulness passes are sold.  We are told by the Minister that there cannot be any very immediate change from the type of bulls we have to the bulls that are desirable and there must be some bulls, not the very best, kept for a sort of probationery period.  The owner will be compelled to pay a fee of 5/- licence when the bull is sold. That will mean that the practice that existed in the country hitherto of disposing of bulls at the end of their period of service will have to bear an additional burden of 5/-.  The burden heretofore has been very heavy because bulls bought for £20 at the beginning <Col N="162" /> of the period for which they were required have often to be sold at a loss of £10, £12 or £14.  That is a matter of public knowledge and I do not think it is just to inflict upon the owners this further burden of 5/-.  It may be held that this is a fee on transfer just as a man pays a fee on stocks or shares.  It is nothing of the kind.  If a man buys stocks or shares, he is buying something outside his business and it is perfectly just that the State should get an amount of duty that is necessary, but here the man is conducting his business in the ordinary way, just as if a merchant was bringing in so many extra stone of sugar and so many extra chests of tea.  To put a burden on this transaction is to hamper part of the farmer's business.</P>

      <P>Take the specific case of a scrub bull without a licence&mdash;a very bad bull.  There is a licence to fatten, but the owner does not avail of it.  An inspector inspects the bull, and in six or eight months' time he finds the bull has not been fattened, and is incapable of being fattened, but it does serve cows all over the district. The bull is there, and the owner says &ldquo;I am fattening him,&rdquo; and he does give him some hay to eat, and that goes on for a year.  Everyone knows this bull is serving cows all over the district, and the owner refuses to castrate or slaughter.

I think the remainder of the sub-section, from the words &ldquo;a notice&rdquo; down to the end, covers all the points as regards the serving of a notice.  As it stands, the sub-section calls for the service of a notice on the owner of the bull.  I do not know in what manner that notice could be served, either through the post or otherwise, when the owner's name is not given.</P>

      <P>We do not want to be faced with a situation like this: you take action against somebody and that somebody is able to meet you by saying that you have inserted the wrong name. He may say: &ldquo;I am not the owner of the bull; my brother is.&rdquo;  And again, he may say: &ldquo;I am not the owner of the land.&rdquo;  The form that is adopted in the sub-section is quite common in many Acts.  Under the Public Health Acts notices may be served simply by directing them to the owner, without giving him a specific name.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anyway, what harm does it do?  It makes the administration of an Act all the easier.  It will hurt nobody but the person trying to evade the administration of an Act.  Further, it will be more economical and, as I have said, it is common form in a great many Acts.  In many cases actions have been dismissed <Col N="168" /> on very technical grounds; they could be dismissed because the wrong name is inserted on the notice.  Some person might get up and swear: &ldquo;I am not the owner of the land; my brother is.&rdquo; If, as is set out in the sub-section, you deliver a notice to the owner, then whoever is there on the premises has the onus of giving it to the owner or the owner's agent or somebody responsible.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardButler" hpid="Mr. BUTLER Mr. BUTLER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BUTLER</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Immediately before section 13 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(13) The owner of any cow or heifer which has failed to hold service to a bull who sends that cow or heifer to any other bull for service shall notify the owner or person in charge of any such other bull that the cow or heifer in question has failed to hold service.  Any owner failing or neglecting to give such notice as aforesaid shall be liable on summary conviction to a penalty not exceeding £5.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The object of this amendment is to endeavour to stop the spread of abortion. It is well known throughout the country that one of the methods of spreading abortion is the sending of an infected cow from one bull to another. I am quite aware that the owner of a bull has power to refuse service of a cow if he thinks that cow is infected; but a better way of preventing the spread of abortion is to put the onus on the owner or the person in charge of the cow or heifer to tell the owner of the bull that the cow or heifer is infected, and has failed to hold service. It will, in my opinion, to some degree prevent the spread of abortion.</P>

      <P>I desire also to support the amendment.  It is a well-known fact that, if cows abort at all, they are liable to do so within three months of the period of service, and if they are brought to another bull they are always certain to infect that bull.  Then the difficulty is that that bull may convey the infection to a great number of cows.  Something in the nature of what the Senator proposes ought to be inserted, because I know that the case is a very urgent one. There should be some deterrent to the bringing of a cow that has aborted through the country to various bulls. Doing so may do irretrievable injury in that part of the country.</P>

      <P>There appears to be some danger in this amendment.  It is based on the assumption that every cow that refuses to hold service is suffering from abortion.  That may not be a fact.  It is quite possible the fault may be due to the bull.  It is not right that that doctrine should be accepted. The owner of a cow may seek the service of a bull for another reason altogether, because the previous bull might be in default.  The owner of the second bull may refuse the service of his animal.  He may say to the owner of the cow: &ldquo;No; you failed with the previous bull, and therefore I shall not allow you the service of my bull.&rdquo;  I think that is a very serious aspect of the case.  The amendment is based on the assumption that contagious abortion is the sole and only reason why cows fail to hold service.  Every farmer knows that that is not the fact.  Cows frequently fail to hold service because the bull is not fertile.</P>

      <P>Senator Keane's objection can be met by disinfecting the animal.  It has been met that way before and I do not see why it cannot be done again.  I do not see why this disinfection cannot be resorted to in the case of the bull.  I believe it would meet the point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Senator Sir John Keane's point is that this particular amendment presumes definitely that if a cow has failed to hold service, it is because of contagious abortion. I do not think the matter goes as far as that at all.  The amendment provides that the owner of a cow may say formally to the owner of the bull that the cow has failed to hold service.  It will then be for the owner of the bull to bear that fact in his mind and to consider what he is to do; that is to say, to judge whether the cow has aborted or whether it is failure to hold service.  I agree with the general principle but, under the Diseases of Animals Act, we have already power to make regulations to that effect.  I think it is hardly sound to introduce into an Act of the Oireachtas a provision which is already in existence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but the Act is. We have power to issue such an Order as has been issued under the English regulations.  Under the Diseases of Animals Act, 1894 to 1914, regulations entitled &ldquo;Prohibition of service without notification&rdquo; have been issued. These regulations were issued by the British Ministry of Agriculture, and we can make similar regulations.  They would be to the effect that it shall not be lawful to send a cow or heifer which, to the knowledge of the owner of that cow or heifer, has calved prematurely within two months immediately preceding, unless the owner shall give notice in writing to the owner of the bull that such cow or heifer calved prematurely.  We have power to issue an Order to that effect already.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NugentEverardBart" hpid="Sir NUGENT EVERARD Sir NUGENT EVERARD">
      <NameTxt>Sir NUGENT EVERARD</NameTxt>
      <P>The danger is that the cow may not be noticed to have aborted within the three <Col N="172" /> months preceding.  Very often all that the owner of a cow knows is that the cow or heifer has failed to hold service. I do not think it would be very arbitrary legislation to say that the owner of the bull must get notice that the cow has broken service.  If that happened, say, within a month, it would be for the owner of the bull to judge and take his chances.  But if the owner of the bull is told that it is three months since the service, he begins to suspect and, perhaps very rightly, he would not allow his bull to serve.  I think there ought to be penalties for concealing the date on which the cow last got service.</P>

      <P>If the Minister intends to issue the regulation, I agree that this amendment is unnecessary. This is a live-stock breeding Bill, and this amendment deals with cows which are liable to contagious abortion.  I say that unless the regulation is issued as read, or as altered to suit Ireland, then I think the mover of this amendment can very legitimately call upon the Seanad to pass the amendment.  But if the Minister says that he will issue that regulation, then there is an end to the matter.  However, that is a very drastic regulation.  This is a live-stock breeding Bill and we are trying to improve live-stock and to prevent disease from entering our herds.  We want to improve the breed of our cattle.

      <P>I wish to move: Before Section 18 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;On and after the appointed day it shall not be lawful for any person to have in his possession any calf more than twenty-one days old which has not been treated in the prescribed manner to prevent the horns from growing except such person is authorised by licence or permit under this Act to keep such calf.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not particularly in favour of this form of words, but if the principle is accepted I am satisfied to leave it to the Minister and his draftsman to construe the amendment in any form which would best meet the requirements. It would be well if the Seanad, in considering this amendment, would remember that at the present time it is against the law to dis-horn cattle, and except we are going to lose what is known in the trade as the polly trade, which is a very important one, we must either accept this amendment or do away with that particular trade.  It is against the law to poll any mature cattle except under an anaesthetic. That being so, I wish to point out the advantage to the trade in polled cattle, and the advantage of having all cattle de-horned, which is a simple process. It could be done when the calf is from three days to three weeks old by the simple application of caustic.  Two rubbings, I understand, are sufficient to prevent horns from growing.  In the case of dis-horning mature cattle everybody admits that there is a certain amount of cruelty, as well as its being against the law.  The polly trade is a very important branch of our store cattle industry. Thirty per cent. of the store cattle exported are pollies, and our best customers in England and, particularly, Scotland will not have horned animals owing to the way they feed these in the winter.  Polled cattle are worth from <Col N="177" /> £1 to £2, in some cases, a head more than cattle of the same quality and weight with horns.  I may be permitted to read a few extracts from a letter received from the manager of Thomas Nelson and Sons, one of the biggest auctioneering and distributing firms in Scotland:&mdash;&ldquo;I am very pleased to learn that there is a movement in hand to try and remedy the disastrous waste, both in money and worry, through the bruising of Irish cattle in transit from Ireland to here.  I have always maintained that, with dehorning of all fat and store cattle being made compulsory, the solution of bruised cattle is practically solved.  In conversation with several of the principal meat market buyers, and also some extensive country buyers, we find that they estimate the damage at about ½d. per lb., overhead, which works out roughly at £1 10s. per head, and that has to be deducted somehow off the price of an Irish animal.  We ourselves handle round 45,000 Irish cattle and 6,000 Canadians per annum, so you can imagine the enormous wastage incurred through the bruising of Irish cattle. Some of our best buyers insist on buying Canadian cattle when available. Although about twelve days on the voyage they are landed in such good condition that it is unknown to have a bruised or damaged carcase.  About ninety per cent. of the Canadians we have sold have been polled, which is also the principal reason for the farmers buying so many of them. About seventy per cent. of the cattle fed here are accommodated in courts or boxes, and farmers won't buy horned cattle for that purpose at any price. You will have done a great service to the Irish cattle trade if you succeed in influencing the carrying out of this most important project, and we will await with interest to hear from you.&rdquo; I could quote several instances on the same lines, but I think that that extract is sufficient, and that it explains to a great extent the argument in favour of dehorning.  There are several other reasons why we should have all our cattle polled.  A big percentage of our cattle are bred in the South, and they move around a good deal, even in Ireland. Many of these cattle from the <Col N="178" /> South go to the West, and from the West to the Midlands, and about seventy-five per cent. are exported. Even for the purpose of transit, you can put one beast more in a waggon of polled cattle of the same size than of horned cattle.  Again, if a polled beast falls down it will have a chance of righting itself, whereas in the case of horned cattle it will have to lie there, as it cannot get up, and in some case it will be much bruised.  In the case of feeding animals in a field in the ordinary way with hay, anyone can notice a vicious beast, and see how it can upset a whole lot of cattle by going from one end of the place to the other, and horning every other beast away, and destroying the fodder.  That proves that polled cattle thrive much better than horned cattle.  I hope that I have said sufficient to secure the support of the Seanad for this amendment.</P>

      <P>I have great sympathy with this amendment.  We know that there is great cruelty in dehorning cattle and that it is being done, in spite of it being against the law.  At the same time it is hardly possible that this amendment could be carried as it stands.  Take the case of a dairy farmer.  I use caustic potash on all the calves I possibly can, but I cannot use it in every case.  The amendment refers to calves but to do it on all heifer calves would ruin the dairy trade.  A person who goes in for breeding has a certain number of bull calves but he cannot say at first which of them he will keep.  If it is made compulsory to dishorn all of them a man would have to decide, when they are dropped, which of them he will dishorn.</P>

      <P>I strongly support the suggestion of Senator Counihan, and would ask the Minister to co-operate as much as possible in passing some legislation whereby no beast in this country should be allowed to develop horns. Apart altogether from the loss, estimated at £1,000,000 yearly, it means a further loss of condition on animals crossing the Channel.  There is also the very important consideration of cruelty.  A nation is more or less <Col N="179" /> regarded as humane and advanced by its efforts to remove from the dumb animals the weight of suffering which we have to inflict on them on account of meat eating, which the climate that we live in necessitates.  It is no evasion of suffering to give a mature animal an anaesthetic and then remove the horns.  I would go further and suggest that some steps should be taken to prevent the castration of any bulls that have reached maturity. They should be slaughtered in preference. An anaesthetic is only an easy means to evade acute suffering, but nothing will evade the pain an animal will suffer for four or five weeks while the mucous of the horn is being absorbed.  It is a very simple process to prevent the formation of horns in calves.  The horn is only a form of the hair, and if chemicals or caustic were applied when the horn is undeveloped, and under the epidermis, it is no more painful that the pain many of us have suffered in removing warts from the skin.  The necessity for preventing cruelty to the animals is, perhaps, in this country more evident than in the neighbouring one.  If an animal is allowed to grow, its condition suffers from the process of dishorning. Evidently from what Senator Counihan has said, and from his experience, the future lies with dishorned cattle. Senator MacLysaght's point about cattle being allowed to develop horns I cannot follow.  I suggest that the Ministry should co-operate in preventing the breeding of horned cattle, first of all to save money, and secondly, to save the nation's face as regards humanitarianism.</P>

      <P>I am sure that we all appreciate the motives of Senator Gogarty in support of this amendment.  Humanity, of course, enters into it, and the mover of the amendment has given expression to those views.  I think his talk is mainly about bullocks.  As far as heifers are concerned, as Senator MacLysaght has pointed out, it would ruin our springer trade.  It would certainly injure it very considerably, because we must bear in mind that artificial dishorning, what you call &ldquo;sculling,&rdquo; is looked upon <Col N="180" /> with suspicion in England for one particular reason.  In England they consider that it is used for the purpose of concealing the age of the animal.  The age is generally known by rings on the horns, and if the horns are sawn off the test of age is gone.  Of course people could look into the mouth of an animal, but it is not every farmer could tell the age of an animal by its teeth. It seems to be left out of account altogether that there are certain pedigree herds of horned cattle.  If they were dishorned they would be put out of the show rings of the world, unless a general licence was given to the owners of pedigree herds that they need not consider themselves bound by this ordinance to dishorn their herds with caustic potash or caustic soda.  It seems to me that you inflict great hardships on people who purchase calves if they have to dishorn them within twenty-one days.  I presume that is the period during which you must use the caustic to remove the core of the horn.  That means that you could not put this legislation into force without due notice, say, six months.  I doubt very much if it would be wise to pass the amendment. With adequate safeguards it might, possibly, be provided under a new section, to be brought up on the Report Stage, but, as the Bill stands now.  I do not think the amendment judicious.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasBennett" hpid="Mr. BENNETT Mr. BENNETT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BENNETT</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish also to oppose the amendment.  Horns were given to cattle for some purpose by nature and we should not attempt to meddle with the decrees of nature.  Because the polly trade with England would be benefited is no reason why we should legislate to that effect.  If the polly cattle are necessary we can produce them with absolute certainty by using a Polled-Angus bull.  I should think that 95 or 98 per cent. of Polled-Angus cattle have no horns.  If we require polled cattle let us go about it in an honest way and not by a back-door method. It is all very well to say that to poll cattle is wrong.  I never had a polled beast, and I hope I never will, but, at the same time, I do not think it can be said to be child's play to take a baby calf and go around the horns applying caustic.  I have known cases where sore <Col N="181" /> heads followed, and in the hands of inexperienced persons there is a danger that sore heads would occur.  To do that on a poor helpless calf seems grossly unfair.  Instead of being a relief it is, I think, an infliction.  For these reasons, and because I think we have inflicted enough compulsion under the Bill on the farmer, I oppose the amendment.  If cattle traders say that the industry will go out of existence if every beast is not polled, then I am sure the experts will produce a type of cattle having no horns.  I do not think we should resort to compulsion in this matter.</P>

      <P>This amendment, in its present form, is quite impracticable unless you are going to do injustice to pedigree breeders.  If you are going to force them to dishorn their cattle you must compensate them, as you would ruin all their herds.  I support the suggestion of Senator Sir Nugent Everard, that the matter might be considered before the Report Stage, by introducing some practical amendment. The most that can be done is to order the cauterising of half-bred stock.  You could not force any person, even under the Department's dairying scheme, to cauterise either heifers or bull calves. What about all those calves and cattle that are running semi-wild?  This amendment would be impracticable. You have got to realise facts and you have many practical difficulties to contend with.  You have bulls running wild with heifers and you have all these calves born.  I can quite understand that Senator Counihan feels strongly the injury that is being done to the cattle trade, and that Senator Gogarty appreciates the other point of view. But you have got to look at these things in a practical light, and the voluntary method of dealing with them is the only practical method.  If people will not see the necessity for this, it is very little use for the Government to try to coerce them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">

      <P>There can be no question of dishorning female calves&mdash; pedigree or non-pedigree&mdash;or calves which are to be kept as bulls.  You would be free as regards them.  There <Col N="182" /> being no question of dishorning calves to be kept as bulls, that would exclude automatically all pedigree herds from the provision.  I agree with Senator Counihan, subject to that qualification. It would, undoubtedly, be a big advantage&mdash;I do not like to put it in terms of money&mdash;to have all the bullocks of the country dishorned. Probably, it would be worth from 10/- to £1 per head.  That would represent nearly £1,000,000 a year.  That is my view at the moment, and I have given some consideration to the matter.</P>
      <P>But can you introduce such a provision in a Bill of this sort?  This is a Bill &ldquo;to make a provision for the regulation and improvement of bulls and other live stock used for breeding.&rdquo; The purpose of this Bill is to improve stock for breeding purposes. In the Bill introduced, there is no provision for any other purpose.  You can improve cattle by feeding them and in a number of other ways, but the sole purpose of this Bill is to improve the breeding qualities of cattle and other live stock.  Hence, I am afraid the suggested amendment would be outside the scope of the Bill.  You would not improve or disimprove the breeding qualities of stock by dishorning them.  Dishorning has no more to do with their breeding qualities than the feeding of them.  The question arises, whether it is sound procedure at this stage to widen the scope of the Bill.  I think everybody will agree that it hardly is sound procedure.</P>

      <P>Senator Bennett would not have any cattle dishorned. The horns, he says, were put on by nature for some useful purpose.  I suppose that in the early days they <Col N="183" /> were put on for fighting purposes or for the purposes of defence.  But if the Senator's contention, that they must have some useful purpose at the present time, be true, why should thousands of cattle in the Free State be dishorned at a mature stage? There must be some advantage in dis-horning. It has been proved by every man who knows anything about the trade that store cattle, for export to England and Scotland, are worth from £1 to £2 more per head when dishorned. That is a consideration which the Minister for Agriculture should take into account.</P>

This Bill was drafted, as all Bills must be drafted, very carefully and on the assumption that it was dealing with a special problem.  On that assumption, the different portions hang together. If we were to alter the whole scope of the Bill at this stage, it would be slovenly legislation and it would be setting a very bad precedent.</P>

      <P>May I suggest that the very reason which the Senator gave&mdash;that dishorning increases the value of the cattle&mdash;ought to be a sufficient inducement, without introducing legislation.  The fact that the value of bullocks is increased by the removal of the horns, which cannot be done now by means of a saw, would impress itself, I think, on the mind of anybody having a calf that he desired to sell as a store beast, and he would remove the horns with caustic.  I think that the mere publication of the enormous advantages of dishorning at an early age would probably accomplish the object which Senator Counihan has in view, which is to increase the value of our store cattle.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. COUNIHAN Mr. COUNIHAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. COUNIHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Against the argument that has been used as regards dis-horning of calves, I desire to point out that the cattle do not come into the possession of the people concerned until they are matured&mdash;at 1½ years or 2 <Col N="184" /> years old.  It would be impossible for those to have a stock of polly cattle except they used the saw, as the case stands at present.  For the last 20 years the Department has been circulating pamphlets advocating the dis-horning of calves and a great percentage of the cattle of the country are treated in that way.  That, I think, answers the argument about propaganda. If the Minister will consider the matter and bring it up again on the Report Stage, I will be satisfied.  Even if he would provide only for the compulsory dishorning of all male calves, I would be satisfied to accept that.  There would, of course, be exceptions, and these could be provided for by licences or permits from the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Look at what that involves !  The intention is to dishorn all the calves of the country, with certain exceptions.  Senators will agree that it would be necessary to define very carefully what these exceptions would be.  It is a very big question.  Personally, I think it would be a sound proceeding, subject to certain limitations and subject to getting over certain administrative difficulties.  But it is a very big step.  There is a considerable volume of opinion in favour of it. It would have to be consulted.  There would have to be a number of conferences before any such step could be taken.  You would have to discuss the matter with every interest affected, and you would have to discuss the machinery.  You would be doing something that would have very serious results if you did it wrongly.  There can be no doubt about that.  What I protest against is introducing a question like that at this stage and in connection with a Bill with which it has nothing to do.  If a Bill dealing with the treatment of cattle generally were introduced in the Dáil, such a provision as that proposed would get three or four days' debate&mdash;it would be entitled to that&mdash;and the Seanad I am sure would also devote three or four days to it.  The various interests throughout the country would have had notice of the intention, and they would have got busy in connection with their own interests and sent up suggestions to the Department of Agriculture and to <Col N="185" /> Deputies.  It is too important a matter to be dealt with casually at the end of a Bill which really has nothing to do with it.  In addition, there is the technical objection that it is outside the scope of the Bill, and I submit that it would be slovenly legislation to bring it within the scope of the Bill by changing the title.</P>
      <P>I dare say it will be necessary soon to introduce legislation in regard to the treatment of cattle generally. There is a conference being called of the railway companies, the shipping companies, and traders with regard to the treatment of cattle in transit and in regard to their condition when they reach England.  It may be necessary to introduce legislation as a result of that conference.  If such legislation were introduced, we could consider this matter, and we would have the advantage of the views of the conference as to whether such a clause was necessary.  If necessary, a clause could be carefully prepared and the necessary exemptions and exceptions and administrative arrangements could be settled.</P>

Let us see for an instant what will happen with regard to boars and rams.  Under section 11 an inspector or member of the Dublin Metropolitan Police or the Civic Guard can inspect and examine at all reasonable times any boar or ram in the Free State.  Well, you are asking them to do a great deal.  As I said on the Second Reading, you expect our Civic Guard, who have to discharge numerous duties, under great difficulties in some parts, to poke their noses into every stye in Ireland, and to perambulate our fields seeing that the proper rams are running with the right kind of ewes.  I have the greatest respect for the Government and our young Ministers, but I really wish they would moderate their zeal a little bit. There has been a flood of domestic legislation.  I knew it was coming. We have had to deal with a flood of domestic legislation, and I wish they would stick to the cattle.  There is a penalty with regard to this section because this question of boars and rams <Col N="187" /> has to be dealt with, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>, in the same way as the cattle are dealt with.  Any person who shall obstruct or impede an inspector or member of the Dublin Metropolitan Police or the Civic Guard in the discharge of these duties may be mulcted in the sum of £10.</P>

      <P>He may be fined in any sum up to £10.  If a man finds an inspector in plain clothes poking about his premises and says: &ldquo;What in earth are you doing here interfering with my business; get out of it&rdquo;; the inspector may take that very badly and complain of the fellow and have him up.  He is quite liable to be fined, because he is impeding and obstructing, and he may use strong language, and that might be put into the summons, too.  Then the Minister may order the slaughter and castration of rams and boars, too.  I consider that our Ministers had much better stick to the cattle, that we have been discussing in this Bill.  I cannot make out why on earth they put in boars or rams. I cannot make out what is the object of, as the Minister just said, widening the scope of the Bill.  I think this is a tremendous widening of the scope of the Bill and that it was an afterthought. They said: &ldquo;Now we have got an excellent Bill.  Let us chuck in the sheep and pigs.&rdquo;  The same regulations that are applied to cattle are going to apply to the boars and rams. I can see that they will have great difficulty.  We heard yesterday a great deal about the Kerry bull and the Kerry cow.  They have become almost as sacred in the Minister's eyes as cattle are in the Hindoo religion. The County Limerick is also a sacred district, but I think there are some disbelievers down there, from what I heard yesterday.  I, therefore, beg to move this amendment, and I shall be very anxious to hear what the Minister has to say in regard to the inclusion of these two very useful creatures in his cattle Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>There are obvious advantages in extending, at least <Col N="188" /> some of the provisions of the Bill, to boars.  We export about seven or eight million pounds worth of bacon and live pigs annually, and I hope we will export twice as much.  We will probably have to rely on our bacon trade in the future more than we have had in the past and it will be an advantage, I am sure, to be in a position to licence boars.  There are not many boars in the country.  It would be almost as easy to administer that part of the Bill as to administer the part dealing with the licensing of bulls.  At the same time there is a large number of scrub boars in the country, though not as high a percentage as of scrub bulls. Still they are there in great numbers, particularly in the poorer districts. We are always making arrangements by which we buy boars at a fairly considerable price and sell them at a small, or a reasonable price, within the reach of any poor man.  In that way we can avoid any hardship which might be caused by reason of insisting on boars up to a certain standard.  We can supply them at reasonable prices. If that can be done, with very little hardship, and if the bacon trade is so important, why should we not improve it with the aid of this Bill as we are improving our cattle industry?  I do not see any particular reason why it should be exclusively confined to cattle.</P>
      <P>I do agree it does not appear very plain as to how we can apply it to sheep or rams, but no one can answer for six or seven years hence.  There may be sections which the Consultative Council, and everybody concerned in fact, would think could be very usefully applied to rams.  It would be a pity to have to introduce a new Bill to meet that contingency.  I think all the arguments are in favour of giving us an opportunity of doing for the bacon trade and for the sheep trade, what in fact we are able to do under the Bill for the cattle trade.</P>

      <P>The Minister asked why we should not improve the bacon trade.  The Department of Agriculture are quite capable of dealing with that matter.  He said there were not many boars in the country but there were scrub boars.  We have got an excellent Department of Agriculture, <Col N="189" /> a Department that can, without contradiction, be said to be the best in the world.  I have been told so on the other side.  You have got a Department you should be proud of and they are quite capable of dealing with that matter.  The Minister has already admitted there is a difficulty with regard to rams.  I quite agree with him.  I myself think that it is a pity that he should have introduced boars and rams into this Bill, because there are penalties, there are inspections, and there are also great duties imposed on the Civic Guard.  A number of inspectors have to be paid and their duties will be quite onerous enough to deal with the cattle trade which is a most important industry. I do not know what the Seanad thinks about the matter and I should like to hear some other Senator who is a bigger farmer than myself say a word on this matter.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That in the opinion of the Seanad the time is now opportune for the appointment by the Government of a Committee of experts to examine and report upon the question of introducing an improved system of public accountancy as requested by unanimous resolution of this House on 28th November, 1923.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am going to confine my remarks mainly to justifying this necessity which, I think, cannot be very obvious or clear to the Government inasmuch as they allowed this matter to remain in abeyance for so long.  I might also remind the Minister that he gave an assurance to this House&mdash;I have not the Official Report by me, but I think it was on the Appropriation Bill&mdash;that the matter <Col N="190" /> was receiving his consideration, and that action might within a reasonable time be expected.  I do not confine myself to these as his exact words, but he said he was going to do something in the matter.  As far as one with no inside knowledge can see, nothing has been done.  We all think our own subjects are more important than other subjects.  It strikes me this is a dull matter, but one of infinite importance in regard to all control of Government expenditure which is engaging so much attention at the present time, which must continue to engage attention and on which, moreover, the Minister must carry public opinion if he is going to do any real good. Public opinion must be enlightened and must be able to inform itself on those questions of public finance and my case is it cannot inform itself. There have been some unfortunate and erroneous statements made in public lately and they are justified by the fact that it is so hard to find out facts for oneself.  Everything is obscure and public opinion is so misled by confusing figures that I defy any intelligent and diligent student of public finance really to know what is happening in detail.  He sees general estimates, totals.  The totals are not sufficient for criticism.  If you are going to examine expenditure in detail you must have detailed figures.  I submit that our detailed figures are most misleading and it is not fair to the public that they should be so misled when the Government really, by very simple changes, can make the matter much clearer.  I take this recently issued publication, &ldquo;The Finance Accounts of the Saorstát,&rdquo; I would first of all point out that these are issued under the Statute of 1854.  Of that I will read the operative words: &ldquo;shall, in each year, cause such accounts to be laid before both Houses of Parliament on or before the 30th day of June if Parliament be sitting, or if Parliament be not sitting, within 14 days after the next meeting of Parliament.&rdquo;  These accounts did not appear until some day in December, about six months late.  They contain most important information, confused though it may be.  Any student of our public finances should have that information <Col N="191" /> promptly and there is no reason for exceeding that statutory period in which this document should be produced by six months.  I say there is no justification because these are practically all figures that must be available at the end of the financial year.  They are merely totals.  As far as I can see, there is no additional work on them at all.  They are merely totals on which the Minister must frame his estimate for the current year and it seems to be due to nothing but laxity on the part of the finance branch that this publication should be so much delayed.  When we come to examine this publication I would like to justify my statement that the accounts are confusing.  You see under the heading of receipts that the Post Office receipts would amount practically to two millions.  On the other side, you see the Post Office costing the sum of two and a half millions approximately. Why cannot the Minister in the case of these accounts keep the Post Office quite separate and only bring into the statement of receipts and issues the net deficit or surplus of our Post Office? It would be far clearer, and one would see in that case that there was a loss on the Post Office or a profit, as the case may be.  I wish to draw the attention of the House to Account No. 23, which is called &ldquo;A statement showing the application of the balances of grants of ways and means remaining un-issued on the 1st of April, and of the grants for the year 1922-23.&rdquo;  This is a very peculiar account.  I have gone through those accounts up to 21, and I think I am right in saying that they represent cash transactions.  That is the basis of our Government accounts, &mdash;cash transactions,.  Every one of those previous entries represents a cash figure, but when you come to Account No. 23 you get into a different region of accounting for the only and almost first time; that is credits.</P>
    <P>It is almost impossible for anybody who has not a very intimate knowledge of what this means, to understand it at all.  I personally do not profess to understand it in its entirety.  I see that a totally different aspect of accounting is introduced here, with no <Col N="192" /> explanation of the method under which the Exchequer puts the Ways and Means Account, or whatever the technical term is, into funds by the creation of certain credits.  On those credits departments draw and unexpended balances are &ldquo;written off,&rdquo; a term I have never seen used before&mdash; it is generally &ldquo;surrendered.&rdquo;  Anyhow, whatever it may be, none of them represents cash at all.  They represent a special credit account, and anybody who examines that account in the light of all other previous accounts will be most confused as to what is intended.  I do not wish to go outside the question of accounting except to say that an examination of these accounts reveals a very large measure of over-estimating, which, I have no doubt, the Minister can, with some justification, plead is due to the difficulties of the times and the uncertain state of policy generally.</P>
    <P>There is one other point within that account which also calls for explanation: that is how the issues have been made in the year 1923-24 out of 1922-23 surpluses.  I understood that all surpluses remaining over at the end of the financial year were surrendered automatically, by law.  In this case there appears to have been certain issues made out of unexpended balances, issues of £11,000.</P>
    <P>We come to another most confusing account, No. 27.  It is an account purporting to show the capital liabilities and assets of the State.  In assets there is no item included for local loans, which is an illustration of how imperfect and confusing the thing is.  Local loans are assets, and should appear as such.  The local authorities are liable, and in due course the loans will be repaid. Surely such a figure is an asset. Similarly all Government buildings, stores, and capital expenditure of a realisable nature, are assets.  Under our present system of crudely dealing with cash items, they do not come within our purview.  I am going in a minute to deal with the expenditure aspect of our accountancy.</P>
    <P>There has been considerable public interest taken in this question of land purchase annuities, and I defy anybody, however diligent and experienced <Col N="193" /> he may be, to trace the sequence of these land purchase annuities through these various figures.  The conclusions appear clearly in the Miscellaneous Revenue.  That, I submit, in the first place, is misleading, or rather lacking in lucidity.  A sum of four million pounds odd is called miscellaneous. That includes two millions paid by the British Government towards their share of compensation, and it includes one and a quarter millions approximately for land purchase annuities.  If these accounts are to be clear, large sums like that should be set out separately and not lumped up as Miscellaneous Revenue&mdash;although in Account 13 details are given.  But the Post Office has a special heading of its own.  Small sums for Excess Profits Tax have a separate heading.  These much bigger sums should also be separately set out if lucidity is to be the purpose and aim of the Government.  With regard to the expenditure and the payment to the Land Commission, that is where the difficulty arises.  When you look under Supply Services you see that under Vote 60 a sum of a million and a quarter approximately has been issued out of a total grant of three millions. That would certainly confuse anybody, that a grant of three millions was made for Land Commission annuities of which only one million odd was drawn upon.  Then seeking other information with regard to Land Commission annuities, one finds that the Government issued a statement, through their Publicity Department, in which the following occurred: &ldquo;Also, contrary to Mr. Dillon's statement, the payment to the British Government in respect of Land Commission annuities is included in the expenditure side of the Exchequer statement under the head Supply Services.&rdquo;  That is to say, what I have referred to.  Then it goes on to say: &ldquo;This is readily ascertainable by reference to the published volume of detailed estimates&rdquo;&mdash;a totally different book, of course, from the expenditure volume where provision for the payment is shown as a distinct sub-head to the Vote for local loans.  I have examined these votes for local loans and they certainly do not, as far as I can see, include any item specifically <Col N="194" /> set out as Land Commission annuities. Further, it is not possible by implication, to discover that they include Land Commission annuities at all, because they do not include a sum large enough.  One million was paid for Land Commission annuities.  This estimate only includes repayment to the British Government of sums due in respect of loans from the British Local Loans Fund outstanding from the office of Public Works on 1st April, 1922.  Looking at another subhead we find: &ldquo;Repayment to British Government in respect of loans from the British Local Loans Fund (Land Law Ireland Acts, 1881-1888) outstanding from the Irish Land Commission on 1st April, 1923.&rdquo;  That amounts to an annual sum of £210,000.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission annuities run to well over £1,000,000.  Obviously the Local Loans Fund does not include anything for Land Commission annuities in the year 1924-25.  If I take the year previous I find the same thing. The Local Loans Fund represents quite a small sum.  Repayments to the British Government, as the sum due in respect of local loans outstanding, is down as a £1,000,000.  If that includes Land Commission annuities, surely it should be distinctly stated.  Local loans outstanding are not Land Commission annuities, and no intelligent person could be asked to assume that they are.  If they are, it should be so stated.  On that I base my case that the accounts are not clear.  Further, I say that these points I have dealt with here do not necessitate any committee of experts or special investigation at all.  They could be done straight away by an order in the Minister's own Department, merely by grouping these things in a manner so that they can be more readily understood. This point, surely, cannot be controversial.</P>
    <P>I now approach the other question which, of course, is a much bigger one: the arrangement of our expenditure of accounts on a basis which will show the true cost of each Department and which, when sub-divided, will conform with spheres of responsibility.  Take the common case of the Army.  We are spending, roughly, ten millions a year on the Army.</P>

      <P>The figure is three and a half millions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir JOHN KEANE Sir JOHN KEANE">
      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>At one time we did spend £10,000,000.  The only reliable information one can get in connection with the Army accounts is in the estimates.  The estimates, I need hardly say, are based in theory and in practice on the form of the accounts should follow the estimates. The Army is grouped under headings such as pay of officers, gratuities, marriage and dependents' allowances, medicines, wages, stores, etc.  None of these classifications in any way conforms to the units  spheres of individual responsibility.  The Army is not organised in terms of pay.  It is not organised in terms of medicine, or in terms of petrol, or oil, or clothing, but it is organised in terms of companies, battalions, brigades, hospitals, transport companies, supply companies, headquarters office, and so on.  All these should be groupings of accounting. If that were done, then you would be able to say to a battalion commander, &ldquo;Your battalion is costing so much and the cost is made up of a number of sub-heads.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another battalion doing almost the same work is costing more or less, made up under similar heads. I do not mean that you should then say to the battalion commander that is costing more: &ldquo;Your battalion is inefficient because it costs more than the other.&rdquo;  I hope that no one will take me up like that.  But what I do urge is that if such a system is put into operation you will then be able to make comparisons between the cost of different battalions in terms of units and of personal responsibility, and you will be able to bring home, if occasion requires, personal extravagances which you cannot possibly do now.  The way the control is exercised now is in terms of regulations.  If you want to control food, you make numerous regulations in regard to dietary, the inspection of kitchens, refuse heaps, and so forth. That is absolutely fatal to any real control.  Real control, I suggest, is only to be obtained by accounting <Col N="196" /> which shows the cost and investigates the reasons for a difference in cost.  I have taken the Army because it is a large spending Department and illustrates my point best, but the same principle should run through all Government accounting.  Every Department should contain its whole and true cost, rates, interest on capital, whatever it may be, and all services. Then you will be able to bring home to the responsible spending officials any extravagance that they may commit and you will also be able to give them credit for any economies they may make.</P>
    <P>This, I may tell the Seanad, is not my invention at all.  It is a method that has been recommended by very eminent authorities.  It was recommended by the Commission presided over by Sir Herbert Samuel and adopted with considerable success in England.  I say with all sense of responsibility, the difficulty of getting this done lies with the permanent officials. I know intimately the history of this whole thing in England.  We have had a most eminent authority, Sir Edward Lawrence, who, after investigation, endorsed this method.  It is largely due to the inertia of Government officials that no change has been made. It is not deliberate.  I do not say that there is any turpitude or malice, but when you find that you are bound up with orders and when you have lived under a certain system for thirty years or so, you get wedded to that system, and you cannot see any advantage coming from any change.</P>
    <P>I notice that the Minister for Finance left some moments ago.  I am afraid he has been suddenly called away, and if that is so, I should be very pleased to accommodate him.  I do not want to develop the subject much longer, but I should like to hear what the Minister has to say about it and obtain from him some assurance that something will be done but not done in a hurry.  I hope that something will be done deliberately to explore the whole question, and to place our national accounts on a satisfactory basis.  I need hardly say that the thing need not be rushed.  In my opinion the best thing would be <Col N="197" /> to begin with the Local Government accounts.  They would not upset things very much.  They are more self-contained, perhaps, than the accounts of any other Department.  If a good beginning were made in that Department, it could be extended when opportunity offered to other Departments. I beg to move the motion standing in my name.</P>

      <P>I think it is the desire of the Minister to speak on this motion, and I imagine he will be back in a short time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir JOHN KEANE Sir JOHN KEANE">
      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case, perhaps I may go on until the Minister returns, because I had not said all that I had intended to say on this motion.</P>
      <P>I wish to illustrate how this method would work in the case of county homes.  In the case of the county homes there is a most elaborate method of control over expenditure in which there are column rulings, and sub-columns divided up into a most complicated state in which even items, like pepper and salt, are brought under the control of the inspector and the auditors.  Now, the real method is to take the question of cost and to set out all this food, not in items but in terms of cost, and to bring that cost into terms of patient or inmate per day.  There are so many persons resident in a home for so many days and the thing is to work out the cost so much per day per resident. Then you get at once a comparison figure that will enable you to make a comparison between the cost of a home in one county and the homes in adjoining counties, and if you get a good administrator, or master, or whatever the official may be called in one home, you will get a controlling figure which you might reasonably expect or a figure which if much exceeded would suggest mal-administration elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You do not immediately proceed to inflict penalties upon the more extravagant administration, but you make enquiry and you get information and you gradually educate the more expensive <Col N="198" /> county home manager into better methods.  Similarly in the case of clerical services.  Has anyone an idea of what the clerical services of any county council costs in relation to a £ of rateable value?  It is the simplest thing in the world if you had an account so arranged.  Then you could get an indication as to differences and make a check.  Undoubtedly there is extravagance in the clerical departments. It would be an invaluable guide to the councillors themselves. They come into the boardrooms at present bewildered as to what to do. They are thirsting to cut down expenditure but it winds up generally by their concentrating upon some typewriter or the County Surveyor's motor car and the whole day is lost in discussing whether the County Surveyor should be allowed a new motor car and these big control figures that would afford a head-line in economy are overlooked.  By far the most efficacious instrument of control for people like County Councillors is a good form of account which would enable the services to be clearly set out and comparisons to be made.  In regard to roads, there is an enormous amount of money spent on them and they are a fertile source of revenue. You badly need a costing system as regards roads.  It would want a little working out, because the cost of roads varies so much in different counties. You can get comparative figures and from them you could discover how it is that some counties are better placed than others.  I do not want to take up the time of the House upon this, and if any other Senator wishes to speak until the Minister comes back, I shall be only too glad to stand down.</P>

      <P>I do not think it would be in the interest of the important motion you are discussing, Senator, that you should simply continue to speak in order to keep the House waiting for the Minister to return.  I would suggest to you that as your remarks will now appear in print and will come before the Minister it would be wise to adjourn this debate for the present.  We need not fix a date for its resumption at the moment. In the meantime the Minister will have <Col N="199" /> your remarks before him and I shall try to have the resumed debate fixed for a date when he will be able to attend.  The Minister has gone away as he has a deputation on hand and has another fixed for three o'clock.  Where he is at present I cannot tell and I think it would be more convenient, if you feel disposed, that we should adjourn this discussion to a date hereafter to be fixed.</P>
