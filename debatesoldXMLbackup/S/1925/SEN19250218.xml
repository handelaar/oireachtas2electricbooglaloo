      <P>In accordance with my duty under our Standing Orders, I have to announce, with the most sincere sorrow and regret, sorrow and regret which, I am certain, will be shared in every quarter of this House, that since our last meeting Senator Dr. George Sigerson has passed away.  With the indulgence of the House, I would just like to say a word or two with reference to the loss which the nation and this House has sustained.  He was a man of exceptional gifts which he displayed in very many fields of activity in public life, and I may use in regard to him and in respect of those activities the familiar quotation: <i>Nihil quod tetigit non ornavit.</i>  He lived a life full of years and full of honour, because his great services to his country and his profession were recognised by most of our great learned societies, who conferred upon him the distinction of their Honorary Fellowships.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In contrast to these great gifts, he was one of the most unassuming of men, and here in this House during the time he was with us, we recognised the greatness of his genius as well as his love for his country and his fellow-countrymen. He had strong feelings and convictions on the great political questions of his day, but he wrote of these and he discussed these, always without bitterness or rancour; while in private life, to those who, like myself to a small extent, had knowledge and experience of him, he was a delightful companion and a loyal friend.  I hope I may be allowed, in the name of this <Col N="704" /> House and of my colleagues, to convey to those who have been left behind him, an expression of our very deep regret and sorrow for his death.</P>
    <P>In accordance again with my duty under the Standing Orders, after announcing the fact of the resignation or death of a Senator, I have to fix a date, at an interval not less than one fortnight, for the filling of this vacancy. A curious little question arises whether that fortnight includes to-day.  If it is exclusive of to-day, of course, the earliest date on which the election could take place would be to-morrow fortnight. As far as I can make out, it will not be necessary or desirable that we should meet next week, and consequently I suggest to the House that if we are to meet in the following week we should meet on Thursday.  That will give a full fortnight and we can proceed to the election, without fear of contravening our Standing Orders, on Thursday fortnight.  I wish to remind the House that all nominations to the vacancy must be sent in within a week from to-day, that is to say, the last day for sending in nominations will be next Tuesday.  I have previously prepared forms of nomination which are now in print and which, I think, comply with our Standing Orders in every particular. If they are of any assistance to a member wishing to nominate a Senator, he can get those forms on application to our Clerk.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Seanad will agree that it is only right and fitting that some expression of the loss we have sustained owing to the death of Senator Dr. Sigerson, who was practically the Father of this House, should be made. Senators will agree that some notice is appropriate and desirable.  To those of us who knew Dr. Sigerson personally, his death comes as the loss of a very deep personal friend.  I regret the death of Senator Dr. Sigerson more from the point of view of his loss to the country. He was a great outstanding figure; he was known and honoured all over the world, firstly as an eminent practitioner in his profession, and, secondly, for his amazing intellectual capacity, and for the inestimable services which he rendered, in the literary sphere, to <Col N="705" /> the country to which he belonged. Most of us have been privileged to read his works.  They are marvels of research and erudition.  Certainly, our late colleague has left his mark upon the times in which he lived, a mark which will remain for generations to come; and, in mourning the loss of this distinguished man, we must also render tribute to his persistency and courage, and as you very rightly said, the modesty, of his support of the aspirations and interests of his own country.  We may take an example from him in how to serve our own country without offending anybody else.  I join with you in expressing my deep regret.</P>

      <P>I would remind the Seanad that on the last occasion we met I received a Message from the Clerk of the Dáil giving the terms of a Resolution passed by the Dáil in reference to Standing Orders dealing with Divorce Bills.  I suggest that we might consider to-day what would be a convenient date to take this important and difficult question into consideration. I think it is one that would require the close attention of every member of the Seanad, and I would suggest that, if we are not going to meet again until next Thursday week, we could fix that date for the consideration of this resolution.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;That the amendments recommended at Par. 4 (i) and (ii) of the Report of the Joint Committee on the Dublin United Tramways (Omnibus Services) Bill, 1924, recommitted, be adopted.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>These two amendments were moved by me, formally, when the Bill came on for the Report Stage in the Seanad, in accordance with the Standing Order relating to Private Bills recommitted for consideration.  The Committee have somewhat altered the amendments. I move that the Seanad agree with the recommendation of the Joint Committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add to Section 8 (as amended) the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Provided that the Company shall perform with respect to the omnibuses run by it under the provisions of this Act, all such services in regard to the conveyance of mails as the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs is entitled to require from it with respect to its tramways under Section 24 of the Dublin United Tramways (Electrical Power) Act, 1897, and the provisions of Section 2 and Section (5) (1) first paragraph of the Conveyance of Mails Act, 1893, shall apply to the said omnibuses in the same manner as if such omnibuses were tramways within the meaning of the said Act.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I would like to explain briefly why this amendment is in a different position from the other amendments which have just been inserted by the Seanad. This amendment was made on behalf of the promoters, after consultation with the Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs, and was brought before the Committee when it met for the purpose of reconsidering the Bill in respect of two amendments that were moved in the Seanad on the Report Stage.  The Committee felt a difficulty, in so far as their definite terms of reference were only to consider amendments which had been referred back to them.  At the same time, as is set out in portion of the report, they decided to recommend these amendments.  Subject to your opinion, it seems to me that the Committee in so doing went outside the terms of reference and outside their powers, and that it would not be desirable for many reasons, if, in future committees were considering Private Bills, that they should adopt this course, which would leave it open for amendments to be moved that had not been considered by the House. That, I think, would not be a desirable procedure.  In view of the fact that we are aware that the Committee has approved of this amendment, and as it is one of substance, placing upon the Tramways Company certain duties towards omnibuses, I think the Seanad might consider it wise to insert it without going through the formality of referring the Bill back to the Committee.</P>

      <P>I am glad Senator Douglas has called attention to this as, while in the present case the irregularity, in view of the facts mentioned, is insignificant, it would not be at all right that an irregularity of this kind should pass without recognition, as it might serve and be relied upon as a precedent for the future.  After a Bill has been discussed fully on the Report Stage the Committee Stage is then, presumably, over, but it might happen, if anything is introduced on the Report Stage which was not originally in the Bill, that the Seanad or the Dáil might like to insert it, in which case there is power to recommit the Bill.  That was done apparently in this case in regard to the two amendments that have already been passed, but the Bill was not recommitted in respect of this particular amendment which had never been before the Seanad and was never considered by it.  The Committee, therefore, in considering and inserting it undoubtedly exceeded their powers.  I have no hesitation in saying that.  At the same time, I think, under the circumstances that the Seanad would be well advised, as it is a pure formality, to apply to the omnibus portion of the tramway system the same obligation that applies to the tramway system itself, and to agree to the suggestion made by Senator Douglas.</P>

      <P>As a member of the Committee might I explain that this amendment, as you rightly say, was not before the Seanad when the Bill was referred back to the Committee. It is an amendment that was suggested by the Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs and the Committee, I think rightly, came to the conclusion that it was not within their power to insert it in the Bill.  They did not do so, but they passed a resolution approving of it.  They found no objection to its insertion in the Bill.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that the Committee only reported one or two days ago I think this procedure of accepting amendments is highly irregular.  It might be said by the Tramways Company if this amendment was made compulsory that they have suffered a loss.  I move that we ignore the amendment.</P>

      <P>I think you are making a mistake.  The position is this, that this amendment was not before the Committee at all.  It was a Government amendment, and the point was overlooked at previous stages of the Bill.  It was only when it went back to the Committee that the Government discovered that they had omitted to provide for powers in regard to this extension of the tramway system.  They have these powers over the tramways as such.  When the Tramways Company, by this Bill, was getting extended powers to run omnibuses it became necessary for the Government to have this amendment inserted in order that these Governmental powers should extend over the whole system as enlarged.</P>

I am only acting in the case of these Bills in the capacity of Leas-Chathaoirleach of the Seanad, and I am not going to argue as to their merits or otherwise.  I would like to point out that the amendments which the Seanad has already inserted, and even this amendment, have already been before the Joint Committee of both Houses which inquired into the matter, and it is in <Col N="710" /> order to prevent the insertion in the dark of any amendment in the case of a Private Bill that our Orders provide that they are to be referred back.  The only reason why it is suggested that this particular amendment might be inserted without being formally referred back is because the Joint Committee have actually recommended it.</P>

      <P>I moved a similar resolution on behalf of the promoters of this Bill some time ago.  It has now become necessary under the Private Bill Standing Orders, if the Second Stage of this Bill is to be further postponed, to move this resolution.  The explanation for doing so can be stated briefly.  It is that the promoters do not desire to proceed with this Bill until the Greater Dublin Commission, which is now sitting, has reported.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Standing Orders relative to private business, this Bill is initiated in the Seanad.  It is treated as a Private Bill in most respects, but if no petitions against the Provisional Order proposed to be confirmed by the Bill are deposited before the Second Stage the Bill is referred, on the Second Stage being passed, to a Committee of the whole House in the same manner as a Public Bill.  The object of the Bill is to confirm a Provisional Order made by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health to enable the council of the urban district of Thurles, being the burial board of the district, to purchase and take lands for the purpose of providing a burial ground in their district.  It is provided, as you know, in the Standing Orders relative to private business, that the Leas-Chathaoirleach should move the stages of a Bill of this character, and accordingly I beg leave to introduce this Bill.</P>

      <P>Before section 2 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;2.&mdash;In every enactment or order containing the expression &lsquo;lunatic asylum,&rsquo; or the expression &lsquo;asylum&rsquo; referring to and meaning a lunatic asylum, the expression &lsquo;mental hospital&rsquo;<Col N="712" /> shall be deemed to be substituted for such expression &lsquo;lunatic asylum&rsquo; or &lsquo;asylum&rsquo; (as the case may be); provided that no proceeding in any court shall be invalidated, and no document, legal instrument or other matter, thing or act in the law of any kind shall be deemed invalid, incorrect or irregular or otherwise affected by reason only of the use in any such proceeding, document or instrument or in relation to any such matter or act, of the expression &lsquo;lunatic asylum&rsquo; or &lsquo;asylum&rsquo; instead of the expression &lsquo;mental hospital.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I had this amendment down for consideration on the Committee stage, and I think the Minister promised to look into the matter.  The object of the amendment is to substitute the words &ldquo;mental hospital&rdquo; for the words &ldquo;lunatic asylum.&rdquo;  As far as I can gather, the change which I propose is generally regarded as a desirable one. As a matter of fact, the term &ldquo;mental hospital&rdquo; has been in use now for some considerable time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment moved by Senator Sir John Keane would considerably curtail my powers on this matter.  As I mentioned when the amendment was under discussion in the Committee Stage, my powers are legislative as well as administrative.  I have to take action irrespective altogether of the local authorities in many cases.  Under this amendment I could only act through local authorities. Sometimes it may be my duty to bring in a particular Bill dealing with an epidemic or some measure for the prevention of disease.  I have to deal with various bodies besides the local authorities.  I have to deal with hospitals in some cases, the General Medical Council, the Dental Council, and various bodies of that kind, and if this <Col N="714" /> amendment were inserted I would have no authority, except in respect of local authorities, to make recommendations.

      <P>New section.  Before Section 19 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>19.&mdash;For the removing of doubts, it is hereby declared that it is the duty of a coroner to hold an inquest in respect of every death occurring or dead body lying in his district in respect of which there is any reasonable cause to believe that the death may have been due to some cause other than common illness.</P>
      <P>I understand that what I propose in this amendment is the law in England and in other countries at the present time.  A coroner is bound to hold an inquest on any person who dies from any cause otherwise than ordinary illness. Previously, coroners were paid so much per inquest and I think the present salaries of coroners were made up on that basis.  They have fixed salaries now and the coroner can exercise his discretion as to whether it is necessary to hold an inquest or not. I think it should be laid down by law that the coroner is bound to hold an inquest in the case of any death due to anything other than natural causes.</P>

      <P>In the old days, when coroners were paid expenses such as travelling expenses, and certain fees were paid to the person who discovered the dead body or for reporting any occurrence in which death ensued, it was notorious that one corpse did duty on several occasions.  There are startling instances on record.  As long as the body was fairly sound it was moved round the particular district and was a source of considerable remuneration to all concerned.  If this amendment were passed that might possibly be perpetuated. I do not know whether any expenses are paid now.  The amendment says, &ldquo;in respect of every dead body lying in his district.&rdquo;  The body may be in one place in the coroner's district to-day and in another place to-morrow, and if he would be compelled to hold an inquest every time the body is found I do not know what it would result in.  However, I merely put that aspect forward.  It is possible that there is another little flaw in the wording of the amendment.</P>

What I want to achieve is that where a death occurs from any cause other than illness the coroner will be bound to hold an inquest.  As I have said, heretofore a coroner was paid so much per inquest. Now the coroner is paid a salary, which covers travelling expenses. Whether that is responsible for it or not I know that there have been cases where inquests were necessary but where they were not held.  If I can have it made compulsory on the coroner to hold an inquest on every person who dies from any cause other than illness I am satisfied.  We can easily delete the first few words of the amendment if they are objected to.  I did not bother about the form of the amendment.</P>

      <P>It might enlighten the House to know what really happens at present when the coroner is called into action.  The naturalness or not of the death is at his discretion, because a doctor can certify anything he wishes if he were so minded, about a patient's demise.  The coroner can hold an inquest at his discretion, if a man is operated on at 12 o'clock, and dies at ten minutes past twelve, in spite of anything in the medical certificate. Formerly coroners were paid by results. If we remove the incentive to hold the inquest, we will have to put somebody in a judicial position to decide whether the death is natural or not.  A super-coroner and medical officer would be required.  The amendment would be effectual if the remuneration were left on the old basis, by results.  I do think that the principle is absolutely essential; the greatest protection of the public from unnatural death is the appeal to the coroner's court, and you are lessening that protection if you allow the coroner discretion as regards the holding or non-holding of inquests.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment seeks to do away with redundant officers and officials. At present I understand these institutions are inspected by a staff of some 17 lay inspectors and 10 medical inspectors.  Under the Bill there will be a new office created, that is, the office of County Medical Officer of Health, and the amendment proposes that within his jurisdiction and area he shall act as Local Government Inspector for all these institutions.  That is on the administrative side of these institutions.  In addition to the lay inspectors and the medical inspectors, there is a staff of auditors.  I do not propose to impose any of the duties of the auditors on the medical officers, but only to appoint them Local Government inspectors so far as the administrative side of these institutions is concerned.  I do not think that would inflict any great extra burden on these men who will be highly qualified men, seeing that at present similar duties with regard to mental hospitals, of which there are 20 in the Free State, are carried out by one official.  One official, I believe, is competent to inspect and supervise the administrative side of the 20 mental hospitals in the Free State.  Generally speaking, I think there is and should be a disposition to cut down as far as possible, the clerical staffs and the inspecting staffs of the various departments, in <Col N="722" /> the first place in the interests of economy, and in the next place to reduce overlapping and redundancy.</P>
    <P>Under the present system we have one of the medical inspectors going down to-day to a dispensary and inspecting under the Medical Charities Act.  To-morrow you have a lay inspector going down to inspect under the Public Health Act.  These are all highly paid officers of the central authority, and their travelling expenses and hotel expenses are going on all the time.  At the time of taking the latest return, I find that we had a staff of inspectors for the Free State of fortythree, whereas for the whole of Ireland under the old régime we had only about the same, or one or two less.  That seems to require looking into, and this is the first move that I propose, at any rate, in the direction of making an effort to help to put down these highly expensive, redundant, and over-lapping services.  You will do away, by this amendment, with your seventeen lay inspectors.  The ten medical inspectors might get the option of taking counties that may be assigned to them as County Medical Officers of Health. They can still retain their inspectorial capacity, under the Local Government Department, and then, simply instead of seventeen lay inspectors, you appoint additional County Medical Officers of Health for the twenty-six counties.  You have to-day between lay inspectors and medical inspectors, twenty-seven inspectors, and under the new order, proposed in this amendment you will have twenty-six county officers taking the place of these and doing the double duty.  That will be a difference of one, and I am sure you will require one or two more in order to act as relieving officers for County Health Officers in the case of sickness or otherwise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BENNETT</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to oppose this amendment.  I certainly am in favour of economy, but I think to practise economy in this instance, to the danger of the public health is not wise. After all the County Medical Officer of Health is appointed by the local authority, and if the local authority is out for economy, he would be very likely to make a big effort to satisfy <Col N="723" /> their desires.  Apart altogether from that, if any epidemic occurs in the country, it is very likely that a travelling official such as a doctor of the Local Government Department would be more likely to know the incidence of the disease, the progress of its course, and the various other matters connected with it, and he would be much more capable of putting an end to it than any mere local man would.  I do not say that if a local doctor had time at his disposal to deal with such outbreaks he would not be competent to deal with them, but he would not have the same opportunity that the travelling doctor would as the inspector appointed by the Local Government Board through the country.  They are acquainted with every new phase of disease, and they study it very carefully.</P>
      <P>I think that their advice is useful and almost essential to the economic administration of public health.  For that reason I think that an amendment such as this, a promise to do away with their existence, would be an injury to public health generally and mistaken economy, and a thing that should not be tried in a Bill like this.</P>

Senator Kenny has been rather incisive in his criticism of the expenditure on my Department, but I might say that we are carrying on that Department, with all its functions that were being carried on by the British Government, with a saving of £15,000 per annum, so that Senator Kenny need have no fears on that score. I think it would be very inadvisable to appoint these new county medical officers as inspectors.  It will be very necessary when these men are appointed, men new to this work, who have had no experience of public health administration and who are taking over new offices, that there should be inspection by the central authority in order that they would carry out their work properly.  I think it would be very wrong to put untried men into the position of local Czars.  These men will have very wide powers under the Bill as it is, and if we put in this amendment they will be put in the position <Col N="724" /> that they will have no inspectors over them to see that they are carrying out their functions.  The result would be that they might be carrying out their duties in a slipshod manner.  Perhaps in fifteen years' time, when the Bill is working satisfactorily, some development of that kind would be possible.  At the present time, however, it would be very inadvisable to grant such very wide powers to officers who have no experience on such matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>There is some slight misconception on the Minister's part. Perhaps that was due to my not elaborating my point sufficiently.  It was not intended by the amendment that there should be no inspection of the county medical officers of health. The general inspectors from headquarters would see that they would do their duty.  I am quite surprised at the Minister stating that it would be inadvisable to accept this amendment because of the fact that these men would be inexperienced and untried.  I say that is decidedly retrogressive.  You cannot have a medical officer in this position unless he has been both tried and experienced. He will require to be an experienced and a tried officer and a man of very high standing in his profession. You are not going to have a man to perform the duties that are going to be assigned to such an officer, very serious duties in which human life is involved over a very wide area, unless he is a man of a very high standard. You certainly are not going, and the Seanad is not going, to be a party to the suggestion made by the Minister that new and untried and inexperienced men are going to be put into these positions.  You are not going to do that.  It was also suggested here, and it was endorsed by the Minister, that these men are going to cost you £400 or £500 a year.  You will not get any man of standing in the medical profession to take up these positions at this figure.  You will possibly get a man at that figure who has completed his medical course and with perhaps a year's experience.  You had instances the other day where, on the suggestion and initiative of the Local Government Department, it was sought to get experienced men for dispensary work <Col N="725" /> rather than young fledglings.  Now, the suggestion is that men be appointed as county medical officers of health, which is a very much more serious and onerous position than that of the ordinary medical officer.  These positions will have to be filled by men who have been tried and experienced.</P>

      <P>There is a Government amendment to insert a new Section 22.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="726" /> New section.  Before Section 22 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>At least one of the sanitary officers appointed by any sanitary authority under the provisions of Section 11 of the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1878, shall be a duly qualified veterinary surgeon and the duties assigned to such officer shall include inspection and examination of meat, inspection of cattle in dairies and other similar duties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. BURKE Mr. BURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Committee Stage, there was an amendment inserted to make it obligatory to appoint veterinary surgeons as sanitary officers and for some reason, owing to the wording or otherwise, the amendment was not accepted.  I think that, perhaps, this amendment might be more acceptable to the Seanad.  It is very necessary that these veterinary officers should be appointed where possible. The duties to be carried out are very technical.  In the past, and at the present time, sanitary regulations with regard to milk and the inspection of meat and the inspection of foodstuffs for export have not been carried out as stringently as they should have been and it is necessary that we should have some co-ordination of these duties. For instance, some time ago an abattoir was inspected here in this City of Dublin.  The owner of this abattoir objected to the inspection of the meat and the veterinary officer insisted on having his inspection.  The result was that the owner removed it outside the City limit, with the consequences that no inspection was carried out and meat of any description would in this way be foisted on the Dublin citizens.  It is very necessary that veterinary officers should be appointed to carry out these technical duties which can only be carried out by persons who have technical training in meat inspection and in looking after dairies and cowsheds. This amendment makes it obligatory to have one veterinary officer appointed in each Public Health area for carrying out this inspection. As the law stands at present, I have ample powers to appoint such an officer.  But this section makes it compulsory instead of its being permissive. <Col N="727" /> I consider that it is a very necessary addition to our Public Health code.</P>

      <P>Since this matter was raised on the Committee Stage, I notice that the association of the veterinary profession has been very busy, but I am rather apprehensive that this House is not inclined to encroach upon their professional privileges.  I want to be perfectly clear about this question. The main objection, so far as my recollection goes, arose out of the matter mentioned by the Minister; that is, co-ordination.  We objected to these professional gentlemen over-lapping under the different Acts, and the danger we apprehend is that you would have one veterinary officer appointed to carry out the duties under the Public Health Act and another to cover the same ground, to carry out the duties under the Diseases of Animals Act. This is extravagant and objectionable, in view of the straitened condition of our local finances, but can the Minister give us any assurance that one and the same officer will do these jobs?  If he can give us that assurance, it will be perfectly satisfactory, otherwise I think this amendment should be resisted, simply on the grounds that it is going to create over-lapping and extravagance. If a county has power to appoint only one veterinary officer, is there any assurance that the whole county will be covered by this professional man?  These officers are allocated to areas, and the object of this amendment will be only very partially served if a veterinary officer is confined to a limited area of a county. I would like to know what the Government have to say on this matter.  I think the result would be ineffective if the veterinary officer is not going to cover the whole area of the county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. BURKE Mr. BURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator has raised the point about dividing the duties of the veterinary surgeon, and has pointed out that some men are carrying out duties under the Diseases of Animals Act, and more of them are carrying out duties under the Dairies and Cowsheds Order, and under the Meat Inspection and Public Health Acts.  It was the <Col N="728" /> original intention to co-ordinate these duties under the Diseases of Animals Act in the officer who would carry out the duties under the Public Health Act, but that is a matter for arrangement with the Minister for Agriculture.  I do not think that the Minister for Agriculture is quite satisfied with the administration of the Diseases of Animals Act.  Throughout the country there is, I think, a good deal of dissatisfaction with its administration, and particularly with regard to the killing of tubercular cattle, which is on a very extravagant scale, and it is a matter that will have to be worked out later on administratively.  I would like to have this particular power in case we appoint a whole-time veterinary officer later on to carry out the co-ordinated duties.</P>
      <P>It was our intention originally to have one veterinary officer carrying out all the veterinary duties in the county, but I think the veterinary profession themselves are opposed to that at present, and we have not been able to get any clear-cut policy.  No matter what policy is decided on later on, it would be necessary to have at least one officer carrying out these duties in every public health area.  As Senator Sir John Keane has pointed out, one veterinary officer, who is only a part-time officer, would not be able to reach on all the duties of the public health district, but it would be better to have one than none at all.  If, as I say, we are able to co-ordinate the duties and appoint a full-time officer I will have ample power if this amendment is carried, otherwise I would not be in a position to do so.</P>

      <P>I hope the Government will persevere with this proposal, which I regard as a most important one.  Even supposing it turned out to be expensive in its operation, I think, on the whole, that it would be very well justified.  We are working to affect an improvement in the cattle breeding, and in the milk and butter industries, and generally to assist the farmers scientifically by every means in our power.  It is perfectly obvious that if you are to have proper dairies and abattoirs you will have to have security that tubercular milk will not be supplied, and you will require to have <Col N="729" /> competent authorities, trained inspectors, to carry out work of this kind.  I think this proposal is essential to the proper carrying out of the supervision of dairies and abattoirs.</P>

      <P>I am in accord with the principle of having one dairy inspector, such as is proposed.  I can visualise what will arise.  You have already in some counties people appointed under the Dairies and Cowsheds Act to inspect these places.  If you are going to insist on getting new men to do these duties it will be incumbent on you to pension these existing officers. That is not a position that should be allowed to arise.  It is stated that the duties of these men should include the inspection of cattle and dairies, and you have already under the Dairies and Cowsheds Act men appointed for a number of years to do these duties.  If these men are replaced it is not improbable that they will have to be compensated. We should get an assurance that the men already in office, if they are qualified for the positions, will be appointed under the new scheme, and unless such an assurance is given I shall oppose the amendment.  I am anxious that a veterinary surgeon should be appointed for the whole county if necessary.</P>

      <P>9.  New section.  Before Section 5 to insert a new Section 5 as follows:</P>
      <P>5. (1)  The Minister may by regulations made under this Act declare that any particular breed or breeds or any particular type or types of bull is or are unsuitable for any specified area or areas, but the Minister shall not make, revoke or vary any such regulation until he has consulted the consultative council established under this Act in regard thereto, and the Minister, in the making, revoking, or varying any such regulation shall take into consideration any advice in regard thereto given to him by the said council, after making such (if any) inquiries and investigations as it thinks proper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  Subject to the provisions of this section, the Minister may, if he think fit so to do, refuse to grant a <Col N="732" /> licence under this Act in respect of a bull kept or proposed to be kept in an area specified in such regulations if the bull is of a breed or of a type declared by such regulations to be unsuitable for that area.</P>
    <P>(3)  The Minister may, subject to the provisions of this section, at any time, if he thinks fit so to do, suspend or revoke a licence granted by him under this Act if the bull to which such licence relates is brought into or kept in an area specified in any such regulations and is of a breed or of a type declared by such regulations to be unsuitable for that area.</P>
    <P>(4)  The Minister shall not under this section refuse, revoke, or suspend a licence in respect of a bull which is entered or eligible for entry in a prescribed herd-book and is used or intended to be used exclusively for the service of cows of the same breed as the bull.</P>
    <P>This new section insures that the Minister, before he makes any regulations declaring any breed or breeds are unsuitable, must confer with the Consultative Council and the Council has power, if it thinks fit, to hold an inquiry into the matter.

      <P>The point raised by Senator Bennett arises here again. I do not think this contention that cross-breeding will be eliminated is quite justified.  I think the House already knows my views as regards this arrangement, but of course that is all passed now, as the principle has been adopted.  Apparently, if you want to breed crosses, and you have got Shorthorns, there is nothing as far as I can <Col N="736" /> see to prevent you bringing in a pure-bred bull of another type and crossing with your Shorthorns.  As far as I can see, you could bring an Aberdeen Angus bull into a prescribed district, provided he is pure-bred, and cross him with your Shorthorns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the position. Senators will have to remember that this section only deals with a very limited area.  I stated on the Committee Stage that we did not contemplate applying this section to any area at the moment except Kerry, and a special district in Kerry.  Therefore, it can only apply to that district.  I state now that it would be quite impossible to carry, with any Consultative Council or with any body of organised opinion, any regulation which would extend it, say, to Limerick, or to any of the ordinary big districts in the country where the ordinary Aberdeen Angus, Shorthorn, and Hereford cattle are used.  It was on that discretion that I relied in getting the section through in the Dáil. I say that that discretion could not be exercised except in the case of limited areas.  I stated that it was never contemplated to exercise the discretion except in a small district in Kerry.  We are only dealing with a small district in Kerry.  I accept Senator Butler's amendment, which is now being inserted in the Bill, and which is to the effect that before even that district is limited, the Consultative Council shall cause a public inquiry, if they wish, to be held into all the considerations that would arise before limiting such a district. The first question that would arise is, what electoral divisions should be scheduled as the areas over which that section should operate, and the next consideration is what breed should be used and what prohibited.  I accepted that amendment.  The Consultative Council are free to hold either a public or a private inquiry in regard to that.  That is a further safeguard. It may be that there is an overwhelming case for limiting a certain district to a certain type of bull; for limiting certain districts in Kerry to the Kerry bull.  But what, I ask, about the unfortunate man who lives in that district and who has a pedigree herd and wants a stock bull for the use of his own herd. <Col N="737" /> To meet that case we inserted sub-section (4) in the proposed new section 5: &ldquo;The Minister shall not under this section refuse, revoke, or suspend a licence in respect of a bull which is entered or eligible for entry in a prescribed herd-book and is used, or is intended to be used, exclusively for the service of cows of the same breed as the bull.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That meets the case of the pedigree breeder but it does not meet the case of the man who wants, say, an Aberdeen Angus bull to put on ordinary Shorthorn cows.  For the farmer in a district where they are breeding nothing but Kerry cattle, I am afraid we cannot do anything.  I am simply giving that as an example of the fact that the general good of the community in that district must be considered before the predilections of any particular individual.  But we have met the case of the breeder who was breeding, let us say, Aberdeen Angus or Shorthorns in that district.  We have provided that the Minister cannot refuse a licence to him to bring in a bull of any variety he likes provided the bull is pure-bred.  We have gone a step further and we say: &ldquo;And is used or intended to be used exclusively for the service of cows of the same breed as the bull.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take a case in the County Wexford, which I am afraid is not a very good example, of two or three pedigree breeders who want the same bull. They do not want to buy a bull each. As the amendment stood originally and as agreed to on Committee, the position was that each man who wanted a pedigree bull for his own cows had to get a bull.  That might be very hard.  If you had three or four breeders all breeding the same class of stock&mdash;it would be very hard to expect each of them to get a bull.  One could pay as much as £150 for a good pedigree stock bull.  We have met their case by allowing one of them to purchase a bull for the use of the 30 or 40 cows that they may own.  It is provided in the Bill that the bull may be used not only for the cows of the owner, but also for the cows owned by the other men provided the bull is of the same <Col N="738" /> breed as the cows.  It is quite clear that we do not allow cross-breeding in the very limited areas which we defined for the purposes of this sub-section.</P>

On the last occasion the Minister was talking about Kerry, but when he was pressed a little more he laid it down clearly that he did not intend it to be limited to Kerry.  There was a reference made to Sligo and when he was asked he said that it could apply to Sligo.  By that statement he practically extended it all over Ireland.  The first thing to be considered is that the Minister will not be always there.  He will not be everlasting.  Consequently this thing is very indefinite.  Sligo and Leitrim have already been mentioned, and now he is beginning to tack on Wexford. I am afraid that the whole thing is very indefinite.</P>

In the first place, he told us that before any area is prescribed as an area preserved for Kerries, for instance, that in that area no bull of any other breed should be introduced with one exception&mdash;that is where there is a herd of similar animals, and where there are individuals with cows of the same breeds, whether they be Shorthorn or Aberdeen Angus.  To remove the grievance of those men having these herds, he proposed to admit into that scheduled area a Shorthorn or Hereford bull.  I believe that was the position.</P>

      <P>I would rather not accept that for the moment.  I will deal with what is here, viz., to insert in sub-section (4) of the new section the following words from my amendment 5.  After the words &ldquo;herd-book&rdquo; to insert the words, &ldquo;or a bull registered in a register of dairy cattle kept by the Department of Lands and Agriculture.&rdquo; In all these matters where we give these wide powers we have to visualise cases which may be exceptional but which are quite possible. It is possible to have in a prescribed area a very considerable owner of a rare breed of cows of a particular pedigree. In this oft-repeated area of Kerry you may have a large breeder of Shorthorns.  Here I will interpolate, if I may, a protest against this tendency to read into powers that are unlimited, a limited application.  The Minister takes unlimited powers, and then suggests that he will only apply them over a limited area.  That is his intention, but the Bill gives him power to apply it anywhere.  He is not going to be Minister for all time, and we do not know what his successor may do. He will have to go by the language as it is in the Statute, and will not have an individual opinion as to how it should be interpreted.  Assuming that you get any scheduled area, as I call it for the sake of description, and supposing you get an owner with a large number of registered dairy Shorthorns, this registration has been going on for a long time, and there are quite a number of people who built up valuable herds of dairy Shorthorns and had them registered under the Department. Now by these powers it would not be within the right of the owner to bring in a registered bull.  That is an extraordinary position.  He can bring in a pure-bred Shorthorn bull.</P>

      <P>I second the amendment and I beg to reiterate the statement of Sir John Keane.  For several years we have been encouraged by the Department of Agriculture to bring in these cattle.  We had to register the cows, and we have now a breed of cows which produces eight or nine hundred gallons or even a thousand gallons of milk in the year.  Their progeny I consider are as suitable to the country as any beasts that could be produced. They were registered by the Department of Agriculture for the last ten years, and now with one stroke of the pen, the work done by the Department is to be blotted out for ever.  That shows the mentality of the advisers of this Department.  We have to move very carefully.  I know myself men who have been building up these herds and have paid out large sums.</P>

      <P>I am not certain what arguments the Minister will bring forward, but I am inclined to think that he would say, the proper bull to introduce in these conditions would be a pure Shorthorn bull and not a registered bull as defined by the Department.  I have had some experience of these registered bulls and they are all cross-breds.  Their dams may be good Shorthorn cows that give plenty of milk, but it does not follow that for breeding purposes these bulls are suitable.  I sympathise with the Minister if he intends to raise the point that he does not object <Col N="744" /> to the introduction of a pure-bred dairy Shorthorn bull where herds of dairy Shorthorns have been established but that he does object to the introduction of a registered dairy bull which is not a pure-bred bull.  I do not think Senator Sir John Keane is quite correct in saying that there are no dairy Shorthorn pedigree herds.  I know of several.</P>

      <P>I think Senator Guinness is not quite accurate when he makes this statement.  As I understand it&mdash;I may be wrong&mdash;a dairy Shorthorn is not a pure-bred animal. A Shorthorn cow can be brought in&mdash; with certain milk regulations&mdash;any cow can be brought in, of a Shorthorn type, to that register and yet it is not a pure-bred cow.  I do not know how long it would be necessary to go back to establish a pure-bred animal.  In the case of horses, we must go back about a hundred years of clean blood, before we can declare it a pure-bred. At all events in the case of pure-bred cattle I think you would have to go back about forty years, whereas the Shorthorn registered at present is not as pure as that or anything like it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. COUNIHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The discussion has taken a course that would suggest that all the bulls in the country were to be pure-bred.  About nine-tenths of the bulls will be ordinary bulls suitable for the district, especially in the County Limerick, and the Minister takes the precaution of prescribing a pure-bred bull for beasts going into what he considers a scheduled or closed area.  That is the position as I understand it.  If you take in the dairy Shorthorn bull they become very numerous and it will be quite easy for anybody to bring that class of bull into the Kerry district which the Minister <Col N="745" /> is all the time trying to guard and preserve.  That is the reason he says a pure-bred bull.</P>

      <P>I think there are one or two things that require to be stated about this matter.  In the first place there is the question of dairy Shorthorns and pure-bred.  I believe that they have to go through four generations before they are admitted, and only a small quantity are so admitted. I think that we may reasonably say that the dairy Shorthorn breed is a pure breed without any possibility of well-informed contradiction.  I think that, on the whole, there is a good deal to be said for this amendment, unless the Minister puts up some argument which I have not yet thought of.  I think, at the same time, that a statement such as that made by Senator Bennett, that the whole value of the scheme will be blotted out by a stroke of the pen because it is proposed in a very limited district&mdash;or even in a large district, if you like, but I say in a smaller district&mdash;should not be accepted.  This scheme has done immense good in Ireland.  It has, as Senator Bennett said, increased the yield of milk to 800 and 1,000 gallons. How could the acceptance or nonacceptance of this amendment change the yield of that breed?  The thing is absurd.  The very price we get for this class of cattle will not be affected. I think that this amendment might be accepted, because these registered cattle are half-breds in any case and they are only dairy cows of a certain type.</P>

My absurdity consisted in expressing the opinion that a scheme which had existed for ten years, promoting the breeding of dairy bulls, is to be abandoned under this Bill.  That is still my contention, and I will maintain that it is a contention that can be upheld if the Minister so desires.  Permitting it to be done in the Bill, he has the power to do it.  The Minister with one stroke of the pen, I reiterate, can blot out the work that the Department has been doing for ten years.  I <Col N="746" /> think it is not absurd to say that such a position can arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear that it is so easy to do these things.  I should like very much indeed to have a state of affairs where, with one stroke of the pen, you could simply apply certain regulations to the whole country, and that no farmer, no member of the Dáil or Seanad, or of the Consultative Council, would say anything to it.  That is what Senator Bennett's statement means.  Perhaps I might explain what I mean by the terms I use.  When speaking of a pedigree bull, I mean a bull entered in Coates's Herd Book; when speaking of a pure-bred bull, I mean a pure-bred bull of a clean breed, whether he is entered in Coates's Herd Book or not. There is only one type of pure-bred in this country not entered in Coates's Herd Book, and that is the ordinary Shorthorn cow, which is, for all practical purposes, pure-bred.  I can go into various Counties like Limerick and Wexford, in fact, all over the country, wherever you get a great many cross and half-breed animals, and I suppose 50 per cent. of the cows would be pure Shorthorns in the sense that for generations back they have been bred from Shorthorns and are, in fact, pure but not pedigree.  The cross-bred or half-bred animal, whichever you like to call it, is a cross between an Aberdeen Angus and a Shorthorn, a Galloway and a Shorthorn, or any other cross.  A pedigree animal is an animal entered in Coates's Herd Book.  A pure-bred animal is an animal of pure breed entered in the Herd Book, and a large proportion of the ordinary Shorthorn cows are pure-bred. We take that into account when examining the cow, to see whether it is to be registered in the Dairy Register.  You may easily see whether it is, for all practical purposes, pure-bred. There may have been a cross of an Aberdeen Angus two or three generations back, but it is now bred out of her.  I am not on the point of whether it is right or not to regard such an animal as pure-bred.  A half-bred animal is a cross between two breeds.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is technically correct.  But, for the purposes of the Bill, it would be sufficient, in order to avoid confusion, to define a cross-bred simply as an animal of any two breeds, rather than to take a cross-breed as one thing and a half-breed as another. These are the three main classes, the pedigree, the pure-bred and the half-bred. This animal, in Coates's Herd Book, traces back not so very long ago, to other breeds.  It is quite possible in fact probable, that that animal four or five generations back was crossed with another breed.  I think that Coates's Herd Book was prepared long after 1800.  Coates was a gentleman who simply went round in a pony trap, went into each cow-byre, had a good look at the cows and made a schedule of the good Shorthorn cows in Aberdeen and in England, and put them in his Herd Book.  I am perfectly certain that, even after 1800, a lot of them had crossed with other breeds, but it is now bred out of them.  I call a cross-breed any animal that obviously on view is a cross between two breeds quite recently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not understand what Senator Sir John Keane means when he speaks about taboos and when he speaks about this slur on these registered cattle. I do not understand what Senator Bennett means when he says that one stroke of the pen might wipe out all that the Department had done for the last twenty years.  Dairy cattle are not only pure-bred, but the dairy Shorthorn is in exactly the same Herd Book as the beef Shorthorn.  Number one may be a beef Shorthorn, number two be dairy, and number fifteen, beef. In other words, a particular cow has proved to be a good milker and we regarded her as a dairy cow of dairy stock, and therefore pure-bred, and therefore in exactly the same Herd Book.  I do not understand the meaning of the word &ldquo;taboo&rdquo; in this connection, nor do I understand the expression that Senator Sir John Keane has used that by inserting this harmless <Col N="748" /> provision I am casting a slur on the register of the cattle of the country. He has only two alternatives.  Does he maintain that registered dairy cattle can, in fact, get the privileges of pedigree cattle in regard to showing, in regard to exportation and, above all, in regard to price?  There is, after all, a difference between pedigree cattle and registered dairy cattle. When I say that I am not in any way casting a slur on the registered cattle of the country.  A pedigree beast is always worth more, for the reason that people are sure of the animal's purity, and that, as a rule, it will give better results and better yields.  But when you say that a pedigree beast has certain advantages which a non-pedigree beast has not, you are not casting any slur on the Department's Dairy Register. As evidence of the fact that a registered beast, if not as valuable as a pedigree beast, there is the fact that buyers will always give a far bigger price, and buyers are not fools.  They do it for commercial reasons and for no others.</P>
    <P>Does Senator Sir John Keane contend that unless registered cattle get exactly the same privileges as pedigree cattle, there is a slur on registered cattle?  If he does, I cannot argue. They have not these privileges, in fact, and they never will have them.  The time may come when breeders may begin to regard the pure-bred Shorthorn, which is not pedigree, as eligible for entry in a herd book, just as at present you have a pedigree register of Kerry cattle; then you have an appendix to the register, and if the cow is up to a certain standard in substance and milk yield, she gets into the appendix and her grand-daughter is entitled to go into the pedigree register.  You may reach the same position in generations to come in regard to Shorthorns, but at present there is a distinction between the pedigree and the non-pedigree, and all I wish to insist on is that because I drew that distinction it is not a slur on the registered dairy cattle, and it will not wipe out all the good work done by the Department in building up the Dairy Register, and will not discontinue that work.  Why <Col N="749" /> do I ask the Seanad to insist that this bull brought into this area shall be pedigreed?  For this reason: This section has to apply to a specified area, limited for the production of a special breed.  An area can only be defined and can only be limited when the Consultative Council has held an inquiry.  I will not go again into the question of what safeguards there are against limiting the whole country for the purpose of a special breed.  We have the Dáil, the Seanad and the Consultative Council, before whom these regulations must come, and that that is a sufficient safeguard, I think any farmer will agree.  I do not think any farmer who looks at the question on its merits would for a moment deny that it would be utterly impossible to define any area for the purposes of that section without the overwhelming support of the whole farming community, not only in that particular area, but outside of it.  That is what I call the real safeguard against my bringing in a regulation that nothing but Galloway bulls shall be used in County Limerick.  We are taking power to define certain areas, and it has been pointed out that that might do harm to individuals.  It might do harm to the breeder of a pure-bred herd within that area, and it was suggested that we should put in a clause to safeguard him.  We put in a clause by which he can have a pedigree bull of the same breed.</P>
    <P>Then it was pointed out by somebody that there might be three or four small breeders who would like to use the same bull and we provided for that by saying: &ldquo;used exclusively for the service of the same breed as the bull.&rdquo; Now we are asked to change that word &ldquo;pedigree&rdquo; and give the same rights to registered cattle as to pedigree cattle.  What would be the effect of that?  I could buy a good registered bull for £30 or less.  I think Senator Butler will agree with me that I could get a registered bull for that price, whatever the pedigree might do.  I know there are various Senators here who could tell us at what price we could get a registered bull.  I should say a yearling could be got at anything <Col N="750" /> from £15 to £20.  Very well.  Now, by this amendment you put it within the reach of everybody who has one single Shorthorn cow, a non-pedigree Shorthorn cow, in any district to say: &ldquo;I want a bull, I want a registered dairy bull for this Shorthorn cow,&rdquo; and he can buy the bull cheaply.  But you make certain that you will only get serious applications if you put in the word &ldquo;pedigree.&rdquo;  That bull is dearer.  People will think twice before buying a pedigree bull.  Only a genuine breeder of pedigree stock will buy a pedigree bull.  It is only the man who is breeding stock for a definit purpose will go to the expense of buying a pedigree bull.  If you put in the word &ldquo;registered&rdquo; you can purchase a bull for 20 per cent. of the price of the pedigree bull.  Now, in Kerry, any man owning a Shorthorn cow could buy a registered cheap bull for the use of even one Shorthorn cow and could bring such a bull into any district.  Hundreds of them would come in, and it would defeat the object of the Bill.  You cannot prevent such a man from using his bull for the service of Kerry cows.  The result would be it would be back in the same condition as before.  It is a bit of a risk to take in a pedigree bull.  But if the bull was to be a non-pedigree one, that bull could be bought cheaply and you would have ten such bulls for the one pedigree bull, and you would be back in the place where you started and it would be as well to delete the whole section.  That would be the logical thing to do.</P>

      <P>I do not think the Minister is very well acquainted with the prices that pedigree bulls realise.  I can tell him there are very large numbers of pedigree bulls which, on account of colour or other causes can be bought just as cheaply as a good class of registered bull.  I know that from practical experience.  So he has got no safeguard really in the word &ldquo;pedigree.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Everybody knows that owners of pure-bred herds have to sell off a large number of their cows.  They are very expensive to rear. Every pedigree Shorthorn breeder always culls out a certain number of his cows, very often because of their colour or other reasons.  All along what I would like to bear in mind, and what I ask the Seanad to bear in mind is that the liberty of the subject is being glaringly infringed.  The argument that these scheduled areas will be inundated with cheap bulls from the Department's Dairy Register, that is really a suggestion not worthy of consideration. Because while there may be cheap bulls, this register is an exceedingly valuable register, and it is getting increasingly valuable.  Let us see what is happening &mdash;as these yields are going up, as these yields are increasing, the strain is improving, and while certain of these bulls may be of a cheap price, those bred from high yielding cows are certain in the future to become of great value.  The Minister already knows how extremely difficult it is to get a really satisfactory dairy Shorthorn bull at anything like a reasonable price&mdash;I mean anything under 100 guineas.  With the increase in the milk yield of the dam the <Col N="752" /> value of the bull rises even now, and will rise more in the future.  We hope to get a more vigorous, a more healthy, and a better shape of stock through the Department.  Now we are here by legislation prohibiting the owner of breeding Shorthorns from availing himself of this sort of stock which the Government themselves have advertised and assisted in building up with very great care and patience.  I can hardly trust myself to speak with moderation on this legislation; and I would like to ask the Seanad to say that there is not sufficient reason for this interference with the liberty of the subject.</P>

      <P>We all know that the Minister has power to schedule certain areas, in which he will prohibit certain breeds.  The object of the amendment is to ensure that the country will get notice of this fact. Breeders and others should have ample opportunity to find out what the intentions of the Government are in this matter.  Owners might be contemplating buying certain bulls, or they might be developing other breeds of herds in certain directions, and it is only fair to give them a year's notice of any intention to limit their activities in the manner this Bill proposes.  My personal opinion is that these whole powers are so interfering that they will not be availed of much.  If they are availed of extensively, they are going to upset the breeding plans with regard to cattle to a considerable extent, and in view of that change breeders should be protected. The Minister should have a policy and foresee his plans.  It is not unreasonable that he should give a year's official notice in some official publication of his intention to schedule a certain area and to restrict certain breeds in that area.  That is what I seek by this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the publication of statutory regulations under all statutes is being dealt with by a special Bill.  I think that is the usual way of dealing with it.  You never deal with the publication of regulation in the Bill itself.  There is a Bill under consideration which will deal with the publication of statutory regulations, and perhaps that will satisfy the Senator with regard to publication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may say it is not statutory publication which will give notice of any such regulations.  A statutory regulation is published in the <i>Official Gazette,</i> but very few farmers get the <i>Gazette.</i>  If you want to advertise a remedy for fluke in sheep, and you put it in the <i>Gazette</i> for two years, farmers would know nothing about it.  For the purpose of bringing it to their knowledge that a regulation has been made and an area defined official publication is <Col N="754" /> not of much use.  Look at the sequence of events: the Minister broaches the subject to the Department, and expresses the view that a certain area should be defined.  The Consultative Council is called in.  They have a public inquiry, and it appears in the papers.  They come to a conclusion, and then the whole country knows about it.  It is finally decided by the Department that an area should be defined. That is always published, and must be published immediately.  There is no statutory duty on the Department to publish the thousand and one things which as a matter of business are published.</P>
    <P>Publication in the <i>Official Gazette</i> would not be of much use.  The real publication is the publication that takes place in the Press of the discussions in the Dáil, in the Seanad, and in the Consultative Council, and afterwards the publication of the decision to our instructors and inspectors.  That is effective publication.  I ask the Senator to agree with me that this question of the publication of statutory regulations should be dealt with in one Bill.  With regard to the time, again there is a difference between us, and one that we will not, I am afraid, agree on.  This will not and cannot in the nature of the case interfere with breeding arrangements.  Just imagine the breeding arrangements in Kerry. Take Cahirciveen and Sneem, and around that district, which the Senator has mentioned.  I say we can only define an area with the support of the farmers, and of the Dáil, and of the country.  There is one area we could define with the support of everybody, namely, a certain district in County Kerry.  You may, perhaps, get a number of people who would disagree, but you would get the support of the huge majority of every organised body of farmers.  Supposing that is the district we are going to define.  Where are the breeders in the district who are going to have all their plans put out by reason of the fact that only Kerry bulls can come into that district? I do not know them.  A number of men can bring in a pedigree bull for the use of their own stock.  If they <Col N="755" /> are breeders&mdash;I think there are one or two herds of Shorthorns there&mdash;they will not be affected by this.  If they want to bring in pedigree bulls they can, and this Bill will not stop them.</P>
    <P>Where are the breeders who have been building up these herds, and how are they going to be affected by these regulations?  A farmer in that district, having a valuation of £5 or £6, with a few Kerry cows, may be using a Galloway bull.  He will be affected.  That is the intention, and the ordinary run of Kerry farmers want a Kerry bull and no other, but there are no breeders to be affected in the sense that Senator Sir John Keane means. Sir John Keane doubted if this section could be put into operation at all.  In fact, we will put that section into operation in that district.  I doubt if there is any single body of organised farmers in Ireland who would not enthusiastically support this, and I have heard of no opposition to it from farmers.  Sir John Keane says if you put this into operation it will cause tremendous hardship.  To whom?  I know of none, and I know the area fairly well.  Senator Sir John Keane has made the point that some notice should be given.  I suggest to the Senator that an amendment like this will meet the case.  Remember, you are dealing with an area where at present there are largely only Kerry bulls, and where three-fourths of the bulls would be rejected under sub-section 2.  The amendment I suggest is: &ldquo;No regulation made by the Minister under this section shall come into force until the expiration of one month after it is made.&rdquo; They will then have all the notice in the sense that the Consultative Council have discussed the matter, and that a decision has been come to.  If it is right to define an area at all, what is the point of putting it off for a year?</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir JOHN KEANE</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an enormous element of hypothesis in this, I think, until we know how the Minister is going to apply these things.  It is largely guessing.  A large measure of interference is quite possible under those provisions.  I am not going to press this amendment.  The Minister says that his contemplated action is <Col N="756" /> going to be known one month before the regulation is in force.  All cross breeding is going to be stopped.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;21.&mdash;The Minister may establish a quarantine station in the Free State, and make suitable arrangements therein for the reception of imported cattle and for their care for a period to be prescribed by him, but no cattle shall be brought into the Free State without his licence.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a quarantine station in the North of Ireland, but none so far as I know, in the south.  I asked the Minister on a previous occasion to speak on this subject and to tell us the advantage or disadvantage of having such a station.  I think the Minister misunderstood me then, as he said that a quarantine station would be open to anyone from the other side of the channel who choose to bring cattle into it without licence, and in that way, perhaps, might spread disease.  My idea was that cattle could be imported only and brought to the quarantine station under licence.  Instead of importing cattle to the North Wall, where there is a certain amount of danger of spreading disease, my suggestion is that some place should be selected where animals could be kept for a certain time before being sent to the country. It has been stated that it might be expensive to set up a quarantine station.  It would be if such a station <Col N="759" /> was set up in the way that the Minister mentioned.  Very few cattle, I suppose, are imported and I presume any that are imported come in under licence.  Very few cattle would be in the quarantine station at the one time. Having such a place would make for the safety of the country from any outbreak of disease.  I have been told that there is a place near Dublin where cattle can be kept.  Perhaps that place might answer the purpose that I have in mind.  An island would be the safest place for such a station.</P>
