      <P>I propose that for the future, in the case of a Senator who is taking his seat for the first time, either the Senator who has nominated him or another Senator, at his request, should escort the new Senator to the stairs when he comes up for the purpose of taking the oath.  I think that would be a convenience to the new Senator in many ways.  Any Senator now desirous of taking the oath will please come to the table.</P>
      <P>Mr. John O'Neill, the newly-elected Senator, was then escorted by Senator Dowdall to the table, where the oath was administered by the Cathaoirleach.</P>

      <P>I think it would be desirable to sit to-morrow as one or two of these Bills are urgent&mdash; certainly one of them is urgent.  The Government are anxious to get it through.  Then there is the Report Stage to-day of the Police Forces Amalgamation Bill, 1924, and if that Report goes through to-day it might be convenient to dispose of the Bill in the Fifth Stage and pass it to-morrow, but the reason which I suggest will influence the Seanad in sitting to-morrow, even though they may have to sit only for a short time, is that I shall not find it necessary to convene them again until after Easter.  Therefore, it is desirable that we should be in a position to-morrow to say that no meeting will be convened until after Easter.  We can accomplish that by sitting to-morrow. We can make that quite certain at the conclusion of to-day's business.</P>

      <P>I suggest it would be convenient for the Seanad in dealing with this Bill that we should take up the matters on which there has been either amendment or disallowance in the other House.  We should take them in two compartments&mdash;that is to say, we should first of all deal with those amendments in this House which were agreed to or altered by the Dáil, and when we have disposed of those we should then take up those with which they have disagreed altogether. Dealing then with the amendments of the Seanad that have been accepted in an altered form in the Dáil we will take up Amendment 15.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="956" /> Amendment 15:&mdash;In Section 19, page 10, after sub-section (3) a new sub-section inserted as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Provided that nothing in this Act shall prejudicially affect the right of any local authority to whom additional duties have been transferred under this Act from obtaining such recoupment from the Local Taxation Account or other source for salaries and other expenditure as was hitherto payable in connection with such duties.</P>

      <P>It seems to me this is a case where it would be extremely inconvenient for the Seanad to consider these amendments unless the Minister is present.  This is a Bill which is under the care of an External Minister.

      <P>(i)  in relation to any new building which is exempt from revaluation under the provisions of section 7 of the Dublin Reconstruction (Emergency Provisions) Act, 1916 &mdash;any of the local financial years between the 1st day of April, 1929, and the 31st day of March, 1933;</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LOCAL GOVERNMENT and PUBLIC HEALTH (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>When this amendment was mooted in the Seanad, we had a considerable difference of opinion as to whether this was the place to insert such an amendment or not.  I had no opinion as to whether it was a good amendment or not on its merits, but I considered that the Local Government Bill was not the proper place in which to insert it.  Of course, we all agree that it is within the scope of the Bill, but it is really a matter for the Minister of Justice, because the Minister for Justice has control over the duties of these particular officers.  My duty in respect of these officers, or the duty of local authorities with respect to them, begins and ends with their appointment. We have no control over their duties whatever, and accordingly we consider that this is not the proper place to give effect to this particular amendment.  I have been speaking to the Minister for Justice, and he says that as the law stands the coroner is responsible.  There is no way of relieving him from that responsibility if a death occurs, if he does not hold an inquest and if that death had arisen from causes that might have been criminal or otherwise not justifiable. The responsibility is on the coroner of the time to hold an inquest.  Accordingly there is no necessity to insert such a provision.  If there is any occasion for inserting such a provision it <Col N="962" /> should be put into some Bill brought forward by the Minister for Justice. It is not a matter that concerns me in my capacity as Minister for Local Government, and it does not properly fit into a Local Government Bill.  That is the only objection we have to inserting it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterDeLoughry" hpid="Mr. De LOUGHRY Mr. De LOUGHRY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De LOUGHRY</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say that under the law as it stands at present, the coroner is not bound to hold an inquest in all cases.  It is only in cases where there is a suspicion of foul play that the coroner may get into trouble if he does not hold an inquest.  I think it is generally recognised that it is necessary to hold inquests not alone where there is any question of foul play, but where there might be a question affecting the public interests&mdash;where in the public interests there would have to be precautions taken against a recurrence of such a death.  I believe that it is necessary that it should be laid down emphatically and distinctly that it is the coroner's duty to hold an inquest in cases where there is no foul play at all, but where the death is the result of anything other than ordinary common illness.  I would impress upon the House that there has been gross negligence on the part of coroners in some cases.  Instances of that kind of gross neglect have come under my own notice, cases where there was death as the result of accidents or otherwise and which people generally held should have been inquired into by a coroner's inquest.  These inquests were not held, and I do not know why.  The coroner seemed to have more or less a free hand and I do not think that should be so.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite sure if my recollection is right&mdash; I am speaking solely from memory which is getting rusty now&mdash;but it is always open to anyone to call the attention of the Minister, who would be the Minister for Justice now, to any death which has occurred under suspicious circumstances and, if he is satisfied, he is entitled to have the body exhumed and have an inquest held on it.  I think that power exists to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterDeLoughry" hpid="Mr. De LOUGHRY Mr. De LOUGHRY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De LOUGHRY</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be; I <Col N="963" /> am not quite so interested in that. What I pointed out was that there are any amount of cases where there is no question of foul play.  A person might be killed by a motor lorry and an inquest, if held, would probably bring out details which would minimise or prevent the chance of a recurrence. There are any amount of other cases, such as for instance, where death is the result of an outbreak of fire.  Although there may be no question of foul play it may be absolutely necessary in the public interest to have an inquest or to have the circumstances inquired into. Cases of foul play are covered already, I assume, but I would like to impress upon the Seanad the necessity of laying it down that it is the coroner's duty to hold an inquest in any case where death is not the result of ordinary illness apart altogether from the question of foul play.  I think there is no intention of introducing any other Bill to deal with it and I think this is the proper way.</P>

      <P>This is not a case where it would be wise to insist on this amendment.  When amendments come back from the other House we have to consider, not merely whether in the abstract we are in agreement with them, but whether our insistence on them will achieve the purpose we have in mind. Personally I am in entire agreement with Senator De Loughry in what he desires to achieve but I am not in agreement that this amendment which was somewhat hastily passed in this House will achieve what he desires.  It seems to me that it leaves it still very largely in the discretion of the coroner and that consequently it creates a new disease called &ldquo;common illness,&rdquo; which no coroner could decide.  Senator Dowdall has questioned whether a surgical operation is a &ldquo;common illness.&rdquo;  I think it is, but I have no idea that it would be so held in law.  I did hope when the amendment was passed that the Minister, if he could not find himself <Col N="964" /> in agreement with it, would have come back with it in some new form with which we could agree.  However, as the Dáil has taken the view that this is not the place for an amendment of this kind, I do not think we should now disagree with them.  I hope, neveretheless, that Senator De Loughry or someone in this or the other House will find some opportunity in the future of making the position of the coroner more clear in these cases than it is at present.</P>

Apart from the intrinsic merits of the case&mdash;I do not think they are very strong&mdash;we passed over one hundred amendments, and of these only six have been disagreed with. That is a considerable achievement, and unless these six, or any of them, are of great importance, I think it would be madness on our part to hold up the whole Bill for the sake of an infinitesimal portion of the amendments we have made.  It would involve another postponement of the elections, and we have had these elections postponed often enough.  If we postpone them for a further nine months I think we will be doing a very foolish thing.</P>

      <P>My experience is that there is a great disinclination on the part of some coroners to take the trouble to hold inquests.  In the old days they held inquests on the slightest pretext because it meant money in their pockets.  But since they have been given inclusive salaries they have not been so keen, and I think what Senator De Loughry wishes to get at is that even if foul play is not suspected and deaths arise from other causes, such as motor collisions, inquests should be held.  There may be nothing in a motor collision or there may be a great deal.  I can quite understand a driver in certain cases deliberately colliding with another vehicle.  That may be only one in a thousand cases, but, at any rate, there is this to be said for a coroner's inquest, where death arises other than from natural causes, that you have all the evidence fresh at the time and all the circumstances strongly <Col N="965" /> outlined.  You can occasionally, and possibly frequently, get evidence at such an inquest that may have a very considerable bearing on future actions or proceedings that may be taken as a result of the death.  Of course, that is outside the coroner's duty.  His duty is to see that there is no foul play. Generally what Senator De Loughry is aiming at is very much to be desired, but, under the circumstances, I agree that this is not the time nor the place to press this amendment, and I would ask Senator De Loughry, now that the principle has been pretty well recognised, to withdraw his amendment.</P>

      <P>I seconded the motion because I thought that this was a matter of great importance.  As the law stands at present a very wide and wrongful discretion is given to the coroner.  You may have very good coroners and you may have very indifferent coroners.  A disinclination to take trouble, to go to some distant place and hold an inquest, may appeal to the coroner more than perhaps the aspect of the case that it is one that should be investigated.  The matter of &ldquo;common illness&rdquo; could be very easily dealt with by altering the amendment.  I am sure that it was not intended that the amendment should deal with surgical cases where patients had been receiving proper skilled treatment, but there is a very grave risk in out of the way places of people losing their lives not in a quite regular manner, and I would hope that the Minister would give some assurance that some other Bill will be brought forward that would include what this amendment seeks to do.  I have no intention of obstructing this very important Bill which has been hanging on for so long, but I think that this is a very important matter, and that it should not be lost sight of.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that the amendment fails in its object if it is to make it mandatory upon the coroner to hold an inquest in any case of sudden death, or death in any circumstances which he may think give him reasonable cause for holding an inquest.  Therefore, it is optional with him in any case.  A man might <Col N="966" /> die from an accidental gunshot wound, perhaps from a weapon that he was carrying himself.  That is not common illness.  There are many other cases where a man might lose his life, none of which could be described as a common illness.  I do not know whether these words &ldquo;common illness&rdquo; are defined by law.  If not, I think the amendment would fail in its object, both in removing it from the discretion of the coroner and defining what may be called a &ldquo;common illness.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I hope the Seanad will agree with the Dáil in respect to this amendment.  Apart altogether from the merits of the case, there is here involved the principle of preserving existing rights.  It has been an old established practice, and one which I think will commend itself in all negotiations, as, for example, between employers and trade unionists, that in making new agreements existing privileges are maintained and the new conditions only come into operation as far as new entrants are concerned.  The <Col N="968" /> Bill proposed, as it left the Dáil, that future solicitors shall not be pensioned, but only those who have pensionable rights under Section 8 of the Act of 1919 shall have those rights applied to them.  It is a sound principle, which should be preserved, and which it is dangerous to encroach on.  On the merits of the case one can argue that to a certain extent a doctor is not a full time employee of a local authority, because he has a large private practice. The same applies to midwives and compounders of medicine.  At all events solicitors are dealt with under the Act, and this amendment seeks to take away the rights given to them under an Act of Parliament.  I suggest we should stand fast by that principle.</P>

It was brought up in 1919 to enable friends of theirs to get pensions to which they were not previously entitled.  I do not think we should recognise that as an immutable principle.  In the ordinary case where people were employed for a long time and had pensions those should not, without consideration, be taken away. This is a different case.</P>

      <P>I have no desire to inflict anything in the nature of a speech on the House in connection with this matter.  The object of inserting this amendment when it was considered in Committee was to protect the rights of a number of men who had the courage, when it was not profitable or safe, to transfer their allegiance to the Dáil Eireann Government.  In the Bill as it came to this House it was proposed under this section that employees of a local authority taken into the service of the State would get credit for their service while in the employment of the local authority.  The object of the amendment as inserted in the Seanad was to protect even the individuals who before the 6th December, 1922, were prepared from patriotic motives to transfer their allegiance to the Government.  Those who waited until it was safe were provided for. The men who were patriotic enough to take risks were not provided for.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>The attitude of the Government in respect to this amendment is mysterious and exceedingly disappointing.  The amendment was moved on the strength of one particularly hard case to which I drew attention when some temporary local government matter was before the House last year.  It was a Bill providing for pensions for those who did recognise the old Local Government Board and who lost their positions owing to technical instruction classes being closed down because of the withdrawal of Government grants, and for those who still carried on under the authority of Dáil Eireann which was not then recognised by the local government. There was one particularly hard case of a man who had 16 years' service and who is now an employee in a temporary capacity in the Board of Works.  The position would be improved if the Government placed this man on the permanent staff for which he is qualified.  The head of the Board of Works recommended this course, but a strong permanent official within the Ministry of Finance overruled it.  They can overrule even the President of the Executive Council in a matter of this kind.  The President has interested himself in this case, and is informed that because of some obstacle raised by some individual in the Department of Finance, this man cannot be appointed, notwithstanding all the things that have been done which are not in strict accordance with the letter of Civil Service Law.  I do not know whether there is anything personal in the matter, but if people knew all that this man did with regard to Oireachtas work, for which there were very few men then competent, they would be inclined to protect him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment only protects a person of that kind in a small degree.  He would have to resign even the temporary position to get a little pension in recognition of past services as a technical instructor.  He sacrificed his career for patriotic purposes, and that is the way he is treated by this benevolent Government.  Is it any wonder that charges are made abroad that the <Col N="971" /> people who gave good service have not been recognised?  If the man were incompetent I would be the last to suggest that he should be appointed to a permanent position.  Admittedly, he is competent, and he has been recommended by the head of the Board of Works for permanent employment. Still, some little person in office is able to prevent anything of the kind being done.  The Minister professes to think that there are scores or hundreds of people affected.  It is well known that that is not the case.  The Minister professes not to understand the meaning of the amendment, and probably has not gone to the trouble to do so.  The other House has thrown out the amendment without having gone into the matter.  The case that was made has not been answered, and until the position is remedied the Government are wanting in their duty towards those who helped it in the fight that enabled it to be where it is.</P>

      <P>I am disposed to support the amendment, but with the permission of the Seanad I ask to be allowed to refer to some of the remarks that were passed.  I ask the Seanad to agree that while we might attack the policy of Ministers or their actions, we should at least reserve criticism of permanent officials who cannot answer.  Some official of the Ministry of Finance not named has been referred to.  I ask the Seanad to remember that the only people who are looking after the taxpayers of this country are the officials of the Ministry of Finance.  To some extent that is what the position amounts to, and if things are not according to rules the Comptroller and Auditor-General may come down on them.  The Minister may say &ldquo;my permanent officials did this.&rdquo; While we may attack the Government and its policy I do not think it is fair to attack the officials.  I agree with the main argument for the amendment, but I hope we will not have permanent officials referred to in the Seanad in future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>From Senator O'Farrell's remarks it appears to be quite evident that this amendment was put in to cover the case of one particular individual.  I think it is generally accepted that we cannot legislate for individual cases.  If we were to pick out all hard cases of the kind and legislate for them we would have a Bill ten times as long as the present one.  Hard cases, it is said make bad law, so that we cannot legislate for particular cases. The case has been put up that the State is under a debt of gratitude, or under some kind of obligation, to a particular individual, not named, and that it is the duty of the State to stand by him and repay him for his services.  If such return is to be made it should be made from the National Exchequer.  If the State is under an obligation to this particular individual it is the State should pay him and not call upon a local authority to do so.  The question has been put to me: How much is involved in money?  I am not in a position to say that.  The amendment is very widely drafted and says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>This part of this Act shall apply to any officer of a local body who before the sixth day of December.  1922, resigned his office under such local body for the purpose of taking up any employment under the control of Dáil Eireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment does not actually say that the officer should have taken up the employment.  It merely says who resigned to take up employment under the control of Dáil Eireann, so that any individual who resigned from <Col N="973" /> a local authority, having that object in view, even though he might never have come under the control of Dáil Eireann, would be eligible for a pension under it.  I do not know, exactly, to how great an extent this might involve the local authorities.  The principle involved is different to that involved in the main section to which this was an amendment.  The object of the main section was to enable the Central Government to avail of the services of an expert official who had attained distinction in any particular line under a local authority throughout the country.  As the law stands at present it is very difficult to get any of these officials to come under the Central Government as, in doing so, they lose their pensionable rights.  It was in order to enable these officials to become servants of the Central Government without loss of pension that the sub-section was put in.  The principle behind the sub-section is different altogether to that of the amendment, the object of which, apparently, is to compensate men for some patriotic services they rendered the State.  I consider that if such compensation is to be paid it should be paid by the Central Government, which has benefited by the services of the individual, and not by the local authority which has gained nothing, but probably is at a loss, by having lost the services of that individual.</P>
