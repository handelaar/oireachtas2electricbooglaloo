      <P>I have been asked by Senator Mrs. Stopford Green to inquire if there would be any objection to having the casket in the Seanad Chamber lent to the School of Art, for the purpose of exhibiting it at the August Show of the Royal Dublin Society.  I told the Senator that I saw no objection to lending the casket but that I would not like to authorise it without the consent of the Seanad.</P>
      <P>Agreed&mdash;&ldquo;That casket be lent as requested.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Senators may like to know how pending legislation stands.  In the Seanad there were two Bills introduced, which stand over during the Recess.  One was the Coroners Bill, 1925, introduced, I think, by Senator de Loughry.  That has been referred to a Select Committee.  Then there was the Land Bill, 1925, introduced on the 17th June last.  Those Bills stand over and will be dealt with after the Recess.</P>
      <P>In the Dáil the following Bills have been held over:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The Industrial and Commercial Property Protection Bill.</P>
      <P>That Bill, Senators may recollect, was referred to a Joint Committee of both Houses.  It deals with patents and matters of that kind.</P>
      <P>The Adaptation of Charters Bill.</P>
      <P>The Oil in Navigable Waters Bill.</P>
      <P>The Electricity Supply (Special Powers) Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="940" /> The River Owenmore Drainage Bill.</P>
    <P>Those Bills have got to a certain stage and will be suspended during the Recess.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Cathaoirleach would allow me to make a few remarks on the Committee Stage of this Bill, which properly should have been made on Second Reading.</P>

      <P>Yes.  I have not put any amendment down, but I would ask the Minister to give us an undertaking that some reasonable notice will be given to those who have had awards or recommendations made in their favour, before any action is taken under this section.  I think they ought to get sufficient notice to enable them to come to agreement with the Minister as regards modification of their ideas and falling in with such ideas as the Minister may have.</P>

      <P>I am agreeable to take the recommendations of the Senator into consideration. But I think that is provided <Col N="941" /> for in sub-section (3) of section 7 of the Principal Act:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Applications to the Minister by the corporation under this section shall be made in such manner and after publication and service of such notices as may be prescribed by the Minister, and before making an order under this section the Minister shall consider any objections which may be made thereto by any persons interested in the site.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>I think what the Senator has in mind is that persons interested should get specific notice that their time has been cut down under this Bill in this way.  This Bill, not having received much discussion here or in the other House, it is possible that those interested may never hear anything about it, or that they may not get to know that the two years' period has been cut down to one year and three months.  I think there should be public notice, or notice of some kind given calling attention to the fact that the period has been cut down in this way.  That would stir them up.  They are entitled to that notice after all. Probably they have not become aware of the fact that the period has been cut down in this way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BROWN</NameTxt>
      <P>There are not very many of them and, therefore, it would be all the more easy to give notice. There is no doubt that it is possible they may not know of this very drastic cutting down of the period.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I may explain what is done by this section.  It is perfectly right.  Under Section 9 of the Act which this Bill seeks to amend, it is provided that destroyed buildings within this area are exempt from rates altogether until 31st March, 1926.  Accordingly, in a case where the landlord under lease or contract of tenancy was paid an inclusive rent&mdash;that is, a rent which included the rent plus the rates &mdash;if the tenant had to pay the whole of that rent he would, during the whole of this exempted period, be paying the amount of the local rates to the landlord. The landlord could put that in his pocket and need not pay anything. That would mean that the landlord would be getting money into his pocket which he was not entitled to get.  What this section does is to give the tenant the right to deduct from this inclusive rent the amount the rates would be if they had been paid.  This also applies to cases where the agreement between the landlord and tenant is either legal or illegal under the Local Government Act.  If the agreement is legal, the whole of the rates ought be deducted. If it is illegal under the Local Government Act, the landlord would still be getting the old poor rate, which is a small portion of the modern rate.  It is necessary, in order that the tenant should have the right to deduct that portion of the rate, that this section should apply to an agreement which is illegal under the Local Government Act.  The section is perfectly right.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Question&mdash;&ldquo;That Sections 5 and 6 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Question&mdash;&ldquo;That the Title stand part of the Bill&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to.</P>

      <P>As this Bill is said to be urgent, perhaps we had better finish it now.  Will any Senator propose the suspension of the Standing Orders so as to enable the Bill to be taken in all its stages now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. BROWN Mr. BROWN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BROWN</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose that the Standing Orders be suspended so that <Col N="943" /> the Bill be taken through its remaining stages now.</P>

      <P>That disposes <Col N="944" /> of our business.  As we are adjourning to-day, I should say that under ordinary conditions it would not be necessary for me to convene the Seanad again before November.  But there is always power under the Standing Orders in the Chairman to convene a meeting if he considers that a position of urgency arises.  You may leave it in my hands, and unless something urgent arises, which I hope may not, we will not have the pleasure of meeting again before November.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 12.15 p.m.</P>
