      <P>That Seanad Éireann approves of the following regulations in draft:</P>
      <P>Registration of Electors (Amendment) Regulations, 1977,</P>
      <P>a copy of which regulations in draft form was laid before Seanad Éireann on the 9th day of December, 1977.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. D. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has asked me to apologise for his absence.  He is, I understand, engaged in the Dáil.  These draft regulations are being brought before the House in accordance with section 7 of the Electoral Act, 1963, which provides that, where regulations under that section are proposed to be made, a draft thereof shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas <Col N="918" /> and the regulations shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each House.</P>
      <P>Section 7 of the Electoral Act, 1963 enables the Minister for the Environment to make regulations providing for the registration of persons as electors at Dáil and local elections.  Regulations under this section entitled the Registration of Electors and Juries Acts (Specification of Dates) Regulations, 1963 were made in 1963 and these contain the detailed procedure in relation to the registration of electors.</P>
      <P>Section 3 of the European Assembly Elections Act, 1977 specifies the persons who will be entitled to vote at elections to the Assembly of the European Communities.  The section provides that a person shall be entitled to be registered as an Assembly elector if he has reached the age of 18 years, is ordinarily resident here and is either a citizen of Ireland or a national of a member state of the Community other than Ireland.  The franchise at Assembly elections will, therefore, be somewhat wider than at Dáil elections, where the right to vote is confined to residents who are citizens of Ireland, and less wide than at local government elections, where all residents enjoy the right to vote regardless of their country of origin.  The section applies the provisions relating to the registration of electors contained in the Electoral Act, 1963 to the registration of electors for Assembly elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because the electorate at Assembly elections will not be identical with either the Dáil electorate or the local government electorate, it will be necessary to distinguish in the register between those who will be entitled to vote at Assembly elections and those who will not and this is the principal purpose of the present draft regulations. The draft regulations propose that electors who are neither citizens of Ireland nor nationals of one of the other member states and are, therefore, entitled to vote at local elections only, will be denoted by the letter (L). Electors who are nationals of one of the other member states and are, therefore, entitled to vote at Assembly elections and local elections will be identified by the letters (LE).  No distinguishing letter <Col N="919" /> is required in the case of Irish citizens who will be entitled to vote at all three levels.</P>
    <P>The draft regulations also provide for sending copies of draft registers and registers to representatives elected to the Assembly and for the supply of copies of the register to candidates, returning officers and local returning officers at Assembly elections and, where necessary, definitions in the 1963 regulations are being extended to include references to Assembly electors.</P>
    <P>The opportunity of the draft regulations is being taken to remove certain provisions and references in the 1963 regulations which were rendered obsolete by the Local Elections Act, 1972 and the Juries Act, 1976.  The 1972 Act repealed the provision whereby a person could be registered as a local government elector by virtue of the occupation of land or premises and the Juries Act abolished the need to identify on the register persons liable to serve as jurors.</P>
    <P>A detailed explanatory memorandum has been circulated with the draft regulations.  If the House requires further clarification on any point I will be glad to assist.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PierceButler" hpid="Mr. Butler Mr. Butler">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words on this Bill because I think it is a very important Bill.  Since we are declared one of the rich nations of the world, at least by Senator Whitaker, I think we should realise our position and realise what we owe to the under-developed nations of the world.  We have much to offer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have learned much in the past about famines.  We have had a famine of our own in the last century and it is written in our history books what happened during that famine and the need for help.  From that time we were a generous nation and we gave <Col N="920" /> financial subscriptions to many organisations to help the Third World. We can go back to our school days and think of the weekly subscription we gave to the black babies in school and that in itself was a lesson to us here that something must be done by us and by other nations to help the Third World.  It is vital and important. It is important for a number of reasons because if we do not help now we may be looking for help later on. If we help the Third World now, perhaps it will be the Third World's opportunity to help us in the future. That may be in the long term but we must do what we can for the poor. There are 700 million people living in absolute poverty in the world.  The more we think about it the more we should be ashamed.  The rich nations should be ashamed of themselves for not doing something about it before now.  I hope they will learn their lesson and do much more than has been done in the past for these nations.</P>
    <P>The type of help given can be in many forms.  They must get financial help, educational help and expertise from the countries who have expertise to give.  We, in Ireland, are proud that we are an agricultural country and have expertise in this field.  The Third World needs that kind of expertise to develop their lands.  It is from the land that the beginning will come.  It is from the produce of the land that starvation will be eradicated.  We have something to give in that direction and we should not hesitate to give it.  We are talking about 700 million people. We are a small nation with a population of some three million.  What can we do in relation to 700 million?  We can give.  If we sent a number of well-qualified people they can educate thousands.  We already have religious people out there who would be in a position to bring people together so that they could listen to the advice of our people out there.</P>
    <P>We would have to get to know the native skills but it would not take educated people long to learn these. We can give food&mdash;small quantities because we are a small nation.  If we give this we will embarrass the rich nations into doing likewise.  We are a Christian nation.  Let us be Christian in <Col N="921" /> this.  Let us recognise what is required and do what we can for them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CLambert" hpid="Mr. Lambert Mr. Lambert">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lambert</NameTxt>
      <P>There appears to be a general consensus that the amount being proposed to help the Third World is too meagre.  However, my thoughts are directed to the fact that the amount being allocated has had to compete with enormous amounts that are required in a great number of other Bills. We must look at ourselves and not lose sight of the fact that our &ldquo;output per head of population&rdquo; is one half of that of the UK and one-third of that of Germany and the USA.  In the NESC report on &ldquo;Population and Employment&rdquo; Ireland fares badly, even in comparison with the smaller continental EEC countries, in terms of &ldquo;output per head of population&rdquo; and &ldquo;output per person at work&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The best way of aiming to increase the contribution to a higher level in future years is, as the NESC report points out, by aiming at achieving by 1986 either full employment at European levels of output per head or full employment at European levels of productivity. This is in the hands of the Minister for Economic Planning and Development.  However, in the meantime there has been a consensus in the debate on the need for an educational campaign on our responsibility to the less fortunate nations.  If the theme of the campaign could only illustrate how well-off we are regarding climate, health, food and other natural resources in comparison with the unfortunate millions of people in the Third World, as Senator Whitaker has pointed out and Senator Goulding has illustrated in her first-hand experience of this, we would see that in return for our good fortune we owe to humanity the obligation to contribute a little more effort in order to generate the greater productivity necessary to give us the extra wealth, the employment and the opportunity to increase our allocation in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the greatest human characteristics is an inherent willingness to help our fellow beings when one comes face to face with immediate distress or disaster.  If only this instinct could be developed to awaken one's conscience to an on-going responsibility then we <Col N="922" /> would be on the way to establishing the kind of purpose in life that has been lost through the lapse in the adherence to the discipline of Catholic teaching or to the Protestant ethic or, indeed, to a basic conscience in giving an honest day's work for an honest day's pay.</P>
    <P>I therefore suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that he might encourage a supplemental allocation to the forthcoming &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign under the heading of a &ldquo;Work Irish&rdquo; campaign which could embody our responsibility to the Third World as well as to our own country.  This could serve a dual purpose in helping us to increase the rate of growth in our gross national product and, at the same time, bring a fuller realisation to everyone in his daily work and daily life that greater monetary rewards for selfish reasons also involves an unselfish commitment to contribute to the betterment of humanity, whatever our beliefs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer very briefly to a report, of which I trust all Senators have a copy.  It is the report by Mary Sutton published by Trócaire and by the Irish Commission for Justice and Peace.  It seemed to me last week that there was a follow-up to something that Senator Mary Robinson said which suggested that we were going to politicise this issue in a party sense in the Seanad.  I hope we will not.  I agree that a consensus is emerging.  It is a sterile exercise for politicians to say in party political terms that X did more or Y did more. Putting this in context, we all have to say that none of us did enough&mdash; whether it was slightly less or slightly more, it was very far from being adequate. I commend to people the report of Mary Sutton.  I hope it will be studied because it seems to me that it is fair, careful and thorough and, so far as it is possible in any party political sense, it is completely non-partisan. Of course it is on the side of increasing aid but then that is absolutely proper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us talk about money.  For example, looking at the table on page 22, regarding the overseas development aid commitment, I see that if <Col N="923" /> we were to reach the target of .35 per cent of gross national product next year it would amount to £15.7 million and the following year it would be £21 million.  Those are large sums of money and we are far from being rich enough to be lighthearted about sums of this sort.  Put into the context of our gross national product, which after all is 300 times as big as those sort of figures, or put in a totally different way into the context of the annual expenditure per person on cigarettes or drink or the two combined, or in the context of our national expenditure on any one of a large number of things, the sum of money is small and it is precisely because it is expressed as a percentage of GNP that the amount is appropriate to each country.  The Germans and the Americans are three times richer but then their GNP per capita is three times bigger and the size of their contribution in terms of each citizen is three times bigger.  It is graduated.</P>
    <P>I will not put the remainder of what I had to say, and I will be very brief. I do not see aid to the Third World in terms of duty or altruism; I see it as self-interest, hopefully enlightened self-interest, which is necessary for our own survival.  The oil crisis which did awful things to us has, in fact, done much more serious things to the poorest countries.  It has taken all their reserves and more and the price of what they have to import in terms of certain categories of raw materials, plus oil, has risen much faster than their exports.  The Third World's economic position has deteriorated sharply as a result of the rise in oil prices, much more sharply than the position of the developed world.  In other words, the gap is opening fairly briskly between the richest and the poorest.  It is not being stabilised; it is not being closed.  What does that mean?  I am not prepared to document or argue over it.  I take it to be so and I take it that those who look at the figures can convince themselves that it is so.  It means that in a period of better communications the people who see the gap of income widening are now people with access&mdash;even if they are only to look in through a shop <Col N="924" /> window&mdash;to television programes. They occasionally see movies; they occasionally see photographs in newspapers. They are no longer ignorant about the standard of living of the developed world in the way that they might have been 25 or 50 years ago. They know that the gap is widening and therefore their sense of political outrage and their sense of being exploited and oppressed is burgeoning all the time.  That means that the attractiveness of alternative routes of development in political terms becomes much greater to them.</P>
    <P>The dilemma seems to me that if the developed world to which we do belong does not bring the undeveloped world along a path of development that makes the citizens of the undeveloped world richer at a fairly appreciable rate then they will pick a path of development of a totally different kind that certainly the Americans and some of the other great powers in the world will not like and will not tolerate and we will be faced with the circumstances of a world war. It is not that the old countries of Europe are going to fight each other and probably not even the people in the Middle East are going to fight each other but the possibility of a world war is concerned with the control of raw material sources and the control of some of the great countries which are rich in people and raw materials but poor in income. Whether we can avoid the partitioning of the Third World between the great powers and therefore avoid a world war depends on bringing them on a path where they grow rapidly and satisfy wants.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of humbug and self-interest and, to use a simpler term that the young like nowadays, a lot of &ldquo;rip-off&rdquo; in aid.  If anybody wants to find out about that there are the studies of Gunnar Myrdal and his people in Stockholm which documents it.  A lot of the aid given by the developed countries has been aid in the interests of their own economies. A lot of the things given to the Third World have been entirely inappropriate. They do not need tractors, they do not need high technology; they need alternative technology which is designed to the <Col N="925" /> limit of science but which is operated either by human labour or by the labour of draft animals and which is extremely labour-intensive.  To the extent to which we give them technology appropriate for us, we steal their reserves of money and we bind them to our technology and, far from helping them, we hurt them.  A great deal of aid has been aimed at extending the domination of one or other of the great power groups through physical control and commercial contacts, the network of spies and so on. Imperialism is not a fashionable word any more but it is the neatest word I know to describe the unequal relationship in economic terms between developed and undeveloped.  It still exists and the undeveloped world is still being exploited.  The world market is manipulated to pay them too little for their raw materials.</P>
    <P>If we are genuinely concerned then it seems to me that psychologically we possess some great advantages.  We possess the advantage of understanding psychologically and remembering oppression and exploitation.  We are more psychologically inclined to identify with the oppressed than with the oppressor and that means we can treat people of another skin colour as if they were equal human beings.  That is very important.</P>
    <P>We are not so dominated by big industry that we are determined to export that sort of technology.  We do not possess it ourselves.  We are not determined to export it in the way the Americans, Germans, French or Swedes might.  We have all the traditions for playing a good role, a role that goes by example far beyond our numbers or the possibility that we possess to influence directly and physically&mdash;we would be mistaken to exaggerate that.  The example role is very considerable.  Our acceptability is considerable, our psychological position is advantageous.</P>
    <P>I hope we will reach the 0.35 per cent target fairly quickly and then the 0.7 per cent target within a reasonable time after that.  We must do it on the basis of national consensus because it will mean diverting money from things that we would like to do <Col N="926" /> at home.  There are always choices when it comes to resource allocation and it will mean that if we give it to others we cannot have it to spend ourselves.  If we can get political consensus to do that, hopefully whoever is in power will find it easier to do. We can only get that consensus on the basis of the conviction which seems to me central and it is the reason that I come back to labour it in the closing words of what I have to say. Bringing the Third World on to our sort of path of development, and satisfying at least the basic physical wants fairly quickly, is not a matter of altruism; it is a matter of self-interest, of guaranteeing that we can avoid a world war.  It is, in the circumstances, in military technology now and in the foreseeable future, a matter of guaranteeing the survival of the planet because we cannot separate the bits in military or economic terms any more. It is a matter of self-interest, so hopefully we can get the consensus to achieve the targets quickly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and I do so in the spirit of the Declaration of Human Rights of the United Nations, Article 25.  This is the spirit in which I think it should be welcomed. Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care.  In other words, where you have nearly two billion people living in squalor, filth, and suffering from malnutrition, disease and so on, any aid that goes to a country should go in that spirit, not so much on the basis of a charity but rather as an obligation.  In this respect I am very pleased to see that not only are we continuing with the commitment already made but that there is an increase. Whether in fact the amount of the increase, having regard to the overall problems and difficulties our own nation faces, is desirable or not is a debatable point.  Possibly we could have afforded more but I will not quibble because I am delighted to see it not only continuing but that there is an increase in the amount being provided.  Possibly in a healthier state, <Col N="927" /> we will see that continuation and a more substantial increase.</P>
      <P>It is very hard to bring the position home to a lot of people although it can be done by the media.  People are conscious of it.  You can get a very emotional reaction but if you depend on charity, unless you make the collection straight away the emotion dies quickly.  It is imperative that the State should always have this commitment to the less well-off people in the world. My colleague, Senator Keating, says that there is a certain amount of enlightened selfish interest.  To some extent a lot of the things we do are in that kind of vein.  I do not think it is wrong to think of it in that term.  At the same time I also feel, while we are thinking of it on the basis of selfish interest, in the way it was expressed by Senator Keating, whether we like it or not the United Nations' declaration imposes a moral obligation on us.  Again, without delaying the House as there is a general consensus on the Bill, it is good to see the increase. I wish it were more and I look forward to its continuation.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill in common with the other speakers.  I only wish to say that the Bill and the effort involved in the Bill is only a drop in the ocean compared with what is needed and what will be needed to solve the problems of the Third World. As a nation we suffered famine in the past and we had our problems.  Other nations came to our assistance at that time.  Even though there was no such body as the United Nations or any similar body of organised nations then, there were nations who came to our assistance at that time.  We can say that as a nation which has secured its independence, its own Government, its own institutions, it is only right that we at this time should make our contribution, small though it might be, to ensure that we set a headline for the people who can afford to do more, who should do more and who will have to do more if we are going to help the Third World in its efforts to establish itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Famine, wherever it may be in the future, will be accepted as a drag on <Col N="928" /> the whole global world because we are living in a global world at the moment. All nations, no matter how small, some fighting for independence, some who have independence and do not know whom they are going to fight to maintain it, can help those who are in need.  Some have more than they need and others have less.  Unless a dream in the minds of world statesmen comes to pass, that all of the haves will give some day to the have-nots, we will never be able to solve this world problem as it should be solved.</P>
    <P>A nation like ours, subjected for more than 700 years to the impositions of a stronger power, eventually throwing aside the trammels. knows more about the problems of the underdog than the greater nations who never had to suffer as we suffered.  It will be up to us, in every forum in which this nation is engaged, to ensure that our voice, small though it may be, can be very loud in sustaining the views and the needs of the people who are in need, the Third World.</P>
    <P>Let us also face the fact that, apart from what we as a nation do at Government level, all our people at personal level need to contribute.  I am sure everybody listening to me is contributing to some organisation or other which is engaged in doing things for the Third World.  I would say that the contribution from the people in their own individual right is far more than the State is contributing but this is only as it should be.  This is because we, as a Christian people, recognise the needs of the Third World.  Cynics might say: &ldquo;What does your contribution mean, or even the Government contribution or even the contributions that individuals make?&rdquo;  Over the total picture, perhaps, it is small but if every community of our size that has something to contribute, were to contribute as much as we do, and as we will, then the problem could be solved sometime, maybe not tomorrow, maybe not next year but eventually.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. D. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate was distinguished by commitment, compassion, <Col N="929" /> concern and finally by consensus.  I am most grateful to the Senators for their contributions. Brief though they were they contained the general feelings of the nation as a whole and for my part I am grateful to them for the non-controversial fashion in which the IDA Bill before the House was received by them.</P>
      <P>During the course of their contributions I took some notes.  In fact, for the benefit of the historians who will come to look at this House in years to come, this is, in fact, the third occasion in which I have been in the House with this Bill.  The matter has been articulated by Senators on three separate occasions.  I have now formulised the notes which I made during those sessions.  If, at the end of my, hopefully, brief but equally committed contribution I have not dealt with any points which have been raised by the Senators I will be glad to do so within my competence and my knowledge of the Bill.</P>
      <P>This IDA Bill is not a direct function of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  In fact, it is a matter which in the normal way is dealt with by the Minister for Finance.  I am dealing with the matter on the basis that it is a Department of Finance function having regard to the World Bank features of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have pointed out, the general agreement and welcome by the Senators of the Bill was certainly appreciated. I think they will agree that the work of the International Development Association is of crucial importance to the developing countries.  In the context of this Bill we are talking about a minimum of 750,000,000 people living in the most abject poverty.  I was very glad to hear Senator Goulding stating that she spoke from her own first-hand experience of visitations to these various areas over the years.  I had the privilege, last year to visit the Indian sub-continent, including Bangladesh and Pakistan. When I say &ldquo;the privilege&rdquo; I do not know whether I would consider it a pleasure.  I do not wish to be inhospitable to my hosts but certainly what I saw I think was reflected in the brief but concerned contribution of Senator Goulding.  If one takes what we consider <Col N="930" /> to be our poverty line and relates it to the horrors one sees in the Indian sub-continent and elsewhere, I reckon that they would consider our poverty to be somewhere in the nature of luxury.  That is the reality of the situation.</P>
    <P>To return to the general and specific points made by the Senators, the present replenishment of the $7,638 million will allow the IDA to continue to increase the value of their commitments in real terms over the next three years.  In the last few days we have become aware that the replenishment is now fully effective as members allocated 80 per cent of the replenishment they formally committed themselves to contribute.  We cannot give a formal commitment to contribute until this very important legislation passes through the House.</P>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald and others had some doubts under a number of headings, for instance, whether the development assistance really found its way to the people for whom it is intended, and those people most in need of help.  The most successful outcome of the prolonged negotíatíons on International Development Association Five demonstrates the widespread support for IDA in the international community. The larger industrialised countries with close strategic, economic, financial and traditional links with the developing world have to set a balance between the level of their bilateral aid programmes, which they can control directly themselves, and contributions to multilateral institutions such as the World Bank and IDA.</P>
    <P>The continued strength of their support for IDA must, therefore, be taken as a reflection of the honesty, efficiency and appropriate and united nature of the IDA's operations.  We share this view.  This happy result has not been achieved by any accident. The IDA are constitutionally bound to aim their lending at areas for which neither commercial nor World Bank finance would be available.  Only economic considerations can be taken into account in arriving at decisions.  The IDA operate an extensive system of internal and external audit and financial controls which allows representatives <Col N="931" /> of donor countries to air any views they may have on the handling of the funds provided.</P>
    <P>Despite the wide range of technical assistance, economic and agricultural research, aid co-ordination and interagency co-operation activities of the World Bank group as a whole I think I will prove to the Senators that administrative costs are effectively kept to a minimum.  Total World Bank/IDA administrative expenses in the financial year 1977 at $213 million will come to about 3 per cent of the $7 billion committed in loans in that year. The effectiveness of World Bank/IDA operations in alleviating poverty is continuously under review.  While economic growth as such has never been the sole aim of the World Bank/IDA lending, as the Minister for Foreign Affairs pointed out in the Dáil, the World Bank group are increasingly concerned to find projects which will directly affect the living standards of the poorest sections in developing countries.</P>
    <P>Senators Whitaker and Markey had some queries about the level of the Irish contribution to IDA Five.  Since the notes I have prepared were typed a similar number of queries have arisen on the same point.  At £5.8 million the contribution is nearly twice their contribution to IDA Four three years ago. It has been suggested that donors might maintain IDA Four shares in all IDA Five replenishment from the traditional donors of $7.2 billion.  However, I might point out that the calculation was done in dollars.  This meant that expected contributions in their own currency of countries whose currency had floated down against the dollar were inflated, and <i>visa versa.</i>  When one considers that in general those countries whose currencies had fallen in value were hardest hit by the recession the shortcomings in this method of calculation are clear.  In Ireland's case this method of calculation suggested a contribution of over £7 million.  That is a 130 per cent increase over our IDA Four commitment whereas the average increase in dollars for the replenishment was 60 per cent.  In the event, the undertaking to seek legislative <Col N="932" /> approval for an Irish contribution of £5.82 million was warmly welcomed by the bank management.</P>
    <P>As Senator Robinson pointed out, although the replenishment covers a three-year commitment period payments are spread over six to nine years as projects in developing countries for which funds have been committed come to fruition.  Payments are not spread evenly over the period but come to a peak in the period three to six years after the replenishment becomes effective.  Furthermore, payments overlap with payments under previous replenishments and replenishments to be agreed.  Payments for 1978 are expected to come to about £1¼ million.  IDA Six negotiations will start next year. I think Senator Robinson will agree, therefore, that the process is a continuing one and a continuously expanding one.</P>
    <P>Another matter relates to the use of the word &ldquo;unfair&rdquo; in my opening statement.  I was brought to task on that particular point by Senator Whitaker.  I accept his criticism.  I think the use of the word &ldquo;unfair&rdquo; was necessary.  I accept full responsibility for its use in my opening remarks.  It was possibly the wrong word to use in the context of what was stated.</P>
    <P>It might be no harm at this stage to clear up a point about our subscriptions to the capital of the World Bank.  It is true that as a member of the World Bank Ireland has benefited substantially from its advice and financial assistance through the years. Membership is obviously a <i>sine qua non</i> for receiving assistance.  The contribution to the bank's resources, which counts as official development assistance, did not have to be made to secure these loans.  To count as ODA, Ireland's paid-up capital in the bank had to be released in useable form, that is, a form which the bank could use in its lending operations.  Many developing countries which receive loans from the bank are not able to contribute to its resources in this way. However, as a Part I member of IDA, Ireland will now be expected generally to release in convertible form any further increases in its paid-up capital. The borrowing phase of our relationship <Col N="933" /> with the bank ended some years ago.  No new loans have been received from the bank since 1975.</P>
    <P>I would remind Senators that the Bill refers specifically to the International Development Association and that it is requesting payment to the replenishment of the fifth fund.  In the circumstances, the debate was rather extended&mdash;I do not say this in criticism &mdash;into the general area of overseas development aid.  It is a natural corollary to it, that it might be extended, but in the circumstances that might have been going outside the terms of reference of the Bill.  However, Senators had the opportunity to express their point of view on ODA. I think on the basis of the natural courtesies, that I should be expected to reply to them.</P>
    <P>The Senators, as I have said, took the opportunity during the debate to comment generally on the problems of the Third World, and what the appropriate Irish response to the Third World should be.  The appropriate response, apart from the financial aspect, which is very important, is one of anxiety to continue to commit ourselves in every way possible to the Third World.  Senator Conroy pointed out, although I do not necessarily agree with him, that it is not all about finance.  That is a reasonable point of view but I would respectfully suggest to him that it has a lot to do with finance.</P>
    <P>To return to the various contributions and to the notes I have made on them, while most of our multilateral commitments in the field of overseas development assistance arises as a result of the obligations of membership of various international organisations I would like to dispel the notion that all that is involved on our part is a cheque-writing exercise. This may answer Senator Conroy's point.</P>
    <P>The development policies and programmes of these organisations are the direct responsibility of the member governments of the organisations concerned. This country has a role to play both in the process of policy formulation and programme implementation. I should like to mention, in passing, especially as some Senators <Col N="934" /> referred to the problem of food scarcity in the world, that this week the governing council and executive board of the recently established International Fund for Agricultural Development are holding their first session in Rome.  Having ratified the agreement establishing this fund in October, and having pledged an initial three-year contribution of £570,000, Ireland is a member of this governing council which will have a responsibility for the overall policy of the fund. In addition, we are part of a five-country &ldquo;constituency&rdquo; for the purposes of representation on the executive board, which is a body of 18 members with responsibility for the management of the fund.  This involves a fairly intensive co-ordination of policy both within our own constituency&mdash;this is of primary importance to us&mdash;and among the member states of the European Community.</P>
    <P>It is through the Community to an ever-increasing extent that Ireland can play a meaningful role in relation to the aid activities of these international organisations.  The process of harmonising member states' development policies, in the context of international organisations, such as the United Nations and the United Nations' Conference on Trade and Development&mdash; UNCTAD&mdash;is well under way.  While this will inevitably take place gradually it is undeniable that through the adoption of unified positions the Community can exercise a most significant influence on international development. Through the Lomé Convention, for example, the Community is already in the forefront of efforts to establish a more equitable international economic order.  The convention explicity acknowledges the reality of inter-dependence and recognises, as the Minister for Foreign Affairs recently stated, that &ldquo;we are no longer living in a world where the better off give something of their surpluses to the poor&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Our programme of bilateral assistance is, as yet, small but it represents a significant acknowledgment of our willingness to do something more for the Third World than merely fulfil the obligations which arise in this <Col N="935" /> respect from Community membership and from membership of international organisations.  Senators will be interested to know that last evening Dáil Éireann passed a token Supplementary Estimate to enable certain unexpended multilateral aid funds to be transferred to the bilateral programme so that additional commitments could be made before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>I was very glad to note the approval of many Senators for a policy utilising the expertise and resources available in Ireland to the maximum extent possible in our development co-operation with developing countries.  This is given effect partly through encouraging the involvement of Irish organisations. Many Senators made this point, which is a reasonable one, that in addition to the financial commitment, which is required by the nation as a developed nation to the less well-off countries, to the multilateral organisations, there are many other agencies which give magnificent assistance to the Third World and elsewhere.  This has partly given effect to encouraging the involvement of Irish organisations in the operation of aid programmes of multilateral agencies, but mainly through the bilateral aid programme administered by the Department of Foreign Affairs, and, of course, the activities of the Agency for Personal Service Overseas&mdash;APSO&mdash;which is presided over by Senator Whitaker.  He spoke with great authority and he spoke generally on a subject with which he has been deeply involved and deeply committed to.  I am grateful to him and to other Senators for their contributions.</P>
    <P>Encouragement and financial assistance are made available to support the mobilisation of the resources available through our universities, voluntary agencies, semi-State bodies, private sector firms, the co-operative movement and other sectors.  The aim of the programme is to draw on the resources available in the country which will be of benefit to the developing countries.  The procedure adopted is that consultations are first held with the developing countries concerned with a view to identifying the requirements that might be met by Ireland. <Col N="936" /> This, effectively, is the mechanics of the lead up to prospective aid.  The necessary skills and resources are then recruited in this country from wherever they are available.  The projects formulated may involve the assignment of Irish personnel, the provision of Irish goods, of professional service, the operation of training courses or a mixture of all these.  In each case the nature of the project is determined with reference to the particular requirements of the developing country concerned.</P>
    <P>In this way finance made available for bilateral aid is spent on projects that have priority rating with the Government of the recipient countries and I think we are able to satisfy ourselves that resources made available are put to good use.  The whole monitoring process is outlined in my introductory remarks in relation to criticism regarding the aid effectively getting to the people for whom it is intended.  This is another feature of our own multilateral and, of course, bilateral aid. We have to monitor it to make sure that it is getting to those people who should benefit from the aid we give them.  Again as has been expressed here, the enthusiasm and commitment of Irish society are channelled into a very practical programme of action.</P>
    <P>I was very pleased, indeed, that Senator McDonald who had to be elsewhere this week had an opportunity of examining a number of bilateral aid projects in Lesotho.  These projects were set up by the Department of Foreign Affairs and naturally by definition I am very pleased that the Senator got such a favourable impression from what he saw in that country. He will be pleased to learn that we hope to develop a number of new projects in Lesotho along similar lines in the near future.  This bilateral programme is proving to be very successful and I should like to assure the House that provision will be made for a significant expansion in future years. It is intended that the bilateral component of the overall development aid programmes will increase at a proportionately faster rate than the growth in the programme as a whole.  I told Senator McDonald that if the reply I have given now was not comprehensive <Col N="937" /> enough, I would be glad to deal with the matter in more detail.  Possibly I should correspond with him but if having read the Seanad debates he is still not happy with the fulsomeness or otherwise of what I have just said now I would appreciate if he would bring the matter to my attention when I would be happy to deal with it in more depth.</P>
    <P>Senator Brennan made a number of excellent points during his contribution. He mentioned the provision of training facilities for people from developing countries and I naturally share his concern that such facilities should be made available as extensively and as effectively as possible.  I welcome his support for the developments in this direction.  Personally I like his idea about the educational establishment for those people going to the Third World.  I think that was basically what the Senator had in mind.  I certainly like that idea and I will have it examined.</P>
    <P>However, in addition to what Senator Brennan pointed out during the course of his contribution, that type of training is catered for through the development of training resources within existing institutions and it might be that an additional new organisation would only add to the pyramid in the context.  However, a substantial amount of technical co-operation with developing countries in the area of education and training is already taking place. This necessarily represents a satisfactory basis for future expansion.  Of course this is not to suggest that the Senator's idea should be dismissed in any way.  It should be examined very critically and if it was found good in addition to those organisations already offering training resources, it would be all the better that we should avail of his suggestion.</P>
    <P>Senator Whitaker in referring to the question of administrative structures in relation to an expanding programme of aid to the Third World, urged that an early decision be taken on the establishment of an advisory council on development matters.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, with whom I discussed this matter, and indeed all the questions raised by the Senator, accepts the need for an advisory council.  At the <Col N="938" /> moment the Minister is at an advanced stage of consultation with other members of the Government about this proposal.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson raised in some detail the question of what target in respect of overseas development assistance this country should aim at in the immediate future.  Again, this question was raised by Senator Keating in his usually clear contribution to the discussion arising from the Mary Sutton Study produced by Trócaire and the Committee for Peace and Justice, if that is the proper title for the committee itself.  I do not say that in any flippant or facetious manner.  Ultimately the target to be attained by all developed countries is the 0.7 per cent of the GNP prescribed in the United Nations' strategy for the second development decade.  It is recognised, however, that some developed countries cannot be expected to reach this target by the end of the decade.  In this respect a resolution of the Council of Ministers of the European Community in April, 1974 acknowledged specifically that three member states, including Ireland, would need more time than others to reach the target. This is because the three countries in question have either domestic structural difficulties, a relatively low per capita income or that their aid programmes are of relatively recent origin.  Pursuant to that Council resolution the previous Government adopted a five-year programme of planned increases in overseas development assistance which has resulted in an overall allocation of £7.3 million in the current year. The amount of next year's allocation is in the final stages of consideration by the Government while the question of the appropriate target which this country might aim at in the immediate future is still being considered and I understand is still under consideration by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>I am very sorry I took so long to reply to the debate but I considered the contributions to merit a fairly detailed reply.  In relation to the contributions made since I prepared the more comprehensive replies just articulated, Senator Butler said that Senator Whitaker declared that Ireland was <Col N="939" /> one of the richer nations of the world. We are reasonably high up in the league of wealthy nations.  We should be grateful for that and I think equally we should take cognisance of the fact that we are well off and better off in relation to the countries whom we would hope to assist through the multilateral and bilateral agencies.</P>
    <P>Senator Gordon Lambert displayed a patient approach in relation to our present economic circumstances and he suggested that we give more notice to the buy-Irish, sell-Irish, work-Irish campaigns, that by so doing will bring up our gross national product and that as a consequence there will be a spinoff to charity arising from the increase in national wealth.  This is a very worthy idea and it is something that should be sponsored and encouraged as far as possible.</P>
    <P>One of the more important statements made by Senator Keating was that to argue about which party did most in this regard was to bring the whole thing down to a futile political argument which was to nobody's benefit. That is the proper approach.  We should not bring this discussion into the acrimonious political arena.  By definition we have to bring it into the political area because we are politicians but to engage in acrimony about who did what is totally wrong in the context.  I appreciate the Senator's articulation of that point of view. He will have listened to other contributions and will agree that generally his guidelines for the debate were followed very thoroughly.</P>
    <P>I should also like to suggest to him that some developed nations can abuse aid to their own selfish national interest.  They produce tractors and other technology which are not required in the first instance by the Third World or the Third World nations to whom those particular pieces of scientific technology are directed.  The Senator continued in his exposition to deal with how the aid should be given.  He pointed out that this nation has a moral place, that it plays a good role, that it has an example role to play and that it has a psychological role by virtue of its <Col N="940" /> history, as pointed out so succinctly by Senator Harte when he quoted Article 25 of the United Nations' Declaration on Human Rights.  If I may paraphrase him, he suggested that we should not be giving this by way of charity, that we should be giving ourselves, our people and our finances to the Third World not by way of charity but by way of entitlement. That is what the Senator was saying and I appreciate his point of view.</P>
    <P>Senator Lyons traced the role of Irish history in relation to the Third World and suggested that Ireland more than 100 years ago was a famine country&mdash;1845, 1848, and 1849&mdash;and now in excess of 100 years on we find ourselves in the role of a developed country.  He said that in our own selfish national interest we might consider that those countries that we are now helping might well find themselves developed countries in 50 or 60 years' time.  That is a point of view that is worth remembering.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything further to add.  Again, my apologies for being rather lengthy but in the circumstances I felt that the contributions required that they should be dealt with in some depth.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Agreed to take remaining Stages today.</P>
    <P>Bill put through Committee, reported without recommendation, received for final consideration and ordered to be returned to the Dáil.</P>

    <Title>Finance (Excise Duty on Tobacco Products) Bill, 1977  (  Certified Money Bill )  : Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Wyse) Pearse Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Wyse)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is designed to comply with Ireland's obligation as a member of the European Communities to introduce with effect from 1st January, 1978, the Community system of levying excise duty on cigarettes.  The Community system has been in operation since 1973 in all member states except this country and Britain who during accession <Col N="941" /> negotiations were allowed until 1st January, 1978, to change over to the Community system because of difficulties involved in changing from their traditional system.  The system under which both countries have operated consists in levying the duty on the weight of raw tobacco.  The Community system, on the other hand, requires that: (a) the duty be levied on the end-product that is, on the manufactured cigarettes, and (b) the duty must consist of a combination of a flat-rate element per cigarette and a proportional element related to the retail price.  The Bill provides the legal and administrative framework to implement the new duty and many of its provisions are, accordingly, technical.</P>
      <P>Each member state is free to decide, within upper and lower limits, the precise combination of flat-rate and of proportional duty it will apply.  It is, of course, free to determine the actual rates under each of these elements. The Community, however, aims at progressively narrowing the gap between the upper and lower limits so as to achieve, in the interest of facilitating trade within the Community, a larger degree of harmonisation of the structure and basis of charge of the duty in all member states.  The first stage of harmonisation which commenced in 1973 provided upper and lower limits on the flat-rate element to be applied by the member states of 64 per cent and 4 per cent of total tax.  Discussions are at present proceeding with a view to setting narrower limits for the second stage which will probably commence in July next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The structural change required to comply with EEC obligations will of itself alter the relative impact of taxation in Ireland on different sizes and qualities of cigarettes.  The flat-rate element in the Community system, because it is the same on all cigarettes, has the effect of narrowing the spread of cigarette retail prices, while the <i>ad valorem</i> element increases with higher prices and consequently encourages a wider retail price spread.  While overall the average duty incidence on cigarettes will not be changed, the new system will generate changes in cigarette prices.  For the reasons I will now <Col N="942" /> indicate, we will be applying a relatively high flat-rate element and this will result in a narrower price spread on our market.</P>
    <P>In implementing this new excise duty system, it is necessary to achieve a combination of the tax elements which will not only meet the interests of revenue but also take account of the the position of the Irish industry.  The Irish tobacco manufacturing industry, which currently employs some 2,200 people, has been influenced by the form of the tobacco duty prevalent for many years.  The impact of the different composite taxation system required by the Community will inevitably cause changes in the market pattern, and it is important that, at least in the initial stages, the resultant difficulties should not be compounded for the Irish industry by the adoption of such a combination of the flat-rate and proportional elements as could be prejudicial to their competitiveness. With this consideration in mind Ireland is seeking, during the discussions in the EEC on the proposals for a second stage of tobacco tax harmonisation, to obtain a high upper limit for the percentage of total taxation to be attributed to the flat-rate element.</P>
    <P>As I said already, the second stage will, it is expected, commence on 1st July 1978.  We will, however, be entering the Community system on 1st January next when the first stage of harmonisation will still be in operation. It is proposed that the combination of the elements which will be applied here from 1st January, 1978, will be 60 per cent specific and 40 per cent <i>ad valorem</i> duty.  The rates for each of these elements for cigarettes would then be as follows: £8.00 per thousand plus 15.7 per cent of the retail price.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the provisions of section 2 of the Bill the new rates of duty will be provided for by way of Government Order.</P>
    <P>Our Community obligations in regard to the structural harmonisation of excise duty on tobacco products extend only to cigarettes.  However, it would be inconvenient to manufacturers to maintain, in conjunction with a post-manufacture excise on <Col N="943" /> cigarettes, the existing pre-manufacture excise on tobacco for other products. The Bill, accordingly, provides for the levying of an end-product duty, which will be proportionate to the weight on pipe tobacco, cigars, &ldquo;roll-your-own&rdquo; tobacco and chewing tobacco.  This change to an end-product duty structure should not result in any price increases.</P>
    <P>The proposed rates are as follows: Cigars, £6.817 per lb.; Cavendish or negrohead, £6.889 per lb.; Hard pressed tobacco, £4.406 per lb.; Other pipe tobacco, £5.538 per lb.; Other smoking or chewing tobacco, £5.753 per lb.</P>
    <P>Senators will not be surprised when I say that the foregoing rates for cigarettes and other tobacco products are designed to maintain existing revenue yield.</P>
    <P>I now wish to draw the attention of Senators to certain of the detailed provisions of this Bill.  Under the new system, excise duty will be levied at the point where manufactured goods are invoiced to traders; at present the duty is levied on the tobacco leaf at the point where it leaves the bonded warehouse for the factory.  Under the current system, payment of duty on leaf tobacco may be deferred to a date not later than the end of the month following that in which duty is charged.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides that, under the new system this period of deferment will run from the new point of charge of the duty but, in order to avoid a revenue shortfall, a &ldquo;catchup&rdquo; arrangement will apply in December which curtails the deferment arrangement for that month, making due before the end of December half of the payment in respect of goods released from bond in that month.  The new deferment arrangements will provide, from the manufacturers' point of view an overall improvement in relation to deferment facilities while, thanks to the &ldquo;catch-up&rdquo; arrangement, there should be no revenue shortfall for the financial year.</P>
    <P>Senators may also be interested in the provisions of section 6 which deals with duty-paid tobacco stocks held by <Col N="944" /> tobacco manufacturers on 1st January, 1978.  In order to avoid double duty payment on these stocks, it is proposed that the duty charged on the stock then held be offset against the duty payments due from the manufacturer at the end of January.  This will enable the new system to operate fully from 1st January, 1978, establishing a clean break from the existing system.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill are described in some detail in the accompanying explanatory memorandum, but if further information is required at this stage I shall endeavour to answer any queries raised in the debate.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House for a Second Reading.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of these unusual occasions on which we have nothing to do but welcome the Bill as it is a consequence of an EEC decision, part of the harmonisation process. This is the first time since the joint committee were established that we have had actual legislation which deals with an EEC directive.  I wonder whether I should not take the opportunity, as a past member of that committee and a proposed member of the new committee, to suggest that some practice be established with regard to legislation relative to directives, regulations and so on that come from Europe where the joint committee have made a consideration of the matter and published a report.  With the masses of documents that flow in to Members of both Houses it is almost impossible for busy Members to keep a tag on the documents and relate them to the various measures.  Perhaps the Executive might do the legislature the civility of reminding them that the committee already have made a report on the matter which is now being legislated on.  This could be done by way of reference in the memonandum generally circulated with Bills or in the Minister's speech, or in some other manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This particular one was very well studied, considered and reported on.  It is fair to say that the Minister and his predecessor have moved along the lines which the joint committee, having heard everybody, wished them to move <Col N="945" /> along.  They might not have done so and it might then become all the more relevant to consider what they had reported.  This is just a suggestion.  A question for the consideration of the House also is how they could monitor this matter.  In saying that it is also right to take the opportunity of saying that the Minister's departmental officials have assisted that joint committee, giving their views on the documents they have had to consider so that the committee are in a position to make an objective report to the House.  There never was a division on party lines in the joint committee in the past.  That is a general point I though worth making as it could be more important in other cases.</P>
    <P>In relation to what is proposed here I wish to express what I understand is involved for us in this change.  There is not a great deal of advantage in going into a general discussion on whether a proportional system of taxation of tobacco or of anything else is better than a specific system.  The fact is that we have always had in relation to tobacco a specific excise duty on the weight of tobacco which tended to make our tobacco industry one geared to usage of a high-cost product.  In that situation what people concerned with the economy must look at is not the general theoretical advantages of proportional over specific taxation but, at this time and during the medium-term time in which people actually live, what is most desirable for this community.</P>
    <P>It seems to be agreed generally and by the joint committee that the advantage for our industry at this moment lies in keeping as low as possible the proportional element in the rate of taxation. We are talking about an industry which thinking in Ferenka terms is, in terms of employment, 50 per cent greater than Ferenka.  It gives employment to approximately 2,200.  If the last figures I heard are still the relevant figures it is an industry which we should be concerned to protect even if it is only from the point of view of employment.</P>
    <P>We are concerned to keep the proportional element as low as possible and that should continue to be the <Col N="946" /> case, It is very important when we realise this harmonisation derives from Article 37 of the Treaty which is directed against discrimination of any kind.  The more proportional the taxation system the greater the advantage enjoyed by the producers who are able to produce in conditions of low cost.</P>
    <P>Traditionally, our industry has not been geared to that type of production. The re-equipment and the retraining involved in that would be difficult. There is a certain degree of protection in the home market involved in taste and habit and so on which will prevent import penetration which will damage the industry, but there are limitations on that.  Therefore, we are forced in our own national interest to focus attention on the realities behind this harmonisation policy.  It favours those countries which have state monopolies in their tobacco industry.  It favours France and Italy as potential exporters to us, and it favours them against us by enabling them to protect their markets from any penetration we might attempt to make in those markets.</P>
    <P>The proportional system of taxation obviously multiplies the advantage in manufacturers' direct costs.  If you have got a monopoly situation such as the Italian one, when I looked at it the last time it was not possible to discover at what cost Italian tobacco was in fact being produced or whether it was receiving any justifiable profit or not.  In that type of situation a subsidy which is pushed in at the point of the manufactured cost gets multiplied by the taxation into an advantage which is far greater than the retail price, and it is very much in our interest, when we are harmonising our system of taxation, bringing it into line with what is generally in the continental system, to remember that.</P>
    <P>The commission are proceeding at a snail's pace for political reasons in enforcing the breakdown of the monopolies. They will continue to proceed at a snail's pace unless we and other interested parties operate in relation to it.  This is also relevant to such exports as we engage in.  These exports are to the United Kingdom and are generally under contract from the <Col N="947" /> United Kingdom, and if these producers themselves get under pressure from imports into the UK our exports to the UK will be affected similarly and employment reduced.</P>
    <P>This brings me to another point, and that is the economies of scale which is part of the manufacturing cost element.  The economies of scale which are enjoyed in the UK constitute a greater danger because of the cultural overlap, the taste factor, the practice of using Virginia tobacco, common to both countries.  The economies of scale with the proportional system of taxation will give the UK exporter to our market an increased advantage.  These exports at the moment are minimal, the degree of the Irish market becoming penetrated being very modest indeed. This could be different and therefore all our energies, so far as we are concerning ourselves with the tobacco industry, must be concerned to reduce the proportion of rate and keep it under control.  I think this is the Government's policy and it is a policy which will be shared by all the parties in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ValentineJago" hpid="Mr. Jago Mr. Jago">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jago</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise that the Minister for Finance will so arrange the duty that the same income will be produced by way of foreign tobacco. I have looked at the Bill from the point of view of that section of our community which is most criticised as weak-willed, that is, the cigarette smoker.  I am one.  There is no definition in the Bill of what is a cigarette, but the Bill specifies in section 1 subsection (3) the length of cigarette on which the tax is paid, a flat tax based on a cigarette of nine centimetres not including any filter or addition at the end of the cigarette.  It does not state what the circumference of the cigarette should be, nor does it state anything about the contents of the cigarette.  The most popular cigarette at the moment on the market, during a recent advertising campaign by the manufacturers, is what is known as the king size cigarette.  The measurement of that cigarette is six-and-a-half centimetres of the smoking part and two centimetres of the filter, a total of eight-and-a-half centimetres in <Col N="948" /> length.  The flat tax rate on that will be .8p.  But if you produce a cigarette of nine centimetres, plus two centimetres filter, it will still be .8p duty on the longer cigarette.</P>
      <P>With the introduction of a tobacco substitute, which might be successful or might not be, there does not seem to be any reason why the tobacco should not be weakened.  Therefore, what is the manufacturer likely to do in a competitive market?  The larger cigarette as compared with the smaller cigarette means probably very little in the labour content of manufacture. The longer cigarette will obviously have less tax per centimetre of cigarette and, per centimetre of cigarette, the base on which the retail price is calculated, the price will be less per centimetre.  Is it likely in the future that the manufacturer in a competitive market can offer the smoker the best value by producing a longer cigarette?  What would happen if the smoker, who probably smokes the same number per day, is going to smoke more in the future than he did in the past?</P>
      <P>I do not know why they brought in this system in the EEC.  Then there is the basis of control.  In other words, the control, under the Bill, appears to be based on the fact that you have a record of the import material&mdash;a record of losses and waste and a record of what goes out of the factory.  Therefore, what you are controlling is a tax on a product made&mdash; it need not necessarily be a cigarette &mdash;at the end containing the amount of tobacco which it does at present.</P>
      <P>I do not think the Bill would cover a cigarette which did not contain tobacco because the Bill refers to tobacco products and therefore it is possible that if a cigarette comes on the market which has got substitute tobacco it will then be duty free.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to two informed speeches by people who clearly possess both interest and special information, Senators FitzGerald and Jago.  I had the unhappy experience of seeing sectors of our industry severely damaged in EEC circumstances, and of making trips to Brussels and pulling the tails of people's coats and trying <Col N="949" /> to use the machinery and being unable to give adequate protection to the people in question, important and numerous in terms of proportion of our total labour force, like textiles, clothing, footwear and furniture which are important traditional industries and have been severely damaged in Community circumstances.</P>
      <P>The nonsense that we were told was that on the one hand when you have free trade in products you will get compensatory regional arrangements to help disadvantaged areas.  It did not happen.  I listened to the arguments. I recognised, without knowing much about them, the existence of State monopolies in France and Italy.  I was interested in the argument about the relative significance of a proportional and a flat rate.  Senator FitzGerald said what seemed to me to be the most important thing, simply the economies of scale&mdash;big <i>versus</i> little. What is happening in the Community is that people say in the name of liberalism in the European sense with a small &ldquo;1&rdquo;, in the name of free trade: &ldquo;We will dismantle all barriers to the movement of goods and we will equalise all the circumstances in which competition takes place and we will do it as quickly as possible.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I cannot subscribe to that.  That is central to the ideas of the Community, but it seems to me absolutely crazy for a little country like ours.  The analogy is a boxing match where there is a heavyweight and a featherweight and all the things which might be a handicap are removed and the fight is made equal.  We know who will win&mdash; the big one will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know the economies of scale and the financial and marketing clout they have.  In these circumstances they are going to threaten the jobs of 2,000 people.  Senator Jago said he is a smoker.  I am not.  I am a reformed smoker and am now a bigoted anti-cigarette man.  The next time I lapse I will become permissive again.  I am not really very concerned about the interests of smokers.  I think what they are doing is putting up the health contributions for the proportion of the population who do not smoke, because they are wilfully damaging themselves <Col N="950" /> in ways that are perfectly measurable and that are now well known, and it is a mistake to keep on doing that.  There should be two rates of health contributions&mdash;for smokers and nonsmokers, and various other categories of insurance ought to be at different rates.</P>
    <P>However, I am just declaring my lack of support for anything that makes cigarette smoking easier or cheaper.  I am very interested in the jobs of 2,000 people and, therefore, I am moved to ask whether it is necessary to do this at all now and had we not better be dragged kicking and screaming right up to the legal limit and possibly over it and into court before we proceed any further with harmonisations with the Community when the Community are notably dilatory in producing the sort of countervailing wealth transfer across national boundaries that would be involved in a real regional policy, if there was one.  There is not a real regional policy, and until there is, on a serious commitment to it, I query the wisdom of any further harmonisation of any kind.  In regard to every aspect of our industry I would be as obstructive and as protectionist as it is possible to be and do the thing not on the day that it became legally necessary but after a series of appeals to the European Court, if necessary for two, three or four years after it became legally necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Wyse)</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, this Bill is the result of an EEC directive.  It is moving towards harmonising a system.  Discussions took place long before this Bill was prepared to ensure that there was no injustice which would put our manufacturers in jeopardy and consumer interests were also considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a rather technical Bill.  I should like to deal first with a point raised by Senator Keating.  This became necessary in 1973, so we had five years. Personally I could not agree with the point made that it will jeopardise Irish industry.  We must remember that we are members of the EEC and we have got to play out part.  In drafting the Bill and in order to fall into line with <Col N="951" /> the move towards harmonisation, all aspects of the trade must be taken into consideration.  Furthermore, since the Bill passed through the Dáil we have had no representations from manufacturers suggesting any amendments. So I assume that after the prolonged discussions with all concerned the change over is agreeable to all concerned.</P>
    <P>In reply to Senator FitzGerald, the directive behind this Bill was not discussed by the joint committee because the directive was adopted before our accession to the EEC.  A later stage of the harmonisation which I referred to in my speech was discussed by the joint committee.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset deferment is to my mind a tremendous facility to manufacturers not offset by the fact that they would be paying for half the month of December, before the end of January.  At least the manufacturer has had a breathing space to prepare for a duty that might have been levied during the whole of December.  That has been a great help to manufacturers.</P>
    <P>Senator Jago talked about cigarettes. If a cigarette contains tobacco then it is considered a cigarette and as the Senator said it would not be a cigarette otherwise.  Under the EEC directive we will be obliged to charge the same flat rate on all cigarettes. Section 1 (3) of the Bill provides for the charge on each nine centimetre of a cigarette, and that is included in anticipation of further stages of harmonisation.  Under the definition of &ldquo;tobacco product&rdquo;, cigarettes made wholly or partly from tobacco are chargeable for duty on the same basis. I hope that clarifies the position for Senator Jago.</P>
    <P>Senator Keating mentioned health, but of course this is a finance Bill and the Senator's point should be directed to the Minister for Health who I understand is considering the preparing of legislation on the subject.</P>

      <P>I want to take the Parliamentary Secretary up on his dealing with the point I made. I would have thought that there should have been a document in this House, produced in June, 1976 over the signature of Charles J. Haughey, Chairman of the Joint Committee of the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities, which referred to the directives which led to this Bill and which said of them that the harmonisation of excise duties on cigarettes is intended to neutralise the effects of duties on competition and so facilitate market inter-penetration while protecting the revenue of the non-member states to facilitate the penetration of the market by producers of the other members of the Community and which referred&mdash;I will not go any further&mdash;to the existence of the various subsidies which favour the producers who will seek to penetrate this market, and with respect I repeat, for consideration not merely by the Parliamentary Secretary but by the Minister for Finance and all other Ministers to where the joint committee had made a recommendation which is relevant to subsequent consideration in legislation&mdash;that the attention of this House and the other House should be drawn to the consideration by the committee appointed by these Houses of the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This took place more than 18 months ago and how the devil could anybody remember it if it were not a genius like myself who is also a member of the committee?  The ordinary folk who were not so doubly privileged would not normally have knowledge of it, and I think it would be good to have a system whereby we all would have our attention drawn to and an opportunity of looking at such reports when we have legislation before us.  It would <Col N="953" /> save an awful lot of time.  I would not have to be talking like this if I realised the matter already had been considered by a committee of the two Houses.</P>

      <P>Is Bille é seo chun an uasteorainn do na hairleacain a eisítear as an bPríomh-Chiste chuig Gaeltarra Éireann a dhúbailt ó £25 mhilliún go dtí £50 milliún.  Teorainn £½ mhilliún a leagadh síos san Acht um Thionscail na Gaeltachta, 1957&mdash;an tAcht faoinar bunaíodh Gaeltarra Éireann mar bhord reachtúil.  Ardaíodh an teorainn sin go dtí £2 mhilliún sa bhliain 1965 nuair a tugadh cumhachtaí breise do Ghaeltarra chun an tionsclaíocht a fhorbairt sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ar na cumhachtaí breise sin áirítear airgead a chaitheamh ar scaireanna i gcuideachtaí agus ar dheontais do thionscail.  Is chun tionscail agus scéimeanna somhaoineacha fostaíochta a <Col N="954" /> bhunú, a fhorbairt nó a chothabháil sa Ghaeltacht a thugann Gaeltarra deontais agus íoctar iad le cuideachtaí ina mbíonn scaireanna ag Gaeltarra agus le daoine eile gan dul i bpáirtíocht leo.  Is faoi na cumhachtaí a tugadh sa bhliain 1965 is mó atá Gaeltarra ag gníomhú ó shin i leith.</P>
    <P>Cúpla bliain ó shin san Acht um Thionscail na Gaeltachta (Leasú), 1975, a socraíodh uasteorainn £25 mhilliún do na hairleacain agus, de bhrí nach fada go sroichfear an teorainn sin, ní foláir í a ardú arís. Tá fonn ormsa foráil a chur isteach don mhéadú is mó dá ndearnadh riamh agus dá réir sin tá £25 mhilliún eile á chur leis an uasteorainn sa Bhille seo.  I dtús na bliana seo socraíodh go mbeadh airleacain £4.8 mhilliún ar fáil do Ghaeltarra don bhliain ach táimse tar éis an soláthar sin a mhéadú go dtí £7 milliún agus tá £6.4 mhilliún de eisithe go dtí seo.</P>
    <P>Is ar mhonarchana le cur ar cíos do thionscail agus ar scaireanna i gcuideachtaí is mó a chaitear na hairleacain &mdash;nó caipiteal neamhvótáilte mar a tugtar orthu.  Is mian liomsa féachaint chuige go mbeidh ar chumas Ghaeltarra leanúint ar aghaidh leis an obair thábhachtach sin.</P>
    <P>Ar ndóigh, ní ionann uasteorainn reachtúil a ardú agus airgead a íoc amach: is amhlaidh a eiseofar airleacain de réir mar a bheidh caiteachas caipitil den saghas atá luaite agam le glanadh ag Gaeltarra.  Ní miste a rá nach mbaineann an Bille le caipiteal vótáilte Ghaeltarra, is é sin, an caiteachas caipitil sna deontais a thugann Gaeltarra do thionscail: cuirtear an t-airgead chuige sin ar fáil trí Vóta Roinn na Gaeltachta gach bliain.</P>
    <P>Tá eolas faoi chaiteachas uile Ghaeltarra go dtí deireadh na bliana seo caite le fáil i dTuarascáil agus Cuntais Ghaeltarra don bhliain 1976 atá leagtha faoi bhráid an tSeanaid.</P>
    <P>Is d'fhonn fostaíocht a chur ar fáil do phobal na Gaeltachta a théann Gaeltarra faoi chaiteachas caipitil&mdash; idir airleachain agus dheontais.  Léirítear sa tuarascáil a luaigh mé go raibh 3,502 dhuine ag obair go lánaimseartha ar 31 Nollaig 1976, sna <Col N="955" /> tionscail uile a fuair cuidiú ó Ghaeltarra.</P>
    <P>Cé nach beag an dul chun cinn atá déanta ó tugadh na cumhachtaí breise do Ghaeltarra sa bhliain 1965, ní miste a lua gur leagadh síos sprioc sa bhliain 1971: is é sin, lánfhostaíocht sna seachtóidí do na cainteoirí Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht.  Ní dóigh liom gur tháinig méadú tapaidh go leor ar an bhfostaíocht go dtí seo chun an sprioc sin a bhaint amach taobh istigh de chúpla bliain eile.  Tuigim, ar ndóigh, go raibh deacrachtaí ann le roinnt blianta anuas ach beidh mé ag súil le plean chun an lánfhostaíocht sa Ghaeltacht a bhaint amach a luaithe is féidir sna hochtóidí.</P>
    <P>Beidh Údarás na Gaeltachta le bunú an bhliain seo chugainn agus beidh deis againn an scéal ar fad a phlé go luath nuair a bheidh Bille chun na críche sin os comhair an tSeanaid.  Idir an dá linn táim cinnte nach miste bheith ag brath ar Ghaeltarra brú ar aghaidh go tréan leis an obair, agus is mar chabhair chuige sin atáim ag iarraidh ar an Seanad glacadh leis an mBille gairid seo.</P>

Ghoill rud mar sin go mór ar gach Rialtas sa tír seo i ngach iarracht a deineadh an Ghaeltacht a chaomhnú.</P>

Ní maith an rud é an iomad daoine a bheith ag tréigint na tuaithe ach is olc linn ar fad é nuair a bhíonn an iomad daoine ag tréigint na Gaeltachta, mar tá sé de chuspóir againn, faoi mar a bhí ag gach páirtí sa tír seo ó bhunaíodh an Stát, an Ghaeilge a chaomhnú agus labhairt na Gaeilge a spreagadh, agus gan foinnse láidir Gaeilge a bheith ann sa Ghaeltacht ní féidir an obair sin a dhéanamh.</P>

Dá bhrí sin ba mhaith an rud é an méid oibre is féidir a chur ar fáil sa nGhaeltacht.  Tá fhios agam gurb é sin an chuspóir atá ag an Aire nuair a thugann sé isteach an Bille seo dúinn inniu.  Sílim go mba mhaith an rud comhoibriú láidir, éifeachtach a bheith ann idir an IDA agus Gaeltarra Éireann&mdash;an dá dream ag obair go héifeachtach lé chéile chun an tionsclaíocht a fhorbairt ar fud na Gaeltachta. Tá taithí agus eolas ag gach dream acu agus is fearr a rachaidh an obair chun cinn nuair a bheidh an dá dream ag obair go héifeachtach le chéile, agus tá súil agam go spreagfidh an tAire an comhoibriú sin.</P>
    <P>Sílim freisin go mba mhaith an rud ceird-oiliúint a thabhairt dos na daoine óga i ngach áit san nGaeltacht i dtreo is go mbeidh seans ag na daoine sin obair éifeachtach a dhéanamh sna monarchana.  Tá gá faoi leith leis an obair atá á dhéanamh ag AnCO ar fud na Gaeltachta.  Tá mé den bharúil freisin gur féidir cás láidir a dhéanamh airgead faoi leith a fháil ón chiste réigiúnach chun cabhrú le forbairt na Gaeltachta.  Tá súil agam freisin go ndéanfaidh an tAire gach rud is féidir leis a dhéanamh chun uisce, leictreachas agus bóithre a chur ar fáil i ngach áit den Ghaeltacht.  Is é cuspóir an Bhille ná an uasteorainn a dhúbailt ó chúig mhilliún is fiche go caoga milliún punt do na h-airleacain as an bPríomh Chiste chuig Gaeltarra Éireann.  Aontaímid leis sin agus tá súil againn go rachaidh an Bille seo chun tairbhe don Ghaeilge.</P>

      <P>Sula labhróidh mé ar an mBille féin, ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh Aire na Gaeltachta ar an chéad ócáid dó sa Teach seo, is dóigh liom.  Guím gach rath ar a shaothar.  Is cúis áthais dom freisin go bhfuil an tAire ina Aire Gaeltachta faoi láthair mar gur duine de lucht na Gaeltachta féin é, duine a thuigeann an Ghaeltacht, ní hé amháin an Ghaeltacht <Col N="958" /> ó thaobh limistéir tíre de ach muintir na Gaeltachta, a saol, a gcultúr agus a nósmhaireacht.  Mar sin, is breá go bhfuil duine dá short againn i bhfeighil Aireacht na Gaeltachta faoi láthair.</P>
      <P>Mar adúirt an Seanadóir O'Brien, is é aidhm an Bhille seo méadú airgid a chur ar fáil le cabhrú le tionsclaíocht san nGaeltacht go ginearálta.  Nuair a smaoinítear ar £50 milliún déarfadh duine leis féin, is dócha, gur anmhór an tsuim airgead é, ach nuair a chuimhnítear, ar an láimh eile, gur ó 1957 anall a thainig an t-athrú sin, ní mór atá ann nuair a chuirtear boillsciú agus dí-luacháil airgid san áireamh. Ach mar sin féin, feabhas is ea é agus fáiltimid roimh an méid airgid seo.</P>
      <P>Ní dóigh liom go mbeidh aon aighneas faoin mBille seo nó faoin a chuspóirí, sé sin, feabhas agus forbairt a dhéanamh ar an nGaeltacht go ginearálta. Aontaíonn gach duine le tábhacht na Gaeltachta i saol mhuintir na hÉireann.  Is ins an nGaeltacht atá foinnse an dúchais go ginearálta.  Is ann a labhartar an teanga mar ghnáth theanga beo ár muintire.  Is ann is mó a chleachtaítear nósmhaireacht agus dúchas na tíre.  Dá bhrí sin, aon chabhair a lorgaítear le feabhas agus forbairt a dhéanamh ar shaol na ndaoine ansin is dóigh liom gur dualgas don Stát é a chur ar fáil a dhéanamh.</P>
      <P>Ar nós gach áit eile sa tír ní mhaireann daoine, dar ndóigh, ar chultúr amháin.  Tá nithe eile a chaitear a chur san áireamh i saol an duine.  Tá fostaíocht, tithíocht, agus áiseanna de chuile short eile ag teastáil ón duine lena shaol a dhéanamh tairbheach agus pleisiúrach. Tá sé seo de dhith go mór ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta.  Dá bhrí sin, aon airgead a chuirtear ar fáil chucu, is mithid é sin a dhéanamh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thagair an Seanadóir O'Brien don méad daoine a bhí ag tréigint na Gaeltachta.  Is fíor le blianta maithe siar go raibh daoine ag tréigint na Gaeltachta, ach ma bhí, bhí siad ag tréigint na tuaithe i gceanntreacha eile freisin.  Is mór an tuar dóchais domsa ar aon nós&mdash;agus is duine mé a bhfuil eolas maith agam ar an nGaeltacht agus ar an saol mar a chleachtaítear é ansin, mar is <Col N="959" /> san nGaeltacht a rugadh mé féin&mdash; go bhfuil daoine anois ag filleadh ar an nGaeltacht agus go bhfuil siad ag teacht abhaile ón iasacht agus ag tógáil tithe san nGaeltacht lena gclann a thógáil san nGaeltacht, mar gur fearr leo é sin a dhéanamh ná a gclann a thógáil thar lear.  Duine ar bith a théann chun na Gaeltachta feicfidh sé go bhfuil go leor tithe nua á dtógáil san nGaeltacht ag daoine a bhí thar lear agus a tháinig abhaile le cónaí a dhéanamh san áit ina rugadh iad.  Is mór an tógáil croí domsa é sin.</P>
    <P>Is é aidhm chaite an airgid seo monarchana, tionsclaíocht agus fostaíocht a chur ar siúl do lucht na Gaeltachta, agus sin mar is cóir.  Ach ní leor monarchana amháin a chur ar bun agus ní leor fostaíocht amháin a chur ar fáil.  Is dóigh liomsa gur ceart &mdash;agus tá mé dá mheabhrú seo don Aire agus don Teach&mdash;nuair a bunaítear monorchana agus tionscail in áiteanna éagsúla san nGaeltacht go gcuirfí feidhmeannaí i mbun na monarchana sin agus i mbun na seirbhisí sin a bhfuil an teanga go líofa agus go maith acu, agus atá ina theannta sin ina ndaoine a gcreideann ins an gcuspóir atá romhainn, sé sin, an teanga agus an cúltúr dúchais a chaomhnú agus a leathnú.  Tá sé sin an-thábhachtach ar fad mar go minic &mdash;agus is eol dúinn ar fad é seo&mdash; tá áiteanna san nGaeltacht in a bhfuil monarchana ar bun agus faraoir géar, ní hé dúchas na ndaoine ná cuspóir na Gaeilge a chuireann na feidhmeannaí sin chun cinn.  Is dóigh liom gur rud é sin gur ceart féachaint chuige chomh fada agus is féidir.  Is eol dom go bhfuil teora daonna agus teora smachta áithrid nach féidir dul thairis, ach chomh fada agus is féidir sílim gur ceart féachaint chuige sin nuair a bhítear ag ceapadh feidhmeannaí agus daoine eile le dul i mbun seirbhísí.</P>
    <P>Tá sé ráite ag an Seanadóir freisin nach leor monarchana amháin.  Tá cúrsaí uisce go dona in áiteanna den Ghaeltacht.  Níl aon uisce reatha ag dul isteach ina dtithe fós agus is rud é sin a chaithfear a leigheas freisin.  Tá tairbhe eile le teacht don Stát ón <Col N="960" /> nGaeltacht, nach gcuirtear san áireamh go minic, sé sin, tá tarraingt mhór ag an nGaeltacht ar thurasóirí as gach áit ar domhan.  Teastaíonn uathu an nósmhaireacht shaoil Ghaelach mar a chleachtaítear é a fheiceáil ina bheatha.  Téann siad go dtí na háiteanna seo.  Rachadh siad níos líonmhaire go dtí na háiteanna sin dá mbeadh na háiseanna céanna le fáil acu atá le fáil i gceanntracha eile sa tír, agus is dóigh liom nach miste féachaint chuige sin freisin.  Tá cúrsaí leictreachais agus go mór-mhór, ina theannta sin arís freisin, tá cúrsaí bóithre.  Tá na bóithre sa chuid mhaith de na ceanntracha Gaeltachta míshásúil. Níl siad sách maith do na ceanntracha sin mar gur ar na ceanntracha sin is mó a bhíonn turasóirí ag tabhairt a n-aghaidhthe.  Bíonn go leor tráchta orthu agus, dá bhrí sin, ní miste na bóithre a leathnú agus a fheabhsú agus iad a dhéanamh níos sláinne do lucht taistil.</P>
    <P>Tá go leor rudaí eile a d'fhéadfainn a rá ar an mBille seo ach ní maith liom an Teach a choinneáil ró-fhada; beimid ag caint ar na nithe seo arís. Fáiltím roimh an mBille agus tá súil agam go gcuirfidh sé feabhas ar an nGaeltacht agus go dtabharfaidh sé solás agus cúnamh do mhuintir na Gaeltachta.</P>

      <P>Nílim ach chun focal nó dhó a rá ar an ócáid seo toisc go bhfuil an Seanad chomh bruidiúil le gnó inniu agus amárach, agus toisc, chomh maith, go bhfuil geallta dúinn go mbeidh an Bille um Udarás na Gaeltachta a bhunú os ar gcomhair gan aon mhoill agus beidh deis againn ansin, fé mar a deireann an tAire, na cúrsaí seo a phlé go mion.  Ba mhaith liom, mar sin féin, fáilte a chuir roimh an mBille ghairid airgeadais anseo, mar Sheanadóir neamhspleách, mar ní mhairfidh an Ghaeltacht gan bun daingean eacnamaíochta agus tá leas na Gaeltachta fite fuaite le leas na teangan agus le leas an cultúir Ghaeilge.  Tugaim faoi ndeara go ndeireann an tAire ina ráiteas go raibh an dóchas ann uair amháin go mbeadh lánfhostaíocht sna seachtóidí dona cainteoirí Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht. Tá na seachtóidí beagnach gafa tharraing um an dtaca seo, ach fós <Col N="961" /> féach tá geallúint eile san áit chéanna. Tá na hochtóidí anois ag teacht agus tá súil ag an Aire go mbeidh lán-fhostaíocht san nGaeltacht á bhaint amach chomh luath agus is féidir sna hochtóidí.  Tá súil le Dia agam go bhfuil an ceart aige mar nuair a thagann na nóchaidí ní bheidh aon Ghaeltacht fágtha mar tá fianaise anois ann go bhfuil líon na gcainteoirí Gaeilge san nGaltacht níos mó b'fhéidir ná an méid atá fágtha san nGaeltacht.  Mar sin béimid ag faire ar an Aire faoi mar a bheimid ag faire ar na hAirí go léir eile ach idir an dá linn cuirim fáilte roimhe, tréaslaím a cheapachán nua leis, agus guím gach rath ar an obair atá idir lámha aige.</P>

      <P>Ar an gcéad dul síos, fáiltím roimh Aire na Gaeltachta. Bhí an-áthas orm nuair a chuala mé gur fostaíodh mar Aire na Gaeltachta é.  Is fear fiúntach é; is maith ann é agus le cúnamh Dé déanfaidh sé beartas mór ar son na Gaeltachta agus ar son na Gaeilge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fáiltím roimh an mBille.  Is beag an méid airgid é £50 milliún nuair a chuimhnímid ar an carn mor airgid a luaitear sa Bhille Leithreasa a bheidh os ár gcomhair amárach.  Is ar éigean is féidir liom é a léamh amach&mdash; £1,827,930,226.  San mBille seo deir sé i dtosach báire gur Bille é chun an uasteorainn dos na hairleacain a eisítear as an bPríomh Chiste chuig Gaeltarra Éireann a dhúbhailt ó £25 mhilliún go dtí £50 milliún.  Tá géarghá leis an mbreis airgid sin mar, mar adeirtear san sean-fhocal, ní bheathaíonn na briathra na bráithre agus ní bheathóidh caint dhá fheabhas muintir na Gaeltachta, mar caithfidh siad sin maireachtáil faoi mar a chaithfidh gach éinne eile maireachtáil. Bíonn bia, deoch agus fothain ag teastáil uathu san leis agus faoi mar is eol don chuid is mó den Teach seo, is bocht an talamh ar a mbíonn siad ag saothrú agus ag obair ó cheann ceann na bliana.  Bíonn siad ag sracadh chun maireachtála le talamh bocht agus leis an iascaireacht, ach buíochas le Dia tá tionscail eile ag teacht chun cinn go mór le blianta anuas, sé sin tionscail na turasóireachta, agus muna mbeadh an tionscal sin san nGaeltacht <Col N="962" /> ní fheadar cá mbeimís; b'fhéidir go mbeimís gan Ghaeltacht ar bith.</P>
    <P>Tá súil agam go mbeidh an-chomhoibriú idir Gaeltarra Éireann agus an IDA.  Tá sé thar a bheith tábhachtach go mbeadh an comhoibriú sin ann.  Tá cliú agus cáil ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta leis na blianta a fheabhas a oibríonn siad.  Tá an-éileamh orthu aon áit a dtéann siad ag obair.</P>
    <P>Tá dearcadh eile leis maidir le muintir na Gaeltachta agus an Ghaeltacht in a iomlán.  Tá an-chuid daoine agus suim mhór acu sna hiarsmaí a tháinig anuas chugainn os na cianta, iarsmaí atá le feiscint sna hiarsmalanna; cuirtear síos ar chaomhnú na Georgian houses agus nithe den tsort sin agus is maith an rud é sin.  Is maith go ndéantar cúram mór sna rudaí sin, ach tá rudaí i bhfad níos luachmhaire agus níos tábhachtaí againn san nGaeltacht.  Tá an teanga. Is rud beo í an teanga agus is í an teanga an tsnaidhm is mó, is éifeachtaí agus is áille dá bhfuil againn leis na cianta ceoigh le Ré na gCeilteach, an ré a tharla idir Ré na nGréigeach agus Ré na Romhánach i lár na hEorpa.  Téann sé siar i bhfad agus is mór an ní é sin.  Is beag náisiún eile go mbeadh a leithéid le rá acu.  Im' thuairim féin do b'fhiú an teanga a aibheochaint muna mbeadh againn ach na hamhráin agus an ceol atá le fáil sna hamhráin sin.</P>
    <P>Molaim an Bille seo.  Molaim an duine a cheap é agus, mar adeirim, tá an dá dhearcadh ann i gcónaí, maireachtáil mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus cothú agus caomhnú an dúchais, agus is san nGaeltacht atá an fíordhúchas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Fáiltím roimh an mBille seo agus fáiltím roimh an Aire, ach thar gach rud, fáiltím le haon rud a thagann ó Ghaeltarra Éireann go mór-mhór nuair a bhaineann sé le postanna a ghiniúint agus a chur ar fáil sa tír agus go háirithe san Ghaeltacht. Ba mhaith liom an áis a thógáil anois chun é sin a rá go láidir agus ós árd.  Ceapaim go bhfuil a lán airgid ag teastáil chun an job iontach mór atá le déanamh ag Gaeltarra a thabhairt chun críche, agus chun an sprioc atá <Col N="963" /> curtha síos ag an Aire a shroicint, sé sin lánfhostaíocht ins na hochtóidí.</P>
      <P>B'fhéidir nach bhfuil a fhios ag gach éinne sa tír na deacrachtaí a bhíonn le sárú ag Gaeltarra.  Tá siad ag iarraidh tionsclaíocht a bhunú i reigiúin nach bhfuil taithí ag na daoine ar chúrsaí tionsclaíochta iontu agus, ina theannta sin, tá siad ag iarraidh feidhmeannaí a mhealladh go dtí áiteanna san nGaeltacht nach bhfuil iontu na háiseanna a bhíonn ag teastáil go minic ón mheán-fheidhmeannach in aon eagras.  Taobh istigh de dheich mbliana nó mar sin ceapaim go bhfuil job iontach déanta acu.  Tá siad taréis an fostaíocht a mhéadú thar 50 faoin gcéad nó mar sin taobh istigh de chúig nó sé de bhlianta.  Chun é sin a dhéanamh do shocraigh Gaeltarra ar straitéis a bhaineann le gluaiseacht &ldquo;entrepre-neurachta&rdquo;&mdash;b'fhéidir go bhféadfainn an focal sin a úsáid&mdash;a chur ar fáil.  Chuaigh siad amach agus chuaigh siad sa seans ar ghnó a chur ar bun.  Sin é an rud a bhaineann go deimhin le cúrsaí gnó, seans a thógáil, risk-taking ventures. Ceapaim féin nach dtuigeann an pobal go bhfuil job cómh h-iontach sin á dhéanamh ag Gaeltarra.  Le déanaí mhol an tOllamh Timoney ón Ollscoil i mBaile Átha Cliath iad mar cheann desna heagrais Stáit a bhí ag tógáil seans ar theicneolaíocht a mhéadú agus a chur ar fáil i dtionscail bheaga.</P>
      <P>Nuair a dheineann tú rud mar sin, bíonn deacrachtaí ann sa chás go mbíonn laige i gcomhlachtaí éagsúla. Tógann siad i bhfad níos mó ama ná mar a cheapann an gná-dhuine chun forbairt a chur ar fáil agus, mar gheall ar sin, bíonn daoine ag cáineadh Gaeltarra. Ba mhaith liom a rá anseo anois go mba cheart stop a chur leis an cáineadh sin agus cabhair a thabhairt dóibh.  Tá an Bille seo ag tabhairt cabhrach, mar tá sé ag cur an teorainn suas i dtreo is go mbeidh i bhfad níos mó airgead ar fáil ag Gaeltarra.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom, b'fhéidir ceist a chur ar an Aire, an bhfuil sé ar chor ar bith ag féachaint ar an mbac atá air dul ar aghaidh gan chead d'fháil ón Aire Airgeadais i gcomhair gach deóntas mór a bhí le cur ar aghaidh <Col N="964" /> aige?  B'fhearr liom dá mbeadh sé saor suas go dtí, abraimís leath mhilliún púnt nó mar sin.  Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil deacrachtaí ag baint le sin ach b'fhéidir go mba mhaith leis focal a rá mar gheall air.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom freisin cúpla focal a rá mar gheall ar an teanga.  Tá sé clúdaithe cheana féin ag cúpla Seanadóirí ach, ós rud é go raibh baint agam cúpla bliain ó shin leis an chuid sin den obair mar Chathaoirleach ar Chomhairle na Gaeilge, tuigim na deacrachtaí agus tuigim na constaicí a chuirtear ós cómhair na teanga ó thaobh forbartha de.  Ag an am sin, chonaiceamar san gcomhairle go raibh forbairt agus teanga go dlúthcheangailte lena chéile agus do shocraímear ar thuarascáil faoi leith ar a dtugtar Gníomh don Ghaeltacht a chur ar fáil.  Bhí an tuarascáil sin curtha ar fáil ag deireadh na tréimhse d'iar-Rialtas Fhianna Fáil agus taobh istigh de na blianta atá curtha tharraing ag an Rialtas eile, níl faic déanta mar gheall ar seo.</P>
    <P>Tá an tAire taréis a rá ins an óráid a chuir sé amach, go raibh sé chun Údarás na Gaeltachta a bhunú sa bhliain nua.  Tá súil agam go ndéanfar é sin go tapaidh mar tá an iomad éiginnteacht ag baint leis an rud seo agus ós rud é go mbaineann an Ghaeltacht le bun-sprioc an náisiúin is é sin fostaíocht, tá sé tábhachtach nach mbéadh aon éiginnteacht ann ó thaobh Údarás na Gaeltachta de.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom, freisin, cur síos beagáinín ar chúrsaí cultúrtha.  Rud a rinneamar nuair a bhí Fianna Fáil in oifig cuireadh Radio na Gaeltachta ar bun.  Tá fhios againn go léir go raibh Radio na Gaeltachta in ann a lán de na Gaeltachtaí atá scaipthe ar fud iarthar na tíre a thabhairt le chéile le saghas aontacht a thabhairt don Ghaeltacht. Ba mhaith liomsa anois go mb'fhéidir go bhféadfadh an tAire bheith ag súil le córas teilifíse a chur ar fáil don Ghaeltacht, i dtreo, ní amháin go mbéadh na daoine sna Gaeltachtaí in ann bheith ag éisteacht le na chéile, ach bheith ag féachaint ar a chéile, agus go mbeadh forbairt agus méadú ar an aontas sin atá ag teastáil chun an Ghaeltacht a chothú agus a chaomhnú.  Tá fhios agam, mar <Col N="965" /> iartheicneoir in RTE, go bhfuil antreallamh ann chun an saghas rud sin a shocrú.  &ldquo;It would be possible to provide a television service for the Gaeltacht within the present technical system that exists there.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Ní maith liom am an tSeanaid a thógáil suas ag cur síos ar seo, ach os rud é go bhfuilimíd ag teacht suas go dtí an Nollaig agus go bhfuilimíd ag caint mar gheall ar thionsclaíocht ins an nGaeltacht&mdash;mar bainfear úsáid as an airgead seo i gcomhair cursaí tionsclaíochta san nGaeltacht&mdash;ba mhaith liom an áis seo a thógáil chun cur síos beagáinín ar an ngá atá ann chun earraí Éireannacha a thabhairt ar aghaidh, chun go mbeadh na daoine sna siopaí ag ceannach earraí Gaelacha, gó mór mhór agus an Nollaig ag teacht. &ldquo;There will be £400 million to £500 million worth of goods bought in this country between now and Christmas.</P>
    <P>Any attempt that the Irish consumer can make to shift even 10p in the £ in the consuming pattern will mean 10,000 jobs over a year's period.&rdquo;  Ba mhaith liom, os rud é go bhfuilimid ag caint mar gheall ar chursaí Gaeilge agus an saghas sprid a bhaineann le tionslaíocht ins an nGaeltacht, go bhféadfaí an sprid céanna a chothú i mBaile Átha Cliath agus i ngach aon áit eile sa tír.  Slí amháin chun é sin a dhéanamh is ea sna nósanna ceannaíochta a bhíonn ar siúl ag mná na hÉireann taobh istigh den am seo.</P>
    <P>Cloisim go mbeidh suas le céad míle bileoga mar gheall ar &ldquo;Christmas presents and jobs&rdquo;, ag dul amach taobh istigh den tseachtain seo go dtí na monarchana éagsúla sna bileoga airgeadais a bheidh ag dul go dtí na h-oibritheoirí.  Deirtear san mbileog, &ldquo;Create jobs in Irish industry, help increase everybody's standard of living, reduce the balance of payments, thereby strengthening the Irish economy, contribute to a possible reduction in personal and indirect taxation&rdquo;. Táimíd ag importáil gach bliain &ldquo;£15 million wines, beers and spirits, £11 million leathers and furs, £42 million men's and ladies' outer garments, £19 million in footwear, £38 million in household goods like TV and radio receivers, refrigerators and washing machines, £10 million in toys <Col N="966" /> and games, and £21 million in plastic articles.  That amounts to £400 million.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Is dóigh liom nach bhfuil mé ag dul as órd é sin a chur ós comhair an Tí nuair a táimíd ag cur síos ar tionsclaíocht san nGaeltacht, is é sin earraí atá tógtha, ginithe agus curtha le chéile ins an tír seo.  Ba mhaith liom go dtógfadh an tAire na cúpla focal seo a dúirt mé chun a chroí agus go ndéarfadh sé le Gaeltarra Éireann, go néirí leis an obair.  Fáiltím leis an mBille.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom are dtús mó bhuíochas a ghlacadh leis na Seanadóirí a thóg páirt sa díospóireacht agus a chuir fáilte romham ag teacht isteach anseo don chéad uair dom. Nílim ag dul ag iarraidh freagra a thabhairt ar na ceisteanna ar fad, a tugadh isteach, ach déanfaidh mé oiread agus is féidir liom.  Aontaím leis an Seanadóir O'Brien nuair a deir sé go bhfuil gá le cuid mhaith a dhéanamh san nGaeltacht go fóill. Fhad is a bhaineann sé le mo Roinn féin, sé sin, Roinn na Gaeltachta, i láthair na huaire níl de chead againn i dtaobh an chuid is mó des na rudaí a luaigh sé ach deontais forlíontacha a thabhairt.  Déanfaimid sin go flaithiúil i ngach cás a dtig linn é a dhéanamh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dúirt an Seanadóir go raibh cosc curtha ar an imirce.  Ba mhaith liom bheith cinnte go bhfuil.  Ní aontaím ar fad go bhfuil deireadh leis an imirce.  Tá fhios agam go bhfuil cuid mhaith daoine ag dul go Sasana i láthair na huaire ag iarraidh postanna a fháil agus nach bhfuil sé ceart a rá go bhfuil deireadh leis an imirce.  Ba mhaith linn a ligint orainn go bhfuil ach, faíríor, níl.  Sin an fáth go bhfuilimid ag tabhairt an Bhille seo isteach, caoí go mbeimíd in ann a rá go mbeidh oiread airgid agus is gá leo ag Gaeltarra Éireann le caitheamh ar phostanna le muintir na Gaeltachta a choinneáil san nGaeltacht.  Nuair a bhímid ag caint ar an nGaeltacht ní ag caint ar phíosa tíre atáimid, ach ag caint ar daoine atáimid.  Mura mbíonn na daoine san nGaeltacht, ní bheidh an Ghaeltacht ann.  Mura bhfuil na daoine ann ní bheidh ann an cultúr, an teanga ná na rudaí eile a luaigh na Seanadóirí <Col N="967" /> ar fad a labhair, atá chomh tábhachtach agus go gcaithfimid a chosaint agus a chaomhnú.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an IDA, tá duine ó bhord an IDA ar bhord Ghaeltarra agus dá bhrí sin tá teanghabháil idir an obair atá ar siúl ag Gaeltarra agus an IDA.  Ag an am céanna caithfimid bheith practiciúil i gcúrsaí mar seo agus is dócha gur fíor a rá go bhfuil coimhlint idir Gaeltarra agus an IDA maidir le postanna a chur ar fáil.  Cé go bhfuil comhoibriú, san am céanna, sé an obair chéanna atá ar siúl ag an dá Bhord, ag iarraidh obair a chur ar fáil do mhuintir na nÉireann, agus is dócha go mbíonn amannaí ann in a mbíonn coimhlint eatartha, fiú amháin leis an IDA féin.  Bíonn muintir an iarthair, na daoine a bhíonn ag obair thar ceann an IDA ag comhlint le muintir an oirthir ag iarraidh postannaí a tharraingt ina dtreo féin.  Cé go bhfuil ceangal idir Gaeltarra agus an IDA, caithfimíd a rá go bhfuil coimhlint ann chomh maith.</P>
    <P>Maidir le oiliúint do mhuintir na Gaeltachta, tuigeadh go raibh gá le sin nuair a bunaíodh an scoil agus na cúrsaí le hAnCO i nGaoth Dobhair, rud a bhfuil an-tharraingt air agus atá an-bhuntáisteach do mhuintir na Gaeltachta.  Tagann an rud sin isteach san méid a bhí á rá ag an Seanadóir de Brún, sé sin, an deacracht atá ag Gaeltarra nuair atá siad ag cur postanna ar fáil.  Go minic, bíonn daoine sna monarchana sin nach mbíonn an Ghaeilge ar a ndeis acu, agus bíonn an dáinséar ann gur Béarla a bhíonn á labhairt sna monarchana sin.  Ní féidir an milleán a chur ar Ghaeltarra i gcúrsaí mar sin.  Tá siad ag iarraidh fostaíocht a chur ar fáil agus ag an am céanna tá siad, b'fhéidir, i ngan fhios dóibh féin, ag chur isteach ar chúrsaí na teangan. Sílim gurb é an leigheas is fearr ar sin go mbeadh oiliúint le fáil ag muintir na Gaeltachta i gcaoi go mbeidh siad in ann bainistíocht a ghlacadh le treoir a thabhairt dos na monarchana sin agus féachaint chuige gur Gaeilge amháin a bheidh á labhairt sna monarchana a bheidh bunaithe ag Gaeltarra. Is fíor go bhfuil daoine ag filleadh ar ais go dtí an Ghaeltacht <Col N="968" /> agus is breá é sin a fheiceáil, go bhfuil siad sásta teacht ar ais agus cur futha san nGaeltacht.  Táimidne i Roinn na Gaeltachta arís ag déanamh ár ndícheall cuidiú leis na daoine sin.  Le gairid, d'árdaímear na deontais le haghaidh tithíochta agus beimíd go luath ag ardú deontas chun feabhas a chur ar thithe.  Táimid ag iarraidh cuidiú leis na daoine seo cur futha ina dtír féin, rud a theastaíonn ó chuile dhuine, is cuma cé hé féin.</P>
    <P>Luaigh an Seanadóir Murphy an sprioc faoi lán-fhostaíocht.  Mar a dúirt mé ar dtús, bhí deacrachtaí ann ach táimid ag iarraidh na deacrachtaí sin a shárú.  Sin é an fáth go bhfuil an Bille seo os ár gcomhair.  Ach b'fhéidir gur ceart cuimhniú go bhfuil lánfhostaíocht i gcuid des na Gaeltachtaí, cuirim i gcás, i d'Tír Chonaill.  Táimid ag déanamh ár ndícheall leis an sprioc sin a bhaint amach dosna Gaeltachtaí ar fad.</P>
    <P>Mar a dúirt an Seanadóir Cranitch, caithfimíd an Ghaeilge a choinneáil slán, a chothú agus a chaomhnú, agus be cheart duinn uilig bheith bródúil aisti.  Go deimhin, is breá an rud go raibh an díospóireacht againn a bhí anseo inniu.  Gach duine a labhair, is san nGaeilge a labhair sé.  Tugann sé sin misneach mór dom féin mar Aire na Gaeltachta.  Cé gur leis an nGaeltacht is mó a bhainim, tá dualgas orm chomh maith i dtaobh cúrsaí taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht.  Tá an-áthas orm a fheiceáil gur i nGaeilge ar fad a bhí an díospóireacht inniu.</P>
    <P>Thug an Seanadóir Mulcahy ardmholadh do Ghaeltarra agus, go deimhin, tá an tard-mholadh seo tuillte acu, mar níl sé furast tionscail a thabhairt isteach dos na háiteanna iargúlta.  Bíonn ceisteanna faoi bóithre, faoi uisce, chumhacht aibhléise agus a leithéidí sin.  Cé go bhfuil na deontais atá á dtabhairt do thionscail san nGaeltacht níos fearr ná na deontais atá le fáil in áiteanna ar bith eile, ag an am céanna tá cuid mhaith deacrachtaí le sárú acu.  Níor mhaith liomsa go sílfeadh duine ar bith go raibh mise dá gcáineadh ar bhealach ar bith.  A mhalairt atá i gceist go deimhin.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an Údarás, níl mise ag dul ag déanamh peil dó, á bhualadh <Col N="969" /> thart ó áit go háit.  Tá sé geallta go mbeidh an Bille faoin Udarás tugtha isteach taobh istigh de bhliain agus tá sé ar intinn againn seasamh le sin.</P>
    <P>Luadh Radio na Gaeltachta.  Ceann de na gníomhartha is fearr a rinneadh riamh maidir leis na Gaeltachtai na Radio na Gaeltachta a bhunú.  Ó bunaíodh an Radio tá có-shnaidhmiú idir na Gaeltachtaí ar fad.  Tuigeann siad a chéile nios fearr.  Tá siad ag plé le chéile nios mó agus tá chomhoibriú i bhfad nios fearr idir na Gaeltachtaí ó cuireadh an radio ar bun. Ar ndóigh tá an taobh eile den scéal. Tá saibhreas ceoil agus amhráin agus na teangan féin le cloisteáil ag an chuid sin de mhuintir na hÉireann atá in ann an stáisiún a fháil.  Sin buntáiste mór eile, agus go deimhin duine ar bith nach mbíonn sé de nós aige éisteacht leis an radio, molfainn go mór dó teacht isteach ar an nós sin agus beidh go leor buntáistí le fáil aige dhá bharr.</P>
    <P>Maidir le teilifís a chur ar fáil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta, níor mhaith liom a rá an bhfuil nó nach bhfuil RTE in ann an tseirbhís a chur ar fáil, ach nuair a thagann an dara staisiún isteach beimid ag súil go mbeimid in ann níos mo cláracha i nGaeilge agus an cultúr ar fad a chur ós comhair na ndaoine.  Cé nach mbaineann an rud deiridh a dúirt an Seanadóir Mulcahy go díreach leis an mBille&mdash;baineann sé go neamh-díreach leis&mdash;sílim go gcaithfimid uilig aontú leis faoin mholadh a rinne sé i dtaobh earraí Éireannacha a cheannach, ní amháin anois um Nollaig ach i gcónaí.  Is mór an cuidiú don lucht oibre go ndíreoimid ár n-aghaidhthe ar earraí Éireannacha a cheannach fhad agus is féidir linn é.  Molaim go mór an rud a dúirt sé faoi sin.  Tá poibliocht ag teastáil le h-aire na ndaoine a dhiriú ar chomh tábhachtach agus atá sé go gceannóimid earraí Éireannacha.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom arís mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis na Seanadóirí.  Tá súil agam go mbeimid in ann an Bille ar fad a chur tríd an Seanad inniu.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to increase the limit imposed by the Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta Acts, 1963 to 1975, on the amount that NET may borrow under Ministerial guarantee.  It is further proposed to widen the scope of the ministerial guarantee powers to permit the guaranteeing of the due payment of commission and incidental expenses arising in connection with loan guarantees.  In addition, the opportunity is being taken in the Bill to introduce legislative controls over the remuneration of the chief officer of the company and over the superannuation schemes operating in the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Bill, the provision dealing with the raising of the limit on the guaranteeing by the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy of borrowing by the company from the present limit of £30 million to a new one of £100 million is by far the most important.  This particular provision is necessary to permit the company to <Col N="971" /> complete the financing of its ammonia/ urea project at Marino Point, Cork Harbour.  In view of the substantial increase being proposed in the guarantee limit, I think it only right that the House should be aware of developments over the last two years which have made this increase necessary.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware the Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta Act, 1975 was enacted specifically for the purpose of assisting the company to finance its Marina Point project.  The Act increased the authorised share capital of NET from £7.5 million to a new limit of £27.5 million, it provided that the Minister for Finance could take shares in the company up to a limit of £22.5 million, and that he could take up additional shares in excess of that amount up to the new authorised share capital limit of £27.5 million with prior Government approval and it increased the limit on the guaranteeing by the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy of borrowings by the company from £2 million, to the present statutory limit of £30 million.</P>
    <P>Based on a project cost of £63.5 million in mid-1975 it was considered that these provisions would be more than adequate to complete the financing of Marino Point.  At that time it was intended that the project would be funded by way of £15 million Government equity, £5 million IDA grant and the balance of £43.5 million from borrowings.  However, two significant developments since then, namely, substantial increases in the project cost and demands by the different lending institutions for 100 per cent guarantees for all borrowings, have upset seriously the company's best calculations and have brought about the present situation where further legislation is essential to enable the company to complete the financing of the project.</P>
    <P>Firstly, I will deal with the question of the project cost.  The latest estimate from NET suggests that total expenditure could be in the region of £90 million.  This represents an increase of about £27 million on the mid-1975 estimate.  The company has attributed almost 45 per cent of this increase to the continued upward escalation of <Col N="972" /> material and labour costs, over 30 per cent to sterling devaluation and additional interest charges, and almost 25 per cent to additional project requirements which had not been budgeted for in the mid-1975 estimate.</P>
    <P>It is, I consider, a matter of regret and of grave concern&mdash;and the Minister has made his views on this clear to representatives of the company&mdash; that costs have spiralled in this manner during the construction of the project.  It must be conceded, however, that expenditure on the project has been incurred during a period when inflation reached heights never experienced before in these islands.  It was, in fact, precisely because of these massive inflationary trends that NET were unable, despite their best efforts, to arrange a fixed price contract and were obliged to operate on a basis of reimbursable costs for the major proportion of the contract for the project.</P>
    <P>The second development which has made it essential that the increased guarantee limit now sought be provided is the demand by all lenders that total borrowings by NET in respect of the Marino Point project be fully secured.  This is something that the company did not foresee prior to the enactment of the 1975 amending legislation. At that time it had been anticipated that the institutional lenders, such as the European Investment Bank, who were participating in the funding of the project would require partial Ministerial guarantees for borrowings but that the other source of loan finance, a consortium of banks, would not require any such guarantees. However, it has since become clear following protracted negotiations between NET and the lenders that the institutional lenders must have full guarantees and that the bank consortium wishing to be treated on a par with all other lenders would require similar guarantees.  In addition, due to the financing of earlier capital projects at NET's Arklow factory by way of short term borrowings over a number of years, an unfavourable imbalance between current assets and current liabilities had developed in the company's accounts; because of this it was considered prudent to rearrange these <Col N="973" /> borrowings as medium-term borrowings through the bank consortium.  The rescheduled borrowings which amount to almost £10 million will also require guarantees.  Overall, therefore, total borrowings by the company in the region of £80 million, representing about £70 million required to complete the Marino Point financing and the £10 million adjustment of Arklow borrowings, will have to be guaranteed by the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy.  In proposing a new statutory loan guarantee limit of £100 million, I considered it prudent that a realistic limit be provided to cover adequately the company's immediate requirements and possible requirements in the future.</P>
    <P>I want to stress at this point that the attitude of the lenders in no way reflects any lack of confidence on their part in NET or in the Marino Point project.  It simply illustrates the desire on the part of the different lenders involved in the overall financing package to be treated equally by NET and, since the institutional lenders must have full guarantees, it is not at all unreasonable for the bank consortium to seek the same facility.  There is, however, no doubt that the company do retain the full confidence of their bankers with regard to their ability to repay all borrowings.  Under the loan agreements entered into by the company all borrowings have to be repaid before the end of 1984.  In fact, on the basis of their latest financial projections the company would have no difficulty in repaying these borrowings at an earlier date.</P>
    <P>In addition to proposing a new statutory loan guarantee limit, I am taking the opportunity at this stage of extending slightly the scope of the powers of the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy with regard to guarantees. In section 3 it is proposed that the Minister be empowered to guarantee the due payment by NET of commission and incidental expenses arising in connection with moneys borrowed by the company.  In practice the amounts of commission or other expenses that might be payable by the company would represent a very minute fraction of the actual amount <Col N="974" /> being borrowed.  Recent experience suggests, in fact, that such additional payments would, if payable, amount to not more than a ½ per cent of the total amount being borrowed.  Nevertheless, the absence of the power to guarantee this type of payment did create difficulties for NET when completing a recent guarantee agreement and the amendment proposed in section 3 will get over this problem and bring the NET legislation into line in this respect with that of some other State companies.</P>
    <P>The types of controls proposed in sections 4 and 5 in relation to the remuneration of the chief officer of the company and to superannuation schemes covering employees of the company are now being inserted in relevant statutes governing the different State companies as the opportunity arises.  The power to control the chief officer's salary and to regulate superannuation schemes is already contained in the Memorandum and Articles of Association of the company; so in fact these new provisions will not affect the controls operating at present but will merely give them a statutory backing.</P>
    <P>Now that I have dealt with the reasons which have made it necessary to introduce this Bill, I should like to refer to the Marino Point project itself. This vast petrochemical complex, which will be using as feedstock some of the Kinsale Head natural gas, will in broad terms have an output sufficient to meet the nitrogenous fertiliser requirements of Irish agriculture until at least the mid-eighties.  This level of output will undoubtedly play a significant role in the continuing expansion of the agricultural industry and will, for the first time, ensure the availability of adequate nitrogen supplies to our farmers.  In the early years of production and until the home market demand for nitrogen expands sufficiently to absorb the total output, surplus production will be disposed of on foreign markets through marketing arrangements already completed.</P>
    <P>The actual construction of the Marino Point plans is now at an advanced stage.  There have been some disruptions in the construction programme <Col N="975" /> due to intermittent industrial disputes at the site but generally the rate of progress has been satisfactory. At this stage and due to the size and complexity of this undertaking it is difficult to say precisely when the plants will be ready to come on stream.  It seems reasonable, however, to expect that the ammonia plant could be ready to commence production by about mid-summer 1978, followed by the urea plant within perhaps a further two months.  This time scale should tie-in with the landing of the first natural gas supplies which it is expected will arrive at about that time.</P>
    <P>NET's new plant will undoubtedly have a revitalising effect on our fertiliser industry as a whole and this is to be welcomed.  There is little doubt that the industry has had more than its share of problems over the last couple of years and some of these are still with us.  Last year, in particular, was an exceptionally difficult one for Irish firms in the business.  Yet despite this situation companies have been able to maintain the same level of employment during the past year.  The latest expectations are that the overall market situation will improve in 1978. The NET project will obviously help in this regard as the availability of home-produced nitrogen based on an indigenous raw material will from the middle of next year onwards be of benefit not alone to NET but also to the different companies involved in the production of NPK compound fertilisers in this country.  Therefore, the NET project quite apart from generating an additional 500 jobs in the industry and in ancillary servicing industries will help also to secure the future of existing employment in the Irish fertiliser industry generally.</P>
    <P>I confidently recommend the Bill for approval.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I happily accept the Parliamentary Secretary's recommendation of the Bill and I shall not delay the House on it.  As it seems to be a Bill essentially of technical character, it is easier for me to make one short speech in which I could <Col N="976" /> make my various points rather than to make a long speech on Committee Stage.  The main purpose of this Bill is to extend the ministerial guaranteeing power and to take the opportunity presented by that requirement to make another amendment with regard to the chief executive's remuneration.  I want to concentrate my remarks on the ministerial guaranteeing power because I sometimes feel that in addressing this House on technical and legal measures people think I am out of my mind and that what I have to say is not relevant to reality. I wish to draw the attention of the House to the reality of the defect in the existing ministerial guaranteeing power which the Parliamentary Secretary has noted with regard to the borrowing ability of this important national industry and the importance, therefore, of having the guarantee powers in the Bills as we pass them in proper form covering what they should cover and that every technical point that has to be made with regard to them should be listened to.  Points which I had to make on the guaranteeing power of the Minister for Finance on Bord Bainne were not listened to.  I just hope that what I have to say on this Bill will be listened to.</P>
      <P>First, for me it will be the last time I will agree to a Bill which amends a section in the Principal Act as is the case in respect of two sections of this Bill which has been amended already in the 1970 Act by three sections and one Schedule.  It was amended in the 1975 Act by another section which is proposed to be amended now by two further sections in this Bill, sections 2 and 3.  You have a gobbledegook as a result of it all, an inability for anybody who is not invited to waste time to know what the ministerial guaranteeing powers are.  It could all be set out in one table which would be the end of the two sections incorporating the effect of the amendments on the existing legislation so that in one document&mdash; the 1977 Nítrigin Éireann Bill&mdash;one would find out what the guaranteeing powers of the Minister for Industry. Commerce and Energy were.  That could be important and would make it easier for us to understand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="977" /> This becomes obvious with my second point, which is to ask the Parliamentary Secretary why it has not been found necessary in this Bill to make an amendment in regard to the guaranteeing power of the same Minister under the Industrial Credit Act which we recently made, that is to say, in which we amended the manner in which the moneys borrowed in a currency other than our own currency was to be expressed.  The Minister introduced and the Oireachtas passed an amendment to the Industrial Credit Bill which we debated.  The previous provision was that it was the par values from time to time fixed by the IMF which determined the liability under the guarantee but we changed that to the exchange rates prevailing at the time of the transaction.  If you had to go through the labours of putting together the effect of all the different sections of this code you would discover that this code is in the unamended condition that the Industrial Credit code was in before we amended it, in other words, that the provision with regard to foreign borrowings of Nítrigin Éireann or what the Industrial Credit Company borrowings were before we amended the situation, are different from the Industrial Credit Company.  I am entitled to ask why.  I am entitled to know if we have now in relation to this an adequate guarantee of foreign borrowings why was it inadequate in the case of guarantees of the Industrial Credit Company and adequate in the case of Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta.  No doubt there is an answer, but if there is not an answer there ought to be an amendment. The two should be brought together.  I understand the situation to be that these par values are now not strictly relevant, but that is the way it is under the code which governs Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta.  There is a consortium of lenders and I suspect the consortium must include some foreign banks as well as home lenders.</P>
    <P>My third point on this is to make a suggestion with regard to this and other guarantee sections which arise under the different codes where these ministerial guarantees are regarded as important.  I agree with the Parliamentary Secretary that the fact that the <Col N="978" /> consortium looked for ministerial guarantees in no way suggests a lack of confidence in the company concerned. They were in a sense forced to look for guarantees in order that they might be of equal rank and security with the European Investment Bank who, as anticipated, were looking for guarantees.  Where you have that situation, where you have that in this particular Nítrigin Éireann code and you had it in the industrial credit code and in the Industrial Development Bill I would suggest that it would be found to be a great aid in facilitating the completion of these financial transactions if there was a provision in the guarantee section to the effect that a certificate by the Minister that the particular guarantee he was giving did not exceed or could not exceed the total amount he was capable of guaranteeing under the Act.</P>
    <P>I know he makes a representation to that effect in most of these cases. The documents of lending recite that in fact the guarantee in question does not exceed, but if some difficult lender raised the point, it would be of considerable doubt as to whether that representation would save the situation of a lender who might be a key lender where in fact the representation was erroneous, where somebody made a mistake at some point and where perhaps a later guarantee shoved him over the limit.  A question would arise then as to the ranking of the guarantees within the limit.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to say you could come in here and look for extensions of powers and all that, but you could get a captious and difficult crew in this assembly some day.  It cannot be assumed that the House will be as docile always as it is today.  It cannot be assumed that the Legislature will always nod to the beck of the Executive and do what they are told.  The thing should be got right particularly if it is a lender who has just closed down a factory employing 1,400 people. There would be very little sympathy for him in that situation.  His adviser at the time of the loan would tell him he might get into that situation and therefore would have to rely on his strict legal rights.  I would suggest that for the consideration of the Minister <Col N="979" /> in his code and of all the other Ministers that this type of certificate which would put the lender in the position that the Minister would be estopped in law from arguing that the lender was in excess of his statutory limit ought to be included.  So much for the guarantee matter.</P>
    <P>With regard to section 4&mdash;this is Devlin I presume popping his head up here as elsewhere, and I am dead against Devlin on this matter.  I am not talking, though I have to, about Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta, simply.  I am talking about all the other bodies involved in this.  What we are talking about here is placing limitations on the people whom the Minister has chosen to look after the affairs of these companies as to what he can pay to get the best skill to look after the considerable capital involved.  In my view this type of limitation ought not to be in this Bill or in any other Bill where there is substantial capital involved.  The best man, no matter what he may cost, should be engaged.  It is penny wise and pound foolish to be cheeseparing in this way.  Apart from anything else I do not see what I would have expected.  What we say here is rather like what a shareholder would say to his wife in his sittingroom with regard to his company.</P>
    <P>There is no provision in this Bill which I would have thought would be required that the articles of association would be amended so as to provide that within the constitution of the company there would be this restriction on the ability of the company to pay this thing.  This brings me and entitles me I think therefore to refer to the last point, that is, with regard to a provision in the statute governing Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta which exists in a lot of these statutes governing these bodies that we incorporate which I think is both outrageous and contrary to the Constitution.  I am trying to win as much sympathy as I possibly can with the least possible interference with the human being's rights. It is provided in the Schedule to the original Act that if a director of a company is nominated as a candidate &mdash;he has not to be elected&mdash;for either <Col N="980" /> House of the Oireachtas he should then cease to be director of the company.</P>
    <P>Somebody listened to me sometime before and amended an Act on this. There is one odd thing about nominations to the Seanad.  Nobody asked my consent to the nomination of me to the Seanad.  Perhaps I consented by the exercise of my body and carefully distributed portions of my mind in the business of getting elected, but there was no formal consent to my nomination. If, say, four fellows in the Oireachtas wished to get rid of somebody on a public board there is nothing to stop them nominating him to the Seanad even though he has no chance of being elected.  Therefore, this provision is bad and should not be in this code or in any other code. There have been serious and embarrassing cases to my knowledge in respect of other companies.  The provision excludes not only a director of a company but an officer or servant. This means that if somebody is employed in any one of our public boards that where this provision remains he would have to vacate his job in the event of being nominated for election to either House of the Oireachtas.  The opportunity in this Bill with regard to the chief executive's remuneration was used wrongly but we should avail of the opportunity now of getting rid of this other provision.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank Senator FitzGerald for his comments and for his welcome for the Bill.  I would certainly agree with him that the Bill is a very technical one.  Sections 2, 3 and 4 in particular amend sections of the Principal Act.  I explained at the outset the reasons for the increase in the borrowings to a limit of £100 million and I think Senator FitzGerald accepted these reasons.  The main reason was, first, to enable the Marino Point project to go ahead and finish.  The cost of the project had increased from £63.5 million which was the estimate in 1975 to a figure now in the region of £90 million.  In addition the various lenders who were providing something in the <Col N="981" /> region of £70 million in borrowing wanted and, as he pointed out rightly so, assurances that they would get full guarantees for all moneys lent.</P>
      <P>The other points which the Senator made about the guarantees are general points but they are mostly points which are for Ministers other than my own Minister.  They are for my own Minister but also, I think the Senator would agree, for the Minister for Finance.  The point about currency changes is a valid point, too.  The Industrial Credit Bill was drafted after the NET Bill.  However, the sort of provision that the Senator has urged should be in this Bill as in the Industrial Credit Bill is provided for already in the individual agreements which NET have with the various lenders.  I understand that this is the case.</P>

      <P>The Senator spoke about Devlin and I do not think we should be commenting here on whether Devlin was right or wrong. It is provided in this Bill that the remuneration to the chief officer of the company and also superannuation schemes covering company employees should be controlled.  That is provided for already in the Articles of Association. They provide for ministerial control. In order to provide for the eventuality where the chief executive might be a manager or general manager it was considered best to include a section which would apply to the chief officer of the company irrespective of the title which he would have within the company and whether he was a board member.  The power to control this is being brought into being in the different State companies.  We have a NET Bill before us and it was considered necessary and right that this should be done.  It is also being done as different legislation to cover State companies is being brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I trust the Bill will go ahead to Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to extend, in a number of specific ways, the powers of the Industrial Development Authority.  Its main objective is to enhance the capability of the IDA</P>
      <P>&mdash;to assist the development of domestic industry, and particularly small and medium-sized indigenous firms;</P>
      <P>&mdash;to stimulate the emergence in much greater numbers of new entrepreneurs.</P>
      <P>In the first place, the Bill empowers the IDA to give loan guarantees and interest subsidies in respect of the finance needed for mergers and acquisitions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="983" /> Up to now the main incentive to help existing industry to become more efficient has been the re-equipment grants scheme.  Our commitment to home industry suggests, however, that the IDA should also be able to take a positive and constructive part in bringing about desirable and orderly change in certain sectors.  The industries most likely to benefit are composed of smaller scale firms and are for the most part not capital-intensive. Restructuring assistance is consequently unlikely to entail an outlay proportionate to its obvious benefits.</P>
    <P>At present the existence of excess capacity in industries at a time of competitive pressure from imports is enforcing structural changes involving major costs in terms of redundancies, lost capacity and the need to create substitute employment.  The Bill would set a limit of £500,000 on the amount of borrowings which the IDA could guarantee in any one case without Government approval.</P>
    <P>It is also proposed in this Bill to provide for the giving of loan guarantees and interest subsidies to first-time industrialists in respect of loans raised to provide working capital.  The new guarantee facilities will be limited to £150,000 in any one case, but the Government may permit a higher figure.  Given this new power the IDA intend to launch an enterprise development programme.  In Ireland the volume of new projects promoted by first-time industrialists has been disappointingly small, and it is clear that one of the main causes of this apparent lack of enterprise has been the inability of the entrepreneur to raise the necessary finance to carry him through the start-up situation.  All too frequently Irish banks will lend only on the security of assets rather than on ability and enterprise.  It is envisaged, therefore, that this proposal will get a response from a wide spectrum of Irish people, both at home and abroad, who have the qualifications, experience and enterprise to become successful industrialists.</P>
    <P>The projects will generally have to be commercially exploitable within a reasonable time span, and it will be <Col N="984" /> necessary also to assess in each case the ability and commitment of the would-be enterpreneur.  Assistance towards working capital will be supplemented as appropriate by the existing range of benefits for fixed assets administered by the IDA.</P>
    <P>In section 4 it is proposed formally to give the IDA power to engage, with the Minister's approval, in giving assistance of a technical or advisory nature to developing countries.  There is a considerable demand for such assistance, both from the developing countries themselves and from international organisations which provide contracts for development projects abroad.  While the IDA have, in the past participated to some extent in work of this kind, this Bill will formally give them the legal authority to do so.</P>
    <P>The Bill also contains in section 5 a number of provisions designed to tidy up the ceilings on aggregate expenditure set out in the existing legislation. Financial commitments under the present Bill are brought within the appropriate limits, and expenditures on equity which formerly were not covered by any ceilings are brought within the limit on grants of a capital nature.  The Bill further proposes to bring the amount of training grant which can be approved, without Government permission, into line with that for capital grants generally, namely £850,000 per case; previously there was no legal limit on the amount of training grant which could be given to any one undertaking.</P>
    <P>The IDA have, since 1970, given grants of up to 50 per cent of the costs involved in research and development projects, subject to an absolute maximum of £15,000 per project; the Bill proposes to raise this limit to £50,000 but with the limit of 50 per cent of approved costs continuing to apply. The new limit is justified in the context of the increased costs of scientific work and the increased scale of projects now being undertaken by Irish industry and, in many cases, being delegated to Irish subsidiaries of overseas companies.</P>
    <P>Under existing legislation authentication of the authority's seal requires <Col N="985" /> the attendance, sometimes at short notice, of two members of the authority.  As a practical matter the Bill gives the authority power to delegate this function to two of their senior officers.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Bill includes a provision which will extend the shareholding powers of the IDA.  Under the Industrial Development Act, 1969, the IDA are empowered to take shares in certain industrial undertakings.  Legal opinion has indicated, however, that on the basis of the existing provisions the authority could be confident of having power to take minority shareholdings in existing companies only. In order to remove the doubt regarding the authority's power to take majority shareholdings and to ensure that they have adequate flexibility to operate successfully in the increasingly sophisticated financial environment, it is proposed to extend the authority's shareholding powers to enable them to take shareholdings of up to 100 per cent in suitable industrial undertakings, or in companies participating in the ownership, control or management of suitable industrial undertakings, and to enable them to form or participate with others in the formation of new industrial companies.</P>
    <P>This is a reasonable and pragmatic extension of existing IDA powers and functions.  Save in exceptional circumstances, IDA personnel will not be engaged in the actual day-to-day management of commercial enterprises; furthermore, under the terms of the Bill it will be necessary for the authority to seek the Minister's prior approval before they take a majority shareholding in any company.  The Bill also provides for a limit of £1 million on the amount which the authority may expend on the purchase or taking of shares in a particular body corporate without prior Government approval.</P>
    <P>I expect that these extended powers of participation will be particularly useful to the authority in the implementation of the new enterprise development programme.  With these powers the authority would be, if circumstances so warranted, in a position to set up a company to manufacture a <Col N="986" /> product successfully developed under the programme or become a shareholder in a company being set up for that purpose&mdash;for instance, in cases where the Irish party was for the time being over-burdened with technical production and marketing problems. or lacked the professional support or finance to bring the project to an early start-up.</P>
    <P>The House will appreciate, from this synopsis of the contents of the Bill, the extent to which the new provisions are oriented towards the promotion of domestic industry, and in particular small industry.  The new powers will be of considerable assistance to the IDA in their promotion of domestic industry, a task to which they are giving increasing attention, while at the same time realising the continued necessity of attracting increasing numbers of new overseas projects.</P>
    <P>Senators will probably be aware of the series of measures taken by the authority in recent times to supplement and reinforce the main programmes aimed at domestic industry. These include a joint venture unit, which will seek out a suitable overseas company to go into partnership with an Irish company who wish to expand or to develop a new project. There is the project identification unit which take the initiative in identifying new manufacturing opportunities for Irish firms, whether arising from the establishment of large foreign industries in this country or supplying existing Irish firms with materials which are currently imported.</P>
    <P>There is a product and process development grants scheme whereby the IDA may make a grant available towards the cost of research involved in improving an existing product or developing a new one, or improving a manufacturing process.  Measures recently undertaken by the Government will help to increase the rate of project approvals for small Irish industries. The Minister recently announced that the small industry &ldquo;cluster&rdquo; concept, introduced on a pilot basis a couple of years ago, is to be immediately extended throughout the country, with a nationwide programme of nine small industry clusters.  The IDA have also <Col N="987" /> recently been authorised to proceed with the building of five 7,000 sq. ft. advance factories specifically for small industries.  In addition, the fixed asset investment criterion for small firms has been raised from £200,000 to £300,000, a change which will enable a greater number of projects to come within the scope of the small industries programme's generous package of incentives.</P>
    <P>These measures represent a substantial commitment by the Government to increasing the resources available to promote local Irish enterprise. Taken together with the generous financial and after-care advisory services at present available, I am confident that they will lead to accelerated growth of the small industry sector in Irish industry.  The measures contained in the Bill can be seen as further promoting industrial recovery and future development.  As such I am confident that they will receive your support.  I accordingly recommend the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJMcCartin" hpid="Mr. McCartin Mr. McCartin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>This is another of the Bills which in the course of the last month or so this House has discussed which were originally initiated by the past Government and naturally on this side of the House we will give the Bill the welcome it deserves.  It is not a new or radical approach to a solution to the problems which we have but it is what we might call another mildly progressive step in the right direction which I hope will achieve a number of desirable objectives. I think we had a few weaknesses in the scheme of assistance that was available particularly to small industries generally, and we welcome the provisions in the legislation here which will improve the facilities available, particularly to new business people who are starting up without much experience and, as always, with a scarcity of capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I particularly welcome the provision for the guaranteeing of borrowings by first-time industrialists because in my experience the vast majority of the people who started up industries got what might be described as fairly <Col N="988" /> generous grants in the past, but the assistance in the form of two-third grants were sometimes down to 50 per cent.  Sometimes to the ordinary citizen it appears a big sum of money. Often, indeed, to an industrialist starting up it appeared that the sort of assistance he had got put him on a solid foundation on which he had only to build.  Generally, however, if one meets the people who have been engaged in small industry in the past number of years one finds it has been one long battle to provide and get sufficient funds to enable the project to keep going.  Usually they start off all right with a grant covering a fair proportion of the investment that was intended to be made, but generally speaking there is nothing provided for the sort of losses that are incurred by most industrialists, particularly by inexperienced people who start up with a load of good ideas and ambition and willingness to work hard but not an awful lot of experience in the handling of money.</P>
    <P>I particularly welcome the provisions through which, hopefully, someone will go in and assess the real need.  In the past we had not really a tradition of business, we had not any tradition of expertise in industry generally, and throughout most of the country the small number of industrialists who got off the ground were people who did not have anything except the ambition to do the job.  They had very little experience and very little advice available to them.  I would say that along with the guarantees of money and interest provided in this Bill, something in the nature of advice to start off with must be available, because, of course, money cannot be paid out unless there are carefully made plans and projections worked out.  I hope that we will see the IDA, in addition to this sort of assistance, giving some sort of strengthening up assistance, perhaps providing advisory services.  In addition to the money, expert people in the field of industry and business must go out and assess the need, must be able to give advice and, having assessed the need, be prepared to underwrite the capital that is required.</P>
    <P>There is no point in us looking back and thinking what could have been <Col N="989" /> achieved if we had had a different policy on the part of the principal lending agencies in the past.  We had a situation where the security of the investment was much more important to the lending agencies than the possibility of guaranteeing employment or getting a new industry off the ground, which came secondary to the main question, which was an absolute safe and secure investment for shareholders, for the people on whose behalf the lending agencies were making the investment.  Fortunately in recent years we have had the Industrial Credit Company taking a more liberal point of view in this regard, but I think the assistance that we are now promised from the IDA will go a long way towards improving the situation for people starting in industry.</P>
    <P>I do not think that this sort of legislation will by any means solve all our unemployment problems.  If there is any mistake politicians and parliamentarians could make at any stage, whether during election campaigns or in the course of debates in either Houses, it is to lead people generally to believe that it is the agencies of State who will solve our unemployment problem.  What we do here is certainly a help to people starting up and to industries already in operation, but we should be very careful to bear in mind all the time that what we have here for the most part is a free enterprise society in which the Government offer help and assistance through various means, like what we have here today, to people to solve the problems for themselves.  If Governments or political parties or candidates in elections go too far to lead people to believe that the solution to all our employment problems is one which the Government have undertaken to provide, then we will take the emphasis away from what we should be trying to do to encourage people to solve the problems for themselves and for their neighbours.</P>
    <P>The unemployment problems which we have are very serious, but they will not be of such serious proportions if the Government and individuals in industry settle down to working out a solution.  If we look at the situation <Col N="990" /> and say that for every job we have at the moment we must provide so many more jobs in the next 12 months, if we reduce it down to the small industry and say every industry that employs ten or 15 people today should be able to increase that number by one or two in the next year, it does not appear to be such an impossible task.  There are few industries that could not do this, but many employers are discouraged.</P>
    <P>While discussing the role that the Industrial Development Authority have to play, it is no harm to question some of the reasons why industries do not rush to employ greater numbers of people.  At the moment in industry there is a fairly good market for most goods being manufactured.  Many industrialists feel that there are more orders in the book than there were two or three years ago, but a lot of them are rather slow to increase their staff. We have a situation where there are so many factors that influence the taking on of more staff that industrialists are slow to do so.  The media give too much coverage to people laid off, but if somebody requires two or three more people they hesitate to employ them because they fear that, perhaps due to a change in situation, those people might be laid off in five or six months' time.</P>
    <P>Then you have the question of the trade union attitude to the letting off of these people; the question as to whether the industry is successful or not; the IDA asking questions about grants that have been paid, levels of employment and so on.  If we had more consultation between the IDA and industrialists generally we could, perhaps, work out a more reasonable solution to our unemployment problems.</P>
    <P>A lot of advice is needed by both employees and employers on the whole question of labour relations.  It is important that the Industrial Development Authority participate more in instructing, advising and helping both sides of industry.  We have had mistakes on both sides.  While many industrialists are prepared to raise a complaint when profits go down and things are difficult, employees are not informed when things are going very <Col N="991" /> well.  On the other hand, we have the situation that I mentioned where, because of lack of communication on both sides of industry, employees and trade unions are not always as sensitive to difficult situations arising within industry as they should be.</P>
    <P>If the State is to be involved in financing industry it must also play a much more active role since we have not got the tradition, the experience of industry.  We are talking about encouraging first-time industrialists to start up and it is important that we provide some sort of back-up advisory service that will start them on a more competitive basis.</P>
    <P>The moves we are making through this legislation are the right ones to help solve the unemployment problem, but far too many people think that solutions to the unemployment problem can be found in the appointment of extra gardaí, teachers, civil servants, or whatever they may be.  These are services that we need, and we should see them in the light of how many guards we need, how many teachers we need and not how many jobs we can create by filling posts in these services. The way to solve our unemployment problem is by putting people into productive jobs where we can manufacture something and export it, or jobs in creating markets for our exports.</P>
    <P>The provision in the Bill enabling the IDA to extend their technical and advisory services to developing countries is a very good one.  It is the same subject which we discussed at length here earlier.  While we may see ourselves to some extent in western Europe as being a poor underdeveloped country, still we must admit that poverty is a very comparative thing and that by most standards we are very well-off and well equipped to develop industry.  At this stage it is good that we are mindful of the problems that are being experienced by countries who have difficulties compared with which ours are not really serious problems at all.  I welcome that provision in the Bill and certainly I can say that there will not be any opposition from this side of the House.</P>
    <Col N="992" />
    <Speaker pid="PierceButler" hpid="Mr. Butler Mr. Butler">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is an extension of the Industrial Development Act, 1950.  Industrial development efforts are not the preserve of any party or Government: they are a service to the State and that is the way they should be recognised.</P>
      <P>The amendments in the Bill are a vast improvement and we welcome them.  The idea in the Bill to assist in the development of domestic industry, particularly small and medium industries, is very welcome.  It is welcomed not just locally but throughout the country.  There have been statements that more industry must come into Dublin because of the size of the population and because of the numbers who are unemployed.  We would welcome that but we would not welcome it to the extent that it would take away interest in rural Ireland.  Many of us come from rural Ireland and are here to defend it.  There is large scale unemployment in rural Ireland as well as in Dublin so we would hope that rural Ireland would not be overlooked to the advantage of Dublin.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides for loans and guarantees for mergers and acquisitions. A number of industries may be carrying out the same functions and because of the cost of those functions there may be no great profit and eventually an industry may wind up. We welcome the allowance here for mergers because a number of small industries would reduce costs and give greater profits to all concerned and greater confidence to the worker and industrialist.</P>
      <P>There are one or two questions I would like to ask about the Bill. Section 4 states:</P>
      <P>The Authority shall have, in addition to the functions assigned to it by section 3 of the Industrial Development Authority Act, 1950, and section 11 of the Principal Act, the function of providing, as the Minister may consider appropriate, assistance of a technical or advisory nature to a developing country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have passed here already today the International Development Association (Amendment) Bill, 1977 and we feel in the Seanad that we should give all <Col N="993" /> the assistance possible to the developing countries.  This section gives that assistance of technical and advisory nature to the developing countries and it is welcomed.  Since 1970 the IDA have given grants of up to 50 per cent of the cost involved in research and development projects, subject to a maximum of £15,000 per project.  I do not know how one would calculate the cost of a research and development project but if it costs, say, £10,000, how much of that would be grant? Would £5,000 be given for a £10,000 project?  If that is the case, I cannot see why there in an absolute maximum of £15,000.  Often research and development projects cost up to £50,000, £60,000, £70,000, £100,000 and maybe more.  Why should the grant be limited to £15,000 in that regard?  This limit should be raised to £50,000.</P>
    <P>We all realise the value of the IDA to our country and the work that is being done by them.  I have met personnel of the IDA on a number of occasions and I would like to take this opportunity of saying how helpful they were.  At all times they have been more helpful than one would expect. When IDA officers come into an industry, when an application is made for a grant, there is a certain amount of nervousness and so on but immediately they arrive the applicant is put at ease.  If everything is right there is no problem and, if not, they explain the position and try to rectify the problem.  Without doubt the personnel are a credit to the IDA, as anybody who has met them will agree.</P>
    <P>Over the past number of years we have had our problems in industry. Recently our problems have been enormous and we should try to do something quickly to make the industries of Ireland more stable so that they can be accepted internationally as such.  I will not mention the industries mentioned in the national papers over the past few months but we should be able to get over those problems and get on the road to success.</P>
    <P>We have also been arguing about whether labour-intensive industry or capital-intensive industry is the better. We could argue the point that labour-intensive <Col N="994" /> industry gives more employment, but there is also a need for capital-intensive industry.  We need exports so that our balance of payments will rise.  We need the confidence of capital being invested in Ireland.  We need both labour-intensive and capital-intensive industry working together.  We discussed today whether we are relying too much on overseas industry.  I would not think this is the case but I feel we could do better at home if we invested finance in agriculture. Agriculture has been mentioned in the other House and there is a wide area of investment in agriculture.  The IDA have helped in that regard. Regarding the processing industry in agriculture, the people from the IDA have been very helpful in dealing with grant applications.  The grants were available and paid.  Agriculture is not fully developed on the industrial side, that is, in regard to the processing of agricultural produce, such as milk and meat.  Milk processing is far advanced but much more could be done and I hope that when propositions are made in that regard the IDA will be helpful. I am sure they will.  I hope that they will consult from time to time with An Foras Talúntais because they have much to offer in that field and there should be meetings between the personnel of both bodies.</P>
    <P>Much of our meat is exported on the hoof but we must have a balance here.  We must not commit ourselves to 100 per cent processing of meat.  We must have exports of live cattle.  I would think the proportions should be three processed to one live.  Having that combination those in agriculture would get the greatest benefit from their produce.</P>
    <P>It was announced also that we should have joint ventures of Irish and foreign shareholding and while I would agree with that I would have doubt about it working.  We are not ready for that type of development yet. Maybe some of our entrepreneurs could join in a venture with foreign shareholders and it would be a success but if it was accepted widely then we would have many problems.  The foreigners would be more advanced in industry and take control of that <Col N="995" /> type of industry.  State-sponsored manufacturing industry was also mentioned and I agree the IDA should get more involved in this.</P>
    <P>There are a number of problems that would face anybody in developing industry and the most important one is the infrastructure of our roads.  We are not ready for big industry throughout the country.  Because of the infrastructure the cost of getting our produce out of the country is far too high, and something should be done urgently in this regard.  I would like to congratulate the county development teams on the amount of work that they have carried out in conjunction with the IDA.  Working closely together, much could be done for Irish industry.</P>
    <P>There should be more communication between unions and industrialists. This situation has been highlighted very recently, and unless something is done we will have more trouble on our hands.  It has been suggested that a smaller number of unions in any industry would give the best results.  I have my doubts about that.  The power of a very large union would be too great.  My personal feeling is that a number of smaller unions would be better than one large union.  The smaller union is closer to its members, it can get the message across to its members more quickly and there is more communication with one another. I am a member of a small union and I know the way small unions work.  We would have fewer strikes with smaller unions.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  I think the provisions of this Bill will improve the previous Industrial Development Acts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to take the opportunity of congratulating the Industrial Development Authority. We have a body of people here that most people do not even know about and certainly they do not appreciate the wonderful work they do which compares very favourably with that of any corresponding development authority throughout the world.  I have been involved with the IDA at certain stages and I know the excellence and quality of their work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One particular matter, which I am <Col N="996" /> very glad to see is covered in this Bill, is the question of joint ventures.  We are getting to the stage when we should ensure, as far as possible, that any industry or enterprise that comes into this country will have an Irish component.  This is necessary not only in a narrow national sense but for the general health of the industry.  Some of the difficulties we have seen recently might well have been avoided, at a very early stage, had there been an Irish component, had there been more communication between the incoming people and those of us who live in this country.  Far too many industrial companies, despite all the efforts of the IDA, equate the situation here as being similar or identical to that in the UK.  It is a totally different situation and attitude, background and so on.  I think it is a general principle anywhere that an incoming industry should be associated, as far as possible, as far as practicable, with people who are already indigenous to the country.  This is a principle which we should bear in mind ourselves as our own industry develops and extends overseas.</P>
    <P>The second aspect of this Bill, which is excellent, is as regards small industry. Small industries offer more, in the long term, to this country than large industries.  Too often in the past when we have thought about industrial development we tended to think in terms of a massive factory, a massive corporation, and we have not realised that the real viability in the most important industrial nations, in West Germany, in Japan, in the United States, France, Great Britain and Sweden, is often provided by the smaller industries rather than by the larger corporations which all too often have really come close to the dinosaur stage, and there is no point in introducing dinosaurs into this country.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect on which we are desperately weak, and it extends right through our whole structure, both in Government and industry, and that is research and development.  If we are just accepting what is done elsewhere and just taking it on here without any input of our own, then we truly are very ancillary to industry elsewhere. <Col N="997" /> We cannot to any great extent involve ourselves in basic research, but there is a very important role that has been shown by other countries that are developed&mdash;Japan is the obvious example&mdash;in which basic research and development done elsewhere are then modified and extended and changed from the purely theoretical to the practical and then employed to build industry.  Not only Japan, but the United States over and over again has imported ideas from Europe, developed the applied technology and then built industry on top of it.  Research and development in relation to our industry are very important, but it is very difficult for a small industry to employ even one or two people who will be more or less full-time involved in research.  That can be a severe or even a crippling financial burden for a small company.  One may well say in theory that it can be done but when one has the experience of it in practice one realises it is very difficult.  It is often not good enough to attempt to make use of the IIRS, very helpful though they may be.  There has to be some situation in which our own small industries can develop.  This assistance could be of key importance in translating what may be a very good idea into a practical reality giving employment.</P>
    <P>It is also of key importance that the IDA should be given much greater freedom as regards their shareholdings and that their legal position, which was perhaps a little doubtful, should have been clarified.  The IDA have to be in a position to take up shareholdings particularly when, as is suggested here, they will be involved in financial enterprises which by their nature are those that the normal commercial banks are unable to support as adequately as one might wish.  It is very important that the IDA should be able to take shareholdings and should be seen to be able to do so.  This is important when attracting external industry.  It is important that the IDA should keep a close eye on what is happening, not from any sort of invigilation point of view but by being involved and being able to help before the problems arise rather than after.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="998" /> One further aspect of this Bill which was mentioned in the debate we had earlier today and on previous occasions here is in relation to developing countries. We are painfully just beginning to build up quite a lot of expertise on how a country gets across the enormously difficult gap between an underdeveloped country and a developed country.  We have a certain amount of expertise to offer which on a semi-unofficial basis is already being availed of.  I am delighted to see that the Industrial Development Authority are being given full backing and formal recognition of the contribution which I am sure they will be able to make in this respect.  I would like to welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Mr. Moynihan Mr. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I welcome this Bill, which is continuing on the same lines as the industrial development legislation going back to the fifties.  It is much the same because it is endeavouring to expand and create further industrial opportunities.  None of us, on the passage of this Bill, will go away and think that that is the end of the necessary industrial development legislation and that we have reached a situation where all our employment problems will be solved.  There is still a long road to go before any Minister can look on legislation as having achieved that.</P>
      <P>The Minister should look on this in a broader sense than just making grants and incentives available to people.  Many of us come from areas that have been bedevilled by over a century of emigration, in which there has not been any confidence in the people or development by the people. The colossal haemorrhage of emigration did not halt until the late sixties and only came to an end with the sealing-off of employment opportunities in the USA and Britain.  I am thinking of the areas in Kerry and Cork and other areas in which we are under pressure to create industry.  In dealing with applications for industry we have got to be realistic.  I would ask the Minister to give attention to this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had some experience in meeting substantial numbers of people coming in here from abroad and also natives who are looking for sites and <Col N="999" /> investigating the possibility of setting up industries.  Unfortunately, many of the areas, if not all, in which we would endeavour to pressurise those people to set up are lacking in the vital infrastructure that is an absolute priority and prerequisite for industry.  I speak of roads, water and sewerage, housing and, above all, electricity.  Much of the money that will be channelled in for the encouragement of industrial development should be made available to these undeveloped areas to recreate confidence and opportunity for the people.  The very foundations necessary for industry should have first attention by way of special money to provide roads, water and sewage, housing and electricity adequate to cater for industry. The excellent sentiments and provisions of this Bill and all its predecessors will be of no avail unless we first give recognition to the basic requirements of industries before they can successfully set up in any area.</P>
    <P>We are conscious of the colossal battle that lies ahead in order to give more employment.  This is a job that will continue for a very long time.  In addition to the IDA there are also the county development teams and the regional development associations.  The county development teams have been in operation and have, in conjunction with the industrial development officers for the regions and in consultation and with advice from the IDA, done very good work.  We must accept that what they have all done combined together is still far short of giving our people employment opportunities.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Minister that possibly the combination and composition of both the county development teams and the regional development associations should be widened. At present it comprises the unpaid secretary, the chairman of the county council, who often has other full-time activities, the county manager, who also has full-time activities and the county CEO of both education and agriculture committees.  There are two vital elements, chambers of commerce and the trade unions, who have not a voice in this important body.  These are the people who finally have to get <Col N="1000" /> to grips with setting up, establishing and making a success of industries.  I believe they should have a say in the invitation of industry and their advice and expertise should be availed of by way of direct involvement with all these statutory bodies.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which is also of some concern to those of us in trade union activities.  Rationalisation is a feature and will continue to be a feature of Irish industry for many years to come, because some industries are very old and require an injection of new techniques, new machinery and new expertise.  New industries which have started within the last ten years and which got grants in excess of six figures did within six or seven years introduce major rationalisation schemes and new machinery.  The net effect was that there was a 25 per cent reduction in the labour force.  Grants were originally paid on the labour prospects and after a short period further grants were paid for the rationalisation scheme, but the net result was that an industry would reduce its labour force by practically 25 per cent. In my opinion, the Minister should be satisfied that there is an urgency in regard to the rationalisation of new industry and that the urgency is not based on the securing of higher profits at the expense of a diminished labour force.</P>
    <P>It is frequently quoted in the media that areas that are important for tourism should not be industrialised. This is a falsehood.  Industry and tourism can merge very happily.  In fact, it is established that many of the amenities that go to make up a top tourist area are themselves major magnets for personnel and top-level officers of foreign and Irish industries. I would urge on the Minister that while there may be pressure that industry should not go into an area that has a high tourist potential, this is not right.  The people of these areas can demonstrate clearly that industry can succeed alongside tourism.</P>
    <P>My final point is in regard to industrial relations.  These have been much commented. on.  One very tragic and unfortunate incident gave rise to very wide comment.  I would say that an <Col N="1001" /> overwhelming majority of trade unions and employers do not want strikes and, fortunately, never have a strike.  It is a minority who have them.  I would urge on the Minister and the Government to be hesitant in bringing legislation into this field.  It is a delicate field and one in which any legislative attempt will not succeed.  The basis for responsible and good industrial relations tions must be established between the employers and the trade unions from within and cannot be successfully legislated for from without.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelMulcahy" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  If I have anything to say against it, it is that it should have come long ago.  I have to disagree with what the Leas-Chathaoirleach said, that it is not a great problem.  He may not have used quite those words but that a lot of other people have problems greater than ours.  It is very important that the message about the job target that we have should be recognised by everybody as a very difficult one to achieve. Fifteen thousand jobs in manufacturing is one hell of a target for our industry. It means that every unit in society that can influence jobs must do something very special about it.  That includes employers, the trade unions, and of course, the agencies of State set up to help.</P>
      <P>The agency of State set up to help here is the Industrial Development Authority.  They and the Minister have declared the targets that we have to achieve in order to achieve some reasonable level of employment over the next decade.  I will not get involved in what that reasonable level is, but it is some percentage which might be the base load for the number of people on the register.  In the last five years we have lost a lot of jobs in traditional Irish industry and some in new industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The role of the IDA in this is a key one.  It is essential to the whole Government influence on development. I would like, before I say some critical words about them that I think the IDA are a tremendous State agency and doing a tremendous job.  I would like to publicly mention the chief executive of <Col N="1002" /> that organisation as a person with tremendous flare.  We have a lot to thank him for in terms of our industrial development.  The Minister must bring it home to the IDA that their whole mission is not just getting jobs but industrial development.  That is the title of the IDA agency.  The getting of jobs and then letting them there is not sufficient.  A certain amount of that was done in the past.  We have to have working in these State agencies of ours risk-taking executives.  I suspect that the name of the game was not to get involved where there was danger.</P>
    <P>When I spoke on the Gaeltacht Bill earlier today I pointed out that a group like Gaeltarra Éireann had no choice but to get involved in the risk-taking aspect of industrial development in those areas because there was no other way that would get people involved. They had to attract them into unattractive areas in terms of the infrastructural aspect that has been outlined by Senator Moynihan.  They also had other difficulties.  One of the difficulties that arises when you get involved in investment in industry is that there is a chance that you can lose.  We must be willing to put up with the losses as long as we make a much greater number of gains and achieve our targets.</P>
    <P>In the past I believe the IDA development took place too slowly and that it is only now that some of the things that should have happened before are happening.  For instance, joint ventures have been commended.  Why were we not joint venturing five years ago?  The reason I am being critical here is that the other things were missing.  We may sit back and say, &ldquo;Well, that is it&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Senator Conroy mentioned small industries.  We had a great upsurge of interest in small industries in the back end of the 1950s and early 1960s and things went along very well for a while.  Then small industries seemed to go out of the profile of interest.  In the Fianna Fáil manifesto we highlighted the importance of small industries and highlighted in particular one aspect, which was that the percentage <Col N="1003" /> of investment going into small industries was only running something like 10 per cent of the total whereas we all know the small industries make up something like 60 per cent of the total employment.</P>
    <P>It is great to see an expansion in that activity now as represented by what is happening in this Bill and, in particular, to see the support being given to first-time industrialists.  That is a nice new term.  We should let it roll around a little, &ldquo;first-time industrialists&rdquo;. We used to talk about first-time home buyers.  We need a lot more first-time industrialists and we need to give them support.  That means a lot of money and a lot of help and putting up with it when they lose, because we will lose a few.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Minister to encourage the IDA to lose a little in order to gain a lot.  For instance, in the Irish Management Institute at the moment, if I might just refer to one of my own interests, there is a programme just started.  It has been seen in the media as the Business Development Programme.  The Minister for Labour opened it last week.  Here 17 executives who want to expand their firm and employment have agreed to enter into a two-year development programme with the guidance of the people of the Institute.  We have got support to do this from the IDA, the banks and from the EEC.</P>
    <P>We must see a lot of that.  If we can get IDA to support more of that activity then small industries may expand at the rate required and we may have more entrepreneurs in the country. If we have entrepreneurs going into small industries a lot of them may turn into biggies in the long run. If you look at the structure of Irish industry now compared with ten years ago you can see that the top people in Irish industry were hardly present in a lot of cases ten years ago.  I will not mention names in that regard.</P>
    <P>IDA need a clear strategy in relation to this industrial support service. They have been articulating it fairly well.  I see in the current issue of <i>Business and Finance</i> their various <Col N="1004" /> executives have outlined the different legs of their strategy, which to me is a very useful contribution.  One area which is the first leg of that industrial strategy is exports.  Fifteen thousand jobs created every year means an output of something like £200 million. That cannot be added to the total demand in our own market.  It must go abroad.  It is essential that a huge export effort take place.  I have mentioned this before in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>I was misquoted in the media as having mentioned £2 million exports. I said £200 million.  It means that we will need a tremendous number of extra salesmen out there selling for us. I find from IMI research, something like 13 per cent of the managers in the country are in marketing.  If we had 15,000 in manufacturing every year and something like 2,000 of them managers, about 100 will be needed out there selling to get that product into the export market because we cannot, as I said before, consume it at home.  It has to get into export markets. There are approximately 200,000,000 people living within a radius of 200 miles of Rotterdam.  That is where we have to sell, not in Dublin or in Cork.</P>
    <P>The next part of the strategy which I would like to comment on is the technology one.  It is supported in this Bill and I welcome it.  We have not a very good history of supporting technological development in this country. I have referred before to some of the difficulties that arise with the efforts, for instance, of the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards, to get a strategy going in this regard.</P>
    <P>I quoted before from a paper on transferring technology to the firm: &ldquo;A Study of the Diffusion of Technology in Irish Manufacturing Industry&rdquo; by Thomas J. Allen of the M.I.T.  University and he points out:</P>
    <P>So the IIRS strategy, which on the surface appears eminently reasonable, has not worked.  Just why this is so is not immediately clear.  One possibility, suggested by the general manager of a major Irish firm, is that they have associated themselves too closely with British technology, <Col N="1005" /> and &ldquo;... British technology is always either too backward or too sophisticated for Irish purposes.&rdquo; That the IIRS is connected very strongly to the UK can be documented very readily (Table XXII). Eighty per cent of the foreigners with whom IIRS staff reported regular contact were in the UK.</P>
    <P>That is an example of where we can be codding ourselves that because we have agencies of a particular kind a strategy looks right, if it is not being delivered in the right way then it will not be effective.</P>
    <P>There is an approach which I have come across called the Pellucio, which is used in Brazil where they seem to have got much more technology transfer. Here, instead of the money being given directly to institutions of that kind it is given to industry first in voucher form and the industry can pass it on to these bodies in payment for help given in the development of technology and, in particular, help given in the development of new products. This is the other leg of the industrial strategy, the product development.</P>
    <P>We are a country which does not seem to take an interest in innovation in technology&mdash;a limited interest but not sufficient for 15,000 jobs we are talking about.  The reason for this may lie in our educational system.  All I can say at this point is that we should pay a lot of attention to what is going on in the Regional Technical Colleges, the National Institute for Higher Education in Limerick and the VEC colleges in Dublin.  In those areas may be the future entrepreneurs who will take an interest in the new product development which will in the middle eighties provide the 15,000 jobs a year.</P>
    <P>This brings me to some of the problems that seem to be arising.  I will take the industrial relations one as some people have already.  I am not afraid to mention the company that is in trouble at the moment&mdash;Ferenka. It seems to me that a company like that has got into trouble because of many, many weaknesses.  They seem to have had weaknesses in their constitution in the beginning, in their <Col N="1006" /> management and in the support which the trade union must give, particularly where they see a large firm getting into trouble.  Nobody in this case can be left off the hook.  I have some figures here which I got from discussion with the middle managers of Ferenka. Ferenka were started by an inexperienced ex-patriot management team. This led to ill-defined management policy of which the approach to personnel was but one.  None of the start up team had held a similar position&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair understands perfectly well the thinking behind the move into this subject. Nevertheless, I must point out that this subject may not be discussed in itself in detail.  A passing reference may be made to such problems, but a detailed discussion on the problems of a particular company is not in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelMulcahy" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is such an outstanding example of what I am trying to put forward as the non-delivery of what apparently seemed to be good industrial strategy that I think it should be in order to give that one example.  I am not going to discuss it. Will it be all right?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="An Leas-Chathaoirleach An Leas-Chathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>A passing reference to the problems in a particular industry would be in order, but not a detailed analysis of the problems of one industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelMulcahy" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The passing reference is that in the time since Ferenka were set up there have been five managing directors, three production managers, four chief engineers and five personnel managers.  When a company, regardless of whether it is that company or any other, get into trouble everybody should come in behind them particularly the development agencies.  I hope, if more trouble of that kind comes up in the future, that the development agencies will be in there from the beginning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another problem that can arise is the lack of development of the downstream industries from areas where we have primary raw materials.  We have talked before about this and it has <Col N="1007" /> been mentioned in many seminars and written up.  Nevertheless, if we believe in downstream industries I would have expected to see many years ago industries based on zinc and our base metals operating in the country because it would not be very difficult to buy the product, even if we have not got the smelter to produce it, and use it for downstream industries to get them going until such time as the others come on stream.  I just mention that as an example of incomplete thinking. You do not have to wait for the raw material to set up the industry.  We can get those industries going.</P>
    <P>With regard to the structure of the support system for industrial development we have heard the Minister talk about the development of the industrial development consortium.  I welcome that&mdash;he mentioned it in the Dáil&mdash; as a support operation for the work of individual agencies like the IDA.  It would be unfair, having made some critical comments and also made some laudatory comments, to say that it all falls on their shoulders.  Obviously it depends on a linkage with CTT, IIRS, National Science and Technology Council now to set up and other areas plus, of course, the financial institutions. It appears to me that the idea for the industrial development consortium can bring all of that together without going into setting up a group like an industrial organisation corporation, a new enterprise board or otherwise.  We have the agencies and we can be proud of them.  The thing is to get them to work effectively as single agencies and to work collectively as a group.  The industrial development consortium is the answer to that.  It may not be the only answer but it is one and it is certainly worth trying.  I welcome hearing about that even though it has not been referred to in this House at this stage.</P>
    <P>In relation to the job effort I have some sympathy with what Senator Moynihan said.  We need jobs from any source in the next decade.  In order to get 15,000 jobs per year in manufacturing we need a 15 per cent expansion per year.  This is a colossal expansion. We have achieved only 10 per cent in <Col N="1008" /> volume expansion and about 5 per cent in productivity expansion recently.  We need 15 per cent of volume expansion and about 7 per cent in productivity expansion to give us the 7½ per cent annual growth in employment that is needed to meet that target.  This will need, amongst other things, investment, which is a fundamental leg of that same industrial strategy I have been discussing.</P>
    <P>We have been achieving good investment and it has been expanding at a good rate.  In the most recent &ldquo;Quarterly Economic Review of Ireland, Third Quarter 1977,&rdquo; we see that the gross domestic fixed capital formation rose by 30 per cent in value terms and a similar rate is expected for 1978.  The ESRI have forecast a rise of 30 per cent.  What worries me&mdash;we are talking about a figure of £1,380 million&mdash;is that 55 per cent of the total capital formation is in building and construction.  The main thrust for our manufacturing expansion will have to come from machinery and equipment installation, which is only 40 per cent. It is even more worrying that when one looks at the rate of usage of the money put aside for investment in construction and building in the last year, there has only been an increase of 5 per cent in money terms.  If that continued through this year, and the increase that has taken place recently does not happen in sufficient volume terms, there will be a £90 million short fall of the money made available for this.  This is another example of not, in the past, putting in the investment where it was required to create jobs but using that industry is a contracyclical device to manage the economy.</P>
    <P>I hope that one of the things that will happen in this regard in the future operation of the strategy is that the construction industry will be left alone to get on with the job and keep investment going into it.  We need the investment.  We have to sacrifice other things, like wage rises.  All of this, taken together, can create a strategy for the development of 15,000 jobs per year but they are all interlocked and we cannot say we will leave it to the IDA.  There are many facets to it and every one of them has to be attacked <Col N="1009" /> but somebody must orchestrate it.  We will depend on the IDA for this.  I am confident that they are capable of doing it but things must be done faster.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong not to mention again what I said earlier on the Gaeltacht Bill, that attention must be paid to the goods produced in this country. Most countries which produced a healthy manufacturing sector in their economies did so by an earlier protection of their products.  We accept that we cannot have protection within the EEC system but we have, at least, to keep encouraging our consumers to favour guaranteed Irish products.  It is only fair that I should conclude by saying to those consumers this Christmas: &ldquo;Look before you buy because a 10 per cent swing in the purchasing pattern could mean 10,000 jobs.&rdquo;  In the light of talking about a strategy of 15,000 jobs that makes a lot of sense to me.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to see that the IDA are moving along the lines outlined in the Bill, that the money is being made available.  My message to them is to take lots of risks because it is only by risk investment that we will gain these tremendously high targets we have to achieve.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I would like to say that so far as the Bill goes, I regard it as a good development. However, I took particular notice of Senator Mulcahy's view of taking a lot of risks.  If one were to confine oneself to what is in the Second Reading of this Bill, there are not many risks there.  If we are to achieve anything like the 15,000 jobs per year, I am sorry to say that I cannot see it in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1010" /> I would like to pay sincere tribute to the men and women who run the Industrial Development Authority, not alone at national level but at regional level.  The Galway-Mayo area has been the most successful region they have, which is remarkable because it is generally recognised as a most disadvantaged area.  I would also like to say that the biggest single crisis is the unemployment situation.  As far as I am concerned, if this Bill is the solution to it we are certainly in for lots of trouble.  This Bill has not gone half far enough along the road I would like to see it taking.</P>
    <P>When we come to our ability to attract foreign industrialists we have to compete with several countries, indeed every other country in the world for that matter, some with very sophisticated skills in attracting industry. From a national point of view the IDA have been extremely good at this business.  I am also led to believe that the tax-free holiday our incoming foreign industrialists are enjoying is not likely to be with us for the next few years.  If that is the case&mdash;I ask the Minister to give his views on that subject&mdash;we will be in a dramatically worse position than we are in now because with this type of incentive the IDA had a strong hand.  We were in a favoured position in that a company deciding to set up here would know that their tax reliefs were looked after for 15 years.</P>
