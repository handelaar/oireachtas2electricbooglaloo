      <P>On the last occasion and on several previous occasions when the Seanad met the Labour group were pressing for the establishment of a Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities and we tabled a motion to that effect&mdash;No. 15 on the Order Paper. When the Seanad last met I asked that it would be taken this week and I asked for an undertaking by the Leader of the House that time would be given. I see that, in fact the Government have at last tabled a motion in the Dáil and I should like information from the Leader of the House when it is likely to be taken in the Dáil and when this House will have an opportunity of taking a similar motion to establish this committee.  It really is incredible that six months have passed since that committee last sat, that is six months of its statutory period when it could examine and recommend the <Col N="568" /> annulment of Irish ministerial regulations of Irish statutory instruments.  In my view, and in the view of the Labour group, it is essential that this committee meet before Christmas and in order to do that we must have an assurance that the Government will have the motions taken in the Dáil and in the Seanad next week at the very latest.</P>

      <P>There are amendments to section 2.  Amendments Nos. 1, 2, 3, 8 and 14, inclusive, are cognate and they should be taken together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, subsection (1), line 14, to insert &ldquo;agus Soisialaí,&rdquo; after &ldquo;Eacnamaíochta&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendments which are being taken together is to insert the words &ldquo;and Social&rdquo; after the word &ldquo;Economic&rdquo; so that the Department would be the Department of Economic and Social Planning and Development and the Minister would be the Minister for Economic and Social Planning and Development.  It is a strange omission from the Title of this Bill, from the name of the new Department and from the title of the Minister that the words &ldquo;and Social&rdquo; are not inserted and the Labour Members of this House, as do the Labour Members of the Dáil, feel very strongly that it is important that the words &ldquo;and Social&rdquo; be expressly included in the title of the new Department and in the title of the new Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="569" /> If the Bill has any sense at all it is to establish a Department to be concerned about economic and social planning and development.  I accept that in the various functions of the Department there is emphasis on economic and social planning.  For example, in section 2 (2) (a) there is the reference to the promoting and co-ordinating of &ldquo;economic and social planning for the development of the economy both generally and as respects different sectors thereof....&rdquo;. In subsection (2) (e) there is provision &ldquo;to review the implementation of such national economic and social plans as may be approved by the Government from time to time and to report thereon to the Government&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, this amendment is not merely a question of semantics and it is not a superficial amendment because the Minister must personify the focus of his Department and the type of plan which will be forthcoming.  It has been one of the problems in former government planning that there has not been a sufficient emphasis on the need for social planning.  There has been a tendency in economic plans to try to focus on the economic development and then, at a secondary level and later in time, to focus on the social dimension.  What the Labour Senators feel very strongly is that it is essential that economic and social planning go together and that any plan deals both with the economic and social dimension at the same time, that in drawing up any economic and social plan the Minister must have regard for the need for the important dimension of social planning.</P>
    <P>I had hoped to refer in some detail to the report of the National Economic and Social Council on the need for a social report because the thinking in that report is very relevant to the amendment; to the need explicitly to include the word &ldquo;social&rdquo; in the Minister's title and in the title of the new Department.  The danger is that the Minister will become known colloquially as the Minister for Economic Planning or the Minister for Economic Development.  This is already tending to happen when the name is shortened and it may tend to <Col N="570" /> diminish the significance of the role which the new Department could have in ensuring a very high social planning content in the approach of the Department to the need for overall planning and co-ordination between Departments.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I feel that this amendment is in the spirit of some of the functions of the new Department as contained in section 2 (2).  It strengthens the role of the new Department and it is an amendment which would emphasise a dimension which has not been present to the extent that it should be in previous approaches to economic and social planning.  Therefore, I think it would be an amendment which the Minister should be prepared to accept for that reason, that it strengthens and fortifies the position of the Minister and the role of the new Department.</P>
    <P>On Second Reading the point was made&mdash;indeed there was a considerable amount of questioning of the merits of the establishment of this new Department&mdash;that the functions were being very expressly set out and that there was a Department with responsibility at this planning level which would have a certain detachment, which would not have executive functions.  It would seem if this Department were really going to have a moral impact and a definite focus that it would be an improvement if it were called the Department of Economic and Social Development and its Minister the Minister for Economic and Social Development.  I hope the Minister for the Public Service will see his way to accepting this series of linked amendments in the spirit in which they are offered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I was absent for the earlier Stages of this Bill.  It is not the first time the Minister has been in this Chamber since he became Minister but it is the first time that we have encountered each other in an Oireachtas context so let me add my voice to those of others congratulating the Minister on his appointment.  May I also assure him that however resolute our exchanges may be, and no doubt as the years go on they will be resolute, from my side I can promise him that they will be pursued in the context of objectivity and in the context of arguing <Col N="571" /> about the issues and entirely without the obtrusion of personalities.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I find myself in a slight difficulty because had I been here for the Second Reading&mdash;I do not propose to make a Second Reading speech; I missed my opportunity to do that and I am not going to do it now &mdash;I would have argued the theory of the countervailing force against the Department of Finance.  I will not do that now.  I believe that the structuring of a major economic Department which balances and engages in a constructive contest with the money-gathering Department, what I call the Treasury, is the best structure by which to develop an economy.  I have argued that elsewhere and no doubt will argue it again.  I will not pursue it now.  I am, therefore, opposed to the whole concept of this Bill and the setting up of the Department which is envisaged.</P>
      <P>Bills do not get this far without the commitment of a Government and Governments do not change their minds in mid-stream except very occasionally.  I take it for granted that this Department will come into being. Therefore, on this amendment I would limit myself to supporting the argument that if it is going to happen perhaps it is not too much to hope that the Government would at least broaden the Bill, not simply have the intention.  I have no doubt that the Minister would say that is the intention. If it is to work it is well that the intention be part of the text of the Bill.  In fact, what we say here in exchanges is not part of the legislation and the time will come when nobody will refer back and say what was the Minister's intention.  They will simply say: &ldquo;Well, what do the words of the Act say?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose for seeking this amendment is to try to focus people's minds in a way that hitherto has not happened on the question of what constitutes planning.  I do not think I am betraying any confidences if I say that I was quite satisfied in my time as a Minister that there were significant forces in the Department of Finance who believed that planning as I mean <Col N="572" /> it&mdash;and I might say as European social democracy means it&mdash;was a nonsense, was impossible and was irrelevant to the difficulties, dilemmas and predicaments in this country.</P>
    <P>If you use the word &ldquo;planning&rdquo; either you do not attach the word &ldquo;economic&rdquo; to it and just call it &ldquo;planning&rdquo; or else you call it &ldquo;economic and social&rdquo; because it is not simply economic.  What planning necessitates in a mixed economy is that you get a trade-off because you can raise money in certain ways and you can spend money in certain ways. You have to decide how much you can raise, you have to decide from what different sources you can raise it.  Then you have to decide how much goes for industrial growth, infrastructure, how much goes into other areas of the economy, to social consumption, because the claims of all of these are endless.  Any useful protagonist of any portfolio would justify the doubling or trebling of the money he gets.  The whole task is a task of balance.  The making of that balance successfully necessitates a growing economy because if you did not have that you would not have money to spend.  It also necessitates deciding your options on how you spend the surplus that is not needed for the economy because the purpose of a growing economy is precisely to generate the wealth to satisfy social needs.  The thing, in fact, is a nonsence if there is not a social component in it.</P>
    <P>The reality that is envisaged to be brought into existence is not what I want but I do not suggest that it is a nonsense.  From what I know of the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, Deputy Martin O'Donoghue, and from what I know of the realities of this work as far as this Department can be made real at all, I know that of course there will be a social component.  It would be a nonsense otherwise.  Though it is weak and though it is inadequate in my view, it is not a nonsense.  If there is to be a social component necessary in the planning function which has these two aspects, why not say so?  You might say: &ldquo;If it is going to be there why bother to say so?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="573" /> I know that external evidence of the relationships between Ministers can often be deceiving but I believe there is a good relationship between the present Minister for Finance and the intended Minister for Economic Planning and Development.  Again, just as we are not talking about the intention of Ministers when Bills are enacted, neither are we talking about transient relationships between individuals who can come or go.  We are talking about legislating to do certain things which will have to be &ldquo;do-able&rdquo; and which will have to survive successfully if the relations between the two Ministers were as bad as relations could possibly be.  Unless we are being unduly hypocritical about the real nature of governments, we know that in every government there are some Ministers who get on very well and some who cannot stand the sight of each other.  That is normal, that is the way governments and political parties work.</P>
    <P>Those differences are, of course, contained but they are there.  It would be sensible since we cannot have the sort of enactment I would like to see, that we have one that is likely to go on working in circumstances of good and bad relations between the relevant Ministers, the two important ones, Finance and this one which also guarantees, at least, the chance of this poor creature that I consider it to be to have some chance of success.  The writing in explicitly of this social aspect is necessary if the fears I have about the success of it ever materialising are to be minimised and if it is to be given a chance to get off the ground.</P>

      <P>Senator Robinson said these amendments were not merely concerned with semantics, but with due deference to her I am afraid they are. Senator Keating said rightly that it is not a question of what are the Minister's or the Government's intentions, that in years to come when this is being interpreted people will look at the Act and say: &ldquo;What is in it and what does it say?&rdquo;  Let us have a look at what it says.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="574" /> Section 2 sets out the functions of the Minister.  Section 2 (2) states:</P>
    <P>It shall be the function of the Department of Economic Planning and Development...</P>
    <P>It then sets out five functions and in each one of them it refers to the social aspect.  Paragraph (a) is to promote and co-ordinate economic and social planing; paragraph (b) to identify the policies it considers necessary for general economic and social development...; paragraph (c) to review and appraise the plans and activities of Departments of State giving effect to the policies for general economic and social development adopted by the Government; paragraph (d) to make proposals to the Government for the co-ordination of the plans and activities referred to in paragraph (c) of this subsection and for their integration with national economic and social plans&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, surely that is an argument for this group of amendments and not against them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>May I finish my argument? Paragraph (e) which is the final paragraph setting out the principal functions of the Department and of the Minister reads: &ldquo;to review the implementation of such national economic and social plans....&rdquo;</P>
      <P>On reading this Bill in ten years' time one could not say that it was not intended to include the social aspect of planning.  It is clearly set out in each one of the functions laid down for the Minister and the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also true, of course, particularly today, that it is impossible to visualise economic planning which did not take full account of the social requirements of the community and the social dimenensions of planning, as Senator Keating said, the expenditure of what might be called the surplus money which is available.  You have to do it and the reality is that the Bill specifically writes in the social aspect of each of the functions laid down for the Minister. What we are talking about in these amendments is not the reality of the functions but about whether it is a <Col N="575" /> good or a bad thing to include the word &ldquo;social&rdquo; in the title of the Minister and his Department.  We ought to get what we are talking about into perspective.  It boils down largely to a question of public relations.  I do not decry the public relations aspect of putting across to the general public the fact that the functions of this Minister and Department include social planning and development as well as economic planning and development. If you consider what is involved in this, whether there is to be any real gain by putting in this word, if you try to deal with it objectively you must come to the conclusion that any gain involved can only be marginal.</P>
    <P>As against that, what you are doing if you put it in is you are giving the Minister and the Department the most lengthy title of any Minister or Department in Government.  Senator Robinson referred to the manner in which the title is shortened for common usage and the fact that people may already be referring to the Minister for Economic Planning.  This may well be so, I am not disputing it.  If that is so already, does one seriously suggest that putting in the word &ldquo;social&rdquo; is going to change the impact of the title of the Minister or the Department?  What we have to concern ourselves with here is the reality of the functions of the Minister and the Department, of the statutory powers and obligations being imposed on the Minister and the Department to concern themselves not only with economic planning and development but with social planning and development.</P>
    <P>I hope I have demonstrated clearly that that is built into the Bill fully, unequivocally and unambiguously and therefore, if we are trying to have regard to the importance or otherwise of adding the word &ldquo;social&rdquo; to the title of the Minister and of the Department, we are talking about something quite different and something on which there can be, I freely admit, a difference of opinion.  The balance one way or the other would depend, perhaps, on personal assessments of the situation.  My assessment and that of my colleagues is that the value of <Col N="576" /> adding in the word &ldquo;social&rdquo; to the title is so minimal that it is not worth doing when you are faced with the counter-difficulty that you are giving an almost completely unwieldly and cumbersome title to the Minister and the Department.  The reality is that that title in normal usage is likely to be shortened even without the addition of the word &ldquo;social&rdquo;.  It seems there is nothing of substance to be gained by adding the word &ldquo;social&rdquo; and that these amendments are dealing really with shadows.  Even in the field of shadows the balance of advantage lies against the amendments rather than for them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened carefully to the Minister's reply and most of it strengthens the case for the amendment.  He said we should be concentrating on an awareness of the reality of the functions of the Minister. In proposing the amendment I drew attention to the fact that the functions include economic and social planning and I accept that.  It is an awareness of those functions that strengthens the case for calling the Minister what he is.  If the Minister's argument&mdash;and it is a strange one&mdash;is that to add the word &ldquo;social&rdquo; would somehow give the Minister too long a title, I find that strange because there has been some lengthening of titles of some other Ministers; for example, the Minister for Industry and Commerce is now the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy.  It is quite a cumbersome title to get your tongue around.  If the Minister's main reason for opposing this amendment is that it would make the title too long and cumbersome, then I would be prepared on Report Stage to bring in an amendment to delete the word &ldquo;economic&rdquo;. Let us have the new Minister called the Minister for Planning and Development because that in a sense would meet the reality of this amendment. To talk about the Minister for Economic Planning without using the words &ldquo;economic and social planning&rdquo; narrows the role and functions of the Minister, in his title, in the focus and in the name of his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="577" /> If we want to have brevity rather than a very explicit title for the Minister which identifies his real functions, we could table an amendment on Report Stage to delete the word &ldquo;Economic&rdquo;. Then we would have a Minister for Planning and Development.</P>
    <P>I would like to agree that it should not be possible to think in terms of economic planning without also to be thinking in terms of social planning, but that is not necessarily so, has not been necessarily so in our approach to planning at Government level and, indeed, in Fianna Fáil's approach to planning when in Government in previous years.  Was it mere window-dressing that Fianna Fáil's Third Programme was entitled &ldquo;A Programme for Economic and Social Development&rdquo;&mdash;a great deal of emphasis was placed on the fact that the words &ldquo;and Social&rdquo; were included in the title of the programme&mdash;or was it an attempt to try to ensure a change of focus? I do not think the change of programme at that stage was very successful but there was significant thinking behind it.  In my opinion, it would be significant to ensure that the Minister was either called &ldquo;the Minister for Economic and Social Planning and Development&rdquo; or &ldquo;the Minister for Planning and Development&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>His functions, as set out in section 2 (2), made it clear that there was as much emphasis on social planning as on economic planning.  There is a possibility&mdash;it is a danger and something we had in the past&mdash;that economic planning in a narrow sense will go ahead.  For example, projects for low-cost housing where the economic dimension is emphasised can cause very significant social difficulties and social upheaval and can have a very bad effect on the environment and on the quality of life of the people who would have to live in low-cost housing which had diminished the social criteria where these had been left out.</P>
    <P>Similarly, social planning can be carried out sometimes at very little cost.  It is a question of taking into account the social dimension.  Recently I participated in a seminar with the new Minister&mdash;which I have referred <Col N="578" /> to previously&mdash;organised by the Council for the Status of Women.  The subject-matter was Economic and Social Planning: Where Do Women Fit In? The new Minister prefaced his remarks by regretting that although he had most of his complement of staff there were no women in the higher ranks. He said he had not actively done anything about it but that that was the reality.  There were no women at key level advising in that Department.  That is a great pity because there is a danger that a dimension of the importance of social planning will be omitted.  For example, in relation to the consideration of plans for housing and development of community amenities, women would have a greater perception of the need for concentration on the area of social planning and of ensuring that whatever plans were put forward substantial emphasis would be placed on this area.</P>
    <P>I would be afraid that to allow the Minister&mdash;as a new Minister with a new title&mdash;to go forth with what appears to be this narrow focus on economic planning and development would be, in a sense, a retrograde step which would fail to highlight the necessity for a rounded and interpreted approach to economic and social planning. This is all the more important because it is clearly the intent in this measure.  A great deal depends on people's perception and on where the emphasis is laid.</P>
    <P>The Minister in replying to the points I made when moving the amendment was saying that this was more or less a question of semantics which I do not accept for the reasons given or, secondly, that it would make the Minister's title too long.  Would he be prepared to accept an amendment which actually shortened the Minister's title and that of the Department but which achieved the same effect by omitting the word &ldquo;Economic&rdquo; when not linked with the words &ldquo;and Social&rdquo;?  The Minister would be titled &ldquo;the Minister for Planning and Development&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelMulcahy" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to contribute to this debate.  Senator Robinson is going over old ground.  We might as well say the Minister for &ldquo;Economic <Col N="579" /> Planning and Development&rdquo; or &ldquo;Economic, Technology, Planning and Development&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Economic Political, Technology, Planning and Development&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Economic, Technology, Physical, Agricultural Development&rdquo; and so on.  It is clear that the term &ldquo;Economic&rdquo; is being used in the same context as it is used in many textbooks on economics.  It catches the general dimension of what goes on in an economy, both in terms of physical and trade resources and in the social system.  As a title it is a useful general term which covers what we are talking about here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not intended to intervene again but the effort to suggest that this is purely semantic, which has been done both by the Minister and by Senator Mulcahy, makes their case worse and the arguments for these amendments greater.  The Minister has pointed out that in five subsections the term &ldquo;social&rdquo; occurs, yet it does not occur in the title of the person to do these things.  If we put that into the context of something that was said by Senator Whitaker, it becomes more interesting.  I did not hear his speech which I have been assured was an interesting one.  We do not agree but I intend to read it.  I have seen the newspaper report, but I have not read the full text.  From the newspaper report Senator Whitaker, who would be in a position to know, suggested that power has been taken from the Department of Finance but has not gone anywhere else.  I do not know if that is a fair gloss on what he said&mdash;that it has not accrued to the new Department, although it has been taken from the existing Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The relationships between Departments are, of course, conducted according to decent norms but they are competitive.  Every Department and every Minister, encouraged by his senior officials, tries to push out the boundaries.  Every other Minister tries to push him back.  There is a continuous attrition within the law-given areas of responsibility between different Departments.  Sometimes the rules are changed and Departments gain a little or lose a little.  That is <Col N="580" /> normal.  Those sort of conflicts between Departments are essential for the vigorous functioning of Departments with high morale.  They are good things.  Of course, there is a conflict between a Minister for Finance and a new Minister of this kind.  It is decent, normal structured conflict, but it is a conflict situation.  We find that the Minister for Finance in a sense, has to remove a rib from himself to create a new individual.  I will not pursue that metaphor but that is what he is doing in this Bill.  He is taking out a portion of his own structure and setting it up as an independent entity.</P>
    <P>In the definition of doing that, of course, he must have certain feelings&mdash;&ldquo;It is a pity; my senior officials say we could really do it better in this Department, but there seems to be a consensus that it should go somewere else&rdquo;.  So you enumerate the things the new Minister will do.  Then you do not give him the title to do it.  Of course, there is a potential conflict between this Minister and the new Minister.  I am not suggesting that this is so.  It is not simply a situation of conflict between Departments; there is also the conflict between individuals at the Government table. That is inherent in the spreading of a planning function out of a treasury-type Department where it traditionally has been.</P>
    <P>If you do not give a clear title to the new individual, you lay the basis for more conflict than there need be and you lay the basis for the undermining of his position.  I do not think this is a good initiative.  If it is to happen, then I want to see it happen successfully. The clear giving of a social aspect to the title of the Minister, as well as the writing in of certain subsections giving a social responsibility to that Minister under the Act, would strengthen him.  If it is going to happen at all, it is better that it happens right. We are trying to be helpful and to make the new Minister and Department function more effectively.  The responses suggesting it is purely semantic, make our case stronger.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Keating is mistaken in his assessment of the <Col N="581" /> position.  First, the terms of this Bill, specifically the terms in section 2 (2) setting out the functions of the Minister are, of course, agreed terms not only between the Minister for Economic Planning and Development and myself but agreed also by the Government.  In the event of some conflict in the future Senator Keating, I would suggest, knows as well as I do that it would not be resolved by reference to the title of the Minister or the Department, but rather to the function of the Department as defined in the Bill.  He also knows that all Departments have certain titles which, as Senator Mulcahy said, are catch-all phrases, but they certainly do not include, or even suggest, many of the functions carried out by those Departments. It is misleading to lay undue stress on the inclusion or omission of the word &ldquo;social&rdquo; in the title of the Minister or the Department.</P>
      <P>I have a suspicion&mdash;I know I should not say this, but I am going to say it anyway&mdash;that Senator Keating did not read section 2 (2) before he made his first contribution.  I suspect that because, if you recall, he said that if somebody reads this in years to come, the Minister's intention is not relevant but rather what is in the Bill.

      <P>The fact is that all five include it.  That is of some significance. Senator Robinson put the suggestion to me that if I do not agree with the proposition to put in &ldquo;social&rdquo;, why not delete the word &ldquo;economic&rdquo; and make the title shorter?  As regards making the title shorter, I would be quite happy to do that; the shorter the <Col N="582" /> better so far as I am concerned.  There would, however, be problems.  The title would be so wide&mdash;that is, the Minister for Planning and Development&mdash; as to suggest much more than would be intended to be suggested in the title of this Minister or this Department. For example, it could be reasonably interpreted as meaning physical planning.  Somebody suggested that it might even be deemed to include family planning&mdash;a topic with which Senator Robinson is not unfamiliar.</P>

We really ought not to spend too much time on this aspect because, while I respect the ingenuity with which Senator Robinson and Senator Keating have put forward their arguments, the fact is that the Bill specifically gives the Minister and the Department functions in relation to both economic and social planning and development.  The title is merely indicative.  It is not something that goes to the root of the performance or the functions of the Minister or of his Department.  In those circumstances, I could not recommend the House to accept these amendments.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 2, subsection (2), between lines 34 and 35, to insert the following new paragraph:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="583" />&ldquo;(e)  to publish annually an outline plan for economic and social development for a period of not less than four years from the date of publication outlining the objectives of the plan and the policies chosen to achieve these objectives, and including an estimate of expenditure of each Department of State for each year of the plan, and the expected Exchequer receipts for each year of the plan,&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I have no objection to these amendments being taken together as they are related.  The purpose of amendment No. 4 is to insert a new and very specific and important function for the Minister for Economic Planning and Development and that is:</P>
    <P>to publish annually an outline plan for economic and social development for a period of not less than four years from the date of publication outlining the objectives of the plan and the policies chosen to achieve these objectives, and including an estimate of expenditure of each Department of State for each year of the plan, and the expected Exchequer receipts for each year of the plan.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 5 provides that such outline plan as provided for in paragraph (e) would be laid before each House of the Oireachtas annually. Amendment No. 6 provides that there would be a duty on the Minister:</P>
    <P>to consult on a regular basis, either individually or collectively, with the interest groups represented on the National Economic and Social Council at the time of the passing of this Act, on the general provisions of the outline plan referred to in paragraph (e) of this subsection,</P>
    <P>which is amendment No. 4.</P>
    <P>The problem with this Bill&mdash;and it is a problem that was mentioned by a number of other Senators on Second Reading&mdash;is that the functions of the new Minister are very nebulously and vaguely set out.  In all good faith I believe there is a danger that the new Minister will become some sort of ministerial think-tank.  There is a <Col N="584" /> danger that the functions of the new Minister might be confined to monitoring, reporting on and reviewing the plans which were emerging from the various Departments, that the functions might be equivalent to the functions of the central policy review staff attached to the United Kingdom Government, that it would be a detached role, not an executive position but merely one which was second rate to the planning, particularly, of the Department of Finance and the planning and priorities of other Departments. That is a potential danger in the way in which the various functions are set out.  If one looks at them, they really are, whatever the new Minister and the new Department make of them, as follows:</P>
    <P>(a)  to promote and co-ordinate economic and social planning for the development of the economy both generally and as respects different sectors thereof and different regions of the country, ...</P>
    <P>There is no time limit, no costing of the plans to be specifically incorporated in them and no duty to publish. At the time there could be private internal memoranda for the Government. And&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>(b)  to identify the policies it considers necessary for general economic and social development and to report thereon to the Government,...</P>
    <P>That could be a very internal and limited exercise of a think-tank nature, prodding the Government to do a job which they were already doing and to do it slightly more efficiently, and with more modern techniques; to identify in consultation with Departments of State and to review and appraise the plans and activities of such Department giving effect to the policies and the general economic and social developments adopted by the Government.  It might have a useful consultative role but again that could be very much at a secondary back-up level.  &ldquo;To make proposals to the Government for the co-ordination of the plans and activities referred to in paragraph (c) of this subsection and for their <Col N="585" /> integration with national economic and social plans&rdquo;, a monitoring, coordinating role, and, finally, &ldquo;to review the implementation of such national economic and social plans as may be approved by the Government from time to time&rdquo; is again a reviewing and monitoring role.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to create a very important and very significant role for the Department, a role which would seem to be essential if it is really to be a counterbalance to the Department of Finance, and if it is really to be a Department of Economic Planning and Development.  This would require the Minister to publish annually an outline plan.  I would like at this stage to emphasise that this would be an outline plan; it would not be the equivalent of a White Paper where decisions had already been taken and where it was in a sense too late in some measure to consult with the various interested groups and sectors. It could be in the nature of an outline plan which had a degree of flexibility in it.  Obviously there would have to be the assumption of initial responsibility and decision-making by the Government, but it should not be an inflexible or rigid blueprint.  It would be for a period of not less than four years.</P>
    <P>The reasons for deciding on a period of four years are first, it is more or less the span of a Government&mdash;it may be slightly more or less than four years &mdash;and for that reason it would appear to be a way of indicating what the overall plan and intention of a Government in office would be. The intention would be that this would be published at the beginning of the Government's term of office.  This plan should outline the objectives and the policies chosen to achieve those objectives.  It should also include an estimate of the expenditure of each Department of State for each year of the plan and the expected Exchequer receipts.</P>
    <P>In my view, a plan of this nature would conform very much to the very clear and helpful analysis of planning which Senator Whitaker gave in his speech for which I was present last week.  He distinguished between, as he <Col N="586" /> put it, a plan and a manifesto.  He made it clear that in his view a plan had to be carefully costed.  It had to set out very carefully the estimate of expenditure for each Department and the expected Exchequer receipts for each year of the plan.  He also made what I thought was a very valuable and valid argument about the consequent nature of the annual budget.  If you have a four-year outline plan, and it is costed, the real role of the annual budget is to make the necessary adjustments which would be required because of the reality of not being able to predict, not being able entirely to foresee certain aspects of the situation, and the budget would lose some of its mystique and some of its, I think he called it, Santa Clause aspects, and would instead become an economic instrument of annual adjustment to an outline plan.</P>
    <P>If the Minister were prepared to accept this amendment, it would genuinely give the new Minister and Department a much more decisive and definite role in being responsible for the publication of this outline plan. Obviously the plan itself would have to be devised in very close consultation with the other Departments.  It could be the fruit of the exercise of some of the functions already contained in section 2 (2).</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 5 would require that this outline plan be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  This again would play an important role in involving the Houses of the Oireachtas in the on-going business of planning for the future of this country.  This is essential because at the moment I do not believe that the Dáil and Seanad play the role they could play in relation to economic and social planning. I believe the resources of both Houses are not used sufficiently, partly because plans are not laid and costed for a sufficient period.  It is only if we have the possibility of examining a properly costed outline plan for a period of four years that both Houses could address themselves to the constructive function of examining them, of making helpful contributions to the debate and perhaps of trying to change the emphasis but certainly with the objective of seeing the merits and problems in a <Col N="587" /> particular outline plan.</P>
    <P>This is absolutely essential for Ireland over the next number of years, and specifically over the next four years, because the major problem which we all have clearly identified and know all too well is the problem of providing for full employment&mdash;the massive difficulty which is going to be faced by us as a people.  It will require very real resources of the State, not just of the Government, but of both Houses of the Oireachtas and of the various social partners and other interested sectors.  It will require a consensus at some level about what we should be doing and an ability as a people, if necessary, to take very difficult decisions.  This can only be done, we would submit, on the basis of a known and costed plan over a period of four years.  If this Department are going to have any real function, that is the real function they could have.  If that plan were laid before both Houses there would be an opportunity for constructive debate and for realistic contribution by Deputies and Senators.</P>
    <P>This would be in the spirit of the concept of a plan as a constantly changing and evolving overall economic instrument.  It would not be possible to have a rigid or fixed plan or, indeed, to criticise a Government for changing part of their plan.  The outline, the priorities and the costing for each Department should be clearly set out.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 6 would place a statutory duty on the Government to consult on a regular basis, either individually or collectively, with the interest groups represented on the National Economic and Social Council. The reason for this is the substantial need for greater openness and involvement of the social partners, particularly in economic and social planning.  We have seen a number of very difficult situations because there has not been an appreciation of the need for involvement and discussion at an early enough stage in economic and social planning.  Therefore, I believe this amendment would provide for much greater participation and, therefore, greater involvement with an outline plan and would hopefully <Col N="588" /> achieve a basic consensus for us as a people as to what our priorities were and how we were going to try to achieve them.  This would be very healthy for our democracy and would allow us to use the resources of the State, to tackle that greatest of all problems which has such significant economic and social dimensions, the problem of providing full employment, of creating a massive number of new jobs and of creating a climate which will help and foster job creation, a climate in which we can build up our own industries, large and small, and attract industry from outside.</P>
    <P>I believe that the Minister should seriously consider accepting these related amendments to ensure that the Department have the impact and the substantial role that he appeared to want to give them in his speech introducing the measure into the House. At the moment the danger is that all the functions are at a secondary level and are nebulous and will not allow the Department to have the intended impact on the performance of the Government. The danger is that there is a <i>lacuna</i> and, as Senator Whitaker pointed out, the Department of Finance retain all the economic instruments and this new Department can only put forward, monitor or review plans.  It cannot, in fact, play a more significant role in formulating an outline plan over a sufficient period of time, allowing for open and constructive consultation by debates in both Houses on the plan and the requirement to consult with the social partners.  I hope the Minister, when he has reflected on it, will be prepared to accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In considering these amendments it is necessary to look at what is sought to be done in this Bill and to look at what is done in the establishment of other Departments.  If we look at the Ministers and Secretaries Act as a whole, we find that Departments of State were set up and their powers, dealings and functions were set out.  It is also clear that these powers and functions were set out in the widest possible terms with two principal purposes in mind, first, to define the area of responsibility of <Col N="589" /> each Department and, secondly, to ensure that the Departments and the Ministers have adequate power to act in the area allocated to them.  The functions provided for in this Bill for the new Department are quite ample to meet the criteria which apply to all Departments.</P>
      <P>It would appear from the amendments that the functions, as proposed in the Bill, are accepted but it is sought to add to them.  Amendment No. 4 sets out a certain message or methodology in regard to the approach to planning which should be used by the Department. I am not saying that there is anything wrong with the method proposed in amendment No. 4.  In some circumstances it could be quite appropriate.  What I am saying is that it would be quite wrong to impose a statutory and mandatory method of approach to planning on the Minister and the Department when we know that, even if this method proposed in amendment No. 4 were the ideal method as of now, it will not be the ideal method at some time in the future.  It could be deemed to be the ideal method of approach as of now.  I am not going into the argument as to whether it is or not, because we could waste a lot of time on that.  I want to suggest to the House that it is a wrong approach when we are dealing with the setting up of a new Department to hamper it in the way it is suggested in this amendment.  This amendment is concerned much more with the methods of operation of the Department rather than with its general functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The method of operation of a Department cannot be laid down in the Bill which sets it up.  I think a little thought will show that this could lead to enormous difficulty.  There is one aspect of it to which I would draw the attention of the House.  I am not making a major point of this but it should cause some concern.  To the extent that you are quite specific in the Bill setting up a Department as to the things it can do and particularly the kind of methods it can adopt in approaching planning, by implication you are excluding the power to do anything else. <Col N="590" /> It could be argued that any other approach would be deemed to be <i>ultra vires</i> if you are too specific, as I suggest amendment No. 4 is.  I would also suggest that a four-year span may have something to recommend it in certain circumstances but surely it can be conceded in other circumstances that a four-year span might be far too long or too short.  Are we to impose this method of planning on the Department and leave it no freedom to manoeuvre at all in the methods it uses?  I hope that a little reflection will show that this is the wrong approach to a Bill which is setting up a Department and setting out its terms of reference in general terms.</P>
    <P>Similarly amendment No. 5 seems to be inappropriate because it would lay a statutory obligation on the Department to lay an outline plan before each House of the Oireachtas annually. There may well be many years in which this would be appropriate but there will be some years in which it would not.  If you have a statutory obligation to do so, no doubt the Department would comply with that, but the form of plan that you would get in such circumstances would simply be a waste of time and a waste of the time of both Houses if they were to discuss it.</P>
    <P>Again, we are talking about the method that should be used by the Department in carrying out their function.  I want to urge the House very strongly that the Department and the Minister should be left as much room to manoeuvre as possible as to the methods that would be used, as to the ability to learn from methods used, to improve some, to discard others and not to put the Department and the Minister in a straitjacket of certain statutory methods of planning.  I want to make it clear that I am not opposed in principle to the methods suggested in amendment No. 4 nor am I opposed to the idea in amendment No. 5, which is the laying annually before each House of the Oireachtas of an outline plan.  In general, I would be in favour of it but I have this reservation, that if it is to be done I want it to be a genuine outline plan, not one that is simply produced because there is a <Col N="591" /> statutory obligation to do so.  There are circumstances in which it might not be appropriate to do it and in which, if there were a statutory obligation you would simply get a document which was not worth the time of either House of the Oireachtas discussing.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 6 is providing for something which will happen, which must happen, if there is to be any national plan of validity or hope of validity and acceptance, but it is making the mistake again of laying down, in a statute, much too restrictive terms of reference for the Department.  It provides that consultation is to take place &ldquo;on a regular basis, either individually or collectively, with the interest groups represented on the National Economic and Social Council at the time of the passing of this Act&rdquo;.  That is very specific but we know from past experience that some of the bodies now represented on the NESC evolve from other bodies or constitute an amalgamation of other bodies.  It would be unreasonable to presume that a process of this kind will not take place at any time in the future and yet this amendment proposes to lay down a statutory obligation to consult with those bodies. Again, I suggest that a little reflection will show that this is not the right approach.  I want to make it clear, although I am saying this is not the right approach and for the reasons I have outlined, that it is my belief and it is the belief of the Government that widescale consultation with the, for want of a better term, social partners is and will continue to be an essential part of planning if one is to hope to produce a realistic plan with a reasonable prospect of widespread acceptance. That fact is self-evident and I think that whatever Government are in power, whatever planning is being done, it will be clear to that Government that they must engage in such consultation on a regular basis if they are to have any hope of achieving their objective.  I fully accept the purpose of the amendment but the actual implementation of it in this way, in a statutory mandatory way, is I believe a mistake and I urge the House not to make that mistake.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Long before the Bill came up I had been looking forward to this debate on whether there should be planning and where it should be located because as a member of the previous Government I know that this was something which was debated. There were statements about that in the Coalition's election manifesto.  I heard some of the things said in the Dáil and read some of the others and heard discussions about the Dáil debate on this and I reserved judgment as to the real intentions of the Minister for Finance until I had an opportunity to be here and see him and listen to him.  Unfortunately I was not able to do that on the Second Stage of the Bill and I do not want to make a Second Stage speech.  As I listened to him I came to the conclusion that the real intention, to use his own word of a few minutes ago, is a semantic one, it is an intention of shadows, it is not an intention of fact.</P>
      <P>The object of these three amendments, which logically band together, is to give this Department certain things which it must do.  In section 2 (2) I have underlined the various verbs that occur in the enumeration of the functions.  It is no harm to repeat them: to promote and co-ordinate, to identify, to report, to identify, to review and appraise, to make proposals to the Government, to review the implementation, to report thereon.  Look at all those verbs together.  It may be that the intention of the Minister for Finance is that genuine planning in a genuinely new Department should come into existence in this country.</P>
      <P>As I listened to him it seemed to me that this Bill is a mechanism to emasculate the promise that was made of real planning.  The argument I would think is the following.  I have heard it before in debates that related to the future role of the Department of Finance.  If it cannot be in Finance then we will see that it does not happen at all.  We strive to be specific but indeed not to put a straitjacket on the new Department or the new Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps as one who has recently been accused of not reading something I might point out that in our amendment No. 4 to section 2, the paragraph <Col N="593" /> (e) to be added to the phrase is &ldquo;not less than four years&rdquo; which is a very different thing from four years.  It is a matter of reading.  If you do not give a Department something that it must actually do then one Minister with one single secretary and one typist could promote and co-ordinate, could report, could identify, could review, could appraise, could make proposals, could report thereon, without actually doing anything.</P>
    <P>I have said that I think this is a bad solution to the question of economic planning in this country.  My God, manifesto politics and Christmas-stocking politics apart, is it not time we had some solution?  If we as a Coalition Government did not do it&mdash; I affirm that and I regret it&mdash;is it not time that somebody else did?  I would have to applaud a Fianna Fáil Government if they did.  The object of these amendments is to make it possible for the new Department precisely to act.  We have not managed our economic affairs well in the history of this State.  I say that in a blanket sense about Cumann na nGaedheal, pre-war Fianna Fáil, and the various Coalitions. None of us have done it.  The trouble with growth is that it is one of these compound interest things, in any period the function of how big is the economy at the start of the period, then, if you are losing a ½ per cent or 1 per cent per annum over a decade the difference at the end of 40 or 50 odd years, during which we have been trying to do something with our economy, is enormous.  We have suffered literally in levels of current personal income from the ½ per cent or the 1 per cent interest points that were lost down the decades.  We have not done well.</P>
    <P>There is a consensus that we need planning even though there is not a consensus as to what planning is.  We have gone ex-gross in 1973.  There is a new economic environment in the parts of the world that are relevant to us.  I may be handing a piece of the armament of an Opposition over to the Government but is it not the case that in any given set of economic circumstances&mdash;current economic circumstances are difficult&mdash;we generally <Col N="594" /> know the things that we ought to do but we find it difficult in a time of manifesto and Christmas-stocking politics to get the national consensus to do those things.  Is it not, therefore, the case that it is essential not just to talk to an Opposition but to talk to all the social parties?  If we are going to find the courage to make a difficult decision&mdash;I have given an example of that decision&mdash;who knows it better than someone who at different times has been Minister for Finance and is now Minister for Finance again?</P>
    <P>Is the great argument not how much money can you spend on social consumptions <i>versus</i> how much do you have to go to investment in industrial and agricultural production?  That is a continuing argument.  It is the great dilemma of democratic mixed society. The more the public know the more you can have rational answers to that and the more indeed you can stymie an Opposition from playing what I call manifesto and Christmas-stocking politics. If we really wanted to see this Department function one would have to support these amendments but if one wanted to carry out a formal promise and consign a thing to limbo so that it existed in theory but in fact did nothing then one would enumerate the responsibilities and tasks of the Department of Economic Planning and Development precisely as they are enumerated in subsection (2) (a) to (e); you would refuse to have them hardened, clarified or made specific under the guidance of the straitjacket and you would let the poor creature wither.  My fear is that this is a formula for letting the poor creature wither. Our economy at any time, but particularly in the time facing us, will be the worse for this Bill not giving the power to a planning department to function as planning departments are now understood to function, of necessity, in mixed economies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I was glad the Minister emphasised several times in his contribution to the discussion on these amendments that he agreed in principle with the amendments, with the idea of publishing an outline plan over a period of not less than four years, with the idea of laying such <Col N="595" /> plans before the Houses of the Oireachtas and also that he agreed in principle very strongly with the idea of consultation with social partners.  His objection was to making these requirements mandatory because this would not leave the Department and the Minister with enough room to manoeuvre. I find that rather strange and worrying because it is part of our democracy not to leave a Minister or a Department too much room to manoeuvre in the sense of too much lack of function, so that we do not perceive that the functions are not being performed.  That precisely is what is at the bottom of these amendments and one of the potential weaknesses of the present identification of the functions of the new Department and the new Minister.</P>
      <P>I made it clear when moving these amendments that it is not intended to conceive of an outline plan as something fixed, rigid and, therefore, a straitjacket, to use the Minister's term. That is not what is meant in any sense when we are talking about setting out the costed economic and social plan of a Government, showing what the Estimates and expenditures of the various Departments would be over a period.  I made it clear by referring to the fact that the budget would be a necessary instrument for making adjustments on an annual basis and for changing the nature of the plan.  The fact that there is provision in amendment No. 5 for the outline plans to be laid annually before each House of the Oireachtas again shows that the intention would be to have flexibility and to adapt to the reality of the situation.</P>
      <P>I would welcome some elaboration by the Minister of what he meant by saying that in some years it might be appropriate to lay an outline plan before the Houses of the Oireachtas, and some years it might not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I could clarify it.  That is not a problem.  It is not intended by seeking, as this amendment does, to have the outline plan laid annually, that the plan would envisage a time span of 12 months.  The whole purpose would be to have an involvement by the Oireachtas in the evolution of the plan.  The outline plan would be one which would have what I think would be regarded as a necessary span in it of not less than four years&mdash;that is the whole idea of an outline plan&mdash;and an estimate of the expenditure of Departments and of the receipts.  The idea of tabling an outline plan annually would be, in itself, a most effective way of monitoring and reviewing the implementation of the outline plan.</P>
      <P>The only sense I can put on the Minister's expression that &ldquo;some years it would not be appropriate,&rdquo; is because of political embarrassment at not being able to deliver what was in the plan, not being able to meet the expectations or having miscalculated on the Estimates of expenditure of particular Departments.  There are very strong democratic reasons why we need the involvement of the representatives of the people in the working out of an outline plan for economic and social development over a period of years.  This must be done by retabling the plan annually as it is envisaged for that particular year, up-dating it in an evolutionary way.</P>
      <P>We need the active involvement of the social partners.  The problem about an assurance by a Minister in the Seanad on 30th November, 1977, that of course there will be consultations with the social partners, is that it does not carry any real statutory weight, it is a ministerial assurance.  I am not trying to undermine the good faith of the Minister.  I am sure he intends that there be active consultation with the social partners.  If there is not there is no way of ensuring this.  It is not a requirement that there be this specific type of consultation, consultation about the outline plan, which rules out all the other dimensions of consultation in our democracy between Government, social partners and other interested groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="597" /> Any suggestion that by inserting a specific provision here one is preventing any other type of consultation does not stand up to examination.  That is not the effect of the amendment.  The effect of the amendment is to provide a statutory requirement of regular consultation to give the social partners an involvement in the formulation of the outline plan.  This is in line with the whole theory of participative democracy, that the Government commit themselves to an outline plan over a sufficient period of years, that they have the capacity to adjust that outline plan to the reality of the situation, but that the whole process is done in an open and visible way in consultation with the social partners and with the participation of the representatives of the people in both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>As the Minister has taken the trouble to repeat that he accepts the principle behind these amendments it is difficult to see why he says he will not accept the amendments on the grounds that they would tie the hands of the new Minister and his Department, that they would tie the hands of the Government, and be rigid and mandatory.  It is clear that the amendments are not rigid in the accepted sense of the word.  They would, to some extent, tie the hands of a Government in that they would commit a Government to an outline plan, that they would commit the Department to the discipline of estimated costings related to this outline plan.  Surely it is in the interests of achieving a sufficient consensus to be able to cope with particularly difficult problems we face and most of all that difficult problem of providing for sufficient job creation and sufficient discipline in relation to jobs, to achieve the objective of full employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to delay the proceedings unduly but there are a few things I would like to say.  First, Senator Keating made a couple of references to &ldquo;manifesto politics and Christmas-stocking politics&rdquo;.  I adverted to this matter previously but I should like to say once more that if there is implied in what Senator Keating <Col N="598" /> is saying that as far as Fianna Fáil are concerned they put forward a list of goodies to the people and succeeded in being elected as a result, I want to refute totally that suggestion because it is too easy for people to produce excuses now for their failure.</P>
      <P>The facts should not be forogtten. They are that the Fianna Fáil election manifesto contained a lot more than goodies.  It contained a number of restrictions, for instance, moderation in pay, and was quite specific on that, limitations on the amount of expenditure that could be contemplated in this year, in the coming year and in the years thereafter.  There was detailed discussion in the various news media on those aspects before the election.  I should like to say that once more because I want to refute the suggestion that is being made.  I am not necessarily saying that Senator Keating is making it, though it seemed to me to be implied in what he said, but it is open to another interpretation.  I want to make it quite clear in so far as I am concerned, we have to let the facts speak for themselves and not allow a myth to be created that would explain away the failure of the Coalition in the last election.</P>
      <P>If I might come more specifically to the matters at issue: I have never been one to denigrate the political astuteness of Senator Keating.  He displayed certain aspects of this again in what he said here today.  He got in to concede that the Coalition did not engage in planning.  Of course he is perfectly right.  Factually they did not but I think he may have thought he would soften the blow a little by acknowledging it first.  He was a member of a Government whose Minister for Finance said that it would not be possible to publish a meaningful programme pending a re-assessment of medium-term planning in the light of the current, unsettled world economic situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not mind this interruption at all.  I welcome it because Senator Keating is suggesting that I am trying to misrepresent the position of the former Minister for Finance and his colleagues in Government.  If he wants to argue about that at least he <Col N="600" /> cannot argue about what happened or did not happen.  There is no room for argument on that, presumably.  He says I am changing ground.  The facts are that whatever was said, or whatever may have been said in public or behind the scenes, no plan was produced by the Coalition Government.  We had promises.  We had indeed the infamous or notorious promise of a plan by mid-summer of a certain year. Eventually what emerged was the Green Paper.  That is the only thing that I think even Senator Keating would regard as even remotely resembling, approaching or contiguous to a planning outline.  I do not think he would suggest that that was a satisfactory document or that it constituted an outline plan.  That is what happened or did not happen and it is in that context that we have to consider the comments which are now being made.</P>
      <P>Senator Robinson is in a different position because during this period she was not committed to supporting the Coalition Government who failed to plan.  She did, however, stand for election in the general election and sought support for that Government.  To that extent and to the extent that she is now a member of the Labour Party she has to accept responsibility for what the Coalition did or did not do in the context we are discussing here today. In that context it is suggested by Senator Robinson and by Senator Keating that they have fears in regard to what I am saying and to what is in or is not in the Bill.  They are entitled to express these fears but their expression of these fears and apprehensions will have to be assessed in the context of the performance of the Government which they asked the people to support in the last general election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as I am concerned there is apparently a misunderstanding on the part of Senator Keating as to how the whole planning process would operate in Government.  I say &ldquo;apparently&rdquo;.  I am never quite sure whether what he says fully represents his views.  I did note that he said that he was aware of or heard&mdash;I cannot quite remember which phrase he used&mdash;certain people <Col N="601" /> in the Department of Finance saying: &ldquo;If we cannot have the planning process well then let us make sure nobody has it.&rdquo;  Maybe he heard that but I would be very interested to know the source.  However, I have found no evidence of that approach.  I must repeat that this Bill represents the consensus of the whole Government but specifically of the Minister for Economic Planning and Development and myself.</P>
    <P>Senator Keating quoted the various verbs in the various paragraphs setting out the functions of the Department and said that putting them all together what it really meant was that the Department would not really do anything, that they would propose, would appraise, would recommend but would not do anything.  I want to suggest to Senator Keating that it would not be the function of this Department or any other Department to publish a national plan.  That is the function of the Government and nobody else.  No Department can be in a position where they can impose that kind of thing on other Departments or on the people.  The function of this Department is, as it is set out clearly&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be the Department of Finance who would draw up the plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If words mean anything section 2 gives that function to the new Department.  What is involved is&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Why can the Department not publish it then?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that when the Department have done this, when they have drawn together the various pieces of information from different Departments and have drawn up a proposal for a plan, they would then have to bring it to the Government where it would be discussed.  It could be accepted fully.  It could be rejected fully or more than likely it would be amended and modified in certain ways. It would then be accepted by the Government. It would be the responsibility of the Government, not of any Department or any Minister.  Such a plan if it were to be published, strictly speaking, would be published by the Government, <Col N="602" /> not just by this Department. Because by that time it would represent a Government document, a Government decision.  However, I mention this because it seemed to me from some of the comments made that some Senators did not understand the process that is involved in this.  More particularly I want to make it clear that I still think that to impose on this Department what is suggested in amendment No. 4, far from being a help to the Department, would be a hindrance.  It would be a straitjacket. While I do not agree with the views expressed by my predecessor which I quoted earlier in regard to the possibility of publishing a meaningful programme&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>We have established that much.  It is some gain I suppose that Senator Keating at one time one year was not in favour of a plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will read the record and will be ashamed of these tricks of debate because he is not trying to debate the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Talking about tricks of debate, I do not think there is anybody who can equal Senator Keating <Col N="603" /> in that regard.  He now tells us that he agreed at that time in 1974 that it was not possible to publish a plan.  That time he agreed but did he agree in 1975, 1976 and 1977?  One can draw one's own conclusions about this.  Unlike Senator Keating I do not agree with the view that was expressed in that context or otherwise but I accept that the methods of planning required will vary from time to time to meet a particular situation.  Of course, what happened to the world economy affects, and would affect if it were to happen at any other time, planning and methods of planning.  I have never disputed that but Senator Keating was unduly defensive and assumed that I was contesting that.  The only point I was trying to make is that it is quite conceivable that at certain times due to certain circumstances it would be necessary to change plans and the methods of planning.  That being so it should be clear that at certain times a four-year perspective would not be appropriate.  It could be too long.  It is conceivable also that in some circumstances a four-year perspective would be too short.  Therefore, it would be extremely foolish to impose a mandatory statutory requirement of this kind on this Department.  Far from helping it, it would hinder it and hinder the whole planning process.</P>
      <P>If Senator Keating wants to interpret that as meaning that I, as Minister for Finance, am trying to ensure that the new Department will not work, I cannot help the fact that he draws that implication from it.  All I can say is that he is wrong and that time will show he is wrong.  I hope, since he referred to the record of this debate, that when that time comes he will refer to the record and see just how wrong he was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not ask Senator Robinson to accept my assurance, because it was an assurance being given by me, that I favoured or thought it necessary to have consultation with the social partners.  What I was trying to convey was that any Government in these circumstances if they want to succeed must have consultation with the social partners.  It is not a question of my <Col N="604" /> assurance.  If one considers the situation it will be self-evident that it would be necessary to have such consultations. Perhaps I did not make it quite clear to Senator Robinson what my objection was to this amendment.  The Senator seems to think that I was arguing that this would prevent consultation with parties other than those mentioned in the amendment.  I was not arguing that.  Let me give a concrete example.  One of the parties involved under this would be the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  If a number of the difficulties existing in the trade union movement today in regard to unions outside congress and so on, were to be overcome it is conceivable that the body which would emerge would not be called the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  I am just taking that as an example.  The same would be true of other bodies and there have been examples in the past of changes that have taken place.</P>
    <P>It is suggested that this Bill should contain a statutory requirement that consultations should take place with A, B, C, D, E and F and so on, including the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  We could easily end up with a situation where the statutory requirement was to consult various bodies and the bodies existing were not the bodies mentioned in this amendment.  That is the point I was making.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very interesting example.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Senator like me to take another one?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would like to elaborate on that one a little further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should have thought that at this stage all people of goodwill would be hoping that there would be such an improvement in the structure of our trade union movement that whatever difficulties we would be faced with we would not be faced with the problems of non-congress unions <i>versus</i> congress unions.  God knows, we are familiar with some of the difficulties which can arise from that problem.  I would have thought that people who <Col N="605" /> would be involved on both sides of that argument would hope that a solution would be found to it.  If a solution were found it could well involve a change in the name and possibly the structure of the organisation known as the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. Senator Robinson is young but she may remember reading of a change which resulted in the establishment of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. That was not all that long ago.  It had a predecessor.</P>
      <P>Similarly on the employer side there have been changes.  There was an abortive proposal some years ago for an amalgamation of a number of what might be called &ldquo;employers' groups&rdquo;. Although it was abortive, there were changes on that side.  There are other groups in which changes have taken place and it is inconceivable for anybody to say that changes will never occur in the future.  While I agree with the idea of consultation and while I say that consultation must take place whatever Government are in power, this particular amendment specifying particular bodies as they exist at the passing of the Act is unreal and unworkable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to delay the House unnecessarily in relation to this amendment but I would like to comment on one or two remarks of the Minister when he intervened again.  He seemed to take some time to erect a sort of camouflage of words rather than answering the specific points I had put to him about why, if the amendments were acceptable in principle, it was not appropriate in some years to publish an outline plan, to lay an outline plan before both Houses of the Oireachtas in the context in which I have explained&mdash;that it would be an up-dating of the overall plan which had been published and which would be for a period of not less than four years.  Again he seemed to miss the point that we are talking about less than four years and it could be for longer.  I do not know why he raised that objection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>But not for shorter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="606" />
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of not having it shorter, and this would be a generally agreed idea, is that if it is an outline plan of the nature we are talking about it is the sort of outline plan and programme which must be for a period of not less than four years. Otherwise it is not possible to have a very meaningful plan and it is particularly relevant that it would be updated annually.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That gets back to Senator Keating's point about the difficulties of 1974 and what would be appropriate in those circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I was interested that the Minister seemed to have to go back and fight old battles about the Coalition.  It is clear from the fact that the Labour Senators are tabling this amendment that we are very strongly in favour of an outline plan over a period of not less than four years in which there is the maximum participation both by representatives of both Houses and by the social partners in discussing and coming to some consensus on the plan.  This is in the context of a country faced with immense social and economic problems.  We have certain advantages but we have real problems, a very real demographic challenge in the structure of our population and in the need to create jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The dimension of the problem requires that we approach our planning in a way that neither the Coalition Government nor previous Fianna Fáil administrations had approached it.  We must approach it by requiring the Government, and I accept that it would be the Government through this particular Department, to publish an outline plan over a period of four years. If the Minister would be happier, we could amend amendment No. 4 to make sure that it was understood that it was to publish annually an outline Government plan for economic and social development for a period.  It is clear that this is what would be intended and that it would be related to the other functions of the Department as set out in the Bill where it would form, if you like, the central function of those various functions set out.  The <Col N="607" /> approach is an approach in principle, the idea that the Government must publish a four-year plan or a plan for not less than four years, must cost that plan, must have the economic instruments to make the necessary adaptations and variations and would come annually before both Houses to debate the outline plan as up-dated annually.</P>
    <P>It is in that context that it would be more possible for us to cope with an unprecedented crisis like the oil crisis, because it would be possible in the annual submission of the outline plan to both Houses to make clear what the extraordinary circumstances and difficulties were.  The reception in both Houses would be sympathetic for that reason.  The difference between the proposers of this amendment, as I see it, and the Minister in his reply, is a very fundamental one.  It is a fundamental difference in principle in the approach to planning.  Planning should be carried out with the maximum participation and consultation and that can only be done if there is a published framework for a sufficient period where Departments have committed themselves to particular costs, to particular estimates of expenditure for that period and where there is then a very open process of consultation and where, therefore, it would be expected that the plan would change.  The degree to which it would change would depend on the particular circumstances but it would be a commitment and it would set out the priorities.  It would outline how we would, for example, achieve the objective of trying to provide for full employment, of trying to provide proper services for the people.</P>
    <P>I find the Minister's acceptance and repeated acceptance in principle of what is behind the amendments and then the very narrow reasons for refusing to accept them&mdash;the fact that amendment No. 4 does not make it clear if it were a Government plan&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I made that point in another context but that was not the major argument I made against the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>The major argument the Minister appears to make <Col N="608" /> against the amendment is that it would be mandatory and therefore binding on the Department and it would require the Department to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>To do it that way and no other way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>That way is a very flexible way.  It only requires publication and a process of consultation.  It is not a straitjacket in the sense of binding, in a blueprint way, to every clause and comma in the outline plan. It is an approach in principle and if accepted in principle I fail to see why the Minister is not prepared to accept the amendment and to commit the Government and the new Department to publishing the outline plan in this way and to a statutory requirement of consultation with the social partners and to a statutory requirement to lay an annual up-dated outline plan before both Houses for debate.</P>
      <P>The basic principle behind the amendments is that we in the Labour Party feel that there is a vital necessity for this type of open consultation and that the planning process cannot be an internal governmental one if we are to achieve a sufficient consensus in the community for the types of decision that will be required.  Time will tell which approach would be better but I sense in some parts of the Minister's reply an unwillingness to be tied down, an unwillingness for the Government to be specific about the publication of their plans and specific consultations with the social partners and a sufficient role for the representatives of the people in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I do not wish to delay the House unnecessarily on this amendment but I am not reassured by the Minister's comments on the amendments.</P>
      <P>Amendment put and declared lost.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 5 and 6 not moved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 2, subsection (2), between lines 39 and 40, to insert the following new paragraph:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(i)  to publish annually a comprehensive series of economic and <Col N="609" /> social indicators relevant to economic and social planning.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment would be more significant if it had been possible to persuade the Minister to accept the three amendments which have just been discussed. It would require the new Minister to publish annually a comprehensive series of economic and social indicators relevant to economic and social planning.  The amendment has relevance even without the previous amendments in that it is vital that there be available the type of information which will enable the social partners, enable the political parties, enable interest groups in the country, to have sufficient information on which to comment and on which to try to influence Government planning.</P>
    <P>One of the real defects even in our participation in the European Community is to see again and again in tables and printed statistical material where one is talking about social statistics, social indicators that very often for Ireland from 1974 onwards, and sometimes from 1975 onwards, there is a blank because the figures are not available, because the social indicators are not sufficiently known.  Therefore, since we are creating a new Department, and thereby establishing a new Minister for Economic Planning and Development, it seems that logically there should be a specific statutory responsibility on that Minister to provide and to ensure the provision of adequate materials by publishing annually a comprehensive series of economic and social indicators.</P>
    <P>This is perhaps more necessary in Ireland than in other member states of the European Communities because we have changed so rapidly and so radically in most of the economic and social indicators.  We are not the country we were even ten years ago.  We are still changing very rapidly, changing in our demographic structure, in our patterns of behaviour, in the priorities of our citizens, in the movements of our citizens and we very badly need much more information.  Once again I think it is not sufficient to say that yes, an attempt will be made to make this sort of material available.  If there is a <Col N="610" /> statutory requirement, there are various ways in which the pressure can be put on the Minister and his Department to furnish the particular material.  We have a bad record in this country when it comes to publishing statistical material.  The Minister will probably say that the Coalition had a bad record on it.  I would only have to reply that we have had a bad record down the years.  It is not a party political point.  It would be appropriate to have a statutory requirement for the publication of this material and that it be done by the Minister who has charge of this function and responsibility and that it be done annually so that this material would be available not only for our own internal use but also for comparative purposes in a European Community context.</P>

      <P>The development of economic and social statistics indicators will be promoted by the new Department as part of their general function to promote and co-ordinate economic and social planning for the economy.  As Senator Robinson indicated, we have a different situation here in regard, on one hand, to economic statistics and indicators and, on the other hand, to social indicators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the economic side the Department of Finance and the Central Statistics Office mainly already compile what was described by the National Economic and Social Council as a &ldquo;reasonably comprehensive set of economic indicators widely accepted as reliable&rdquo;.  When we come to the social indicators side the position, unfortunately, is quite different and much less satisfactory.  We have far fewer statistics on the social side.  The NESC have done some valuable work in this area, like forwarding the work of preparing social indicators, but they point out that obtaining actual social statistics is one thing but the measurement of social change over a period of time is relatively less easy than collecting the statistics and, certainly, presents much greater difficulties than on the economic side.  Indeed, in some areas one comes to quite difficult intellectual problems in deciding how the statistics should be interpreted to register <Col N="611" /> change over a period of time. Whatever the intellectual or other difficulties involved, the fact is that it would not be possible for the new Department, or any Department, at this time or within a reasonably short time, to produce annually a comprehensive series of social indicators, as is required in this amendment.  It just would not be possible.</P>
    <P>There is a further difficulty in that a number of the statistics required, both on the economic and the social side, come from different sources as I have mentioned, the Department of Finance and the CSO.  The social Departments, as such, produce a number of the statistics which would be used as the basis for the social indicators so that I would not wish to interfere with the operation of these various bodies in producing their statistics.  I would, however, visualise a role for the new Department as encouraging the improvement of those statistics and arranging for the collection of statistics required where they are not being collected at the moment.  In the main I would see this new Department as being the one concerned with the kind of difficult operation to which I have referred, the measuring of social change over a period.  I would see that as the role of this Department.</P>
    <P>However, the amendment is something quite different; it requires the Department to publish annually a comprehensive series of economic and social indicators relevant to economic and social planning.  It would not be physically possible for the Department to comply with that.  In the first place, they would not be comprehensive, and, secondly, the role of this Department with regard to these statistics must be much more one of co-ordination than the actual production of such statistics. But the primary difficulty is that it would not be physically possible for any Department, or indeed for all Departments together, to comply with what is required in this amendment and it will not be possible for them to do so for some years.  I would not like to estimate how long it will be; it depends on what progress we can make under the guidance and stimulus of <Col N="612" /> the new Minister and the new Department in this area.  It is clear that it will not be possible for some years anyway to produce what is sought in this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann, in accordance with established precedents since the entry of Ireland into the European Communities, approves the nominations of five members of the party or parties comprising the Government and five members of the party or parties comprising the opposition, to be the delegates to the Assembly of the European Communities, pending the holding of direct elections to that body.</P>
      <P>To some extent the motion in the names of Senator Harte and myself is a formality.  In fact, we know the names and the party affiliations of the people chosen who are enumerated in No. 4 on the Order Paper.  I will be brief.  There are a small number of points that are worth making again and indeed are worth making very widely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When you have ten places, which is what is currently within the keeping, within the nomination, within the <Col N="613" /> powers to nominate of the Oireachtas, every 10 per cent of the vote ought to correspond to one seat in a proportional representation situation which we pretend we admire and wish to operate.  Those things do not work neatly in practice because you cannot have slices of persons, you have a whole person.  Therefore, you have to make adjustments because the vote does not ever break down into units of 10 per cent, it breaks down into much more ragged fractions than that. Of course a little violence has to be due to be able to choose whole individuals and not portions of them, and to give some sort of reflection of the breakdown of votes within a country. The fact that we cannot get an exact match between votes on the one hand and persons chosen on the other hand need surprise nobody.</P>
    <P>Another point worth making is that people being chosen are delegates to the Assembly of the European Community. Since 1st January, 1973&mdash;I recall this because I was among the first delegation sent from Ireland to that Assembly after we joined the Community on 1st January, 1973&mdash;we have had a representation and we have had experience of the working of the Irish representation in that Assembly. We know that it is an Assembly with power to debate but with very little power beyond that.  If we pay lip service to democracy we believe that the various plans and attitudes in our nation ought to be reflected in that Assembly and ought to be reflected roughly <i>pro rata</i> with the breakdown of opinion within the country.</P>
    <P>We know furthermore in equity and in decency, that since you cannot have an exact match between the percentage of votes and the people because people, as I say, come in whole numbers and not in fractions, that it is normal, decent, non-shabby practice at the lower end to average up and at the upper end to average down.  What is so sad and tawdry about this is that a party with very little more than half the votes should find themselves using mechanisms of power to defeat equity and fair play and to award themselves 60 per cent, six out of ten, when any normal basis of equity and generosity <Col N="614" /> would suggest that they should have five out of ten.  Getting from 50.5 per cent to 60 per cent, which is the trick that has been turned, of course involves two steps; first, the number of Deputies in the Dáil is not linear with the vote of the Fianna Fáil Party, it is more <i>pro rata.</i>  That increase is given a further stepwise increase from the middle 50s of percentage of Dáil seats up to 60 per cent in the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>The Community is extremely important for all our futures.  No one would disagree about that.  It is important that the different strands of Irish political opinion be fairly represented in the Community.  The position of the Labour Party on this is worth recalling because we opposed full membership. The people expressed their will in a referendum and voted overwhelmingly for full membership.  As democrats we accepted that decision and we have been&mdash;both as members of the European Parliament of which I had the honour to be in the first delegation and indeed in my own case as a member of the Council of Ministers the first Irishman to chair the Council of Ministers of the European Community which, by accident, I was, and in various other roles in the Community&mdash; striving loyally to minimise the dangers that we forecast and to maximise the benefits which we recognised to exist in the Community.</P>
    <P>We accept the democratic decision of the people of May, 1972, but we represent a valid strand in public opinion which is now larger, if heads were to be counted, than it was at the time of the 1972 referendum.  At that time just over 17 per cent of the people voted for our position.  The experience of the passing years has shown that many of the predictions that we made have been validated and the poohpoohing of difficulties that was such a conspicuous feature of that campaign has been invalidated.</P>
    <P>This is the use of a statistical trick to see that there is only a 10 per cent, a one-tenth, representation for that point of view which is a valid strand of Irish political life.  That seems to me shabby and it seems to me sad and it seems to me also in terms&mdash;and I <Col N="615" /> am looking now at the terms of the amendment&mdash;to be innumerate rather than illiterate because the terms of the amendment says &ldquo;in proportion to the relevant representation in the Oireachtas&rdquo;. Six out of ten, of course, is not in proportion to the relevant representation in the Oireachtas.  You have to go up from an already majority representation to 60 per cent or you have to go down to 50 per cent because you cannot send half a person.  Equity and generosity would suggest that Fianna Fáil ought to go down to half.  They know that there is no danger of their embarrassment as a Government in the European Parliament.  They know that Irish Deputies and Senators going to the Assembly, in the almost five years since that started, have in general behaved in a way that waged the issues at a high level&mdash;this applies just as much when the Opposition were in power as when Fianna Fáil were in power&mdash;not playing domestic politics on the European scene, not embarrassing each other at home and generally participating usefully and trying to raise the level of debate, trying to raise the level of understanding.</P>
    <P>This seems to me a pity, it seems to me shabby, it seems to be tawdry, it seems to me hostile to the idea of proportional representation and it seems to me&mdash;I was going to say unworthy but I will not&mdash;simply a pity and tawdry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support this motion.  I should like to do so by examining the particular nature of the European Parliament and the particular nature of Irish representation in the European Parliament.  As Senator Keating said, we are not talking here in a narrow sense about the representation of the Labour Party in the European Parliament, we are talking about the composition of the Irish delegation to a very different sort of parliament from our parliament. This really is the essence of not only the unfairness in the sense in which Senator Keating was putting it forward but the stupidity of the decision that was taken to grab an extra seat for the Fianna Fáil component of the national delegation to the European Parliament. <Col N="616" /> It was stupid and it was not in the best interests of this country if one examines the type of parliament that the European Parliament is, the type of structure is has and the importance for the interests of this country in the eight months, or whatever it will be before direct elections, that we maximise the possibilities of that representation. We are talking about the national representation which will be composed of ten members from either the Dáil or the Seanad who will have the task of representing Irish interests in the European Parliament.</P>
      <P>It has been a feature of Irish representation which has been commented upon by Members of the European Parliament on all sides that very often they are representing Irish interests in the broader sense against the possibility of either a particular proposal being viewed and passed to the European level which does not take into account the particular difficulties and needs of Ireland and that party politics are forgotten in that context in many instances.  There is an agreement by the Irish representatives there, whatever their political affiliation, that the measure must be opposed or amendments must be put in because it would cause particular difficulties or hardship when translated into the Irish context.  I know from meetings of the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities that delegates to the European Parliament who participated in sessions of the joint committee made the point over and over again that the first priority is to represent Irish interests in this much larger European grouping called the European Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How do we have our interests represented at the European Parliament? We have them represented in a way which is very different from the structure and type of debate which takes place in either House of the Oireachtas. The European Parliament works very much through a system of committees. There are 12 specialised committees of the European Parliament. I will set them out giving the number of members.  The 12 committees are: the Political Affairs Committee <Col N="617" /> which has 35 members: the Legal Affairs Committee has 35 members; the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee has 35 members; the Budget Committee has 35 members; the Social Affairs Employment and Education Committee has 35 members; the Agricultural Committee has 35 members; the Regional Policy, Regional Planning and Transport Committee has 35 members; the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection Committee has 35 members; the Energy and Research Committee has 35 members; the External Economic Relations Committee has 35 members; the Development Co-operation Committee has 35 members and the Rules of Procedure and Petitions Committee has 18 members. All but one have 35 members.</P>
    <P>The membership of these committees retains a very delicate balance between the political groupings in the European Parliament.  At present there are various political groups of which the Socialist group are the largest.  There is the Socialist group, the Christian Democrat group, who are the next largest, the Liberal and Democratic group, the European Conservatives, European Progressive Democrats, who each have 17 members and the Communist and Allies.  Apart from that, there are a small number of independent members of the European Parliament. The balance which is retained in the specialised committees means that the Socialist group have the largest number averaging about nine or ten members of the specialised committees. That is of very real significance for Ireland because it is very important for us as a country that we have adequate representation in these specialised committees when they are discussing draft regulations and draft directives which affect us.</P>
    <P>When we send ten delegates from Ireland to the European Parliament, the members of the European Parliament have to make a decision about which committees they want to serve on and they also have to lobby and work fairly hard to try to get on to those committees.  Understandably, they have to concentrate on the committees which will have most significance for <Col N="618" /> this country&mdash;agriculture and regional policy, that type of committee work. At the same time it is possible that an important matter might come up for discussion in one of the other committees where there was no Irish representative of any of the political groupings, or where there was possibly one other Irish representative who would be a member of this committee of 35 but because the Socialist group have a membership of about nine or ten on these various committees there may very well be a vacancy for another member of the Socialist group to attend that particular committee.  This has happened a number of times in areas where there was a matter of great sensitivity to Ireland being discussed and where it was possible for one or two members of the Labour Party who are members of the Socialist group to be present and to represent interests in that committee.</P>
    <P>The European Progressive Democrats group which Fianna Fáil belong to is the fifth largest group in the European Parliament.  It would have much less representation, and would share that representation with the French representatives of the Gaullist Party and also with the Danish representatives. The likelihood of there being a vacancy in the European Progressive Democrat component of the specialised committee is much less. That is one specific reason why it is very important when we are considering the Irish representation to the European Parliament that we think of it in terms of the structure of the European Parliament, of trying to maximise the possibility of Irish representation on the various committees, the need to have participation by delegates from this Parliament when a draft regulation or draft directive is being discussed and is going to be reported on to the plenary session.  It is the largest group which will contribute first to the plenary session and then the other groups in accordance with their weight and number.</P>
    <P>The Socialist group are a most significant group in the European Parliament. They have the largest membership on the committees and they have a very significant role to play also in <Col N="619" /> the plenary sessions.  If we confine the Irish representation on the Socialist group to one person we put an enormous burden on that one delegate who participates in that group.  We put the burden on one person of trying to make an impact on the largest political grouping in the European Parliament. That itself is a matter of very real Irish interest because the Socialist group are represented in the Governments of six of the member states of the European Community.  They have at least three Prime Ministers and they have an immense weight as a grouping.  The political groups meet in between sessions of the European Parliament or committee sessions in Brussels in order to decide on the policy of the group.  This group is the largest and most significant group in the European Parliament, meeting before a committee session or a plenary session of the Parliament to decide on the policy of that group and we are going to have one representative in a total of 65 members if that one representative is not ill or otherwise unable to be present.  We are effectively taking a decision to cut by 50 per cent the representation which Ireland would have in this very significant political grouping.</P>
    <P>I think there are two possible approaches to the consideration of the representation.  The first is the approach which was argued by Senator Keating that Fianna Fáil are grabbing 60 per cent of the representation in the European Parliament without having that percentage of the endorsement by the electorate.  That is the kind of numbers' game one can argue round and round in a rather sterile way.  If you take that argument in the context of a national delegation representing Irish interests in a much larger European grouping of a particular kind, there are Irish disadvantages in structuring it as we appear to be about to do, unless this motion is carried.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil group of components of the national delegation to the European Parliament are members of the European Progressive Democrat group.  That is a rather narrow group <Col N="620" /> because it really only involves two countries, France and Ireland, with one Danish member.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>Two Danish members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Sorry, two Danish members.  I accept the correction of one of the members of the European Parliament, Senator Yeats.  Nevertheless, it is largely a Franco-Irish grouping. The socialist group on the other hand have strong political links with each of the member states and have a very substantial impact both as a political group in the specialised committees and on the floor of the House.</P>
      <P>For that combination of reasons, both internal Irish political reasons and equally the impact of our delegation on the European Parliament, we would urge Members of this House to accept the motion and to understand that we are talking about the composition of a national delegation to a body where we are actually minimising the possibility of real use of the structure, the committee system in the Parliament to the best interests of this country.  If we are sending a national delegation surely the primary consideration should be how do we best represent our interests?  The situation will change very substantially when we move to direct elections, whether that be in next May or June, as is hoped, in the autumn, or even May or June of the following year.  Whenever the date may be, at that stage there is a completely different situation because one is talking about direct representation. The election will be on the basis of regional constituencies and the people will have a direct opportunity of deciding who they want to represent them.  Very different criteria will apply at that stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You have a constituency, you have people standing on the basis of a programme of policies at the European level, and people are elected on that basis.  If at that stage, 14 of the 15 people elected happen to be from one political party, I do not think there could be any complaint.  It would illustrate that the people wanted to be represented in the European Parliament <Col N="621" /> by that number of members of that political party.  At that stage, the result of having direct elections will mean that there will be a debate on the issues at European level and that there will be a much greater comprehension than there is at the moment about the structure of the European Parliament, of the political groupings in the Parliament and of the way in which the specialised committees work.</P>
    <P>It could not possibly be argued in a realistic way that a decision was taken by the people in the general election that they somehow wanted to cut by 50 per cent the representation in the largest political grouping in the European Parliament and that they wanted to add to the representation in the European Progressive Democrats group.  It is shortsighted and not in the best interest of the country and it is very much dictated by short-term party political advantage if Fianna Fáil persist in an attempt to change the composition of the Irish delegation to the European Parliament. Therefore, I support this motion and hope it will be accepted by the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>Much of what has been said by Senator Keating and Senator Robinson is misconceived.  They do not appear to appreciate what is involved in the selection of the delegation to the European Parliament.  All of us agree on one thing.  If one takes the statistical position of the members of parties in both Houses, Fianna Fáil are entitled to six seats and the rest have four.  This applies to all the nine countries when they are selecting their <Col N="622" /> delegations.  As Senator Keating said, you cannot split people.  What they all have to do, and what we have to do, is to try to work it out to the nearest human, allowing for the way party figures are worked out.  Immediately after our general election it was assumed at the European Parliament that this would involve an extra seat for Fianna Fáil and one of the other parties.  This is the way things are done in all nine countries as a matter of course.</P>
      <P>We can accept that statistically speaking the upshot of the election must be that Fianna Fáil would take six seats.  One can take that the line which essentially is the line taken by Senator Robinson and Senator Keating, that is, it does not really matter whether we send Fianna Fáil people, Labour people or Fine Gael people to the Parliament, let us all, therefore, row in together and agree to carry on as before without any change because it makes no difference.  One must make the point that it does make a difference. In Fianna Fáil's view, it is in the national interest that there should be more Fianna Fáil people at the Parliament and it is not in the national interest that there should be more Labour people there.  We are entitled to press that view.  We have certain policies to carry out.  They have certain policies that they have endeavoured to carry out.  I do not believe that the line taken on a number of occasions by the Labour members in the European Parliament has been in the national interest.  Senator Keating said&mdash;and I think it is pretty near an exact quotation&mdash;&ldquo;beyond debating in Parliament there is very little power beyond that&rdquo;, the implication being that it does not really matter who goes because it is really only a matter of talking.  There he is wrong.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is not the implication, I am not sure what it is.  Even with regard to the quotation.  I do not accept that.  After a considerable number of years in Seanad Éireann&mdash;about 19&mdash;and five years in the European Parliament, I am absolutely satisfied <Col N="623" /> that the ordinary member of the European Parliament has a far better chance of getting through substantial amendments to legislation than he would either in this House or in Dáil Éireann.</P>
      <P>It is also a fact, as a plain constitutional statement of the position, that on budgetary matters, for example, the European Parliament have considerably more power than either House of the Oireachtas.  They have the power which neither Dáil Éireann nor any other national parliament in the EEC has of adding to budget expenditure. They can reject the entire budget and in many respects they have very considerable budgetary powers.  Therefore it is important whom we send.  It has been made clear by Senator Keating and Senator Robinson that what to them is important is the concept of sending two members to the Socialist group rather than one.  The problem with that is that the policies, the traditions, the aims of the Socialist group as represented in the European Parliament are not necessarily those which we would wish them to carry out from an Irish point of view.  The Socialist group, for example, traditionally are essentially a consumers' party rather than a farmers' party.  They are very much opposed to the CAP.  They have policies in many fields which are not in our best interests.  The Irish members&mdash;that is the Labour Party members&mdash;of the Socialist group have inevitably, I am not blaming them, it is not their fault, been curbed on many occasions in their activities and in their votes in the European Parliament because of their membership of a group who hold certain views which are not often in accordance with Irish interests.</P>

      <P>With regard to that, I can make an interesting point.  The Socialist group are a large group, as we have been told.  Even when there were two Irish Labour members they <Col N="624" /> were only a very small part of a very large group.  Where the group differed from them on one or two occasions they decided to go their own way.  On many other occasions they decided they had to go along with what the group said.  With regard to the European Progressive Democrat group, to which Fianna Fáil belong in the majority of cases there has been complete agreement, particularly on agricultural matters.</P>

      <P>They have backed us completely on regional policy and matters of this kind.  Even on such matters as direct elections, or more recently on fishing, when we are unable to agree on a joint policy, I can say categorically after four and a half years' experience with that group, that there has never been one occasion when our freedom of action was hampered in any way.  We voted and spoke on many occasions in favour of direct elections.  On all matters of that kind we have been completely uninhibited. We have been allowed by the group, where there could not be complete agreement, to go our own way and to propound our own policies.  We have never had that type of problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is worthwhile saying something about a very recent day at the European Parliament when the voting took place at the end of October on various aspects of the annual EEC budget. This is a matter on which the European Parliament have considerable powers.  There were five particular votes in which there was not a united Irish delegation.  The first of these related to the matter of cross-Border co-operation.  It seemed to Fianna Fáil that, with conditions as they are at the moment in the North, cross-Border co-operation and studies of the type being carried out by the EEC on a minor scale so far, are exceedingly valuable.  Therefore, on behalf of my group, and with their full backing.  I moved, at the Budget Committee, an amendment to add considerably to the sum provided for this in the annual budget and persuaded that committee to accept it.  It came before the Parliament <Col N="625" /> and our group voted in favour of it.  Our only Labour member of the Socialist group present abstained.  I am not blaming him but I can see he had a problem in his group, but that is his affair.  Nonetheless, I would have thought that from the point of view of our national interests it would have been desirable that he would have supported it.</P>
    <P>I moved another amendment.  This arose out of a petition sent to the European Parliament a month or so ago by 26 mayors and chairmen of county councils throughout Northern Ireland.  Heaven knows there is very little that all parties are prepared to agree on in Northern Ireland today, but this was a matter on which all sides felt deeply.  They wanted to have an office of the European Economic Community in Belfast.  Again I moved an amendment on behalf of my group and got the Budget Committee to put a sum of money in the budget for the opening of a Commission office in Belfast.</P>
    <P>At the vote in plenary session we naturally voted in favour.  The Irish Labour member of the Socialist group with his group voted against.  Two minutes later with his group he voted in favour of Commission offices being opened this year in Madrid and Lisbon, but not in favour of Belfast.  It is a rather curious sense of Irish priorities.</P>
    <P>We also had an amendment down to the budget to eliminate the co-responsibility levy which has caused a great deal of ill-feeling among Irish farmers. Again, we voted in favour of our amendment.  Again the Irish Labour member of the Socialist group voted against the amendment in favour of a co-responsibility levy.  It is his affair how he manages inside his group.  He may have been personally in favour of it but nonetheless that was not in accordance with Irish interests.  We had another amendment on behalf of our group to increase considerably the sum to be put in the budget for the regional fund.  This is a matter of fundamental interest to us.  We voted in favour.  The Irish Labour member voted against.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="626" /> The last item on that day was an extremely dangerous amendment by Mr. Spinelli who was formerly a member of the European Commission.  He resigned to stand as a Communist candidate in the last Italian elections.  He was elected and is now a member of the European Parliament.  He put down an amendment to the budget to provide for a limit on the expenditure on FEOGA for the coming year.  It was done in a dangerous way because it sought, by a sidewind, to impose an authority on the European Parliament over the Council which in fact they do not possess.  It was an extremely dangerous amendment which has since been rejected by the Council.  Even though the Council rejected it, it was extremely dangerous that it should have been passed because it had the authority of the European Parliament behind it.</P>
    <P>This amendment which was totally opposed to everything we would wish to see happen in Ireland, was approved by 54 votes to 51.  We had three members present, because two of our members are now members of the Government and could not be there, and we voted against this amendment.  The Irish member of the Socialist group of the European Parliament voted in favour.  If we had had our five members, it would still have been passed by one vote.  If we had six, we could have blocked it.  The question of voting is not as inconsequential and unimportant as one might feel.</P>
    <P>It is not in order to blame anyone that I mention these matters because everyone has to exercise his own political judgment and make his way in his own political group.  My point is that we are essentially choosing a political delegation to carry out certain political policies, to take part in political groups at the European Parliament.  We, in Fianna Fáil, are entitled to say that in our view our policies, as exercised over the past five years, have been more beneficial, and will continue to be more beneficial to the Irish interests than the policies of those who form parts of large, amorphous, multinational groups whose policies are not necessarily similar to those we would wish to carry out.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="627" /> I am supporting the concept of taking six members of this delegation because in the European Progressive Democrats group we will be able to do more for Ireland with greater freedom than would an extra Labour member of the Socialist group.  In other words, this is not just a talking shop we are sending people to, to be happy brothers abroad.  We are sending politicians to do a political job.  I am certain, from my experience in the European Parliament, that we in our group are in a position to do a better job for Ireland than the others.</P>

      <P>If the National Coalition Government had 84 Deputies elected last June, would they have given Fianna Fáil five seats in the European Parliament?  Would they have given Fianna Fáil even four seats in the European Parliament?  I very much doubt it.  I could visualise the passionate speeches of members of the Labour Party pointing out that the people had given them a mandate to take a representation of seven seats in Europe.  One might say there is no precedent and we do not know what would happen&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardMcGlinchey" hpid="Mr. McGlinchey Mr. McGlinchey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGlinchey</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but I believe there is a type of precedent.  I was <Col N="628" /> elected to this House in 1961 and Fianna Fáil had an overall majority. The Cathaoirleach elected was from Fianna Fáil, but the filling of the Leas-Chathaoirleach's position was left to the Opposition, as it was right down to 1973 and as it was only a few weeks ago.  In 1973 that precedent was changed.  When the National Coalition Government were elected they came into this House and we agreed to the election of Cathaoirleach and they grabbed the position of Leas-Chathaoirleach as well.  Perhaps we could describe their action then as Senator Keating has just described ours.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party grabbed that position and even Senator Robinson, who was then an Independent Member of this House, protested very strongly.  She considered it unfair.  She forecast that in future elections Fianna Fáil would have a monopoly of both positions.  Having witnessed that situation in 1973 I feel that if the National Coalition Government had received the same mandate from the people last June as Fianna Fáil did not alone would they seek six seats in the European Parliament but they would seek seven and would apologise to nobody. This Government are being more than generous in leaving four seats to the Opposition, considering the huge mandate that we received from the people only a few short months ago.</P>

      <P>I would like to join in condemning this motion.  It is high time we placed greater emphasis on Europe and on the European Parliament. It is in no sense any longer a debating society but an area where crucial decisions and crucial influences can be brought to play.  It is high time we took full cognisance of this and reflected in our representation in Europe the true representation of our parties in this Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it is any of our business to increase, as Senator Robinson would seem to wish us to do, Socialist representation in Europe.  We have to have the people there who represent the people elected to this Parliament. Many key issues will be coming up even in the immediate future, on agricultural structures policy, and on regional <Col N="629" /> policy and many of these very important policies will influence our lives economically, sociallly and culturally. It is absolutely essential that we be fully politically represented in Europe and that we stop this notion that it is some form of debating society.  It is a very serious businesss.  We no longer can afford to do other than take it seriously.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. O'Kennedy) Michael O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, it is important to indicate what representation in the European Parliament is not about.  It is not about ensuring that we have a presence in the groupings or in the maximum number of groupings in the European Parliament.  It is not about ensuring that our view would be expressed in these groupings.  It is fairly evident that there are some major groupings in which Ireland does not have any representation&mdash;the Liberal, Conservative and Communist groupings. According to the Labour motion, if we are to maximise our effective strength in the European Parliament, we should seek to find representations, if possible, in the various groupings.</P>
      <P>Secondly, another point needs to be stressed.  Obviously this is a matter for each national parliament.  It is not covered in the Treaty and the nomination of members, pending direct elections to the European Parliament, is a matter for each national parliament. To that extent, Senator E. Ryan's amendment, which represents the Government's position, is entirely consistent with what has been done and with what is now being done in every other country.  We are not setting ourselves up in judgment of what is or is not a valid strand of Irish political viewpoint, as Senator Keating put it. That is not part of our function and that is not what is involved in this issue.  We are being consistent with what is being done in every other country.  The understanding in representation to the European Parliament is, that the members who will represent our Parliament in that Assembly will be as far as possible in proportion to the strength of the parties in both the Dáil and Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="630" /> This representation means in some countries, in Denmark for instance, that parties such as the Radicals who have six seats, the Communists who have seven, the Left Socialists who have five and the Single Tax Party who have six, have no representation in the European Assembly.  In some instances, such as in the case of France, there seems to be all-party agreement that the Communists would not be represented in the European Parliament.  Subject to the qualification about France, generally and con-consistently, the representation in the European Assembly is as far as possible in line with the representation of the parties in their national parliaments.</P>
    <P>That seems to be a very reasonable and proper proposition, particularly at a time when we are coming to direct elections to the European Parliament, when we will want to give effective expression to the will of the Irish people, as Senator Robinson indicated, as to what type of representation they want in the European Parliament.  The target date is still May-June, 1978.  To ignore the very definite opinion of the people as expressed in the recent general election, within one year of that target date, would be to move away from democratic representation in the Parliament and to reject it.  The people have given a clear indication of what they want in relation to the national parliament, but representation to the European Parliament was not an issue one way or the other nor was whether the Labour Party should have one or two seats at issue.  The people spoke only in relation to the composition of the national parliament and the formation of Government arising from that.  To the extent that the other follows immediately from it, that they indirectly convey their views, then in all matters of natural interest the Government have an obligation to take account of that mandate particularly coming into the period of direct elections. In so far as we are doing so&mdash; I would like to stress this&mdash;not only do we not presume to make statements on bodies who have not a valid strand of Irish political thinking&mdash;Senator Keating presumes we seem to be doing this&mdash;but there are other valid strands <Col N="631" /> which we might not find particularly attractive such as Deputy Noel Browne's party and some others such as the Irish Communist Party.  It is not for us to comment as to whether or not they are valid strands and we are not doing that.  They are not represented in the European Parliament. Neither do we speak about whether or not the university Senators or other Independents in this House are valid strands of Irish political opinion.  We are simply responding, as in every other country, to the reality of political representation.  That reality is that most of the Opposition parties represent about 40 per cent of the share of the seats in both Houses.  I cannot see, on that basis, how if they represent about 40 per cent of the share of seats they can object to getting exactly that representation in the European Parliament or do they claim that they embrace the interests of, for example, Deputy Blaney, Deputy Browne or the university Senators here?</P>

      <P>The Fianna Fáil Party happen to have, in relation to the proportionate strength in both Houses, over 55 per cent, not taking account of the Independents either here or in the Dáil.  On the precedents already adopted in this country, on the precedents and principles employed in every other country, with the exception of the Communists in France, at least with over 55 per cent it seems reasonable that we can justifiably claim a 60 per cent representation as against 50 per cent which the Opposition are claiming for a 40 per cent representation in both Houses.  That does not <Col N="632" /> seem to make sense and if it did it would be acting in a manner entirely inconsistent with what is being done in any other parliament in Europe.  If somebody can indicate to me positions being taken up, apart from the exclusion of the communists in France, then the matter can be reconsidered.</P>
      <P>I can understand that inevitably practical problems can be posed for a particular party or parties who had five and who now, as a result of the election, it is proposed should have four. I can understand that one or other of these parties might feel less than enthusiastic about the outcome in so far as it would mean a cutback in their representation.  It is not the Fianna Fáil Party here or in the Dáil who have decided that, it is the Irish people. To the extent that we are moving towards the day, I hope fairly quickly, when we will have direct representation with the mandate of the Irish people in the European Parliament, it behoves us to take account of this, the latest expression of the Irish people in advance of the European elections.</P>

      <P>Some of the Members have a continuing mandate as a result of their re-election.  It is a matter <Col N="633" /> of Fine Gael replacement.  It is a different matter and we can discuss that when that motion comes up for discussion.  We had some discussions on this in the other House as well. I do not accept the implication that any fault in this lies on the Government of the day because when it comes to discussing that I can quite clearly indicate the reasons for some of this delay.  It does not by any means lie with the Government of the moment. That is obviously not related to the point I am making or to any point which has been made already.</P>
      <P>In the Dáil the Labour Party presented their case in accordance with precedent.  We dealt with that case on the basis of precedent.  The Labour Party acknowledged in the Dáil that either on the basis of precedent here or elsewhere what is now being proposed is entirely in accordance with that precedent and what they were proposing, on the other hand, was quite clearly opposed to the precedents established.  I have not heard precedents being quoted here.  Perhaps it may be for that reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make it quite clear that this is not a judgment on the performance of anybody, although what Senator Yeats said was rather enlightening. I have referred in passing to this in the Dáil and one of the Labour Party Deputies seemed to take issue with it.  Nonetheless the record is very clear and one that gives some concern as to the lack of effective voice which perhaps some of our parties may have in some of the major groups in the European Parliament. Senator Yeats spoke about being unable to influence these grouping to supporting positions which I would have thought would be consistent with Irish interests, in so far as we are talking about cross-Border projects, representatives of the Community in a Belfast office, but consistent with the Community interest and the Community stated aims, namely peace in Europe, elimination of regional imbalances and economic development in areas where there has not been development.  I would have thought that on any terms there could be only one response there <Col N="634" /> but apparently that was not the case. The precedents are all in favour of what the Government are doing by way of support and for that reason I hope the consequence of this debate here and in the Dáil will not be that there will be a division in the Irish representation in the European Parliament but that it can be seen simply to be a response to the latest expressed view of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>Finally, I do not wish to comment on Senator Keating's implications that this is sad or tawdry, or whatever word would seem to imply less than worthy motives to us, from a party that was always claiming all the worthy motives for themselves.  That is always a matter of political argument and I do not think we will make much ground on that.  I rely on the facts and the facts are all in our favour, obliging us to do what we have to do.</P>

      <P>It was a very interesting debate.  It was a numbers game that concentrated on one set of numbers but not on another set.  It seems to me to be inconsistent to say we are in favour of direct elections but then ignore the percentage of support as expressed in direct elections here and we use the parliamentary representation as the guideline and not the people's voice by percentage as the guideline.  Which way do you want it? Direct elections are the most valid. The fair proportional representation of the various opinions is the most valid. If you do that it comes out five and five.  You have to use the non-linear relationship between national votes and seats in the Oireachtas to get your 56 per cent to go on to add to that another 4 per cent to get the 60 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="635" /> The Minister is not mounting an argument on the Government side to favour direct elections.  He is mounting an argument in favour of non-linearity. He is mounting an argument in favour of skewing the figures by the uses in a proportional situation of a non-linear result in the Dáil election.</P>
    <P>When Senator Conroy was reflecting the true representations of our parties, he of all people is numerate enough to know that that is not a genuine argument but a trick argument.  If you want to know the proportional opinions of the Irish people you take the percentages of the huge sample who expressed their opinion in June.  You can take that percentage down as fine as you like and it is over a big enough sample to be valid, and you do not take the 148 because we know there was a non-linear thing built into that already.</P>
    <P>The Minister's side know that, the Fianna Fáil side, the Government side, know that as well as I do.  I am afraid I find a big element of hypocrisy in resting this on a statistical argument. When you look at the figures a statistical argument does not stand up. However, in fact, if they want to, a majority in any national Parliament can distort away from the different balance of opinion as expressed in national elections.  They can distort representations in the European Parliament coming from that national Parliament as much as they like.  The French, traditionally, have done it very widely.  We had a tradition of doing two equal halves.  There were two equal halves on the 1st January, 1973 when we went in.  But when the Coalition won an election in 1973 we actually had the forces in the Oireachtas to depart from linearity if we wished.  Not alone did we not wish but it was never considered or suggested for a moment.</P>

      <P>It was five, five to this moment.  We have on the Order Paper a resolution to move away from five, five.  I am now talking about events of the election of 1973 which gave us the power to do something which was obviously not done.  We did not depart from such linearity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One could go on on this endlessly <Col N="636" /> but I do not propose to take up too much of the Seanad's time.  Let me reiterate the argument about committees. Senator Yeats made a powerfully selected enumeration for the voting record and that was subsequently incapsulated in characteristically immoderate terms by Senator McGlinchey.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister for Foreign Affairs misunderstood the argument.  It is not about the grouping.  We are not arguing that we invent people from this Oireachtas to represent us on groupings where no such public opinion exists in Ireland.  Nobody ever suggested that for a moment so bringing the groupings in is irrelevant.  We are suggesting that it is important to have a powerful voice on the committees since the committee system is so important to the European Parliament, that it is important to have a significant voice in what is the largest group.</P>
    <P>Senator Yeats made an interesting point that seemed to me to strengthen our argument, when he said that the Socialist group represented&mdash;I am not going to quote his words or misinterpret what he said&mdash;consumers rather than farmers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>Supported the interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is a valid demographic statement about where most of the Socialist support in Europe comes from.  I think that the groups in the Parliament, as any other groups of politicians, represent the interests of those who elect them.  It is very important that within the Socialist group the argument for small farmers against simple urban consumerism be loudly articulated.  That is in Ireland's interest, it is in the interest of the Socialist group, it is in the interest of Europe as a whole.  When you go from five to six on a delegation you increase it by 20 per cent and that makes very little difference to covering the committees. When you go from two to one you simply say that certain committees will not be covered at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Yeats knows this as well as I do.  He may recall, in 1973, when we were all on the first delegation to Europe, an argument about who got what committees, which was quite a <Col N="637" /> sharp one, between the five and five of each side.  He knows how important committees are and he knows that, physically, one man cannot do it.  It is precisely because there is&mdash;he validly said a rather uniquely consumerist approach to the European Socialist group&mdash;that the voice of Ireland has to be articulated in that group at the various committees and that people have to say: &ldquo;Hold on now, I am a member of your group but you are not necessarily expressing the interest of my people who sent me here.  You may be expressing the interest of urban workers in a very high cost city where they have a particular set of pre-occupations.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It seems to me the figures do not warrant six, four.  It seems to me the effective working of the European Parliament does not warrant six, four. On the point of clarification my argument was not that it was simply a talking shop.  I think all of us must assume that we are clear enough, at least in this Chamber, about what the powers and role of the European Assembly are and what powers it does not possess.  The point was that there was no track to the Government in their legislative policy, in their power to do what they will.  By having the delegations equal there was no threat to the Fianna Fáil situation prior to the general election of 1973 and there was no threat to the Coalition by equal delegations from 1973 to now.  There is an argument for seeing, in the national interest, that all points of view in the nation are loudly expressed in all the committees.  There is an argument more particularly, though in fact we do not make it, in this motion for not cutting the Socialist representation off because that simply means that certain committees will not get covered. The committees are where the really important work takes place.  In fact, what we are saying is five, five representation. We are not saying in the motion one more Labour person.  In regard to the cross-Border studies to which Senator Yeats made reference, where does he think the initiative for those came from except from Coalition members, Fine Gael and Labour, in <Col N="638" /> the Council of Ministers?  That is where the drive to do that came from.</P>

I do not want to go on endlessly but I want simply to refer to the very interesting thought that emanated from the Government benches&mdash;I am quoting Senator McGlinchey&mdash;that it was more than generous to leave four seats to the Opposition and that the Irish people had given them&mdash;I would interpret &ldquo;them&rdquo; to mean the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;a mandate to seven seats.</P>

      <P>I think that is authoritarian, that it is using a majority of votes in the Dáil, which does not correspond to a majority of votes in the country, to skew the representation in an authoritarian way.  That is a pity but that blurting by Senator McGlinchey expresses the real intention of the Government and the Fianna Fáil Party, that when Fianna Fáil in <Col N="639" /> Opposition had enjoyed half, the present Opposition 40 per cent is, to quote, &ldquo;more than generous&rdquo;.  That is the real attitude of the Government and it is a deplorable one.  It was very <Col N="640" /> useful to debate a bit in order to bring that out.</P>

      <P>Just on a point of order, the reality is that the mandate for all but two of the delegation ran out on Friday last so that it is very important to get this motion through.  I do not want to make any point on that beyond saying that if this motion were not in the Seanad perhaps we could have gone ahead in advance to ensure that they would have been re-nominated. However, the fact that this motion was here would seem to be in contempt of this House if we had gone ahead and nominated in advance of that.</P>

In my view it is also the Government's responsibility to ensure that there is an Irish Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities.  On both those counts there has been a very unnecessary delay on the part of the Government.</P>

      <P>I have very little to say regarding this amendment except that in general and having regard to the nature of a private company, with the restriction on numbers and on transfers of shares and with the very high proportion of the companies in Ireland that are private companies &mdash;according to the latest statistics I have seen, 99.15 per cent of the companies in Ireland are private companies and that is an extraordinarily high proportion&mdash;there is an undue amount of carelessness with regard to this matter of ensuring that a private company remains a private company and that the rights of members of a private company are preserved.  There are serious losses for members of a private company if they breach the conditions which make the company a private company.  Obviously, the amendment would make it right that I should accept the ministerial amendment to section 5.  I was not convinced of the necessity of that amendment but I am prepared to accept it.</P>
      <P>In addition it follows logically that the provisions of Table A, regulation 8, the regulation applicable to private companies, should be altered accordingly.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 3, to delete subsection (2) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) Subsection (1) shall not relieve a company from compliance with</P>
      <P>(a)  the obligation to keep such books as are necessary to give a true and fair view of the company's affairs and to explain its transactions imposed by section 147 (2) of the Act of 1963;</P>
      <P>(b)  the obligation to preserve records imposed by section 147 (5) of the Act of 1963;</P>
      <P>(c)  the obligation with regard to the register of directors' share-holdings imposed by section 190 (2) of the Act of 1963; or</P>
      <P>(d)  the obligations imposed by any other Statute, statutory instrument or otherwise by law to preserve any other documents relating to any transactions of the company.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me explain briefly my position with regard to these amendments and in the context of what I said on Second Stage.  I have become satisfied that while official seals should not apply to private companies I am satisfied <Col N="645" /> now also that it is proper that private companies be given an opportunity of keeping computerised registers, computerised accounts.  I have found that quite a significant number of private companies are already keeping computerised records of accounts but there would seem to be some doubt as to whether in law they are right in doing so.  However, the doubt is being removed by this section.</P>
    <P>In moving the deletion of subsection (2) I have to consider the ministerial amendment thereto which is offered to the House in exchange.  I am satisfied that subsection (2) should stand because it relates to pre-1963 trust deeds which provide for the register of debentures.  Therefore, it is proper that in such cases registers be computerised. That is the convenient method for the company to adopt.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied also that the original subsection in the form in which it was would not have been satisfactory and I am happy that the ministerial proposal to amend it meets the difficulty I had in that regard.</P>
    <P>In agreeing to withdraw the amendment I am bound to express some residual unhappiness with regard to any possibility that anyone could construe this computerisation effort as relieving officers of companies from the obligations of the Companies Acts. This is probably taken care of by the provisions of subsection (4) which I had proposed to delete.</P>
    <P>I should like to give one illustration of the sort of problem involved.  There is an obligation on directors to keep records of their directors' share-holdings. It is possible to programme a computer in a way that the card will show what were the directors' shares at the beginning of the year and to show also what were their shares at the end of the year, perhaps showing the same figure on each occasion but without showing what went on during the year.  In other words, it is possible to programme a computer in a way that the basic information that is required by the Companies Act is not available.  I am satisfied that if the directors programmed a computer in a way that the information would not <Col N="646" /> be provided, they would be in breach of the Companies Act.  Consequently, I am withdrawing the amendment.</P>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Government amendment No. 4a:</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 4, before section 6, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;6.&mdash;The following is hereby inserted at the end of subsection (1) of section 2 of the Act of 1963:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;The word &ldquo;register&rdquo; (wherever used in this Act) includes in the case of any company keeping such register a register consisting of reproductions in legible form of entries recorded otherwise than in a legible form.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps I could argue for this amendment by giving a very short account of the stages by which we got to the <Col N="650" /> computer.  It was regarded as a major change in our company law when it became possible to keep company records in anything other than bound books which were faithfully transcribed by ill-paid servants of the company and changed either regularly or irregularly. At any rate they were presumed to be changed correctly.</P>
    <P>However, it was provided in the Companies Act, 1963, that it was no longer necessary to keep the records in bound books and it became possible for companies to do what many of them were already doing anyway, keeping the records on loose leaves and inserting them whenever convenient and making alterations to them.</P>
    <P>Now, we have come to the stage where we have computers that are ready to produce whatever has been fed into them.  I find it difficult to make this vast leap forward from the bound book to a locked machine.  I would have thought it desirable that there should be identified as the register which contains such vital information to the usefulness of company business, cards which result from a proper input to a machine that has been programmed properly and which should represent the register.  I find it difficult to accept, as a state in company law that is desirable that the register is in a machine which for some reason speaketh not and writeth not.  This seems tantamount to moving back two stages and saying that the register was the bound book with a creature before it with an ink and a pen but with the scribe refusing to make any entry in the bound book.  Until the entry was made in that bound book it was not a properly kept register.  In the case of a computer it seems to me that there should not be a register until the cards that are produced are filed properly and are available to the auditors.  I am suggesting in aid of the Bill that the register should consist of the reproductions in legible form of what has gone into the computer. There might be some metaphysical argument against that in terms of what we have already agreed to pass, but in terms of practical business it seems to me that the <Col N="651" /> register ought to be identified as a carefully collected together set of reproductions from the machine.</P>

      <P>I disagree with the Senator's remarks.  I feel that the amendment is based on the Senator's idea that the computer print-out is the register.  I feel that the input in the computer is the register and, in fact, the print-out is only a reproduction of the register in legible form.  This seems quite clear if we look at the wording of section 4 (1) which refers to keeping the register by recording matters in non-legible form and the wording of section 4 (2) which refers to keeping the register in legible or non-legible form. Again, I could refer to the Companies Act, section 378, which refers to the fact that any register may be kept by making entries in bound books.  On this basis I feel the Senator's amendment would be contrary to section 4 and, therefore, I could not accept it.</P>

      <P>There is a logic to the position of the Parliamentary Secretary.  It must be admitted that the logic stems from the language which I had been cajoled by the Parliamentary Secretary to accept as contained in subsection (1).  I am beginning to reject the cajolery because the Parliamentary Secretary has been saying in effect that what is put into the computer is the register.  If it be, why put it into the computer? However, in the interest of the harmony which I hope will long prevail between us all I withdraw this amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 2, subsection 1, line 20, after &ldquo;includes&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;houses,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I tabled this amendment because I was not sure of the position in law and I have now satisfied myself that houses as such are included.  I might say that my difficulty arose because I had not looked at the Interpretation Act, but now having looked at it I think I should have tabled a different amendment. I am not certain that flats, for example, are included and I just raise this point.  I have not looked at it in any great detail or depth but I raise the point so that the Parliamentary Secretary might take a look at it and perhaps we could discuss it on Report Stage if we thought it appropriate.</P>

      <P>With respect, I am not absolutely satisfied that they are. Our Interpretation Act differs quite <Col N="653" /> distinctly from the Interpretation Act applicable in the North.  I realise it is not appropriate perhaps to go into this at this time but flats are not specifically mentioned in the Interpretation Act. The North of Ireland Interpretation Act includes in the definition of &ldquo;lands&rdquo;, &ldquo;houses or other buildings or structures whatsoever&rdquo;, something which is not included in our Interpretation Act.  I do not want to make an issue of this at this stage but I would like the opportunity to look into it again.  As I say, flats are not specifically included in the Interpretation Act and I would have some doubts that they are included in this Bill.  With the consent of the House I will withdraw my amendment.</P>

At the time when we asked for legal advice from the Attorney General's office we discovered that the term &ldquo;land&rdquo; under the Interpretation Act includes houses, tenements, messuages and they would, in fact, include flats.  These points were specifically put to the Attorney General's office and we have been assured that this is the position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I would like to say to the House that nobody gets greater pleasure from the close of the day's work than I do.  But we are here proposing to enact an extremely important extension of our criminal law which casts a great deal of responsibility on us as legislators to know precisely what we are doing.  I think it may be a happy thing that the Bill is one which cannot possibly cause any disagreement between the parties represented in this House because it was a Bill which moved from one Government to another with perhaps some minor changes that I did not <Col N="654" /> bother to identify but in general it is such a Bill.</P>
      <P>Therefore I think we should be concerned to make it as good a Bill as we can.  Once you enact a thing it takes a long time again to get that enactment corrected.  I speak from great experience on this.  You may get full agreements from Departments but they cannot get their Minister's time or the Ministers cannot get parliamentary time and if there is something in legislation that ought not to be in it it is extremely difficult to get that put right. Therefore, I am at once pleading for attention from those Senators who feel able to give it, and I am warning those who feel they are going to be bored by the whole thing that I may be going on for quite a little while.</P>
      <P>I would like to take this exactly as the Parliamentary Secretary would like it to be taken.  I have a lot of points on some of the sections and if the Parliamentary Secretary feels that she has heard enough so far from me on section 1 and indicates by a nod I shall sit down and get up again to make the other points.  Sometimes it is hard on one who has to deal with points to get the whole lot of them thrown at one, so I do not want to do that.  First of all, I may be wrong in everything I say, but it seems we are at once getting a warning of the dangers of our situation when we find &mdash;and this is relevant to section 1&mdash; Acts referred to on the outside of the Bill.  You find here six Acts.</P>
      <P>In section 1 we find the Acts are described as meaning the Merchandise Marks Acts, 1887 to 1970.  If you take a little time to look into it you will find that there is indeed an Act not referred to which is pertinent to the consideration by the Seanad of what it is now enacting and which is part of the Merchandise Marks Acts, 1887 to 1970, that being the Act of 1970 which is not on the outside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I missed the Second Reading debate and I must avoid making a Second Reading speech which I shall adroitly do.  It seems a pity that the parliamentary draftsman was daunted by the task of trying to produce for the consumption of those who have to <Col N="655" /> consume legislation a clear designation and description of the law relative to consumer information.  It would have been difficult but not impossible to extract from the Merchandise Marks Act, 1887 what was pertinent to it and putting it into this legislation but at least consumers could find out what their rights were.  Now there is the greatest difficulty in finding out what their rights were because we have to go back to the Merchandise Marks Act, 1887, take a truncated piece of it and, as I did with scissors and back-up paper, paste together the truncated remains of the Merchandise Marks Act, 1887 which itself had to be then amended in ink, and add to it part of this Bill to discover what is the principal offence created by this Bill.</P>
    <P>There are two offences.  One is the offence of applying a false description to goods or procuring that application. The other is selling, which includes exposure for sale or possession for sale, of goods falsely described. They are two separate offences but we do not find that in this legislation. My first point is in regard to the 1970 Act.  In aid of the Parliamentary Secretary I am making these points at this stage so that when we come to the later sections perhaps it might be possible to give some indication of what the ministerial attitude is to the matter.</P>
    <P>The 1970 Merchandise Marks Act dealt with containers and section 2 provided for ministerial orders with regard to containers.  Subsection (5) provided that the notice displayed on the container should not be so displayed as to convey false or misleading information with regard to the quantity of the contents.  I do not know whether that section is being amended in any way by the section dealing with false descriptions or trade descriptions.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of those powers of authorised officers contained in section 4 of the 1970 Act, are they reconcilable with the powers of the authorised officers under this legislation? There is provision for offences <Col N="656" /> under section 5 of the 1970 Act and descriptions of penalties.  Incidentally, the penalty is very greatly in excess of the penalty provided seven years later with regard to offences under this legislation because the penalty mentioned there is £2,000.  Is the provision which deals with what seems to be a breach of an order with regard to the description of what is in a container to exist side by side with the general law in regard to trade descriptions which is to be contained in this legislation?  How are the two to be reconciled and why are they not reconciled?</P>
    <P>There is provision also in the 1970 Act for a particular kind of defence which we are getting rid of by this Bill as a possible defence under the 1887 Act.  I would like to know how this matter was considered and how it is proposed to deal with it.  It seems to be made to have two different types of defences and penalties for proceedings which are analogous if not the same.  They all relate to the same sort of matter, which is trading.  Although we are calling this a Consumer Information Bill it is, in fact, a trade description Bill.  People buying machines will be entitled to the benefit of this legislation. The State will be as alert to protect them as it will the ultimate customer.  It is consumer information for the palates of consumers but at all stages of the chain from the manufacturer all the way along the line down to the consumer with regard to whoever is paying value-added tax it is possible that a crime will be committed against him.  There are similar difficulties with regard to the 1931 Act and the thing that interested me there was the provision with regard to the prosecutor.  There is a section in this Bill which we will come to later&mdash;we can talk less hurriedly about it when we get to the section&mdash;with regard to who is to prosecute.</P>
    <P>As far as I know the Merchandise Marks Act, 1931, is still the law of the land.  I know there was a big change in 1932 but I do not think the Merchandise Marks Act of 1931 went in 1932; in fact it did not, it is still there which is encouraging for us all in 1977.  Maybe it is not encouraging to find that people are forgetting its existence when <Col N="657" /> they are drafting Bills in 1977; it seems to me they are, perhaps they are not, perhaps I am wrong in this.  There is a provision for prosecution by the Minister and various authorised persons. The Minister for Agriculture pops up in the Merchandise Marks Act, 1931, unless he surrendered his power in some disgraceful episode of which we have not been informed.  In the Merchandise Marks Act of 1931 under section 31 he may undertake as prosecutor the prosecution of any offence &mdash;now, do not think that I am talking rubbish&mdash;under the Principal Act. What is the Principal Act?  It is the very one being talked about here today. The Principal Act is the Merchandise Marks Act of 1887.  It was in 1931 and it is in 1977 and it looks like being in 1987 because it is continuing as the Principal Act.</P>
    <P>At any rate, the Minister for Agriculture may undertake the prosecution of any offence under the Principal Act or any offence under this legislation in cases which appear to him to relate to agricultural produce or to the produce of any other rural industries and which affect the general interests of the country or a section of the community or of a trade or an industry. All I want to know is, what has happened to him?  How is he provided for in this particular Bill because provided for he ought to be.  If we are going to take power from him let us do it formally.  If we are going to leave it with him, let us note it and justify the reasons for doing so.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a few other points.  Should it be the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy? Senator Keating will leap out of the torpor which I have been inducing in him at any suggestion that it should not be the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy.  But he is the Minister who, after all, is most interested in the development of industry, in the stimulation of production, in the accretion to gross value or whatever happens to be the current word at any given moment.  He is most interested in increasing turnover.  He is most interested in people selling to consumers by any devices that they can.  As Minister <Col N="658" /> for Industry, Commerce and Enregy he is interested in the business of selling and getting goods produced, processed, reconditioned, repaired and so on and he is interested in exports but his function as such must mean that he is less than interested in the consumer, particularly when we get to something like exports.  How interested is he in the foreign consumer?  The UK are frightfully clear about this. They have a Trade Descriptions Act which visibly distinguishes in a more gross manner than they normally do the foreigner from the Briton.  When you are selling things abroad you do not have to comply with the Trade Descriptions Act.  In Britain if you are selling to foreigners the Trade Descriptions Act says you are O.K., as I understand the British law.</P>
    <P>For the moment I just want to concentrate attention on this question of whether the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy is or ought to be the Minister to deal with consumer affairs.  After all, in this generality of his function he is not merely interested in manufacturing, employment and so on but specifically connected with a whole lot of State enterprises and he is involved in the supervision indirectly of a lot of equity stakes.  How can he be concerned to bring a prosecution to lead to jail some of his nominees on some State board who have been found guilty of offences under this Act?</P>
    <P>I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will not think it discourteous of me that I have to argue that in my view the Department of which she is Parliamentary Secretary ought not to be the Department concerned with looking after consumer affairs, or at least concerned with the business of deciding whether people are to be prosecuted. That, at any rate, I can see is a matter for debate and it should be a debate between us all without regard to any allegiances we may have.  It is a question I raise for consideration.</P>
    <P>The question of goods as including land has been dealt with by my colleague, Senator Molony.  Goods include various things but there is missing a definition of what a ship is. Do we include a ship?  Is there some <Col N="659" /> doubt about a ship being a chattel?  I could not push a ship if it were of any size whatever but that is hardly the test.  The united Seanad would not be able to push the <i>Queen Mary.</i>  What is the test?  The passing by delivery? You do not pass a ship by delivery. Is this the reason we are including it? We are including it as something that passes by some document of title.  Then we include aircraft.  We have not gone into the law of aircraft but probably there is another piece of paper to pass the title to that.  Land would not leap to your mind if told your wife was going to buy some goods this afternoon. If she came back having bought a mountainside it would definitely be a surprise if she had not included it on the shopping list.  When you get to including things you are in difficulty because of the possibility of excluding things.  When we are including ships are we excluding boats?  Are we excluding shipping vessels or any kind of old thing you can push out to sea or along a river bank?  What about the oil rig?  That is not very pushable.  I do not know how you acquire title to it.  I know how you dispose of pieces of paper that you once thought might give you title to it.  The business of inclusion raises a problem.  Why vehicles?  I do not think you need include vehicles.  I know they are included in other legislation and that may be the reason.</P>
    <P>Accommodation is limited to living accommodation and I should like to know why.  Is this because it is a crime to want to narrow the number of things?  What about an office?  I recently discovered&mdash;because I only recently read it&mdash;that the law relative to vendors and purchasers and lessors and lessees and the civil liability situation with regard to houses and land of any kind is extraordinarily complex and stays starkly within the <i>caveat emptor</i> provision.  I know we are not dealing with civil law here.  If you get a false description of accommodation, if it is something you do not see, if the whole place is going to fall down and you do not discover that until you fall or until it falls five years later, the false description is there and it is <Col N="660" /> a criminal offence.  Surely it should be a criminal offence if somebody builds a hospital describing it to be in accordance with certain specifications when it does not live up to those specifications.</P>
    <P>I had a situation where my daughter, fortunately, had left the room when the ceiling fell in&mdash;I subsequently sold the house for a considerable sum of money but I had repaired the ceiling, I hasten to inform the House, and my daughter is still alive and intact&mdash;at least she was when I left for the Seanad earlier today.  I inquired into my rights at that stage because I thought she might have remained in the room and the ceiling might have fallen on her and so on.  I found I had no civil rights and, what is more, the darned builder had put in plans saying that the lath, or whatever the damned thing is they shove across the top of the ceiling, was going to be two inches and it was only one inch.  That was living accommodation and, under this legislation&mdash;subject to suitable amendment being made later&mdash;we would have been able to get him.</P>

      <P>I moved on to subsection (2).  The words used there do not necessarily include a record or cassette or one of the type of things which a bright boy might use to advertise.  It might come as a total surprise to some in this House that anybody would think of such a thing, but it has been done.</P>
      <P>There are two final points on this section.  It is right that we should say that the change made here represents a significant extension of the criminal law in the general proposals.  With regard to subsection (3)&mdash;a person exposing goods for supply or having goods in his possession for supply&mdash; the word &ldquo;supply&rdquo; is much wider than &ldquo;for sale&rdquo;.  It is useful to draw attention to the fact that this definition may have curious consequences on those few occasions when we use the word &ldquo;supply&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;sale&rdquo;.  We make a sudden shift round in the middle of the Bill from selling things to supplying them.  Of course, one can have things for supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are talking about a criminal offence where the proof must be considerable. For example, in Britain when they got a bread vanman contravening the trades descriptions under the old Acts, the authorities were unable to prove he had supplied bread already, because he had not goods for sale in the van; he only had them for supply.  He was not capable of being convicted at that stage of <Col N="662" /> British law, when the offence was for having them in his possession or exposure for sale rather than for supply.</P>
    <P>I have one suggestion for consideration by the Parliamentary Secretary and that is that the whole section might start with &ldquo;For the purposes of the Acts and this Act&rdquo; and so on. The words are used in subsection (2) but not in subsection (1) for some reason that is not altogether clear to me.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank Senator FitzGerald for not making a Second Stage speech on section 1.  He spoke about the list of Acts referred to in the Bill.  This is a factual list of the Acts covered in the various sections.  &ldquo;The Acts&rdquo; means the Merchandise Marks Acts from 1887 to 1970 but the others are included in various sections in the Bill, and we will be coming to them, no doubt, during Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>The inclusion of the 1970 Act was necessary because powers were conferred on officers under that Act which will still remain for the old descriptions and we have added further features of descriptions.  The Senator will appreciate that.  Included under section 17, to which the Senator referred, are the penalties which will now be in force for all the Acts.  He was worried in case nominees of the Minister happened to be prosecuted by the same Minister.  I am sure Senator Keating would agree that any nominees, either of the present Minister, Deputy O'Malley, or of his would not have to be prosecuted by the Minister, and we would hope that the situation would remain the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald went on to talk about accommodation and why it should mean living accommodation. We try in this legislation to include private accommodation as opposed to, say, factory accommodation.  Private accommodation offered in newspaper advertisements would be described in glowing terms.  It would be proper that it should live up to the description given.  If I understood the Senator correctly he spoke about living accommodation which had recently collapsed or fallen.  I was wondering if it was the <Col N="663" /> accommodation recently acquired in Mount Street.</P>

      <P>The right of the Minister for Agriculture to prosecute under the 1931 Act is not abrogated by this Bill.  The Senator brought up the point as to whether the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy is the most suitable person to have responsibility for consumer affairs.  I must deal with the situation as I find it and that is as it is at the moment.  Of course, it is a matter for the Taoiseach of the day and the Government to say who should be responsible for consumer affairs.</P>
      <P>The Senator asked why vehicles should be included.  It is natural that we would, as much as possible, catch those who sell cars by advertisement or by describing them, because very often when we go to buy they are not as described in the advertisement.  We include in accommodation, hotel rooms or any other accommodation, as opposed to a factory.</P>
      <P>Other points raised relate to different sections of the Bill.  If we discussed them at length on the relevant sections, the debate would be more organised. Is the Senator agreeable?</P>

      <P>This amendment is designed to improve the effectiveness of the provision by widening its scope to cover recordings and performers.  I may add that the amendment is similar to that of Senator Molony.  It is alleged that false or misleading descriptions arise regarding the identity of performers on sound recordings.  This would not be embraced by the provision in its present form but will be covered if the amendment is made.  The effect of this amendment will be to protect purchasers of recordings from deception. It is not intended as a safeguard for the protection of the commercial property or the copyright of the production itself. As it is similar to Senator Molony's amendment I feel it will be accepted.</P>

      <P>On this section I have a number of points, perhaps the most important one is that section 2 does not seem to deal with parts of goods.  It refers to goods only and not to any single part of goods which may be capable of trade descriptions as well as goods generally. The second point is that the trade description here would have to include the reference in the Merchandise Marks Act, 1911, which provides that a customs entry is a trade description, or in some way reconciles it.  As section 2 of the 1970 Act provides for an order with regard to the contents of a container and makes provision for a trade description, the use of the word &ldquo;means&rdquo; does not include &ldquo;means any description, statement or other indication&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the effect of section 7 of the Principal Act with regard to watches?  There is a special provision with regard to the description of watches in the Merchandise Marks Act, 1887.  There was a provision in <Col N="665" /> the Principal Act that the provision of the Act as to false descriptions is not to apply in certain cases where it is lawfully and generally applied to goods of a particular class.  I would like to know if this has been considered.  I think there is a clear mistake in the drafting.  It is a small one and easy to correct.  Section 2 (2) (c), line 54, states &ldquo;false in a material respect&rdquo;.  I think this should be &ldquo;false in a material degree&rdquo;.  I may be wrong but that seems wrong to me.</P>
    <P>With regard to the provisions for the temporary importation of goods, how is it proposed to deal with the provisions of goods which are consigned under the Merchandise Marks Act, 1931, to persons outside the State, whether there are analogous provisions to the UK provisions which exclude the Trade Descriptions Acts from exports in effect?</P>
    <P>My final point is a question rather than a comment.  What if you got something like cheddar cheese?  Section 2 (1) says:</P>
    <P>...&ldquo;trade description&rdquo; means any description, statement or other indication, direct or indirect...</P>
    <P>(b) as to the place or country in which any goods were manufactured, produced, processed, reconditioned, repaired, packed or prepared for sale, or</P>
    <P>Cheddar cheese is produced in many parts of the world besides Cheddar. Bath buns are cooked in other places than Bath.  Are you falsely describing cheddar cheese because it was not manufactured in the land where cheddar cheese originally came from?</P>

      <P>There is one point I would like to raise but before I do so I would like to suggest to Senator FitzGerald that his amendment to section 2 (2) (c) would not be very satisfactory. As I understand it, he would like to have things being &ldquo;false in a material degree&rdquo;.  That suggests that a certain degree of falsity would be all right, and only at a certain point would you say it was too false.  Therefore, we better leave it as it is because it implies that if it is false on some matter which is material, it comes under the Act, and I certainly would not like to see the word &ldquo;degree&rdquo; inserted.</P>
      <P>I would like to make an inquiry about section 2 (1) (k) which reads:</P>
      <P>...as to the contents of books or films or as to their authors or producers,</P>
      <P>Every one knows that in many cases books have false statements about their authors.  Many authors write under a pseudonym.  In other cases we have celebrated but somewhat illiterate football stars who write articles, and we all know these are ghosted by anonymous individuals.  In theory it is the football star who writes them. Are these to be brought holus bolus under the Act for false statements?  It seems to be a rather drastic breach of prevailing rules of authorship.  I suggest that this should be looked at because otherwise one might have unforeseen results.</P>

      <P>I would like to support my friend, Senator FitzGerald, in his remarks about cheese.  A better known place for cheese production is Cheshire.  Cheddar is known and celebrated as an area where cheese is produced.  Suppose you describe something as Irish Cheshire or Irish Camembert or Irish Danish Blue. Senator FitzGerald has raised a genuine and important point and Senator Yeats has an important point also.  Are we going to produce a Bill which, if a certain very pedantic lawyer got hold of it he could prosecute for all kinds of things?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For instance, the great poet Cecil Day Lewis used to write thrillers under <Col N="667" /> another name.  Would he be prosecuted for not signing himself Cecil Day Lewis?  He wanted to separate two sides of his personality.  Would he be misdescribing himself and be open to prosecution?  It is only a small point but I think the point about Cheddar and Cheshire cheeses is probably relevant here.  You could say that a sensible lawyer looking at this would say, yes, it is designed to protect us against fraud and fraud exists in all kinds of ways, but would an innocent spoof be open to prosecution?  For instance, what would happen if somebody said he had discovered a 19th century Irish poet who never existed and wrote the poet's works and commentaries on them, learned foot-notes, invented a biography for him, and published his article for the amusement of certain people?  It is something that has not been unknown.</P>
    <P>There is an English poet called Crabtree who does not exist and there are lectures given on him every year. Crabtree dinners are eaten in his honour.  He never existed but all his poems have been written fraudulently by a number of bored academics who could not think of anything better to do with their time.  Is this Bill not a bit too precise and pedantic?  If it were scrupulously interpreted, could it not put a lot of innocently mischievous people in trouble?  Surely that cannot be the purpose of a Bill which is primarily there to protect the public against fraud.</P>

Is it dairy cream foodstuffs?</P>

      <P>I wanted to intervene in exactly the opposite sense to Senator Martin.  If manufacturers and suppliers are in danger through pedantic interpretation by ingenious lawyers, let us consider the situation which we know to be true and which this legislation was developed to end &mdash;that the poor, unsuspecting and exceedingly numerous public have been ripped off ruthlessly decade after decade.  The existing legislation, named and unnamed, has not been invoked in practice.  Lawyers deploy their ingenuity in other directions, mostly in the services of those who could afford to pay them who were in fact manufacturers.</P>
      <P>One can think of instances where a pedantic lawyer could act in an obscurantist and difficult way under any such legislation.  But the reality, when you come to frame it is that there is a difficulty for every solution.  If we do not legislate in this sort of way, in a reasonably straightforward sense, assuring the reason of the lawyers who interpret it, then we will not get any protection for the public at all.  The need of the public, in balance in this context, in my view far outweighs the need of the manufacturers and suppliers. They have been winning the battle.  When for a few decades the public have won the battle and have vexatiously taken some damages from suppliers in the wrong, it may conceivably balance for all the decades when the manufacturers and suppliers ripped off the public in the wrong and the public had no defence.  Until I see that happening, I believe that if we are going to&mdash;I do not want to use the word too perjoratively&mdash;nit-pick about this, we will find all legislation on this issue damn nearly impossible and we will find that we are denying the public the protection all of us as public representatives know to be long overdue.</P>
