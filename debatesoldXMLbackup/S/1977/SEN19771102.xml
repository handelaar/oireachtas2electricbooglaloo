      <P>Could I ask the Leader of the House when he expects that the expediency motions will be available to re-establish the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities and to establish the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies?  I know that the Leader of the House, as former member of the EEC Committee, will share with me the concern about the workload of this Committee.  It last met on the 4th May, and in the five months since there has been considerable EEC draft legislation.  I am aware that the Committee require an expediency motion tabled in the Dáil.  But both Houses have now been sitting and it seems to me that it is a matter of extreme urgency that there be a watchdog committee of the Oireachtas to scrutinise the EEC legislation.  I would welcome some information about when we can expect the necessary expediency motion and the motion establishing the terms of reference so that this Committee can come into operation as soon possible.</P>

      <P>That the Clerk of Seanad Éireann do send to the Minister for the Environment notice of a vacancy in the membership of Seanad Éireann occasioned by the death of Senator Jack Garrett, a Member elected from the Sub-Panel of the Administrative Panel at the General Election for Seanad Éireann, August, 1977.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Senator John Joseph McCartin be elected Leas-Chathaoirleach.</P>
      <P>My party in putting forward Senator McCartin's name for this important post are completely satisfied of his ability to discharge the duties that pertain to that post.  In the lifetime of the last Seanad he had considerable experience as Acting Chairman of controlling the proceedings of the House and his conduct of those proceedings gave general satisfaction. He proved that he has a complete knowledge of the procedures and rules of the House and has the ability to apply that knowledge in practice.  Accordingly, I move that he be appointed Leas-Chathaoirleach.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It had been the practice of this House for many years past, up to four years ago, for the majority party not to put forward a candidate for the position of Leas-Chathaoirleach. In 1973 the Coalition Parties, who were then busily preaching power-sharing, decided, with a characteristic inconsistency, not to apply that doctrine to this House and put forward a candidate for Leas-Chathaoirleach, thus depriving the main Opposition party of that position.  In spite of that provocation and the temptation to follow that rather shabby precedent, Fianna Fáil do not propose to put forward a candidate for the position of Leas-Chathaoirleach and we will be <Col N="63" /> supporting the nomination of Senator McCartin who did act in the Chair on a number of occasions during the past four years.  I am sure he will show the same impartiality and firmness he showed when he acted on occasions in the past and he will certainly have our full support.</P>

      <P>I want to thank the Leader of my Party for proposing me and Senator FitzGerald for seconding the motion.  I am most grateful to Senators for making my selection unanimous. I realise it is on the standards, behaviour and debate of the Seanad in general that this House will be judged. In so far as I, in the discharge of my office, can complement your work in any way, Sir, I hope I will be able to do this in accordance with the high standards that have been set by all my predecessors.  I would like to say, especially at this time, that my immediate predecessor, Senator Evelyn Owens, Leas-Chathaoirleach in the last Seanad, discharged her obligations in a manner I should like to imitate.  My experience during the previous Seanad and all I learned from Senator Dooge and Senator Owens, I hope to be able to put to good use in the future.</P>
      <P>While being a very close neighbour, geographically, of the present Cathaoirleach, we have never been in the same constituency and therefore there has never been political strife, certainly at constituency level, to mar the very good relationship that we always enjoyed and we have roots in the same what might be described as backward, underdeveloped, soggy soil.  It is very nice to share that common background. I hope we will enjoy the work that is before us and that we will be able to co-operate to make the work of this House easier and more efficient.</P>

    <Title>Export Promotion (Amendment) Bill, 1977  (  Certified Money Bill )  : Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose <Col N="64" /> of this Bill is to make provision for further grants to Córas Tráchtála to enable them to continue the work of promoting, assisting and developing exports.</P>
      <P>When Córas Tráchtála were first set up, under the Export Promotion Act, 1959, the amount which could be made available to them out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas was limited to £1 million.  This statutory limit was raised by subsequent Export Promotion Acts, the most recent being that of 1974 which raised it to £25 million.  The Bill under consideration at present proposes to raise the limit to £45 million.</P>
      <P>The Export Promotion Act, 1959, set up Córas Tráchtála as a statutory board, to take over the functions of Córas Tráchtála Teoranta, a limited liability company which was incorporated in December, 1951.  Since 1959 Córas Tráchtála have made a valuable contribution to the development of Irish exports which in the period 1959-1976 have risen from £130 million to £1,857 million.</P>
      <P>There is little need for me to point out to this House that moneys made available to Córas Tráchtála are well spent.  Senators are well aware of the importance of the board's task and of the efficiency of their operations.  As industrial activity expanded in volume and range over the years, Córas Tráchtála's operations were extended to provide exporters with the aids and services they needed in changing market conditions, to assist them in opening up new markets and consolidating their position in existing ones. The board have provided new aids and services as they saw exporters' needs for them developing.  These aids and services are wide, ranging from information, advice and basic market research to specialist services in the fields of market research and design management, and from incentive grants for individual exporters visiting overseas markets to the organisation of national stands at international trade fairs.  These services are kept under constant review to ensure that they cater adequately for changing trends in marketing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="65" /> The result of Córas Tráchtála's efforts to create new markets for our exports and so, amongst other benefits, lessen our dependence on the UK, our traditional trading partner, is evident from the distribution pattern of our exports in 1976.  In that year 49 per cent of our exports went to the UK as against 56 per cent in 1974 and 66 per cent in 1971.  The share of exports to the other EEC member states on the other hand has increased from 18 per cent in 1974 to 27 per cent in 1976.</P>
    <P>For the first nine months of 1977 the percentage taken by the UK was down to 47 per cent &mdash; though still up in the absolute sense.  Our exports to the other seven EEC countries at £524 million represented an increase to 29 per cent of total exports compared with 27 per cent for the same period in 1976.</P>
    <P>Exports this year are buoyant and for the full year seem certain to exceed anything achieved in previous years.  In the first nine months exports at £1,809.6 million represent an increase of approximately 41 per cent compared with the corresponding period of 1976. That gives us the highest rate of value growth in exports in the European Economic Community.  The main contribution came from manufactures. Export expansion and development on such a scale is indeed encouraging and, I am sure you will agree, a tribute to Córas Tráchtála.</P>
    <P>An invaluable source of assistance to exporters is the overseas office network of Córas Tráchtála which is at their disposal.  Córas Tráchtála now have 19 overseas offices &mdash; in 17 countries and all five continents.  They are particularly conscious of the requirements of our exporters to the EEC where, in all, they have nine offices. Through their Brussels office they monitor EEC developments and provide exporters with expert advice and market intelligence in this area.</P>
    <P>While all these developments create opportunities for exporters, they also call for an increasing level of expenditure on the part of Córas Tráchtála. Payments to the board by way of grant-in-aid up to the end of 1976 amounted to £22,350,885 which left a <Col N="66" /> balance of £2,649,115 unissued from the existing statutory limit of £25 million.  This balance will not cover the board's financial requirements up to the end of 1977 in respect of which it is estimated that £4.3 million will be required.</P>
    <P>I am sure Senators will agree that Córas Tráchtála should have adequate funds for their work, which has been a major factor in the development and diversification of Irish exports, particularly industrial exports, which in 1976 accounted for almost two-thirds of total exports.  Therefore, I confidently recommend the increase by an additional £20 million of the statutory limit on the grants which may be allocated to Córas Tráchtála to enable them to pursue the important role they play in the development of our exports.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>Fine Gael support this simple amending Bill, which proposes to raise the limit from £25 million to £45 million.  I wish the Minister for Industry and Commerce well in the very difficult task which he is undertaking as Minister in a very sensitive and important area of national activity.  He is going to have a lot of problems, the most serious one being the anomaly that in an era of staggering improvements in the general welfare of the Irish economy, of greater competitiveness, of major investment and of great increases in exports of manufactured goods, it is very difficult to relate all this to jobs. This will undoubtedly continue to be a major factor.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I would like on behalf of my party to wish the Minister well.  I agree with his remarks about CTT.  They have been doing an excellent job.  They are very dedicated people.  We have had proof of that over a great number of years.  They are to a considerable extent responsible for the staggering increase we are seeing in exports.  The fact that exports for the first nine months of this year equal the total for the 12 months of last year shows how dramatic the increase has been &mdash; nearly 50 per cent and in real terms something in excess of 30 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In looking at CTT and other semi-State <Col N="67" /> sectors, there is one area in which we need to have a fairly critical analysis.  Unthinking people might draw an immediate parallel between the work of CTT and the total industrial export figure.  I do not think this analogy should be drawn.  We need to put one or two things into perspective. A huge proportion of our total manufactured exports come from many sectors, such as multi-nationals and very large companies which have come here since our EEC entry with their own marketing structures, both in their parent companies and in other countries. A large proportion of these exports would be there whether or not CTT exist.</P>
    <P>CTT's main function is advertising this country and, within the industrial sector, helping the less well off and smaller companies in the field.  I read recently that, of the 16,000 companies they have assisted, nearly 1,000 have been small&mdash;&ldquo;small&rdquo; being companies employing under 100 people.  The smaller companies, in which there is proportionately the highest proportion of Irish equity, account for about 18 per cent of total manufactured exports. The encouragement of this sector, apart from the overall national aspect of representation within the specific sectors, is probably the area in which they can do the most useful work.  The raising of that level is very important.</P>
    <P>If we look at other manufacturing nations, there is a tendency to think of the United States, Great Britain and West Germany as being the world industrial powers, with industrial power concentrated within large companies. In these major world economies around 25 per cent of manufacturing output and employment is provided by small companies employing 100 or under 100 people.</P>
    <P>I would like to compliment CTT on the work they have been doing in the promotional area, especially outside the United Kingdom.  Historically we have been much too dependent on Britain for our exports.  One of the immense benefits accruing from EEC membership has been our lessening dependence on the British market and <Col N="68" /> the increase in the proportion of Irish trade going to other countries.  It is interesting to see that in 1971 about 66 per cent of our exports were going to Britain and that in 1976 that figure was 49 per cent.  We have not got the figures for this year but presumably there is a further lessening of dependence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>46 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>46 per cent for this year.  This trend is extremely healthy, and CTT have been in the vanguard with very diligent marketing and unrewarding work to an extent which is not altogether appreciated within this country because the work is done on shores far from this island.</P>
      <P>When we speak about the lessening dependence of trade with Britain and look at trade with other parts of the world, there is room for continuing disquiet about the abysmally small proportion of Irish exports going into Eastern Europe and to Russia in particular.  There is a high level of imports from some of these countries &mdash; from Russia for example &mdash; and there is an imbalance which is entirely unsatisfactory.  I am aware that CTT have been doing all they can.  They have set up missions, established offices and a very large proportion of their budget has been going into that part of the world.  However there are still major blocks where we are simply not selling what we might sell.</P>
      <P>I believe there is a political dimension to trade with Russia and Eastern Europe to a much greater extent than there is a political dimension to trade in the free world.  It seems that the Governments of these countries can be much more influential in assisting our exports if they have the will to do so.  There is a very big Russian presence in the Russian Embassy here and the level of our imports from the USSR at present suggests that more could be done at that level and that more leverage at a diplomatic level might be necessary to attempt to correct this imbalance.  I hope the Minister will refer to this in his reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In summary, the money sought is for a productive area of the economy, an area where there is a direct spin-off.  It <Col N="69" /> is one of the healthiest sectors of Irish life at present.  Fine Gael fully support this amending Bill and wish CTT well for the future.  As I said at the outset, we wish the Minister well in his very arduous task and hope he will build on the foundation which has been very successfully laid for him by my colleague, Senator Justin Keating.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CLambert" hpid="Mr. Lambert Mr. Lambert">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lambert</NameTxt>
      <P>I had the rewarding experience of working with CTT since their inception in 1959 and I should like to confirm all the praise they have received.  I have found them most efficient and helpful in every possible way as they have evolved over the years.</P>
      <P>I concur with what was said during the Dáil debate that the Department of Foreign Affairs should consider more business expertise when sending officials to our embassies abroad.  In my opinion this development is far overdue.  We are too small a country to overlook the complementary benefits which our own costly embassies can give in more active support to the likes of CTT.  I experienced this in the sixties when Con Howard was Vice-Consul in Boston.  He was immensely helpful to me in arranging trade contacts and business negotiations at a time when CTT were not fully operative.</P>
      <P>I should like again to add my good wishes to the Minister on his new responsibilities.  I am sure the whole business community are glad he is in favour of conveying to the Minister for Foreign Affairs that he would like our foreign diplomatic representation broadened to some extent to take account of the fact that our trading interests are perhaps one of the most important interests abroad.  Closer coordination between our diplomatic and commercial representatives abroad, financed by public expenditure, is to be welcomed and can strengthen promotion of our trading interests as well as our international political image.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is only one other point I wish to discuss.  I believe Córas Tráchtála have 19 overseas offices in 17 countries in all five continents.  However, one of the most valuable and easily accessible markets is Northern Ireland and I hope some official form of trade representation <Col N="70" /> in that area will emerge from the money being allocated under this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Firstly, let me convey my congratulations to the Minister on his taking up what I know to be a difficult job and, secondly, to convey my congratulations that he has been able to add Energy to his portfolio. The logical planning of an energy policy indicates that responsibility ought to be right beside industry where it naturally belongs.  That is something he should be congratulated on, and I think it is a progressive step.</P>
      <P>This is the first time the matter of Córas Tráchtála has presented itself in public since I left the office of Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I welcome this opportunity to say how vastly I was impressed by the professional expertise, the high morale and &mdash; the cliché is &mdash; the willingness to work beyond the call of duty, but in my experience it was even beyond an awareness of what time it was on the clock or what day of the week it was. The extraordinary vitality, high morale and expertise inside CTT in my opinion put everyone in debt to that organisation.  They have done extremely well for us.  Therefore I am rising in support of the Bill, but there are a few points that I should like to make.</P>
      <P>I do not think we need to do more than notice in passing and to welcome the fact of diversification away from dependency on the UK market.  It is easier to welcome that when we can couple it with the recognition of the fact that actual sales to the UK are increasing.  It is not being done at the cost of sales to the UK, but because other sectors are rising more rapidly. That is welcome and is important for us nationally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would be interested to see our ranking in Community terms&mdash;indeed this is findable but I do not happen to have found it &mdash; of export growth, not in value terms but in volume terms, because there have been different rates of inflation in different countries.  I ask that because I am prepared to believe that we may not be first in volume, as we are in value, but we would be very high in Community terms in rate of export growth, and may even be near <Col N="71" /> the top in volume as well.  That is a strikingly good performance.  It is a performance that is not the responsibility of any single organisation but the responsibility of the whole of our industrial sector and, indeed, the responsibility of the whole of our economy.  Also it is not a performance that can be switched on or off quickly. It is the result of literally decades of accumulating activity and accumulating skill.</P>
    <P>It is welcome too &mdash; and I say this with my own particular agricultural precoccupations and background&mdash;to see the industrial sector becoming more and more the engine of growth. We see with the evolving figures that, though agricultural exports are also showing dramatic increases, the leading role of industry is being more clearly confirmed.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister can sucseed where I could not in relation to trade with Eastern Europe.  I note what he has said in recent months. It is a matter of regret to me that in my period in office my performance in that area was as inadequate and as bad as it was.  I wish Córas Tráchtála and himself well in that regard.</P>
    <P>I want very briefly&mdash;and this relates to something Senator Lambert said &mdash; to congratulate everyone concerned on an extremely striking performance of industrial exports, but I want them to look at the dangers.  The upfloat of the pound while it is welcome in lots of ways and certainly eases inflationary pressures, will make our exports less competitive at a time when world trade is not showing the dynamism it did a year or 18 months ago.  That is a threat that we can deal with, but only on certain conditions.  If you look at the table of exports, take out the industrial headings and then look at the breakdown of those industrial headings, you see that the evolution going on in our export trade is not 40 per cent across the board; it is by no means that.</P>
    <P>There are very dramatic rates of growth in certain areas like chemicals but there are other areas where performance is bad.  In other words, <Col N="72" /> there is an evolution going on in our industry.  It is an evolution where the usually overseas-owned, high technology intensive, very modern, efficient firms are doing extremely well, but there are other sections in our industry inside these brilliant figures that are doing badly.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that it is crucial to maintain the rate of investment if we are to maintain this export growth at the rate which everyone wishes.  It seems to me further that there are two essential conditions.  From my own experience I would identify two prime determinants more important from the investors' point of view than the grants&mdash; export tax relief and the existence of reasonable labour relations. Those were the two things that investors wanted to know about and they have been under threat very publicly in the recent past.  I will say no more than that at this stage except that continuing investment attention to those is crucial.</P>
    <P>I cannot stop wearing a hat that I had been wearing for a number of years, so perhaps the House will bear with me if I take up a point made by Senator Lambert and gratuitously offer some advice to the new Minister. I hope he will not resent it.  I offer it in the hope of being helpful.  It is perfectly natural that there should be competition and contention between Departments in Government.  Any organisation worth a damn defends its borders and pushes them out a bit when it gets a chance.  It is perfectly natural and proper that there should be a certain amount of friction, hopefully productive, between the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Industry and Commerce, but it is absolutely essential that the role of Industry and Commerce in Brussels and around the world in promoting exports is maintained.</P>
    <P>Since Ireland joined the European Community the role of the Department of Foreign Affairs mediating our relations with the Community has been greatly enhanced in importance and the tendency of the vigorous, effective people within that Department is to try to replicate the work of every <Col N="73" /> Department in Government and to produce their sections of experts for everything.  They have their economic group and their experts on foreign trade and industrial investment.</P>
    <P>The continued health and success of CTT, which I believe to be essential and to be closely related to the continued health and success of our exports, demands that the role of the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy be maintained in that area. I would offer my counsel, which is not in agreement with something a Fine Gael Deputy said in Dáil Éireann recently.  I do not think we need to see the strengthening of the Department of Foreign Affairs activity in these areas.  There is quite enough of that already.  They have their last to stick to.  They do it awfully well and they should be encouraged to stick to their last.</P>
    <P>The International role of CTT and of export agencies, answerable to and responding to the wishes of the Minister, and the work of the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy, should be maintained.  That seems to me to be extremely important.  Because of my previous job, I would offer that piece of obviously partisan advice to the new Minister.  Hopefully, he would look at it, whether he agrees with it or not, as advice offered on the basis of experience and in the desire to be helpful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that Córas Tráchtála are to be complimented. The officials are doing an excellent job.  Indeed, Córas Tráchtála, the manufacturers of exported goods and those who are exporting on behalf of manufacturers are playing an increasingly important role in improving life in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it is said often enough that we must export goods or export people.  Our situation is somewhat different from that of most other industrialised countries in that up to about seven or eight years ago we had a very high level of enforced emigration. The policy which has been evolving over the past 40 years has reached the point where industrial development has caught up with the need for <Col N="74" /> people to emigrate in order to earn their living.  It still must be brought home to all those involved in the employment side of industry, on the development side and to those on the workers' side that goods must be exported on an increasing level or those who cannot get employment will have to leave the country.</P>
    <P>The facts of life are that the rising standard of living has been dependent on increasing the level of exports.  A very good thing to note in the Minister's speech is the change in our situation <i>vis-a-vis</i> the percentage of our exports dependent on the United Kingdom market.  It is not for any political or historic reason that one should stress this.  It is important that a small economy such as ours should not have to rely on a single large market in the way we had to do.  One Senator has mentioned that in 1971 66 per cent of our total exports went to the UK. The Minister has indicated that this is now down to 46 per cent, a change of 20 per cent over a short period of five years.  I do not believe that those who were thinking in terms of expansion and employment even ten years ago would have hoped that such a level of success would be achieved so quickly.  Nevertheless, we need to keep on encouraging and facilitating the increase in exports, as this Bill is doing. We are not now anything like as dependent on one single market as we were heretofore and this situation puts us in a somewhat healthier and stronger position for the future.  Any fluctuations in that area which may come about in the months immediately ahead ought not to affect us as much as they might have if our level of exports to the UK were larger.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect of the statistics revealed by the Minister which should be mentioned at this stage and that is the extent to which our improvement in exports has resulted from membership of the European Community. Those who are today complaining so much about the shortcomings relating to membership ought to explain at the same time where increasing exports and increasing employment arising out of increasing exports might have come from if we had not become members <Col N="75" /> of that Community.  It was seen by many of us as an opportunity to expand industrial development.  From the facts emerging now it can be taken for granted that the policy was the right one.  That is entirely aside from the tremendous benefit to our agricultural sector from the European Community.</P>
    <P>Though it does not fall within the scope of this Bill, I might safely comment on the possible effects on exports of the rising value of the £ sterling. Senator Keating touched on this.  It is a very important factor for us.  It is quite obvious that the hardening of the £ sterling must affect our exports to some degree since our exports outside the sterling area will become more expensive and that must make it more difficult to maintain the level of exports to those areas.  That probably raises the whole question for discussion in the coming months of the advantages and disadvantages of our connection with sterling itself.  This is a matter on which we should have very broad discussion.  It is not the sort of question that should be talked of from emotional or idealogical springboards but rather from the pragmatic point of view as to how best our economy, as a competitive economy in the Western world, may be improved or disimproved by changes of this nature.  I do not think there is any question of serious consideration of this while we have a high level of inflation, but we should be considering it if our own level of inflation comes down anywhere near lower European levels.  However, that is merely one of the questions facing us in relation to exports.</P>
    <P>I would conclude by complimenting the officials of Córas Tráchtála and those manufacturers and the workers who are taking part in such a successful enterprise at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">

      <P>I should like to join the other Senators in supporting this Bill.  I have been a Member for seven years and in no case has a Bill asking for extra finance for semi-State bodies ever been opposed.  This is interesting because it shows the role which the semi-State <Col N="76" /> bodies play in our national life.</P>
      <P>It was important that the vacuum which was not being filled by private enterprise should be taken up early in the history of the State.  Looking back on the history of semi-State bodies, two people who played a crucial role were predecessors of Deputy O'Malley in his position as Minister for Industry and Commerce: Paddy McGilligan and Seán Lemass were instrumental in getting the first semi-State bodies off the ground and were responsible for greatly increasing the whole range of semi-State bodies.</P>
      <P>In general we look on semi-State bodies with a very great deal of favour.  The problems of extra finance are generally accepted and the Minister's figures are rarely queried.  I do not intend to query them, and I am unable to do so, but in dealing with a body of this nature it is difficult for the layman to get things into context. It is difficult for me to disentangle the functions of the IDA, the ICC and Córas Tráchtála.  It is probably even more difficult for the man in the street to do so.  Not only do we have a function in attempting to judge the performance of semi-State bodies, but the semi-State bodies involved also have a duty in getting their message over to the public, because a considerable portion of the revenue which we collect in taxation goes to financing semi-State bodies.  This is not the case in other countries where private enterprise has a bigger section of the industrial cake. But that is the way it is here, and to assist us in our difficulties the last Administration set up a Joint Committee of the Oireachtas to oversee certain commercial semi-State bodies in their operations.  I would urge the Minister to reappoint that body as soon as he can and also to ensure a wide representation in doing so, not forgetting the Independent Members of the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As people have pointed out, Córas Tráchtála play an essential role in assisting our exporters.  One of the happy features of Córas Tráchtála is that they assist the smaller exporter as much as the bigger operator, represented perhaps by Senator Lambert.  I know some of the small operators in almost <Col N="77" /> one- or two-man institutions who produce goods, sometimes craft goods and other specialised operations.  Córas Tráchtála have been tremendously helpful to them in setting up export opportunities, in introducing them to buyers, in showing them markets and in fulfilling a function which a small person is quite unable to do by himself. It is important to have a Government agency.  It is important that they should not forget our small operators because small industries play a very important role in our industrial life. The industrial structure shows this if one looks at any table and I am glad to compliment Córas Tráchtála on not forgetting the small man.</P>
    <P>People have mentioned the problems of exporting to Eastern Europe and I should like to mention another problem to the Minister.  I am sure he knows about it, but I have heard rumours about Ireland not getting a fair crack of the whip in the operation of the Lomé Convention, that there is some hold-up in Brussels and that we have not got our fair cut when it comes to opportunities under the Lomé Convention covering trade between the EEC and the developing countries.  I hope that the Minister will do what he can to rectify this, because we have a lot to offer the developing countries and our relationship could be a two-way one.</P>
    <P>It is worth while to point out that the man who was chief executive of Córas Tráchtála up to recently now holds the very important position of industrial ambassador &mdash; I suppose you could call him that &mdash; on behalf of the EEC to Nigeria.  He is ensuring that Lomé Convention conditions are carried out between Nigeria and the EEC.  He made an outstanding contribution as head of Córas Tráchtála. The fact that our senior executives are recognised in this way gives us a handle for ensuring that we get fair treatment in Brussels when it comes to the awarding of contracts under the conventions which we operate <i>via</i> the EEC, and certainly Córas Tráchtála would be interested in this.</P>
    <P>There is one final point which I should like to make to the Minister because it worries me as an educationalist. <Col N="78" /> It is a matter in which I have fallen down.  When we are talking about exports to countries apart from Britain and the US, we are generally talking about countries whose language is not the same as either of our official languages, and I have often thought that we are linguistically behind compared to our competitors from the Continent.  There one meets people whose basic language is, perhaps, French and they speak four or five other languages effortlessly.  We have inherited the Anglo-Saxon tradition of linguistic isolation, and more direction from the Government at the top would be helpful in making people realise how important it is to be able to converse in the basic foreign languages if we are to compete abroad.  I know Córas Tráchtála would have an interest in this and the encouragement which should come from the top and filter down through the educational system could only be of considerable benefit to our exporters and any of our citizens engaged in overseas trade.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to join with other Senators in welcoming this Bill. The only contribution that Members of the Seanad can make is to welcome the Bill and hope that the extra finance should strengthen Córas Tráchtála.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of us realise that marketing on a world scale is a serious undertaking. With the increase in the volume of exports resulting, mainly from the efforts of Córas Tráchtála, it is reasonable to expect that they must have funds to carry on and expand business.  It is probably right to say that there is duplication or that one could recognise duplication in some areas.  We have a marketing organisation for some of our agricultural produce, but Córas Tráchtála have to cover a very competitive market.  They run up against many marketing organisations that do not stick to the rules, as we expect Córas Tráchtála would adhere to them.  I am thinking mainly of countries whose goods are labelled and relabelled a second and third time.  Some of these goods find their way to our own country.  These <Col N="79" /> are the kind of tactics that Córas Tráchtála have to compete against. All of us are very conscious of this and we offer our sincere congratulations and help and support to Córas Tráchtála at this time.  I certainly think that they do a wonderful job. There is a heavy task ahead of them because Ireland is increasing production.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that we encourage Córas Tráchtála to put more emphasis on agricultural produce.  This is an area where we can expand our production. I am thinking of milk products and the whole agricultural scene.  We are bound to have a market if Córas Tráchtála can have the strength to explore the world markets. They could make a great contribution to our economy and improve our exports of agricultural produce.  Everybody welcomes the extra funds that have been made available and we have no doubt that the results will be beneficial to the Irish producer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PierceButler" hpid="Mr. Butler Mr. Butler">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Minister and welcome him to the Seanad.  Second congratulations should be to Córas Tráchtála for the wonderful work they have been doing over the years.  Our exports are now worth £2,000 million.  The main things that Córas Tráchtála would be looking for are quality and the cost of the product, and these are the two things about which I would like to speak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all I would like to appeal to those people who are demanding salaries and wages above what can be paid.  I appeal to them because wages are a large element in the cost of a product, and if we do not have common sense and accept some type of national wage agreement then we are in trouble.  Córas Tráchtála will also be in trouble.  People concerned must realise that unless we are able to sell the product the jobs will not be there for them.  I take this opportunity to appeal to all concerned to come back to the situation where common sense prevails.  Common sense is going out the window at this time and we have <Col N="80" /> heard of large industries such as Ferenka closing down.  I appeal to all concerned in the unions to think seriously of what they are doing.  We need our exports.  We need companies to come here and set up industries. From those industries we can gain exports.</P>
    <P>I should like also to talk about the quality of the product.  It is not just the by-products that make the quality; it is the work that goes in that really produces the quality.  We are second to none in this regard.  Some of our people do not carry out work as it should be carried out.  The main reason is that we are lacking education in that field.  I should like to take this opportunity of congratulating AnCo on the training they are giving.  That type of training is necessary.  We need it so that the products we export will be of a high calibre.</P>
    <P>I should like also to mention promotion. Unless we have promotion outside the country then we cannot have the amount of sales that are possible. I should like to ask Córas Tráchtála to combine with the other export agencies and draw up some kind of scheme under which the agencies would have the opportunity to discuss with each other the best means of export.  We have, as Senator McGowan said, exports of agricultural produce, and I am sure Bord Bainne and CBF are doing an excellent job. It would be no harm to encourage CTT, Bord Bainne and the other export organisations to get together from time to time and discuss this problem. We are entirely dependent on our exports.  Any surplus we produce is for the export market.  Anything we can sell on the export market will be to the monetary benefit of everyone concerned.  I again congratulate Córas Tráchtála on the work they have done over the past number of years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelMulcahy" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Os rud é gurb é seo an chéad ócáid a thug mise óráid san Seanad ba mhaith liom comhgháirdeas a dhéanamh leatsa, a Chathaoirleach, as ucht an obair trom atá agat anseo agus ba mhaith liom freisin mo chomhgháirdeas a ghabháil leis an Aire agus fáilte a chur roimhe.  Is mó an áthas <Col N="81" /> a chuireann sé orm é sin a dhéanamh os as Luimneach mé féin, cosúil leis an Aire.  Tuigim go bhfuil ceangal éigin ag an iar-Aire Tionscail agus Tráchtála le Luimneach freisin.  Tá súil agam go bhféadfaimse mo chuidse a dhéanamh ar son tionscail agus tráchtála i Luimneach.  Buntáiste mór amach agus amach is ea é aon airgead is féidir linn a chur le heaspórtáil. Gach cuid den straitéis tionsclaíochta atá againn, braitheann sé ar easpórtáil.</P>
      <P>I should like to elaborate on that point.  Our entire industrial strategy depends on a successful export strategy.  If I have any point to make here at all, it is this.  While congratulating Córas Tráchtála on doing an excellent job it would be remiss of me if I let the opportunity go without saying to the Minister that I believe the effort is not big enough.  It is worth while to analyse the underlying mechanism behind this.  It is a simple matter.  We need 15,000 jobs in manufacturing industry every year in order to achieve our employment target.  Those 15,000 new jobs require about £14,000 gross output per new person taken on in a factory &mdash; about £200 million extra of output each year.  That £200 million can only go outwards through exports, because our home market is not big enough to consume that type of output. In other words, that £200 million must be sold abroad.  That means that something like 1,000 extra salesmen are required to sell abroad.</P>
      <P>I am putting it to the Minister that Córas Tráchtála should be encouraged to put more and more people out there selling and that grants should be made available to them.  If necessary the full salaries of the salesmen should be made available in the short-term because they will be required. An expansion rate of 50 per cent&mdash; say, 47 per cent&mdash;is needed to sustain the natural growth of the existing situation.  The extra £200 million which I mentioned earlier represents another 12 per cent growth.  This requires a massive export effort, and even that is not going far enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, I have great pleasure in supporting the terms of this Bill and asking that there should be no cut <Col N="82" /> back whatsoever, no skimping of money spent on exports.  Our lives and the future of the country depend on a strong competitive Irish sales force in Europe and the world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>He would be a brave man who would stand up now to criticise Córas Tráchtála.  I am not that brave. I just want to make a couple of points. To what extent do Córas Tráchtála go in helping the shoe industry in Ireland? More than 2,000 jobs have been lost in the industry and footwear imports account for 70 per cent of the home market.  If you go around any of these markets, apart from the retail outputs, there is little but imported shoe and leather on sale.  A lot of it comes from the Eastern bloc.  Prices are not low, so it cannot be the prices. Because of the 2,000 lost jobs in the shoe industry I would urge the Minister to see if Córas Tráchtála could make a special effort with their aids and services in this area.</P>
      <P>The clothing industry is in a similar situation.  The number of jobs lost there through increased imports is also very substantial.  I should like to know if something specific could be done. There might be other areas which need special attention and it is up to other people to highlight them.  I should like to highlight those two areas because they are small in comparison with other groups who get support.  At the moment we export cattle on the hoof.  We have no proposals to discontinue that because it would create other problems.  However, we have a shoe industry which is gradually being eroded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>The £4.3 million which it is estimated Córas Tráchtála will get in grants this year seems to be good value for money in the value of exports for the country.  However, if we look into the figures a little closer we find that the cost of running Córas Tráchtála in 1976 was £3.7 million.  That represents half a million of an increase on the previous year, 1975.  It is interesting to ask how much of this extra cost is due to inflation and salary increases and how much is due to expansion in most of the activities of CTT.  If we look at <Col N="83" /> the figures for 1975 and 1976 we can gain some light on this matter.  In 1975 the grant was £3.1 million; in 1976 this had gone up by half a million pounds.  Bearing in mind that half a million pounds increase, we find that product development, trade fairs, exhibitions and publicity increased by only £15,000 that year.  Market research and design went up by £100,000.  Trade promotion tours and general travel went up by £40,000 odd. Salaries and allowances, rents and rates and office expenses amounted to almost a quarter of a million.  In other words, half of the increase in 1976 is represented by salaries, allowances and office running expenses.  To me the figure for product development and trade fairs, which seem to be an essential part of any promotions drive, was most miserable and I wonder if CTT could increase the amount of their expenditure under that heading.</P>
      <P>However, when one compares a cost of £4.3 million with a total export value of £1,800 million in 1976 &mdash; a figure expected to reach almost £2,500 million in 1977&mdash; it seems good value for money.  How much of the increase can be attributed directly to the efforts of CTT is the important question.  We must remember that once markets are obtained by exporting industries there is a likelihood that those markets can be retained by those industries if a certain momentum is sustained.  I would look on the job of CTT as that of pioneering new markets, resurrecting lapsed markets and trying to correct adverse balances of trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two paragraphs in the 1976 CTT annual report on which I should like to dwell.  The first is in regard to the UK market.  Here CTT anticipate a reduction in the provision of promotional services in the UK.  What they are aiming for is to concentrate on the provision of group promotional services and to cut down on some of the services to individual firms.  I wonder if this is wise, because the UK market in the past three or four years has been a weakened market due to a certain endemic weakness in its own economy.  Recent reports indicate that <Col N="84" /> they will have an upsurge in their economy.  Therefore, I wonder if we are wise to contemplate a cut in any part of our promotional activities or services in the UK.  The UK market represents, and will for a long time to come, a very considerable part of the markets open to our exporters.  Even though the percentage has fallen from about 64 per cent to 48 per cent in the last ten-year period, we still look on the UK market as taking the bulk of our exports.</P>
    <P>The other paragraph deals mainly with promotional activities in Eastern Europe and what is referred to as the less than proportionate return for the amount that has been expended in finance and effort on promotion in Eastern Europe, with the exception of Poland and Yugoslavia.  Eastern Europe is a most peculiar export market.  It is unlike any market in any of the Western democracies and we therefore must put extra promotional efforts into such places.  We have set up in recent years a number of Embassies in countries where ten years ago we would never have contemplated setting them up.  I do not know if the criteria which has been adopted by the CTT, namely the financial returns coming from their effort, would justify our pulling out of those markets.  We should put in more effort to try to obtain a foothold in that area.</P>
    <P>In talking about the activities of CTT we must remember not to confuse what CTT present as being the export attainments with what individual industries put in themselves, because it was their willingness and determination in the first place to go into the export market which resulted in the outstanding figures we have before us today.  We must also remember the part the IDA have played in all this.  Their foresight in going into what were export-oriented industries is beginning to pay off because a large number of those industries are beginning to come on stream and they will increase their export values in coming years.</P>
    <P>CTT should perhaps look a little more closely not at the overall features of the year's export figures but at what they should attempt to do to create <Col N="85" /> markets, and to resurrect lapsed markets and to try and correct adverse balances of trade.  That is the true test of the success or otherwise of CTT.  I do not want to take any credit from what they have done.  As I said, an expenditure of £4 million in this day and age on market promotion for our country is a minimum amount. We should look to increasing that amount, particularly in regard to promotional activities.  Too much to me appears to be taken up by ordinary administrative expenses.  We should try to devote more funds to trade fairs, exhibitions and other forms of publicity.</P>
    <P>The high percentage of our total exports going to the UK has been referred to.  We accept that is so, that we had in the past too many of our eggs in that basket.  While the EEC percentage has increased, I notice that the USA and Canadian percentage has fallen from 12.9 per cent to 8 per cent in the ten years from 1966 to 1976.  Is there any overall reason for this?  Why is there this percentage fall as against an increase to EFTA and the EEC countries?</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the CTT on their work to help our economy.  I hope we will see an increase in the amounts which the Exchequer is prepared to give to the work of CTT.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a few points concerning what Senator West said regarding the acquisition of continental languages by men and women in our exporting business community. I am aware that CTT and AnCO are involved in the provision of language courses but acquiring a new language gets more difficult the older one becomes.  It is necessary to begin with children.  We have neglected the study of continental languages.  As a long term proposition I would hope that Córas Tráchtála and the Department of Foreign Affairs might consider developing a programme in cooperation with the schools, financially and academically, in the study of languages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Boys' schools in particular have neglected languages.  It seems to have <Col N="86" /> been a tradition both in Ireland and England that boys did not learn continental languages whereas girls did. I speak with some knowledge of this because I ran courses in modern European languages for Irish business people.  It was very sad to see so many senior men so regretful of the fact that they had not got a European language. They felt it was a big disadvantage against their European competitors both in prestige and in practical matters.  They had neither the time nor the energy to learn languages at that late stage.  Perhaps some of the extra £20 million might be devoted to a research programme on the question of languages.</P>

      <P>I thank the House for the welcome which has been given to the Bill, and the various Senators who extended their personal good wishes to me, not least from my predecessor.  I appreciate it very much. It augurs well for the new Seanad that in a little more than an hour we heard 13 Senators speak.  Perhaps the good example will float down the corridor. Even those who have graduated from another place have learned the good habits of the Seanad very quickly.  Because so many points were made so quickly I am not certain that I can deal with every one of them individually but I will try to deal with all the major points made and perhaps those I overlook I can deal with privately afterwards, if necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made by Senator Keating and others to the situation <i>vis-a-vis</i> the Comecon countries.  I expressed my views on that point in the Dáil on 13th October at column 374 of the Dáil Official Report.  I have nothing to add to those views, which still stand.  As a result of what I said in the Dáil on that occasion I understand the Soviet Embassy issued a very lengthy statement of which Córas Tráchtála and CBF disputed the accuracy.  I join with them in disputing the accuracy of the lenghty statement that was provoked from the Soviet Embassy.  However, I intend that the pressure in this regard should be kept up and I am not without hope that there will be some developments which <Col N="87" /> will make it worth our while trying to keep trade contacts open with Eastern Europe.  This might, if developed sufficiently, result in our not withdrawing the trade representation which we have had there for some years past but which has paid so very little in terms of results in the past four or five years.  I will not say any more on that point, but I hope there will be developments shortly which will make it worth our while to remain interested in this Eastern European market.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators, including Senator Lambert, referred to the role of the Department of Foreign Affairs in trade promotion, and Senator Keating suggested that perhaps they should not have a dominant role or seek to take over CTT's functions in this respect.  I do not think there would be any question of that or that that was suggested.  I would not feel happy if they should try to do it, but I do not think there would be any danger that they would try.  CTT's attitude is that they are very happy to co-operate with the Department of Foreign Affairs in the promotion of trade, as I think the Department of Foreign Affairs are happy to co-operate with CTT.  This is particularly so where CTT do not have representation but the Department of Foreign Affairs do.</P>
    <P>However, I think it is fair to make the observation in general terms that our Department of Foreign Affairs traditionally have not placed the same importance on foreign trade as some other countries have.  The reason is partly explained by the fact that we have a foreign trade promotion body which a number of other countries do not have.  For that reason our Department of Foreign Affairs do not have to engage to the same extent as the foreign service of other countries, but nonetheless I would hope that this cooperation will not alone continue but will intensify and grow.</P>
    <P>In particular, I have in mind parts of the world where we do not have CTT representation &mdash; for example, the entire continent of South America.  We have there one embassy, in Argentina. <Col N="88" /> One would like to think that an Embassy in that situation would be able to make a fairly major contribution to the development of trade between the various countries of South America and Ireland.</P>
    <P>Senator Lambert pointed out that we do not have trade representation in Northern Ireland.  It is certainly a point that I will bring to the attention of CTT, but I think it is only fair to say at this stage that although Northern Ireland is a comparatively important export market for us, it is a market which can be serviced by all our exporters and potential exporters without any great difficulty.  Potential buyers in Northern Ireland speak the same language as we do.  We can get them on the telephone when the telephones are working.  We use the same banks and we share the same island. The difficulties of doing business with them are minute compared with our difficulties in doing business with the Middle East or in the Far East, where language barriers, geographical distances and totally different fundamental customs and ways of doing business render it extremely difficult for the average Irish small exporter operating on his own to make an impact on those markets.  He can make a major impact without any great assistance on the Northern Ireland market.</P>
    <P>The fact that CTT do not have an office there is not therefore indicative of any lack of interest on their part in the Northern Ireland market.  It is simply a recognition that the need for an office there is a great deal less than it is in some of the more remote parts of the world, in particular in the non-English speaking countries.  This language difficulty which we labour under was adverted to by a number of Senators, I think quite rightly.  It is a serious disadvantage which we have, more so than any other European country.  We tend not to be able to speak any language other than our own and this has frightened off many of our people who could otherwise have done a fairly lucrative export market from trying to get into markets outside Britain, and this is one of the reasons that we have historically <Col N="89" /> been so very heavily dependent on Britain.</P>
    <P>Though a large proportion of our trade is with Britain, a comparatively small proportion of our CTT representation is there.  This is for the same reason that we have not representation in Northern Ireland.  The need for assistance to our exporters to the British market is not at all as acute because they do not encounter the kind of difficulties that they encounter elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Senator McGowan suggested that CTT might make a greater effort to sell agricultural products abroad.  The position is that traditionally, and by agreement with the various bodies concerned, CTT, except in an indirect way, have not tried to promote agricultural products abroad.  There are other semi-State bodies, which in some cases are extremely successful, in other cases perhaps less so, engaged in selling Irish agricultural produce abroad.  In particular, Bord Bainne come to mind as the outstanding example in that area.  Their ability to sell Irish milk products throughout the entire world at competitive prices in an open market is very commendable.  They are to be congratulated on the fact that they have been able almost entirely to avoid the fall-back position of intervention when it has come to selling Irish milk products abroad.  The CBF have less power in this respect and I do not think it is fair to compare the two bodies for that reason.  One would hope that CBF's functions and ability to sell will be increased and that they will be given a greater opportunity than they have had up to now to promote the direct sale by them of Irish beef abroad.  The Pigs and Bacon Commission also have been a very successful body in selling pigmeat in various markets abroad.</P>
    <P>The attitude of CTT is that the primary responsibility lies with those boards and it would be wrong of CTT in any sense to seek to muscle in.  However, I myself saw in the past couple of months at the trade fair in Cologne, which is one of the principal food fairs in the world, the way these boards cooperated with CTT and <i>vice versa</i> in the promotion of Irish food produce. <Col N="90" /> The Irish national stand there was organised by CTT, and various other bodies concerned were represented on it.  Collectively it was a very successful effort with a high degree of co-operation between the various interests concerned, so much so that many people there said that they wished all these various bodies and interests could co-operate as well at home as they did abroad. CTT will continue to co-ordinate work of that kind and give all the assistance they can to the agricultural processing industry.</P>
    <P>Senator West made reference to the Lomé Convention and to the Irish benefits, or lack of benefits, from the funds made available there.  It is worth setting out briefly the position in regard to that.  There are three different headings under which firms here can benefit from the funds provided by the EEC under the Lomé Convention.  The first two of these are by means of works contracts and supply contracts and these constitute 84 per cent of the fund.  They are awarded by public tender and there can be no question therefore of Ireland being given by prior arrangement a certain percentage of them. They have to be won in competition with other Community countries and, possibly, companies from outside the Community.  They have to be won on the basis of competitive tender and we have no control over that situation.</P>
    <P>On the question of consultancy work, to which 16 per cent approximately of the fund is devoted, a small number of Irish firms so far have got major consultancy work and quite a number of these have been short listed in Brussels.  One is hopeful that the numbers in this respect will increase fairly soon.  I am also hopeful that Irish firms who have won major competitive contracts in the Middle East, for example, will very shortly be able to achieve similar success in the contracts that are being awarded by tender under the Lomé Convention arrangements.</P>
    <P>Senator Harte made reference to the footwear and clothing industries and felt that CTT could perhaps make a bigger contribution to the unemployment <Col N="91" /> situation that has arisen in those industries in recent years, particularly since the advent of free trade.  It should be realised that exports are increasing significantly in those fields and that a high proportion of production in those sectors are now exported. I have not got the latest figures for the ten months of 1977 but in 1975 our exports of footwear were £9.6 million; in 1976, £12.3 million and the trend for this year appears to indicate a continuing growth, notwithstanding the difficulties we are under.  The trend in textiles is the same because exports have increased from £79 million in 1975 to £118.3 million in 1976.</P>
    <P>This morning I met a deputation from the Irish footwear industry, representatives of the unions and the firms concerned, and we discussed these problems in some detail.  I am familiar with the problems and certainly will give any assistance I can.  In the course of the discussion I urged strongly on the people present that the best future for the footwear industry, to my mind, appeared to lie in export markets.  I am very much at one with Senator Harte in advocating that again this afternoon.  We have had an unfortunate situation in that 73 per cent of our home market in footwear is now accounted for by imports.  The figure was about 35 per cent before our entry into the EEC.  Nonetheless about 80 per cent of those imports, of leather shoes at any rate, are from the UK.  They are not from the Far Eastern countries which are frequently blamed for these difficulties.  Quite bluntly, there is not a great deal we can do about imports from the United Kingdom, whether it is of shoes or anything else.</P>
    <P>The industry may well come round to the view &mdash; many of them already have&mdash;that its greatest hope for the future is in a positive policy of exports rather than trying to regain a higher proportion of what is a very tiny home market.  We have only 3.1 million people and that was our home market in everything until 1st January, 1973. The great thing that happened from 1st January, 1973, is that our home market is today 260 million people. If one goes into a common market one <Col N="92" /> has to accept at least the competition of one's fellow members of that common market.  On balance we have benefited enormously by being in a common market.  We have given our own people the opportunity to expand which they never had before and we have had the opportunity since 1973 to create employment on a very wide scale, something we never had when we were trying to sell to three million people.</P>
    <P>While I know it is difficult for industries like the footwear and clothing industries to adapt as rapidly as one would wish them to adapt to this fundamental change, some of the firms are adapting and have done so extremely well.  One footwear firm, for example, in Kilkenny is now exporting more than 80 per cent of its output and is increasing its output enormously each year.  Of course, it is also increasing its employment considerably as well.  That is where the future is and where the stability of employment will lie in firms of that kind.  I hope smaller firms can be helped and encouraged to develop in the same way and not to think of the potential market for footwear as simply 3.1 million people in the Republic of Ireland but to think of it as 260 million people in Western Europe.</P>
    <P>Senator Mulcahy very forcibly made the point that there is a tremendous connection between exports and jobs. That is something many of us tend to overlook because we do not see the connection at first sight.  There is no doubt that a high proportion of employment in Ireland today exists only because the firms giving that employment are selling abroad.  If they were to lose their export markets the employment would be gone.  For a country &mdash; I come back again to our minute population by comparison with so many of our neighbours &mdash; of 3.1 million people, the future of employment and growth lies almost exclusively in the export market.  One cannot emphasise that too much. Where we are anxious to increase employment, we must in the same breath in practice almost invariably be anxious to increase exports too.</P>
    <P>Senator Mulcahy referred to the need to have more Irish men and <Col N="93" /> women abroad actually selling.  There is a small side to CTT's operation, which was not referred to in today's debate in this House, but which I referred to in the Dáil and which is, perhaps, worth referring briefly to here, and that is the Irish Export Agency.  It was established a few years ago to go out and do the actual job of direct selling which CTT have not done traditionally because they have been a promotion body rather than a direct selling body.  That agency was started a few years ago on a limited scale on behalf of very small firms in distant markets, mainly the Far and Middle East.  It has been extremely successful and I have &mdash; as I said in the Dáil &mdash; encouraged CTT to think in terms of expanding it without interfering with their basic objectives as a promotional body.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is right that Irish exporters or potential exporters should get the idea that because there is a public export board here the whole question of selling abroad should be dumped on to that board with the kind of attitude: &ldquo;Let the Government do it; exporting is something for the State to do.&rdquo;  That is not so and CTT would not wish that impression to go abroad.  The primary effort to to sell abroad must be the effort of the companies themselves.  CTT will give every assistance available to them in that effort but the primary moves in that regard must come from the companies.</P>
    <P>I recognise, and CTT do, that it is not always feasible for a very small Irish operation to sell in a distant market and in what to them is often a very difficult market with language and travel difficulties and totally different customs in every sense of the word from what we have here.  Where very small firms are involved it is a very good thing that there should be some selling agency for them.  There is another selling agency, something on the lines of the Irish Export Agency, which was set up in which the State have a 20 per cent interest and four major firms in Ireland have a 20 per cent interest also.  That has not got off the ground as quickly as one would wish but I hope it will increase its <Col N="94" /> activities in the years to come and that it will perform the same kind of function as the Irish Export Agency is. There is no question of their being in competition with one another.  The world is big enough for the two of them to co-exist and proper for the benefit of all others.</P>
    <P>I have covered some of the main points made in the debate and I do not wish to delay the House by going into any of the other points in any great detail but before I conclude it is appropriate that I should at this stage &mdash; although it was not mentioned by any Senators in the debate &mdash; make reference to the recent refloating of the pound sterling and the effect it might have on Irish exports.  The situation is not a serious one from the point of view of exports.  Obviously, some of our exports are not directly helped by this.  They are marginally put at a disadvantage; but I would not like exporters, or the public at large, to feel that Irish export industries were in any sense seriously damaged by what happened in Britain on Monday and Tuesday.  There are, of course, some obvious advantages to us in other areas.  The inflationary situation will be marginally helped in the long run by the floating upwards of the pound as against the other currencies.  However, so far as exports are concerned, a little over 45 per cent of our exports are into the sterling area anyway.  To start off with they are not in any way affected, notwithstanding the statement the other night by a prominent Member of the Labour Party to the effect that our exports to Britain were put at a disadvantage.  Something over 45 per cent, therefore, of our exports are in no way affected by this and we must think of something less than 55 per cent which potentially could be affected.</P>
    <P>The revaluation has been something in the region of 4 per cent or a little above that, but it does not necessarily follow that our products in the 54 or 55 per cent non-sterling area will have the full impact of that passed on to them.  The first reason for that is that a lot of our exporting manufacturers are already quoting and selling in the currency of the market rather than in <Col N="95" /> sterling and they are not going to be directly put at any disadvantage at all.  The revaluation is comparatively small and in many cases it will not be found necessary to pass it on either by the wholesalers or distributors.  In some cases some of the manufacturers can absorb the difference, having had the benefit of movement in the opposite direction over the past couple of years.</P>
    <P>In summary, therefore, I do not think our exporters need feel that any serious damage is done to them because while the £ is today at 1.86 dollars approximately, which seems quite a long way away from 1.58 dollars as it was for a few days 14 months ago, nonetheless, at 1.86 dollars our exporters are in a much stronger position than they were, say, two-and-a-half years ago when the £ was standing at well over 2 dollars.  As the House is aware it stood at that, or at higher figures, for a long period. We are still at an advantage relative to the situation as it existed two or two-and-a-half years ago.  Therefore, our export figures which have been very good over the past couple of years and which have been helped by the movement against sterling, will not be jeopardised to any significant degree by the relatively small movement in favour of sterling.  I referred to this in my reply to the Dáil debate as reported in the Official Report, column 373 of 13th October and I indicated that I thought this might happen and that it was something we would have to bear in mind.  It has happened now, but the volume of effective revaluation has not been so great as to create any major problem for the great majority of our exporters.</P>
    <P>I should like to thank the Seanad for the welcome given to the Bill and for the useful, constructive and helpful speeches made on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of the debate on Second Stage I indicated that I was somewhat concerned about the nature of the guaranteeing powers of the Minister and that I would consider putting down recommendations for the amendment of the Ministerial power of guaranteeing by way of strengthening that power.  But by virtue of that fact I had to conclude that any such recommendation would be ruled out of order, either in the case of an extension of the time as coming from an ordinary Member of this House, or as being beyond the scope of the Bill, which in this section proposes merely to amend in one particular only the relevant section of the Principal Act.  However, that conclusion that it would be otiose for me to put down recommendations which would cast a burden on the officers of the House in circulating what would then be found to be disorderly, does not make it undesirable for me to make a few further brief comments developing what I said on Second Stage in relation to this section.</P>
      <P>There are two points in general. The first is this question of the duration of the power of the ministerial guarantee.  So far as I know it is only in relation to the dairy produce code that there is a time limit placed on the ministerial power of guarantee.  That may derive from the fact that in a sense An Bord Bainne was a sort of a contrivance forced upon us by virtue of EEC requirements.  It is in essential nature a voluntary body.  A view may have been taken in some Department with regard to this that there ought to be a time limit in the case of a ministerial guarantee of such a body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the point of view of a democracy it is desirable that the reasons for a decision be given.  We have here a situation where An Bord <Col N="97" /> Bainne in fact is the agent, to use a less general term, the parent to use another general term, of an industry of very considerable significance to the country.  A figure of the contribution to the exports of this country which can be confidently enough given represented by dairy produce is 15 per cent of the total exports.  There is reason to infer&mdash;not necessarily from what the Minister has said either in this House or the other House, but it is possible to make such an inference from what his predecessor said in the other House &mdash; that the views of the Departments of Agriculture and Finance on this matter may not be in unison.  The more I think about the manner in which our affairs are conducted I am forced to the conclusion that one of the most pernicious doctrines that lies at the heart of our political affairs is the one of collective responsibility, a splendid device whereby the real argument is concealed from the democracy which is to be guided by the decision.</P>
    <P>I should like to know why, when we have An Bord Bainne in the conduct of foreign marketing, in particular in relation to the exporting of the dairy produce surplus of this country, with a five year plan to cope with the potential increase of 200 million tons of milk, it is decided that the guarantee should be for two years only.  That means that the guaranteeing power can be of use only in relation to 1978 and 1979.  It cannot be of any use for 1980 and 1981.  The Minister will have to come back to the Dáil and then to this House to get his strength and power to cope with the latter two years of the five-year plan of this agency which is so significant and important for this industry.</P>
    <P>I should like to know a reason for that.  The Minister will have to come back for certain.  Why should he put himself in that position?  If it is correct to say that the guaranteeing power of the Minister is central to the affair of the financing of An Bord Bainne's plan why should he put himself in the position that he cannot now exercise the power which will give confidence to An Bord Bainne, and its members, confidence to the financiers of An Bord Bainne, confidence which will <Col N="98" /> enhance the ability of the board and its status with foreign purchasers and foreign dealers rather than postpone that particular item?  It is within the Minister's power, as I understand the Rules of this House, to propose that that date be changed from 1979 to 1981, though it is not within my power.</P>
    <P>With regard to the status of the guarantee, Senator Whitaker, who made a short but notable contribution to the Second Reading of this Bill, spoke of the guarantee playing the part of equity finance with regard to the financing of An Bord Bainne.  With regard to that equity finance, properly understood it must inevitably mean that the equity is generally available for all the purposes of the body for which it is subscribed and that it lies at the rear of all creditors.  In this case a guarantee of An Bord Bainne is not available for all the purposes.  A guarantee in this case can be for a loan only; it cannot be for borrowings of another character; it cannot be for general indebtedness; it can be for a loan only for a particular purpose, for the acquisition of dairy produce.</P>
    <P>It is common case and it is known that the five-year plan of An Bord Bainne involves increased financing of expenditure for marketing, for the taking of positions in foreign areas where the exports may go to, and that the plan involves the diversification of product to gear in with the estimates An Bord Bainne make as to what range of products will fit the particular market.  It is in fact the position of a guarantor that he does not lie in the rear of other creditors.  A guarantor at the end of the day can prove in the liquidation with the other creditors, and he is not an equity holder in that sense or in any sense.  In the sense that this is a voluntary body, a ministerial guarantee has that general sense of strengthening the body in its international appearance, giving it stature it would not otherwise have.</P>
    <P>It is immensely important that the guarantee be such that the financiers who are going to rely on it will know precisely how far it can be relied on. In this case we know that the mere acquisition of dairy products is only <Col N="99" /> one of the functions for which the finance is required.  There is nothing the Minister can do.  He can give no assurance whatever beyond the powers that are given to him in the statute which at the end of the day will stand up against a claim being made on that guarantee if the moneys guaranteed have not been used in the manner and for the purpose for which alone they can be used under the section.</P>
    <P>I recognise the Minister cannot be expected at this Stage &mdash; it would not even be orderly for him to propose amendments of the Principal Acts &mdash; to get rid of these impediments in the deficiencies as I see them.  I may be wrong and, if I am, I will be glad to be corrected.  I would invite him very seriously to consider whether there is any merit in what I have said and, if there is, when he does bring in more comprehensive legislation with regard to an Bord Bainne will he take note of this?</P>
    <P>I would suggest a thought of a general character and end with that. We have just had a debate on export promotion from which I learned a good deal, but I thought it was nonsense to assume in the course of that debate that the expenditure we were approving for Corás Tráchtála had any particular relationship with the generation of exports generally. I submit that the generation of exports generally relates to two other matters. It relates to the existence of a tax relief and to the success of the Industrial Development Authority in procuring industries interested in taking advantage of our whole marketing position.  The Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy has told us that the home market was now expanded to around 160 million people.</P>
    <P>In the case of An Bord Bainne we have a most interesting potential.  We have a structure which might be seen to be analogous to the type of structure that exists, for example, in Japan. We have already at the top of the industry a leader capable of taking a planned view of the entire industry, where it can possibly serve as a model for a similar type of institution in <Col N="100" /> relation to other industries.  There is a whole range of specialised industries in which this would not be true, but another reason for strengthening the powers of An Bord Bainne is to see how far it can prove itself to be a leader in other fields of Irish enterprise and industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CLambert" hpid="Mr. Lambert Mr. Lambert">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lambert</NameTxt>
      <P>No one is a greater admirer of Bord Bainne's marketing efforts over a great number of years, particularly as flag carriers with Waterford Glass in promoting the quality image of Irish products, but I have a comment to make about freedom to go beyond the promotion of dairy products.  I must remind the House that Bord Bainne among their ancillary activities now control two biscuit manufacturing industries in Great Britain and are importing biscuits into this country in competition with our national industry.  There are peaks and valleys in the financial requirements of the biscuit industry, just as there is in the dairy industry, and also in the requirements for working capital.  If these coincide then the total borrowing requirements of Bord Bainne Co-Op could be seen to be used to finance an industry which is competing at the expense of our local industry.  Any undermining of such Irish potential jobs must in no way be financed by the Irish taxpayer.  Under this Bill the amount is now increased to £40 million.  I feel that caution must be maintained in the guarantee of this public money and, as in this Bill, it should be limited to the purpose proposed and to the time span proposed by the Minister.  On this basis Bord Bainne have my utmost support.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>A small point relevant to section 2.  We all want to demonstrate our continued confidence in Bord Bainne for the work they are doing and have been doing, but there is one point I am not quite clear on, that is, the question of whether the Minister could make a recommendation for an extension of the duration. Frankly, I think the duration should be longer but I will come to that point in a moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said in his Second Stage speech that he hoped the board <Col N="101" /> would accelerate their efforts to build up their financial resources of their marketing agency.  I think they were the words he used.  He went on to explain that there was a gap between expenditure and income and that it had to be bridged by short-term borrowing.  This is the point I wanted to raise.  Does this type of borrowing not impede Bord Bainne in building up the resources of their marketing agency?  If so, would it not be better if, instead of resources being bled by short-term loans at high rates of interest, we extended the guarantee to 1982 to facilitate the objective of that company becoming self-reliant in this respect?  Would it not be better to recommend that the guarantee be extended to 1982 on condition that the type of borrowing they do between now and December, 1979, should not place this objective in jeopardy?  That sounds very simple but I am a simple man putting a simple point.  I hope the Minister can assist me on this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Gibbons) James Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Gibbons)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to begin by approaching the question of the duration of the guarantee.  One point that may have been lost sight of is the transformation that has taken place within Bord Bainne.  It is now a co-operative society.  It is precisely because the Government recognise the great importance of the dairy industry that last year the amount of the guarantee was doubled and under this amending Bill the period of that guarantee is being extended by two years.  I do not think it will be possible for the Government or any other Government to throw the door wide open in this business of guarantees to what could be deemed to be private concerns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of the dairy industry, with its history and its importance, there is no denying that the case for the specialised borrowing which is prescribed in the 1973 Act is necessary. On Bord Bainne's projections of the building up of their assets to increase their ability to deal with this problem of seasonal borrowings, of the ratio between the growth of their assets and the growth of the <Col N="102" /> industry, their need for borrowing will be improving.  I need hardly say that the Government will be keeping a constant eye on the progress of Bord Bainne and the dairy industry generally.  They are in constant contact with the board and I do not think there is an obligatory requirement that would require the Government to relate their period of guarantee to Bord Bainne's own five-year plan.  It is sufficient for the board to know, as they do, that the Government realise the vital importance of the industry and their very commendable efforts in the export markets, which were referred to both in this discussion and the discussion on the previous Bill.  Should a new need arise that would require adjustments to be made, the Government will always be ready and willing to consider these adjustments.</P>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald, as he did on the Second Stage, dwelt for some considerable length on the nature of the guarantee that is actually enshrined in the main Act.  As I said on the Second Stage, that Act is not before the House. The Bill now before the House simply deals with the extension of the period over which the guarantee is continued. It is for fairly specific purposes, having regard to the seasonal nature of our milk production-on the one hand and on the other the far more even pattern of sales carried out by Bord Bainne.  It is necessary for Bord Bainne to have this guarantee to enable them to purchase during the production season.  It is for that specific reason that the guarantee is being given.  Senator Harte raised a similar question on the period of the guarantee.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Faulkner) Padraig Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Faulkner)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since 1922 12 Bills have been enacted to provide capital for telephone development.  The Bill now before the House is the 13th in the series.  Like its predecessors, it is an enabling Bill.  Its purpose is briefly to empower the Minister for Finance to make further capital available for telephone development up to a limit of £350 million.</P>
      <P>With the exception of the amount provided for and a few minor drafting amendments, the text of the present Bill is the same as in the last Bill enacted in 1973.  It provided for advances of up to £175 million.  This figure represented the then estimated cost of meeting capital requirements during the period from mid-1973 to mid-1978. Advances made under the 1973 Act to a recent date have amounted to some £158 million.  The balance remaining under the Act will not be sufficient to complete this year's investment programme.  The need for a new Act now&mdash;instead of next year&mdash;is mainly due to the reduction in the value of the pound arising from the high rates of inflation experienced since 1973.</P>
      <P>Of the £158 million already drawn, £67 million was spent on subscribers installations and local distribution plant; £44 million on new exchange equipment; £34 million on the trunk system and £13 million on buildings, sites and miscellaneous works.  The total number of exchange lines in service was increased by 104,000 during the period.  Local distribution net-works&mdash;that is underground ducting and cabling in built-up and overhead cabling elsewhere&mdash;were considerably expanded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>About 670 telephone kiosks were erected.  Sixty-three new automatic telephone <Col N="104" /> exchanges were brought into service and most of the existing automatic exchanges were extended.  The extra exchange equipment installed in automatic exchanges for connecting subscribers exchange lines represented an increase of 56 per cent as compared with an increase of 39 per cent in working subscribers lines.</P>
    <P>About 10,000 extra trunk circuits were added to the system and additional trunk equipment was provided at many centres, the largest being a new trunk exchange at Dame Court, Dublin. International Subscriber Dialling was made available in the Dublin (01) and Shannon areas to some 21 countries mostly in Western Europe and North America.  Direct dialling was also extended to major cities in Britain from Dublin and the chief provincial centres. The number of international circuits. not including those to Britatin, was increased more than fourfold.  New telephone buildings and extension to existing telephone buildings were completed in about 200 centres.</P>
    <P>Because of the integrated nature of the telephone system the full benefits of some schemes already completed will not become evident until complementary works, many of which are in progress, have been carried out.  While much has been done over the five years to expand and improve the system we have a long way to go to match the kind of service available in countries like Denmark and Switzerland. I need only mention our long waiting list for telephones and the service difficulties that still exist to indicate how much leeway has still to be made good.</P>
    <P>We have the lowest telephone density in the EEC.  It now stands at 15 per 100 of the population as compared with 27 telephones per 100 in France which is the next lowest.</P>
    <P>The percentage of telephones connected to automatic exchanges at 87 per cent may seem high but the networks of all our partners in the EEC are now 100 per cent automatic except that of France which is over 97 per cent automatic.  We still have over 500 small manual exchanges serving extensive areas throughout the country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="105" /> I do not intend to dwell further upon the shortcomings of the system.  Commercial and industrial interests rightly stress that they constitute a hindrance to efficiency and an obstacle to attracting new industry to the country. Clearly they most be remedied as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>It would however be unrealistic to suggest that spectacular progress can be made within a few years in clearing arrears and resolving the problems of the system throughout the country. Even for the most advanced systems such as the Swedish and American major schemes necessary for large scale development have to be planned between five and 15 years ahead.  International experience has shown that it is virtually impossible in a democratic state to expand a national telephone service as quickly as we would like because of the inescapably long intervals between initial planning and physical completion of large numbers of related works involving site acquisition, buildings, manufacture and installation of plant, training of technical staff and so on.</P>
    <P>An outstanding example in this regard has been the modernisation of the French telephone service.  The French PTT Administration began a succession of planned programmes in the 1960s to remedy as quickly as practicable the relatively undeveloped conditions in their system.  Intensive efforts have been in progress there for well over a decade, but despite the advantage of a long engineering tradition and a telecommunications manufacturing industry it is only in the past few years that the rapid momentum has been gained.</P>
    <P>Ten years ago our capital budget for telephones was about £6 million. For the current year it is £57 million and in this Bill we are providing for the probability that £350 million at current prices will be required over the next five years.  This level of expenditure makes the telephone service one of the heaviest users of capital in the State.  The position of our telephone service in this respect is similar to that in other developing and highly developed countries.  In Britain, for instance, the capital budget of the <Col N="106" /> British Post Office for the current year for telecommunications, mostly telephones, is over £1,000 million.  This is required for a system which is already fully automatic.  Investment in telecommunications, excluding broadcasting, in France in the current year is estimated at over £2,000 million and for the period 1976 to 1980 expenditure of £15,000 million is envisaged.</P>
    <P>These figures are an indication of the demand which the provision of a modern telephone system makes on available capital.  This is due to the huge potential for growth of the telephone service itself, which is likely to remain for a long time ahead the most important form of telecommunication, and to the fact that it provides the basic network for other forms of telecommunication including such services as telex, television, data links between computers, telecopying, and so on.</P>
    <P>The £350 million development programme proposed for the next five years has four main objectives:&mdash;to increase the annual rate of connections progressively from about 45,000 at present to 85,000; to raise to 96 per cent the percentage of automatic telephones and provide for progress to full automatic as soon as possible; to further expand and improve the quality of service in order to attract and handle efficiently a high level of increase in traffic; and to make advance arrangements for the acquisition of sites, contracts for buildings and manufacture of equipment to provide for continuing progress in the years beyond 1982.</P>
    <P>In order to achieve these objectives it is planned to spend about £135 million on subscribers' installations and local network development, £70 million on local exchange development, £110 million on trunk development, £28 million on buildings and £7 million on miscellaneous works.  I propose to comment briefly on each of these broad divisions of the programme.</P>
    <P>On installation of subscribers telephones, including provisions of local underground and overhead plant, the programme proposed in connection with the 1973 Act envisaged that a target of 460,000 subscribers lines <Col N="107" /> would be reached in 1978.  It has not been possible to speed the connection rate sufficiently to reach this figure, but on the basis of connection targets for this year and next a figure approaching 420,000 should be reached, leaving a shortfall of about 40,000.  This is roughly the number of applications on the waiting list at present.</P>
    <P>In the past three years effective annual demand has been between 36,000 and 39,000 despite the economic conditions.  This year there has been evidence of a rise in demand and with recovery of the economy, demand in the years ahead can be expected to increase rapidly.  Connections on the scale envisaged over the next five years will bring the total number of exchange lines in service to around 575,000 by 1982 and the number of telephones to 775,000, representing a density of 23 per 100 population.</P>
    <P>To reach these figures it will be necessary to expand the subscriber underground and overhead plant network thorughout the country very extensively. In doing so provision will be made for further rapid growth in the years immediately following the current programme period.</P>
    <P>In order to meet demand for new subscribers lines, 22 new automatic exchanges will be provided in the Dublin, Cork, Galway and Limerick automatic exchange areas and the equipment in virtually all other automatic exchange areas will be extended. It is planned to convert 270 manual exchanges to automatic working.  This includes provision of a major auto-manual exchange at Letterkenny&mdash;at present in progress&mdash;which will complete the planned number of auto-manual centres.  Some 330,000 extra automatic exchange line terminations will be installed in automatic exchanges.</P>
    <P>The capacity of the trunk network will be greatly increased and large scale extensions will be made to the trunk system serving most major centres.  In total it is planned to bring over 22.000 additional trunk circuits into service.  A number of major new trunk routes will be provided including a microwave link to Britain over <Col N="108" /> the Irish Sea between Dublin and Welsh mountains.</P>
    <P>Automatic dialling facilities to Belfast, London, Birmingham, Glasgow, Liverpool and Manchester areas, which have recently been made available in Dublin and certain large provincial centres will be extended progressively to all automatic exchanges over the next 12 months.  Further extensions will be made as quickly as they can be arranged with the British Post Office.</P>
    <P>In the course of the next two years subscribers in eight large provincial centres will be provided with the facility for dialling calls direct to most European and North American countries. The facility will be extended progressively to other centres as quickly as practicable.</P>
    <P>International telephone call traffic has continued to grow rapidly in recent years.  In order to cater for further growth of calls, substantial additions to the international exchange equipment will be made.</P>
    <P>The availability of adequate accommodation in good time is a basic essential for rapid development of the telephone service.  Difficulties in acquiring sites and in having buildings erected quickly have in the past been a main cause of slowing telephone development.</P>
    <P>The provision of new buildings or extensions of existing buildings to house telephone equipment and/or staff are already in hand or planned at over 260 centres.  Major new buildings will be provided in the Dublin 01 Area at Ballyboden, Clondalkin, Dolphin's Barn, Lucan, Palmerstown, Sandyford and Terenure.  Outside Dublin the centres will include Athlone, Carrick-on-Shannon, Dongeal, Drogheda, Ennis, Galway, Kilkenny, Limerick, Navan, Cork, Sligo, Tralee, Tuam, Waterford and Westport.  The new automanual exchange and district telecommunications headquarters building being erected at Churchfield, Cork, will be the biggest telecommunications building project yet undertaken in the State.</P>
    <P>A small number of STD coinboxes have been in experimental use in selected public call offices in Dublin and provincial areas for some time with <Col N="109" /> satisfactory results.  Within the programme period it is planned to replace on an extensive scale existing coinboxes with STD boxes from which trunk calls can be dialled, commencing with the public boxes which are most used for trunk calls.</P>
    <P>There are at present over 35,000 coinbox telephones in the country, including about 3,000 public telephones, kiosks and call offices, which account for 35 per cent of all operator controlled trunk calls.  As the telephone system moves towards fully automatic working, replacement of the existing coinbox, which requires the assistance of an operator for trunk calls, becomes of increasing importance in order that the benefits of automatic working to users can by fully secured.</P>
    <P>Policy in regard to kiosks has been that they are provided only where they are considered likely to pay their way and existing facilities are regarded as not meeting reasonable need for public telephone facilities.  This policy still applies in urban areas.  In 1969 it was decided to undertake a programme for providing subsidised kiosks in rural areas by replacing call office telephones in rural post offices by outdoor kiosks with 24-hour service.  All but about 350 of the 2,000 odd call office telephones in rural post offices have been replaced by kiosks.  With few exceptions the stage has now been reached where kiosks provided in replacement of the remaining call offices would be unlikely to pay their way even with a very substantial subsidy.</P>
    <P>A scheme whereby local authorities may have kiosks provided at their request under guarantee against loss in areas where the Department considers them unlikely to pay their way is also in operation.  About 100 kiosks have been provided under this scheme, mainly in areas where there is no post office and accordingly no public telephone. I am having an examination made of the present arrangements for providing rural kiosks to see whether they can be improved.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to convert the larger Government manual private branch exchanges to automatic working.  This will improve the service given and reduce operating costs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="110" /> Growth in the volume of international call traffic will warrant provision of a satellite earth station during the next decade.  A site and radio interference study to identify technically suitable locations have been commissioned. It is expected that some costs of providing the station will be incurred in the period of the proposed programme.</P>
    <P>The feasibility of introducing a mobile public radio telephone service enabling calls to be dialled between vehicles and the public telephone system is being examined both from the technical viewpoint and in relation to the likely extent of demand for such a service.  While the main emphasis in use of resources must be on meeting more basic needs, it is hoped within the next programme period to commence arrangements for the introduction of a mobile radio telephone service.</P>
    <P>As previously mentioned, the telephone network provides the transmission of microwave links for televi-vices, such as data transmission, telex, television, facsimile transmission.  At present an extensive programme is in progress for replacement and extension of miscrowave links for television; and the use of microwave links for special purposes such as offshore communications is likely to increase considerably in future years.  Equipment for data transmission&mdash;between computers&mdash;over telephone lines is supplied by the Department on a rental basis.  The demand for this service is expected to grow rapidly with the accelerated growth of multiple access computer networks.</P>
    <P>At present the most modern switching equipment in widespread use among telephone administrations is the electro-mechanical crossbar common control type.  About 75 per cent of automatic equipment in this country is crossbar, the remainder being the older Strowger, step-by-step, equipment.</P>
    <P>In recent years the advanced manufacturing countries have made much progress in the design and production of electronic exchanges.  It is clear that these will be the exchanges of the future.  They are most compact, require <Col N="111" /> less maintenance and offer the possibility of giving subscribers a wider range of facilities.  Although many electronic exchanges are already in use abroad there is not yet clear evidence as to which designs will prove most satisfactory.  It is likely that within the next few years an electronic exchange will be purchased on a trial basis for use in this country.  However, a first requirement here as elsewhere is that the electronic exchange shall interwork with the electro-mechanical exchanges already in service.  A feature of telephones systems everywhere, and especially in the most highly developed countries, is that investment is so enormous that no administration will scrap its existing equipment in favour of new designs, even if substantially more attractive.  An instance of this is that Strowger-type exchange equipment which the Department discontinued purchasing, except for extension of existing exchanges, in 1962 is still in use throughout the world and in Britain forms 80 per cent of the network.</P>
    <P>Turning to the general financial position of the telephone service, I would like initially to emphasise that despite losses in recent years investment in the service is basically a sound proposition. Capital invested in it is fully paid for by the users of the service over a period.  Moreover an appreciable part of the capital invested comes from within the service.  Of the £350 million required for the next programme it is estimated that £120 million will be financed by depreciation provisions.  Over the past few years the telephone service has secured loans amounting to over £50 million from the European Investment Bank.  More recently grants from the European Regional Development Fund of over £6 million have been approved for telephone projects.</P>
    <P>For almost 40 years until the 1971-72 financial year the telephone service operated at a profit.  The period of the 1973 Act has been one of exceptional difficulty for the finances of the service, due to the concurrent incidence of high inflation, high interest rates and economic recession.  The first two of <Col N="112" /> these factors combined to raise the cost of the service sharply and the third depressed growth of traffic and prevented the higher costs being offset by the additional revenue the traffic would have brought.</P>
    <P>A programme for rapid expansion in a capital intensive service such as telephones normally results in fall off in profit or even in temporary loss. Plant and equipment for the needs of an enlarged system have to be provided some time in advance of being brought into use and to that extent a burden is imposed on the revenue of the service. Under stable conditions profit would recover within a relatively short period of time with the growth in traffic.</P>
    <P>Costs increased overall by almost 150 per cent from £34.4 million in 1973-74 to an estimated £85.6 million in 1977, some £34 million of the increase being attributable to the effects of inflation.  Telephone charges were increased in the same period but because of the difficult economic conditions growth of call traffic was below normal levels.  The loss for the current year after deductions of interest and depreciation charges is estimated at £7.6 million.</P>
    <P>It is expected that the service will revert to its traditional profit-earning position within the period of the programme proposed.  Call traffic will grow more rapidly with the return of more favourable economic conditions.  Moreover the more rapid addition of subscribers lines as well as yielding extra revenue from connection and rental charges will increase call revenue.</P>
    <P>A major benefit of the programme, which is of considerable importance in the current economic situation, is the amount of employment which the programme itself will generate.  At present there are about 13,000 people employed on the telephone service within my Department, and an estimated 2,000 more employed by contractors in the erection of exchange buildings, manufacture and installation of equipment, supply and laying of ducts and cables.</P>
    <P>The £350 million programme will give rise to an estimated 7,000 additional jobs.  The bulk of these new <Col N="113" /> jobs will be created within the Department. The aim is that there will be a build-up of recruitment over the five-year period according as extra staff can be used productively, as there are limits on the numbers which can be usefully absorbed at any given time. Most of the extra jobs will arise on the engineering side; in the technician installer, labour and trainee grades. There will be more jobs for engineering graduates too and some extra in the clerical and administrative grades. Of course, the creation of the additional jobs will depend on the speedy and efficient implementation of the development programme.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJMcCartin" hpid="Mr. McCartin Mr. McCartin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to extend the customary welcome to the new Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and hope that his period in office will be crowned with the success and progress which his efforts will deserve.  He is taking on a heavy responsibility. The field of telecommunications is a most important area for development. Coming as I do from an area which has suffered severely from the handicap of bad communications, I feel especially at this stage that the programme of expenditure which has been embarked upon by the Minister is of vital importance to the development of the less favoured areas of the country.</P>
      <P>I should like also to congratulate the outgoing Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  A far-sighted journalist wrote a few years ago that the foundations being laid so carefully and with such dedication by the then Minister for Posts and Telegraphs could lead to a situation where future Ministers would claim credit for the tremendous progress which would undoubtedly follow the serious efforts being made at that time.  The then Minister is with us today and perhaps he will have some views to express on the subject.  I should like to record my appreciation of the progress that was made during his term of office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure all public representatives have noticed that when people come to us with problems the emphasis changes from year to year.  If anybody were to ask me what is the most pressing and urgent problem that <Col N="114" /> continually comes up in the course of my work as a public representative, I would say that people are demanding a better and more extended telephone service and are becoming very impatient about the fact that this most vital service is so slow in reaching all those who rightly expect to be covered by it at the moment.  I realise of course that there are tremendous difficulties.</P>
    <P>As a public representative I would feel much happier if the public generally were aware of how the decisions are made regarding the provision of a telephone service to individuals. The subject probably has come up before but it is no harm to mention it again.  The ordinary applicant for connection to the service should know where he stands, what his chances are, where he is on the priority scale and within what length of time he can expect to have service provided for him.  Most politicians have enough to do without carrying useless messages to and fro between the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and business people or private subscribers on the subject of when they can get a telephone and the reason for the delay.</P>
    <P>There should be a clear points system laid down by which every section of the community would know their entitlement.  Applicants for private telephones will be fairly quick to understand that they must be put on the waiting list after those who need the service more urgently.  In particular, farmers should get a very high priority rating, together with all employers. As we know, farmers have all become business people, but in fact each farm is an isolated business and we have experience lately of all the extra services that farmers require. Farmers are involved in communicating with outside businesses and services very regularly and often many times a day&mdash;for instance, veterinary services, AI services, supplies and so on.  These things take farmers away from their place of work, make the running of their operation much more inefficient and generally contribute to lower production in agriculture than we should expect to have.  For these reasons a good telephone service is of <Col N="115" /> tremendous importance to the agricultural community.  It should be clearly laid down what a farmer's priority rating is and a farmer making application should get an indication within six, eight or ten weeks of his original application as to when he can reasonably expect to have that service provided for him.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable, and in my experience it has happened, that the occasional Post Office employee, manual or white collar worker, will say to people who make inquiries over the telephone, &ldquo;Well, that is all I can tell you, but maybe you should consult your local representative, county councillor, Deputy, Senator or whomever it may be.&rdquo;  I am not saying this is general but certainly to my knowledge it has happened on more than one occasion and it is very regrettable that this sort of attitude should be shown by any employee of any Department.  The present Minister should seek to have the full position regarding supply of these services clarified as soon as possible because I believe that the vast majority of applicants tend to have the impression, rightly or wrongly, that if they approach people in political positions they will get the service sooner than the neighbour who does not make any such move.</P>
    <P>In areas such as the one in which I have experience of working, one of the greatest handicaps we have had to suffer in the past few years is the slowness of our telephone services, the lack of automatic installations and, in addition, the rather deficient service from the exchanges where personnel were, I suppose, actually doing their very best but nevertheless could not cope with the amount of work.  I saw lately where some journalist trying to contact a Senator of this House, commented on the fact that he could not make out what that Senator was saying, but when he realised that the Senator lived in the Leitrim-West Cavan area, he said he was not surprised because the service was so bad in such a remote area.  I am not worried about the ordinary citizen getting that impression but I am worried that <Col N="116" /> potential industrialists would get such an impression-people who visit the country, people involved in the tourist industry.</P>
    <P>For all these reasons the underdeveloped areas should get a special priority.  We have the handicap of long and sometimes difficult roads but to people living in remote areas the handicap of a difficult telephone service is just as severe as bad roads. I would appeal to the Minister to make a special effort on behalf of those areas to give the service there attention above the national average in order to provide some advantages for these people.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister says that the telephone service will in the future become self-sufficient and pay for itself and, perhaps, have money to invest in further development. It is not a good thing for the public generally to expect some sort of subsidisation of this service.  It is sufficient to pick out a group of people like the aged, the physically handicapped or other groups of people who should get free telephone services.  That is reasonable and I believe that this is as far as subsidisation of this service should go.  The vast majority of people who want a good service are quite prepared to pay whatever it costs to have this service provided.</P>
    <P>People who are providing this service should be under an obligation to provide it at a competitive price which will enable industrialists to use the service.  If we have not got the buffer of a Government prepared to subsidise when the going gets tough, then the people who give the service should have to meet the consumer face to face. They should have to account to the consumer for what the service costs and the standards being provided for the payment.  That is the healthiest situation. That is the principle on which we should build the service in the future.  I would hope that in the very near future the whole telecommunications service will be in a position to pay for itself and that those who cannot afford it and need it, like the categories I have mentioned, will be subsidised and that this will be the policy of the Government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="117" /> With all the development that has taken place, I can see the necessity in some areas for long stretches of new lines to be provided.  From time to time the Department of Posts and Telegraphs take on quite a number of temporary people and then leave them off again.  These people are usually taken on by contact with the local employment exchanges.  We might have a more satisfactory situation if we could work out some sort of system by which we would contract out to individual contractors these bigger jobs or larger extensions of lines&mdash;the erection of poles over areas of a mile or upwards. We might in that way reduce to some extent the difficulties encountered by the Department because the further they develop the more complicated the machinery becomes and I believe the job will be less efficient in the long run.  The Department already contract out the building of exchanges and I see no reason why they could not contract out the laying of lines.  There is a lot of work yet to be done.  It is a good time for the Minister to look at the possibility of giving some of this work on an ordinary contract basis to private individuals who would fairly soon equip themselves to do the job efficiently.</P>
    <P>In the case of internal communication in industry, I see outside companies coming in after the Department of Posts and Telegraphs have provided the service and recommending improvements and the removal of some of the switches.  This is a pity and the Department should have the expertise to advise companies on systems of internal communications.  Since they provide the service from the outside, they have the first opportunity to assist in this area and, like the ESB, there is room to give a better service and more advice.</P>
    <P>These are the points I want to make. For the underdeveloped areas this is the most important service we have. I want to ask the Minister to recognise the problems of areas in the northwest and west which have had a very bad service in the past and to give them their share of what is coming in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome the Bill and join in welcoming <Col N="118" /> the Minister to the Seanad.  He has given us a very comprehensive and detailed explanatory speech regarding the purposes of this Bill, but there are a few points which would perhaps bear further emphasis, particularly the role of communications.  Earlier this afternoon we were talking about exports and industrial development, and effective communications are an absolute necessity in this respect, especially since this country is so isolated geographically. Communication is much easier from Britain or the mainland of Europe.  If we are to compete effectively it is essential that standards of communications should be equal to and preferably above those elsewhere in Western Europe.  We will have to use our telephonic communications more than people elsewhere.</P>
      <P>I am delighted to see this Bill and this emphasis on telecommunications. As well as the industrial necessity of improved telecommunications, in order to provide a richer cake as it were, there is also the personal aspect.  We cannot emphasise too much the importance of an efficiently functioning telephone service to old people, to those who for one reason or another are isolated and to people who are ill. It is absolutely essential that these people have some means of communicating and to this end I am delighted to know that it is hoped to double the rate of individual connections.</P>
      <P>I particularly notice that expenditure on the number of underground cables will be increased because this seems to be one of the more difficult aspects in developing telephone connections. The other essential point regarding the development of telecommunications is the very long time lag between the initiation of developments and their actual fruition.  It is essential that we look ahead to the numerous changes in technical advances and that we plan for the provision of staff well ahead of the time when they will be required. I am glad the Minister has emphasised this aspect; it has not been sufficiently emphasised in the past.  We should look at it very carefully and realise that the rate of growth is likely to exceed the present estimates rather than fall below them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="119" /> It is certainly worth emphasising that capital investment in telecommunications is profitable.  It is one of the areas where the State, or private enterprise as the case may be, can spend funds in the knowledge that throughout virtually the entire history of the Post Office here the telephone service has paid and the likelihood is that by increasing the facilities available revenue will increase also.  One is getting a direct return on the capital employed, quite apart from the spinoff in the development of industrialisation which is likely to be encouraged. I would concur with those who would say that it is difficult sometimes to attract industry to this country if one has to confess that the telephone service is not as fully up to date as it might be.</P>
    <P>I should like very much to welcome this Bill and am delighted that the Minister and the Government have made this a priority in legislation for this session.</P>

      <P>As this is the first occasion I have had to speak in the Seanad I should like to extend my congratulations to you on your election as Cathaoirleach and also to Senator McCartin on his election as Leas-Chathaoirleach here today.  I should like also to extend my congratulations and good wishes to the Minister, my successor in that office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill before us is to be welcomed, but our welcome for it should be a somewhat cautious one in that we should be quite clear what we are doing.  As the Minister has said, this is an enabling Bill only.  It does not provide or guarantee any investment or any given level of investment.  That depends on the Government from year to year.  It is not hard to introduce a Bill like this and I am not criticising the Bill or the Minister.  The Bill was, of course, prepared under the previous Government and is as it would have been if a Coalition Minister had been introducing it.  Such Bills are desirable in themselves but they guarantee nothing at all.  Therefore it should not be taken that the Oireachtas have now decided on a given level of investment. They have not.  They have put a figure <Col N="120" /> on what it might be if the Government from year to year provide that it will reach this level.</P>
    <P>The Bill itself provides no time scale, and this is the usual practice.  It does not set out that this money is to be spent within five years or whatever. The Minister's speech gave the impression, without altogether saying so, that it is intended the money should be spent over the next five years.  He refers to the probability that £350 million at current prices will be required over the next five years.  If the implication of that is actually met it would be welcome because it would be providing a level of investment approximately corresponding to that which has been maintained over the past four years.</P>
    <P>The Minister acknowledged in his speech that it is only in the past few years that rapid momentum has been maintained in this matter.  I think that is so.  But what is important, in the public interest and in the interests of the future of our economy to which the last speaker Senator Conroy rightly referred, is that the level of investment which has now been achieved should be sustained.</P>
    <P>We should bear in mind that the level of total investment in the past four years is higher than what was invested up to 1973&mdash;it is higher than that but it is also higher than the totality of investment in Irish telephones in the history of the telephone system.  The achievement of that level of investment represents a kind of break through; and what is important is not just that we should pass this Bill but that we should know that that level of investment will be sustained.</P>
    <P>What I am trying to do is not to make a party political point, though it may sound like that at times.  What is important for both the Minister and myself, because I am sure we see eye to eye on this matter&mdash;any Minister for Posts and and Telegraphs would see eye to eye with any other Minister for Posts and Telegraphs irrespective of party&mdash;is that this momentum, however it was achieved or under whomsoever it was achieved, should be maintained.</P>
    <P>That simply cannot be taken for granted and we should not in debating <Col N="121" /> this matter in this House take it for granted and say: &ldquo;It is great, £350 million for telephone development, Bob's your uncle.&rdquo;  It is not like that because at the beginning of this decade, during the period 1970-71, the then Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, my predecessor, Deputy Collins, put forward his demands for capital investment.  He made his case and the then Minister for Finance simply cut them back drastically.  The then Minister for Posts and Telegraphs protested but his protest was ignored, not even answered, just swept aside on the ground that there was some financial stringency in that year; and the telephone system of this country suffered for years after that from the consequences of that decision.</P>
    <P>In 1974-75 this country passed through a period of economic stress greatly exceeding that which occurred in 1970 and I am proud to say the Government did not do what was done in 1970, did not cut back on the telephone service.  They held that this was essential for our economic future and development and they kept up that level of investment and I hope that that will happen in the future.  I am quite certain that this Minister will press for that but what I should like to be sure of is that he will be successful, because the political problem about telephone development is that it does not pay off in the short-term.  Some reasons for that are indicated by the Minister when he said here earlier:</P>
    <P>Even for the most advanced system such, as the Swedish and American, major schemes necessary for large scale development have to be planned between five and 15 years ahead.</P>
    <P>He said elsewhere:</P>
    <P>A programme for rapid expansion in a capital intensive service such as telephones normally results in fall off in profit, or even in temporary loss.  Plants and equipment for the needs of an enlarged system have to be provided for some in advance of being brought into use, and to that extent a burden is imposed on the revenue of this service.  Under stable conditions profit would recover <Col N="122" /> within a relatively short period of time with the growth in traffic.</P>
    <P>But that is ahead.  So the position is, when a Government have to take decisions on this matter that they know if they are to provide the large investment required, will not be felt for years.  On the other hand, if you are going to say, &ldquo;Well, the borrowing level of the State is already high, there are other projects that will pay off quicker&rdquo;, the Government also know that the damage done by that cut back will not be felt for several years, and that is a rather dangerous combination. I think it is because of that combination of factors that in the past this State did not achieve the necessary momentum in telephone development, so that we are still at the bottom of that EEC table as we have been so long.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister, not to embarrass him, but on the contrary in an attempt to strengthen his hand, for an assurance that the level of telephone capial investment which has been achieved in the past four years will be maintained in real terms as long as he is Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  If he can give the House this assurance&mdash;he implied something like it in his speech but I should like something better than an implication; I should like a firm and clear statement here that it will be his policy to do that&mdash;that he will do his level best to ensure that it is made good, then he will be doing something concrete.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a couple of points in the discussion on this Bill that I should like to make.  First of all I think that Senator Conroy was correct when he suggested that instead of being behind Europe in communication we should be ahead because of the size of our country and because of the competitive situation in which we are participating. Communication is one of the key factors in modern business and in development. What I think Senator <Col N="123" /> Conroy was emphasising was that if we are to be competitive we must have a first class communications system instead of being where we are, when the number of telephones is at the level of 15 per 100 against the French average of 27 per 100.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech has covered the total area, as far as I can see.  He has dealt with the wide area of new installation such as the exchange lines, trunk lines, automatic exchanges, new buildings and so on. I am sure that every Member on both sides of the House would encourage him and support him in that programme. There is one minor point that I should like to make having regard to correspondence which I still receive in relation to the provision of private telephone lines.</P>
    <P>Looking back on the past couple of years many of us would have been a little bit easier in our minds as public representatives if we could have given a clearer picture of the rate of connection of lines in different areas.  I am saying that with the knowledge that in many areas some information was available, but one was being constantly approached, phoned and so on, been asked &ldquo;When can I get my line? I have got an answer that says that I might not have it for three months or four months or five months&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Looking ahead to the next three or four years, I suggest the Minister should set up some kind of survey to produce a detailed statement of the hoped for rate of connection in different exchange areas.  It would be a help to elected representatives because we could at least be able to show reasonably fair methods employed by the Minister's technical staff in their efforts to satisfy the public demand for telephones.</P>
    <P>One of the questions I should like to put to the Minister is about his reference to a satellite earth station. Is this to be one we will be sharing with other countries, with Europe for example?  The impression I get is that it would apply only to this country.</P>
    <P>I would impress on the Minister again the need to be competitive, to <Col N="124" /> be efficient in communication.  I would encourage him to bring about that change to provide a connection for those who have telephones for mobile telephones, so they can use private radio telephones through the ordinary phone system.  This may be anything but essential to the great majority of the people but it can be essential to a small number who provide a very effective industrial contribution.</P>
    <P>The speech of the Minister is too broad to be dealt with adequately unless one had it in advance.  I should like to know from the Minister, bearing in mind the very significant contribution of the European Investment Bank in the past four-and-a-half or five years, what he would envisage by way of contribution by way of loan from the bank in the current year and the coming financial year.  My understanding is that the loans from the European Investment Bank were available and are available <i>pro rata</i> to the capital that we are putting into the telephone system.  If there is any information available to the Minister I should appreciate it.  It is relevant in view of the fact that <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> says we have received no loan since 1st January from either the European Investment Bank or any other overseas banking system.</P>
    <P>In closing I should like to compliment the technical staff of the department of Posts and Telegraphs for the work they are doing and have been doing.  Also I should like to urge the Minister to ensure that this full programme will be put into operation. Quite apart from the contribution it will make to our economy and the estimated 7,000 additional jobs, there is the need to have the most efficient communications system possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I offer the customary congratulations to the new Minister and assure him that for my own part&mdash;so far in the debate I felt that this has applied to all the other contributors&mdash; what I have to say, and I will have one or two sharp comments to make, will be offered in a constructive and what I believe to be a helpful sense. Everybody recognises that his job is a difficult one, and not in a personal sense.  The post of Minister for Posts <Col N="125" /> and Telegraphs is a difficult one because it is hard to satisfy people in regard to a service which we must acknowledge is not as efficient as any of us would like.</P>
      <P>I am grateful that the Minister had such a lengthy speech which contained a good deal of facts, but in a way it represents to me as a speech what I find to be wrong with the whole service of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs&mdash;with the communication service.  There seems to be a lack of analysis in it and a lack of plan in it. This Bill is only about money: it is only an enabling Bill about money. The real expenditures will be decided annually when people sit down to make a budget, and it will not be the decision of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs; it will be the decision of his Cabinet colleagues as a whole when they are considering all of the spending of the whole Government.  This is an enabling measure.  We will wait to see how much will be spent annually.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should have liked to have had some sort of analysis, some sort of plan in it.  I am very pleased that we had the contribution from the Minister's predecessor.  It was both interesting and realistic, and benevolent in the literal sense of the word: he was trying to be helpful and wishing well for the service and for the present Minister and he was saying some essential things.  The reason I believe that Senator Cruise-O'Brien will be remembered as a very good Minister for Posts and Telegraphs is because he was able to bring enough clout to the Cabinet table to get enough money every year, not through enabling legislation but at budget making, and see that the money was spent.  He did not want to make a party political point.  Perhaps I will be less delicate in the matter because I think a lot of our difficulties, and the long time lag in the whole of the communications service acknowledged in the Minister's speech, are there because the previous Government inherited a situation where there had been insufficient investment and insufficient planning over a long period, and that is not quickly cured.  It was our great good fortune that the last Minister had the clout and when <Col N="126" /> necessary the acerbity at the Government table to get the investment up and the Government are taking back the reins of power at a time when those years of effort are beginning to pay off.</P>
    <P>When we say &ldquo;Fine, we are delighted at an enabling piece of legislation&rdquo;, we hope, as Senator Cruise-O'Brien said, that this enablement, if that is the appropriate word, will be put into effect in the annual budget every year and that the level of expenditure will be kept up and increased, because this in a sense is an area where a cut does not show itself for perhaps five or ten years.  Lots of things you cannot cut coming through the pipeline, but this you can cut and it has been cut year after year precisely because of the long time lag to which the Minister made reference.</P>
    <P>We are happy to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to this enabling of expenditure but we are entitled to ask what the Minister proposes to do with the money, and we are entitled to more than the factual listing we got in the Minister's speech. I want for a few moments to offer the House some of the conclusions I came to during a period in office in a Department where the quality of the communications service was relevant.  I want to tell the House&mdash;I mentioned it in a previous speech&mdash;the main things that overseas investors wanted to know.  They wanted to know about the state of labour relations, about export tax relief, the quality of the transport service and the quality of the communications service.  These were the four big things in Japan and the United States.  They knew that our communications service was bad, and we could not say otherwise in truth, and it influenced their decisions.  The quality of communications is totally enmeshed with the whole question of economic development and the rate of economic progress which we all desire, inseparably so.</P>
    <P>I want to offer the conclusion that has been forced on me more and more as the years pass and especially as a result of the period in office when I saw the machine operating in another way.  In parenthesis I should like to assure the Leas-Chathoirleach&mdash;I was <Col N="127" /> very interested in what he said&mdash;that the inadequacy that he described does not refer to his part of the country only.  Without wishing any ill to his part of the country, I can only say would that it only applied there, but I happen to live in the 045 code area and I simply do not use my telephone, as a lot of other people do not, because I know that the effort to do so would result in an increase in blood pressure and delay.  I would use it four times as much if I was sure that simply dialling would get me the person I wanted to talk to, as it does in America, Denmark or any part of Scandinavia.  The question of improving quality generates a dramatically faster growth than the general growth of the economy which is being served by that communications system.  Many of us are not using the communications service to the extent that in efficiency we ought to do, simply because of its defects.  That applies in areas, I say with regret, a Leas-Chathaoirleach, all over the country.  We must not deceive ourselves that the situation is satisfactory even though there has been great improvement.</P>
    <P>Where do I want a plan, where do I want a bit of analysis.  May I refer to a new Senator and I hope he will come in on this, Senator Noel Mulcahy?  I hope he will give us his mind on it because he brings to the Oireachtas a very useful knowledge of what management is and how it can be applied.  That seems to me in the whole communications industry of this country strikingly not to be present because the management problem of communications are beautiful ones in their technical sense because you are planning five, ten and 15 years down the road.  You are making hopefully elegant guesses about what the economy will be like at future times and about the cost of money.  You are making elegant guesses hopefully of how much of your GNP you can afford to put into the communications industry in years five, seven and ten. You have to do elegant things about the rate of promotion selling of your products, the sort of rate of return that will give you and how fast that will enable you to grow.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="128" /> There are a beautiful management, long term and short term, money and technology questions in all of communications. It seems to me that those are questions that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs are hardly aware of the existence of let alone the solutions for them.</P>
    <P>A compliment was paid by Senator Brugha to the technical people in Posts and Telegraphs.  I feel the same about them.  As human beings, when one meets them out of office, not in their formal capacity, they are often defensive, sorry and sick people because they are not satisfied with the way they are enabled to perform for the public in the way in which they wish to perform.  The reason for that, it seems to me, is the structural one. The reason for that it seems to me is an example of the classic division we have in our public service between administrative and technical.  Technical people never get a fair chance and the administrative people do not know about the sort of expertise, be it electronic, technological, communications theory, management theory or long-term money theory, that has to be brought to the solution of these problems.</P>
    <P>Therefore I ask the fundamental question, not for an answer now.  I am not saying that I am convinced this is the solution, but we are entitled on a Bill that enables a large amount of money to be spent over five years, without being out of order, to raise this sort of question.  Is the administrative structure of having the communications service within the civil service the right structure?  I am not for a moment advocating it being given to the private sector as exists in some countries.  Everyone must say fairly, and I say this as a socialist, it is a mechanism that provides an efficient service in some countries.  I want to see it remain in the public sector, but the mere spending of large amounts of money will not guarantee efficiency.  I think one of the barriers is the structure, that the question of a public corporation and the taking it out of the homogeneous membership of the civil service and giving it autonomy and giving it certain rules that public corporations can operate <Col N="129" /> by and that the civil service cannot, may be the necessary thing that will liberate the creative energy that we know to exist among the technical people in the communications sector of our civil service.</P>
    <P>There are two conditions for solving a problem that I hope we all agree is a serious one.  One is that the Minister has enough clout once a year when the budget is being made to get enough money to keep up the level of investment, and on that battle all we can do is to wish him well.  The other is that we look at a fundamental reorganisation that will liberate some of the creative energy that we know is there and to bring the technological and managerial knowledge that we know is in the country to bear quickly and fundamentally on a problem that we are convinced is essential of solution if we are not to be inhibited in our economic growth.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The amount being legislated for, £350 million, is a sizeable sum of money no matter how you look at it, but the fact that that sum is written into this enabling Bill is indicative of the intention and the purpose of the Government and the Minister.  There is a colossal job in front of the Department to bring our telephone service up to <Col N="130" /> what it should be, now that we are members of the European Economic Community, and at the outset I will throw this out and I hope somebody will take up the point&mdash;I am sure the Minister will deal with it: is there a case for separating Posts from Telegraphs, telegraphs and telephones, &ldquo;telecommunications&rdquo; would probably be more accurate now?  There are two entirely different disciplines.  Post offices have to deal with stamps, saving certificates, the Savings Bank, allowances and so on whereas telecommunications, as we understand telephones and telegraphs to be, is a major service industry requiring the highest skills not alone in construction and installing but in maintenance.</P>
    <P>The Minister listed the type of people who will be employed in this five-year plan, maintenance technicians, installers and graduates, undoubtedly graduates in the field of electrical engineering. I hope he will see to it that a proper balance is kept between administration and field work, and as far as electrical engineers are concerned that conditions will be made as attractive as possible for them.  I know of an electrical engineer who left the service within the last couple of years a disappointed man.  He expected that his talents would be used to the utmost; he was very keen on the work he was trained to do as an electrical engineer, but he found that most of the work he was asked to do was of the administrative kind.  That is most discouraging to a young graduate who is full of ideas and wants to give the best his talents can enable him to do to the service of his country in the particular service he had chosen to work in.</P>
    <P>At present a first class service is an absolute necessity for us all.  It is no longer a luxury and as time marches on it becomes more of a necessity.  Earlier we were dealing with the Export Promotion (Amendment) Bill, 1977, and during that debate the thought occurred to me: what could be done about export promotion or the promotion of any sort of industry if we did not have telecommunications?  The whole thing would fall.  The Department responsible for telecommunications has become one of the most important Departments <Col N="131" /> in the State.  Therefore we must have the best planning, the best engineers and the best industrial relations in order that we have the sort of efficient service that is necessary nowadays.</P>
    <P>A telephone is an absolute necessity for the farmer now since farming is a big industry.  There is a question of personal communication and a telephone is one of the great levellers socially, one of the great solaces and one of the great comforts socially.  Many of us have made friends over the telephone with people we probably may never meet.  In the times we are living in the more friendships we can make by telephone as well as meeting in person, the better.  We should think of all the friendships many of us have made with people overseas, friendships we have made with people in the Six Counties, in Britain, on the Continent and in the USA.  All these things help to build very good relations: our status as a nation will to a large extent be measured by the type of communications we have in order to get in touch, converse and do business with people all over the world.  I mention specially the great solace a telephone is to old people, to those living alone with no relatives living near especially and who may be subjected to violence.  People living in isolated areas are in constant fear of unwelcome visitors, violent robbers and so on and a telephone is a godsend to those people.  They feel they have help at hand by the dialling of a number.  We must all commend the Minister for the arrangements made by which certain pensioners will be allowed to have a telephone free of rental.  That is a great step forward.</P>
    <P>Kiosks were mentioned.  &ldquo;Kiosk&rdquo; is almost a dirty word for those of us who were on the Seanad campaign last summer.  Somebody may ask what a kiosk is.  Those of us who were on the campaign can say what a kiosk was at that time.  It was a nicely built little hut from which one could not make a telephone call.  That is a definition of most of the kiosks we had reason to use.  Vandalism is, of course, the problem.  How can we overcome it? I have given the matter a lot of thought, have discussed it with various <Col N="132" /> people and come to the conclusion that we may have made those little huts too attractive.  Maybe they are too well built.  The fittings are similar to those we have in our own homes and offices.  In the future when building these kiosks they should not have four walls just a pillar with a little shelter over it, unbreakable glass, steel sheeting and that sort of thing and have them is as public a place as possible with a minimum of comfort.  If we came across a kiosk that worked they were occupied by young people having long conversations possibly using a telephone line to do a line of their own, and we had to wait until they were finished.  That is the reason I suggest putting as little comfort as possible into kiosks that will be built in the future.</P>
    <P>One of the big problems facing the Minister is one with which we could help him a lot.  We should help him dispel the idea that his only job is to instal more telephones, provide more telephones for more people.  That is part of his work, but the big imponderable was referred to by him in his speech.  He mentioned things that would have been unheard of even five years ago&mdash;a satellite earth station, a mobile public radio telephone service, transmission services, data transmission, telex, television facsimile transmission. He told us that at present an extensive programme is in progress for replacement and extension of microwaves for television and the use of microwaves for special purposes such as offshore communications.  Those things would not have been heard of in the recent past, and therein lies a very big headache for the Minister and his Department.  Those things require careful planning over a long period.</P>
    <P>I noticed with great satisfaction that the Minister advocated the dictum of <i>festina lente</i>, not to be in a great rush buying new equipment because the cost of this is colossal and, possibly, with further development in electronic engineering it could soon become dated. One thing he will ensure is that as far as humanly possible Irish manufactured equipment will be used.  I have a suggestion to make: would it be possible in view of the huge amount of money involved that further industry <Col N="133" /> could be promoted to develop and make parts not being made here already?</P>
    <P>Kiosks, telephone lines and telex and so on remind me of the seanfhocal Trí rud a bhaineann le hól&mdash; é ól, é iompar agus díol as&mdash;and of course the sting is in the third one, &ldquo;díol as&rdquo;.  When is this money going to come back if it is ever going to come back?  There is only one way to make sure that most of it will come back&mdash;to have the most efficient service possible.  Some Senators already mentioned the fact that they would not make a telephone call from their own telephones because of interference and so on.  That is most unsatisfactory, and all these things will have to be put right.  If a service is not satisfactory it will fall.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I want to refer to the calls where one has to dial for an operator.  Ceann de na deacrachtaí a chasann ort go minic ná é seo: Má labhrann tú as Gaeilge leis an gcailín atá san oifig, de ghnáth is beag áird a tugtar ort.  A lán díobh san atá ag obair ins na háiteanna sin, ins na malartáin, sílim gur daoine ar bheagán Gaeilge ar fad iad agus n'fheadar cé chuige a chuirfinn an gearán mar gheall ar an sceal.

Ba cheart go mbeadh an oiread sin Gaeilge ar a gcumas siúd agus a chabhródh leo freagra a thabhairt as Gaeilge agus cabhrú leis an ndaoine a dteastaíonn uathu a saol a chaitheamh trí Ghaeilge.  Sin pointe beag amháin, agus ní rachaidh mé thar sin.</P>
    <P>Guím gach rath ar an Aire san obair atá roimhe agus, mar adúirt mé cheana, tá súil agam i gceann cúig bliana go mbeimid ar an mbóthar chuig an sprioc&mdash;córas teileachumarsáide a bheidh chomh maith agus is féidir é bheith san Stáit seo.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join in welcoming the Minister to his new office and on the occasion of his first visit to the Seanad and hope that his ideas for the telephone service as set out in the Bill will come to pass.  It is something we would all like to see. I have intervened in the debate to make a rather net point.  It has to do <Col N="134" /> with the fact that we are debating this Bill which provides the machinery whereby the Minister can look to his colleague for a very large sum of money for investment in telecommunications at a time when telecommunications here and from countries abroad are seriously prejudiced by industrial unrest in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
      <P>It is on that subject I want to say a few words.  The point was made earlier that there are certain essentials to foreign investment in this country. Export tax relief was quoted as one and stability in industrial relations was mentioned as another.  That links in with the third, which Senator Cranitch has referred to, the importance of good telecommunications.  Unfortunately, we cannot offer those two important fundamentals at the moment, sound consistent telecommunications, nor can we offer&mdash;it is no joy to say this&mdash;stability in industrial relations. I have personal knowledge of an industry which has to compete on the world markets.  It is entirely an export industry.  It must compete against giant competitors who are formed into a cartel.  This small Irish industry was attracted here by the IDA and by their promises of a good labour market and the other attractions they hold out to foreign industrialists.  It is now in the position of competing in this difficult market but it is literally being crippled for want of telecommunications.  It cannot compete very often in price because the cartel can see to that and its competitiveness rests on the quality of its product and its general commercial efficiency.  Underlying the ability to be commercially efficient it must be able to communicate speedily, accurately and whenever necessary.  It is prevented from doing that now and has been for some time in the past by the running sore of the telex dispute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Telex is not something which impinges on most of us.  We just have our telephone and, as Senator Keating says, we are used to our telephones, but telex is now becoming more and more part and parcel of Irish industry and the Irish business scene generally. The experience I related in regard to this company is not unique because I read in the newspapers of spokesmen <Col N="135" /> from other companies complaining of the plight in which they find themselves. I have heard a spokesman on behalf of the Confederation of Irish Industry and the representatives of employers making similar complaints.  We can be satisfied that the <i>malaise</i> is widespread, deep and extremely serious. There is no point in State agencies, whether they be the Industrial Development Authority or Córas Tráchtála, attracting industry here or trying to sell the goods abroad if when those people come they find themselves in a position where they cannot communicate abroad.  Unfortunately, that is the position we are in at the moment.</P>
    <P>This is the position which has pertained for some months.  It seems to me that the industrial relations situation within the Department of Posts and Telegraphs is in such a condition that a very fundamental look must be taken at it.  I do not know what is the cause of the present dispute.  Very few people know this.  It is almost impossible to define the cause from what we read in the newspapers.  It is probably only known to those who have been in the Department, on the management or trade union side, for a long time and have grown up with all the complexities which have contributed to this present industrial tangle.  There is no point in trying to speculate on it because it defeats me, but what is clear at this stage is that the industrial problems seem to be so intractable&mdash;and apparently insoluble, because they have not been solved up to now.  I do not know where the fault is, whether it is the management or whether Senator Cranitch put his finger on it when he talked about Telecommunications and Posts being in the one Department &mdash;the very new with the very old and traditional.  I do not know whether there are old procedures there that are no longer able to cope with the stresses of modern industry.  That may be it.</P>
    <P>I imagine that the whole thing has become so interwoven in a complex mass of relationships, hierarchical structures and all that sort of thing, that the problem is possibly insoluble. Certainly no solution has been achieved up to now.  We have been reading <Col N="136" /> for some months past about conciliation and arbitration meetings and consultations but none of those procedures produced a result.  The only result is peace.  I know there are procedures in the Department for dealing with industrial disputes, conciliation, arbitration and all the rest of it and that traditionally the Minister has remained aloof from these matters.  Likewise, the Minister for Labour's general stance in industrial disputes is to stand apart and let the established machinery deal with them.  But when we have a case where the established machinery has been incapable of dealing with a dispute can the Minister any longer afford to stand apart when real harm is being done to viable Irish industries, when public investment in industries may be lost and when people may be out of jobs?  When I speak of &ldquo;people&rdquo; in this context I mean friends and neighbours in my own town.  I ask the Minister if he can stand aside any longer from this running sore of industrial disputes within his Department affecting the telecommunications of this country?  I suggest to him that he cannot.  What is needed now is a fundamental reappraisal of these relations.  The existing machinery has failed and I appeal to him to make this fundamental assessment as a matter of the greatest urgency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJOTooke" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, particularly at a time when there is quite an amount of capital required for the development of our telephone system.  Like the Minister, I, too, being from the west of Ireland am critical of the services we get in that area.  It has always been the case&mdash;not alone in the field of posts and telegraphs but in the field of many development authorities&mdash;that if one is in a peripheral area that person is the last to get the services.  The remote areas should get priority in regard to telephone communication. We are a small divided nation and the least we can expect is to have certain communications for those who live in remote areas.  It is unconstitutional to charge additional installation costs to such people.  Such costs should not debar those people from receiving the services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People living in remote areas who <Col N="137" /> require hospitalisation, medical attention, veterinary services and emergency services must wait in a queue, regardless of their occupation, for at least three years.  That is disgraceful.  I can see why the previous Minister was concerned about the production that might accrue from the expenditure of £350 million over the next five years.  I can tell Senator O'Brien that after his period of office people are still in that queue in my area.  There is a delay of at least three years from the time a person applies until a phone is installed.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Minister takes into account the provision of services in what I regard as the peripheral areas. Where there is a high density of population, for example at beaches during the tourist season, the lifeguard should be in close proximity to a telephone kiosk or have immediate access to a phone so that ambulances, doctors, nurses and so on can be alerted.  There should be some radio link between the fishing fleet in that area and the lifeguard on shore.</P>
    <P>The island dwellers along our coasts have a system of communication that breaks down at least twice or three times a week, depending on the inclement weather in the area.  There is no alternative communication for those people who are cut away from the mainland.  The Minister should take into account the provision of some additional coverage for such people when their communication system breaks down on the mainland.  Emergencies and problems arise on the islands also.  It is only right that when they are cut away by miles of sea in inclement weather some type of communication in substitution for the one they have should be installed.</P>
    <P>The Minister and some Senators mentioned that a telephone is a must in modern farming.  I know plenty of farmers who are on the waiting list but who will be unable to get their phones installed until they get out of what is known as the carriage office in Dublin. That is some kind of net one gets into in Dublin when one makes an application. The engineering branch continually blame the carriage office.  The technical operators in one's own county <Col N="138" /> from time to time blame the county council or the local authority for way leaves but in the ultimate analysis it is at least three years before one has a phone, regardless of one's occupation. It is no wonder the previous Minister for Posts and Telegraphs is concerned about the production of money spent during his time because this still obtains.</P>
    <P>The Minister should look into this problem.  There may be dumping of equipment here which is obsolete in other countries.  Because we are not able to manufacture modern, up-to-date equipment there is a danger that obsolete equipment may be installed.  I ask the Minister to be aware of this and ensure that the equipment we install now will not be outdated next year or the year after.  It has happened in our hospitals where X-ray units and other equipment were installed and became obsolete in a very short time. There is also the danger that if one puts any product out of the reach of the customer financially, the customer will tend to use that product less.</P>
    <P>If one lives in a remote area one will get a three-minute telephone call for 50p&mdash;possibly with interruptions and being cut off&mdash;and one might end up with only one minute's conversation. If one does not give a service at a reasonable rate, it will be put beyond the reach of the ordinary consumer and will no longer bring in any capital or profit for the operator.  It is not the answer to increase the charges.  We had that with CIE.  They continued to increase their charges until they discouraged people from using their transport.  When they reduced their charges, even on a trial basis, people started again to use the passenger service.  The same will apply to telephone charges if they are put beyond the reach of the people.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and hope it will give the Minister what he intends.  I want to compliment him on bringing in this Bill with financial teeth.  Unless you have a financial commitment in a Bill, it will not have teeth.  This is the first requirement.  The Minister has done this and I wish the Bill every success.</P>

      <P>In the area of forecasting <Col N="139" /> capacity I would have some doubts whether the Department as it stands at the moment has organised itself to produce an integrated plan for the development of the telephone service.  It was with some surprise that I heard Senator Keating talking about the need for reorganisation and restructuring and I wondered what the Coalition had been doing during the last few years.  I want the Minister to take note that we will be watching what he does.  What has been done about the Devlin recommendations in relation to the reorganisation of the Post Office&mdash;I see that strange look in my colleagues' faces&mdash;pushing for the notion of the Aireacht?  If anything I would say that we should throw out that notion.</P>
      <P>What I am pushing for is reconciliation between the technical and administrative people in the Department.  As one of those technical people it was my privilege in 1956 to climb the mountains of Ireland to select the television transmission sites.  That was one of the things that was done in time for the television service when it came on screen.  It was not such a happy situation when I worked in industry at Shannon.  I found there was no automatic exchange there when it was needed to keep the new industrialists happy.  It is important that the infrastructural development goes hand in hand with the development of industry. We spoke earlier today about the expansion of exports, the need for 15,000 new jobs and so on.  The telephone service must keep pace with it.</P>
      <P>In contrast the ESB have over a period managed to move their capacity forward at a rate which more or less has balanced with demand.  It is essential that the telephone service do this also.  If the organisation of the Post Office needs to be changed&mdash;for instance, if it needs to be set up as a public corporation, which the Minister might think about&mdash;then perhaps we will have to do that.  We cannot have an inferior telephone service when we are an export country and must remain competitive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not get too hung up about the amount of money involved because, <Col N="140" /> when we take £350 million over the five-year period and deduct £120 million for depreciation, we are talking about a funding of £46 million a year.  Maybe that is not enough.  I am not fully confident that the planning and forecasting services are fully worked out within the Department.  If they were pressure would have been exerted to provide funds, as was done in the past for the expansion of the electricity capacity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of this measure.  It has been said that this Bill had no teeth because all it does is lay out the guidelines which might or might not be followed when capital becomes available from the Department of Finance.  The Government have the will to provide the money for this Bill.  An indication of this is that it has been introduced to the House very early in this session.  I have no doubt the Minister will have the political clout necessary to get the finance which will be needed over the next number of years.  As has been mentioned by Senator Mulcahy, there is a possibility that the finance mentioned in this Bill may not be enough to help us through what we hope will be a very successful period during the next five years.</P>
      <P>The Bill gives us an idea of the complexity of modern communication. When somebody comes to us looking for a telephone it is a relatively easy matter for him to say that a telephone only costs X number of pounds, but when you get into the finance needed to provide the back-up service for that one phone you realise the trouble you are in.  Mention has been made of the peripheral areas and the need for phones for those areas.  There can be as many community care problems in the centre of the city as in the wilds of the country.  In a big built-up area where there are very few private phones and no public service buildings, such as hotels or pubs, one realises the urgent need for telephone kiosks. Kiosks are as essential in that area as on the top of a mountain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mention has been made of provision of a suitable type of kiosk.  The kiosk at present used by the Department is an invitation to a vandal.  Where <Col N="141" /> can he get at ready cash more easily than in a telephone kiosk?  All he has to do is break the simplest lock and he has enough ready cash to tide him over until the next day when he can break into another.  There are problems in this area.  Some of these problems might be created by the fact that some of these kiosks are not always checked by the Department officials in time.  They get overloaded and are an invitation to the vandal.  It does not seem an impossibility to design a telephone kiosk in which the money box might be under the ground or hidden in some way so that vandals cannot get at it.</P>
    <P>There is concern about local authority funding of telephone kiosks.  In many remote areas there is no possibility of adequate funds being generated to make that particular box pay, but the need for the phone is nevertheless there.  Because of that need I feel there should be a community care aspect in the provision of telephone kiosks.  Community care is essential in all areas.  A person living beside a hotel or remote from a hotel should be able to get the srevices he requires whether it be doctor, dentist, priest or whatever.</P>
    <P>The scheme which has been devised whereby the local authority will fund kiosks in certain areas should be looked into in greater detail.  We have found that there is a possibility that in one year a telephone kiosk might produce revenue over and above that guaranteed.  In the next year it will not have the revenue needed, so a subsidy will have to be given.  No cognisance is being given to the fact that the year before a profit was made.  If we are going to stick with that system it should be over a five-year period and the accounting period should be at the end of those five years.</P>
    <P>Our communications system is of vital importance not alone to our tourist industry and industrial prospects but to normal living in a complex world.  In a rural area where there is a small industry the telephone is the only link with suppliers in many cases.  It is all right if one lives in a built-up area where within five minutes one can get to one's source of supply, <Col N="142" /> but in a country area when one is depending on somebody to send something by train or by other fast means very often one cannot get it, and this is hindering the progress of business. I am sure that the amount of money involved will be forthcoming from the Government.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope the House will support this Bill, which is necessary if we are to progress as a nation because communications is our life blood.</P>

      <P>There is no question about the House giving support to the Bill.  This Bill was ordered to be printed in May, 1977.  On that occasion not alone did we get the support of the Opposition but, generally speaking, the tone of the debate was consistent with the tone of today's debate.  It is possible to get the money and to spend it, but we must realise that if we are not vigilant there is the possibility that the pressure will not be kept up for the money to be delivered.  Over the period of the last Government more money was spent on the telephone system than had been spent in the 70 years of the State's existence.  Senator O'Brien made that point in a different kind of way.  I do not expect to follow him; I can only say it in my own way.  The fact is the money was there to bring in 136,000 new subscribers. That happened and it can be done again.</P>
      <P>We have to say to the Minister what Senator O'Brien said: &ldquo;We are with you all the way.  We believe in this. We know it is a good idea.  We know the nation needs it.  We know there have been great developments.  We want to see those developments continuing&rdquo;. We want an understanding that the same sort of direction will be followed in respect of this Bill and that the money will be spent as it was over the past four years.  That is the only point at issue.  Every Senator is behind this Bill and knows the value of it.  There is no point making a political speech about this.  The only issue is: will the money continue to flow into this service as it has over the past four years and will it be consistent with the rate spent over the past four years?</P>
      <P>We welcome the Bill and want to see it passed fairly quickly.</P>

      <P>I should like to wish the Minister success in the programme he has laid down because it will be most important to the community that he has that success.  I would ask him to give definite consideration to the priorities in which he carries out the programme, priorities which are related to the needs of the present community. He may decide, for instance, that the commercial community for the sake of jobs requires first priority, that it is labour intensive and he wants to give employment on the actual installation of telephones.  But there is one area to which I would ask him to give first priority, and that is to the existing installation.  The existing installation is causing frustration and loss of trade.  Even on the existing installation one can dial numbers and keep getting the wrong ones.  When one cannot get a number one can dial the exchange and wait half an hour to get a reply.  This is particularly so in the evening and at night.  As to whether there is sufficient manning of the exchanges I do not know.  Therefore I stress that the Minister should have a good look at the existing installation and the maintenance of it.</P>
      <P>As we are all aware, the present industrial dispute is having an effect on the service.  I do not want to speak on the merits or demerits of the dispute, just the results, especially in the Cork area where we have had the main problem.  Industry is being affected and orders are being lost.  There are other spheres.  For instance, there is a home for old people with which I am connected. There are 100 old people, mainly bed-ridden, there and that home does not even have a telephone.  If a fire started during the night how would they get the fire brigade?  Therefore I stress the first priority should be the present installation.  I would ask the Minister to consider putting as many cables as possible underground in new installations to retain the amenity of our country.</P>

      <P>I do not think it is necessry for me to repeat what I said in Irish, but in case it is I should like very briefly to thank the Senators who congratulated me on my appointment as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  I appreciate their good wishes.</P>
      <P>I would like to take this opportunity of thanking all the Senators who contributed to this wide-ranging debate. It has been stressed that it is of paramount importance that the telephone service should be improved and developed as rapidly as possible.  The general support for the Bill in this House, as well as in the other House, is indicative of the general consensus on this point.  I accept that some impatience was expressed in relation to deficiencies that still exist, but there was a general recognition in the speeches made here that there is no easy short-cut to the achievement of a modern efficient telecommunication system.  I should like to assure the House that there is no lack of a sense of urgency in my Department about the need to improve the service.  Intensive efforts have been made to achieve higher standards.  This Bill can be taken as an earnest of the Government's intention to ensure that we will have a telephone service that is as good as the best to be found elsewhere in the shortest possible time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would comment briefly on some of the points made by the various speakers.  Senator McCartin spoke <Col N="145" /> mainly about the priority situation.  At present about 45 per cent of applications are in priority categories.  It will be appreciated that if we were to add many more categories to the present priority categories we would totally erode the value of the priority rating. While farmers are not in a priority category, nevertheless where a farmer provides a fair amount of employment he does qualify for priority treatment.  I doubt if it is necessary for me to read out a list of the priority categories but it will be appreciated from the figure I have given&mdash;45 per cent&mdash;that if we add many other categories to the priority list it would mean little or nothing.</P>
    <P>I fully agree with Senator Conroy when he said that an effective telecommunication service is vital to economic development.  I have stressed this on many occasions since I became Minister.  It is generally accepted, when we look at the very high rate of development in the other countries of the Common Market, that we have a considerable way to go and that it is essential that we should travel this road as rapidly as possible so as to ensure that we will eventually and in the quickest possible time reach the same stage of development as other EEC countries.</P>
    <P>Senator Cruise-O'Brien, Senator Keating and other Senators pointed out that the Bill is an enabling one and that there was no assurance that the full £350 million would be provided as planned year by year or within any particular period of years.  This is of course the legal position.  It is designed to ensure that the Government and the Minister for Finance, indeed the Oireachtas, have control of the allocation of capital resources from year to year.  However, Senator Cruise-O'Brien, having been Minister, will agree with me that the reality is that the telephone service cannot be extended on any worth-while scale without entering into considerable long-term contracts, and increasing staff and other resources.  The scale of long-term contracts and the other commitments is determined by the size of the programme drawn up in connection with each Telephone Capital Bill.  Indeed, <Col N="146" /> the size of the programme covered by the 1973 Act was determined by what had been done and planned beforehand.  Most of the schemes carried out in the 1973-77 period&mdash;including, for instance, the major Crown Alley scheme which was completed last year&mdash;were initiated a considerable time before 1973.</P>
    <P>I am not making a political point of this anymore than Senator Cruise-O'Brien did.  In my opening speech I gave the factual situation.  I am simply saying that if we had to argue on a political basis, I would have to say that the planning was done prior to 1973 &mdash;which it must necessarly have been &mdash;for the programme carried out since then.  Then of course Senator Cruise-O'Brien could say to me that the planning has already been done in his time for the next programme.  It is not a political point; it is simply pointing out the actual situation.  I can give every assurance that the Government are as committed as it is possible to be to ensure that the major development on the proposed scale is achieved.</P>
    <P>Senator Brugha mentioned the European Investment Bank loan.  These loans are made to the Minister for Finance and are, as the Senator said, related to the level of national investment in the telephone service.  It is expected that the level of the loans will not be less in the future than they were in the past.</P>
    <P>The Senator also referred to the satellite earth station.  This satellite earth station will be located in this country but it will operate through a space satellite which will be shared with other countries, mostly in Europe. I should perhaps add that the Department owns a share in an earth station in Goonhilly, Cornwall, and many of our international trunk circuits are routed through communication satellites</P>
    <P>Senator Keating also referred to the need to improve the quality of the telephone service.  I certainly would agree with him there.  It will be one of our objectives in the period to which this money refers to endeavour to improve it.  Senator Cranitch, Senator Mulcahy and Senator Keating asked if <Col N="147" /> the civil service was a suitable organisation for the task of development.</P>
    <P>First of all, I suppose I should say that it is important that the organisation of the body responsible for the telephone service should be reviewed at intervals to ensure that it is the most appropriate for the task.  The Government have already indicated publicly their recognition of the importance of organisation as an aid to efficient management.  They have announced that they are committed to the reorganisation of the public service and that they regard it as an urgent matter.</P>
    <P>Any reorganisation of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, including the telephone service, will be considered in the context of the reorganisation of the service as a whole.  I doubt if it is possible for me to be more precise at the moment except perhaps to refer to the Public Services Organisation Review Group mentioned by Senator Mulcahy.  In their report in 1969, the Group did not recommend that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs should be set up as an autonomous State-sponsored body like the ESB, although they did not rule this out for the future.  I should like to point out that I am not excluding it from consideration as a possibility on some future date, but a move of this kind is not envisaged at present. There are many problems and difficulties involved in this and I feel that at the moment it is essential that we should concentrate all the energies we have in resolving the particular problems and difficulties which now face us without entering into new commitments of this kind immediately.</P>
    <P>Senator Cooney referred to the industrial unrest.  I regret that the industrial action should be continuing and that subscribers should have been deprived of both telephone and telex service for periods during the past few months.  I have assured the union executive and the staff concerned that if they called off their industrial action and returned to the use of the agreed negotiation machinery, their problems would be dealt with speedily and <Col N="148" /> sympathetically.  I want to repeat that&mdash;speedily and sympathetically. I would add that the Department are most anxious to enter into a productivity agreement with the engineering staff and are satisfied that there is scope for a substantial increase in output which would bring about benefits to the staff and to the users of the service.  An unfortunate result of the industrial action taking place is that negotiations on a productivity agreement are in abeyance while industrial action continues.  I feel it is very much in the interests of the staff that all industrial action should be brought to an end immediately and I would again appeal to the staff to end it.</P>
    <P>I would like to say to Senator Cooney that I propose to meet the Irish Congress of Trade Unions tomorrow on this matter.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Toole mentioned the problems of telecommunications in the West of Ireland, and I think Senator McCartin also mentioned them.  I would accept that because there are so many manual exchanges there are problems, but he will see in my opening speech I referred to the fact that we propose to change over to automatic as quickly as we can and this will probably be of considerable assistance.</P>
      <P>Senator Lanigan referred to vandalism in relation to telephone kiosks.  I would like to say that we have in recent times taken steps to make these kiosks less susceptible to vandalism by fitting steel plates to which the kiosk boxes are bolted and so on.  I regret very much there is so much vandalism in relation to these kiosks.  I have already mentioned in the Dáil, and I repeat it here, that the cost of repairing damaged kiosks in Dublin in 1975 was about £84,000 and so far as I am aware this year the cost is running at about the same level. It is a serious matter and I feel public opinion might usefully be brought to bear on this particular matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Harte and Senator Jago, mentioned priorities and the need to <Col N="149" /> give priority to servicing existing installations.  We are doing our utmost to improve the service.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to say that I have tried as best I could to deal with the main points made during the debate. It is possible that I may have missed some of them.  The comments were numerous and so varied that it was difficult to cover them all.  If any Senator considers that I did not reply to a point made or if he would like more information than I have already given in my reply, if he would let me know I would be very glad to write to him on the matter.  I would like to express m thanks to all the Senators who contributed to the debate on this very important Bill.  I can assure them that the comments and the criticisms they have made will be closely studied by my Department and action will be taken where appropriate.</P>

      <P>I should like to confine my remarks to the words &ldquo;the Minister for Finance may issue out of the Central Fund or the growing produce thereof&rdquo; and the final words &ldquo;according to estimates approved by the Minister for Finance&rdquo;. The Minister, in his interesting statement replying to the Second Reading, referred to the point made from this side of the House by various Senators and myself to the effect that this was an enabling Bill which guarantees nothing.  He treated that as a somewhat technical or legalistic point and he sought to convey the impression that, because advance planning existed, assuming a certain level of investment, of expenditure, that therefore the investment would somehow automatically follow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="150" /> This is quite misleading.  To take a homely example from the area where I live myself, plans have existed for decades for the development of Howth harbour but Howth harbour never gets developed because nobody provides the funds.  In this exact area, planning existed at the end of the sixties for certain major developments which did not then happen because in 1970-71 the then Minister for Finance, who has always had the powers under these Telephone Acts, refused to give the money; and over the protests of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs he cut that back, with consequences that have still to be felt.</P>
    <P>Having pointed out that this Bill was enabling only, I asked the Minister for certain very specific and concrete assurances that the level of investment achieved over the past four years would be maintained in the future.  He did not find it possible to give exactly that.  He said the Government are as committed as it is possible to be to ensuring that an investment on this scale is achieved.  With respect, that commits him to nothing, or not very much.</P>
    <P>This House has to bear in mind when it reads these words &ldquo;according to estimates approved by the Minister for Finance&rdquo; that the very same Minister for Finance we now have showed himself at the beginning of this decade so insensitive to the need for development in this area that he cut back, so when we note this enabling section we have a right to raise that query.  Is that likely to happen again?  We hope it will not.</P>
    <P>I am quite sure that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs will do his level best, as I did and my predecessor did, to maintain the necessary level of investment.  I assure him that everything from this side is intended to strengthen his hand in seeing that the necessary investment is made but we should not believe that it follows automatically from the existence of plans in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. The Department have been told in the past &ldquo;You will have to forget about your plans for this year and maybe a few years ahead.  That is less urgent than a lot of other things that <Col N="151" /> have to be done.&rdquo;  The consensus in this House has been that investment on this scale is necessary and Senators, as well as Members of the Dáil, will wish to see that it actually happens. All we are doing now is allowing the Minister for Finance to authorise it.  It remains to be seen whether he will or not.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to raise the statutory limit on the borrowing powers of the Industrial Credit Company and to bring up to date the formula for converting into their equivalent in Irish currency borrowings by the company in foreign currencies and guarantees of borrowing in foreign currencies given by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Industrial Credit Company was established in 1933.  Its function is to provide industrial credit mainly of a long-term nature.  There has always been a statutory limit placed on the extent to which the company may borrow in the conduct of its operations, and this limit has been extended from time to time as occasion required by amending legislation.  The existing limit on borrowing is £75 <Col N="152" /> million.  Outstanding borrowings now total £72 million and are rising rapidly as the company's business continues to expand.  On the basis of firm commitments already entered into by the company it is probable that the statutory limit will be reached by mid-November, 1977.  It is essential, therefore, that the present limit be raised to enable the company to continue its very useful work.</P>
    <P>The new limit proposed in section 2 of the Bill is £200 million.  An increase of £125 million may be considered to be very large.  ICC business is, however, steadily growing and is at present at a level of above £30 million per annum and it is likely that this growth will continue.  Lendings of £30 million would involve borrowings by the company of some £25 million.  Hence an increase of the limit on borrowings to £200 million should suffice to enable the company to borrow its requirements for a further four to five years before Oireachtas approval has again to be sought.  This is the normal period which elapses before legislation of this nature is amended.  I do not think that Senators will regard this period as too long.</P>
    <P>The legislation applying to the Industrial Credit Company has incorporated in it a formula for converting foreign currency into Irish currency for the purpose of determining to what extent any particular borrowing in foreign currency counts against the statutory limit referred to above which is expressed in Irish currency.  This formula provides that the basis for conversion shall be the International Monetary Fund parities in operation at the date of borrowing.  The formula is no longer appropriate because of the increasing number of exchange rate changes and the prevalence of floating rates at present, and it is proposed to update the formula in the manner set out at section 2 (b) of the Bill.  A similar updating is necessary in the case of the formula for converting into Irish currency borrowings in foreign currency which are guaranteed by the Minister for Finance pursuant to powers conferred by existing legislation. The new formula is to be found in section 3 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="153" /> The company has budgeted to provide financial facilities totalling £30 million for industry in the current financial year.  In the previous year&mdash; that is, to end of December, 1976&mdash; the company disbursed £27 million which was in itself a record figure.  Of the £30 million which the company will advance up to December next, £5.3 million relates to loans for the building of new vessels within the country and will be provided by its subsidiary company, Shipping Finance Corporation.  The balance will be disbursed by the ICC itself for the benefit of industry in general.  Most of the capital needed by the ICC is secured from non-Exchequer sources, and it is hoped that this position will continue. The capital required to enable Shipping Finance Corporation to provide loans for ship-building is made available by the Exchequer as it is relevant at a subsidised rate of interest.</P>
    <P>The Industrial Credit Act of 1933 conferred wide powers on the company enabling it to underwrite capital issues, to provide issuing house facilities and to make long and medium-term capital available, particularly for the establishment of new industries. While the Industrial Credit Company operates as a commercial undertaking and has been a profitable enterprise since its establishment, its primary aim is to contribute to national economic expansion.  It examines sympathetically every project brought to its notice having regard particularly to economic soundness, employment potential, importance to the proposed locality and utilisation of indigenous raw materials and of the services and products of existing industries.  Its facilities have been availed of over the entire range of industry and in all parts of the country by large, medium and small undertakings.</P>
    <P>Over the last decade the ICC has considerably expanded its activities. The company has extended its services to include the provision of hire-purchase facilities for plant and machinery, equipment leasing and finance for distribution.  In addition to the provision of capital, the ICC has also a subsidiary company, Mergers Limited, which specialises in the field of mergers <Col N="154" /> and takeovers by undertaking share evaluations and by advising in negotiations for mergers between firms. As I have already mentioned, it is also concerned with shipbuilding finance through its other subsidiary company, Shipping Finance Corporation.</P>
    <P>In view of the need for higher industrial investment to promote economic growth, there will be a continuing and increasing demand for the facilities provided by the company, particularly in the climate of great optimism which is currently manifesting itself.  I am most anxious, therefore, that the company should be in a position to contribute to industry the fianancial and organisational expertise which it has built up over the years in addition to financial assistance.  The proposed legislation when enacted will enable the company to maintain an appropriate flow of funds to industry.</P>
    <P>Because of the probable high rate of demand for industrial finance over the next few years as industrial investment continues to recover and because of the capital intensive nature of modern industry, it may not be easy for the company to procure without recourse to the Exchequer all the funds which industry is likely to require. In seeking funds from the Exchequer, the company's requirements would have to be balanced against demands on behalf of other important services.  It is hoped, therefore, that the initiative shown by the company in the past in raising capital from non-Exchequer sources can be maintained and intensified.</P>
    <P>For over 40 years the ICC has been to the fore in the financing of Irish industry. Many of the successful indusries established over that period started from modest beginnings with the assistance of finance provided or arranged by the company.  Facilities are provided for the establishment of new industries as well as the expansion of existing firms and the company has a tradition of giving special attention to proposals in regard to small projects.  The continuing increase in the demand for the company's facilities is proof that its importance has in no way diminished with the emergence <Col N="155" /> of present-day financial institutions in the private sector.  The present legislation will enable the company to continue its important role in the development of the economy and I confidently recommend the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndyOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and regard it as a mark of confidence in the industrial development of the country.  The statutory limit placed on the amount which the ICC may borrow is to be increased from £75 million to £200 million, an increase which should draw public attention to the magnitude of the assistance to industrial development given by the ICC.  It is sensible on the part of the Minister to enable the ICC to raise the limit and thereby enable the company to make plans for a period of four to five years.  Attracting new industries to the country can often be a long drawn out process and it is essential that the ICC should be assured well in advance of the availability of funds. Modern industry is becoming more and more capital intensive and the requests for assistance are likely to grow accordingly.  We hope, therefore, that the company will be progressively more and more successful in raising capital from non-Exchequer sources.</P>
      <P>The greater public awarness of the part played by the ICC and the ACC in building up our economy should convince people of the desirability of investing with them, thereby contributing to the national growth. Investment in Irish enterprise is a very practical form of patriotism. When we use the phrase &ldquo;Support Irish Industry&rdquo; we should think of it in its broadest sense of helping to establish and develop industry as well as buying Irish-made goods as far as possible.  In this way we support those who put their capital and their labour into industrial development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to see the maximum development of industry based on home-produced raw materials and I believe there is a future for the development of industry based on agriculture.  I cite, for example, the success of Bord Bainne and <Col N="156" /> Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann in this field.  The development of small industries is to be encouraged and I believe there is a growing demand for handmade goods of good design and workmanship.  The record of our small industries during the period of recession is highly creditable and would justify further investment in that type of industry.  There is much to be said, too, for aiming at establishing industry based on highly technical skill and craftsmanship.  The market for such goods grows and is likely to develop as the number of our tourists grows in coming years.</P>
    <P>I should like to put on record our appreciation of the part played by Irish Shipping in the development of our economy and hope for its continued growth in this highly competitive sphere.  The provision to help meet the difficulties arising from fluctuations in the rate of exchange is necessary and, of course, welcome. In general I extend to the Bill a sincere welcome.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The present statutory limit stands at a figure of £75 million. The cumulative outstanding borrowing to date stands at a figure of £72 million.  For those reasons, if for no other reasons and there are many, this Bill is necessary to extend the statutory limit on the amount which may be borrowed by ICC.</P>
      <P>I want to raise one matter with the Parliamentary Secretary and it refers to the formula which is incorporated in the Bill.  I presume the Parliamentary Secretary could assure us, in view of the recent British decision to allow the £ to float and uncertainties in exchange rates, that this formula will be able to stand up to the uncertainty in world markets and will protect the borrowing in which ICC will be involved.  This is important, particularly in view of recent happenings on the monetary front, and would be if at some future date the position <i>vis-á-vis</i> sterling were to be re-examined. This formula should be looked at now in the light of all the developments in the international monetary situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, when this Bill was <Col N="157" /> going through the Dáil, pointed out that he hoped the ICC would not have to borrow any of this £200 million from the Exchequer.  That is a view that I share very strongly.  I believe that we must encourage more and more State and semi-State companies to stand on their own feet and to do so as soon as possible.  In underwriting the various activities of these organisations we should constantly encourage and remind them that they should as soon as possible endeavour to stand on their own feet without the necessity of continuous guarantees.</P>
    <P>I want to join in the appeal made by the previous speaker and in the Dáil that the ICC should get more involved in helping small industries and do so rather dramatically, particularly in view of the unemployment problem.  I know that this concerns the IDA as well.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned in the Dáil that a proportion of the ICC capital would be available for what he termed venture capital.  I would like to think that the proportion of venture capital which is available to the ICC is significantly high&mdash;not just a nominal or marginal amount but a realistic figure which is geared to helping small industries which do not involve a tremendous risk.  An increased commitment is required from the ICC to the small industries of this country.</P>
    <P>The Industrial Credit Company should not be allowed to become a commercial bank in the ordinary sense of the word.  They were set up some 40 years ago to encourage Irish enterprise and they should keep that in the forefront of their mind and not get sucked into the world of general commercial banking at the expense of Irish industry generally.  It is important that that priority of the ICC be kept firmly in their minds.</P>
    <P>When this was going through the Dáil, Deputy Moore made what I thought was a novel suggestion, which was repeated in this House.  He said the average Irish person is not aware of the work that the ICC do and for that reason a promotional drive should be undertaken to attract the money which is in the hands of Irish people into the ICC.  He made the novel suggestion that the trade unions in particular <Col N="158" /> might have a look at their own funds with regard to investing some of them in the ICC where the funds invested are State guaranteed.  It is not our business to tell the trade unions how to invest their funds, but I for one would strongly recommend to them&mdash; I join with Deputy Moore in the suggestion&mdash;that they take a look at their funds with a view to helping Irish employment and an Irish semi-State company by investing their funds, thus reducing the necessity of the ICC to take up some foreign borrowing or indeed to come to the Exchequer.  Indeed, all organisations should have that in mind, but particularly the trade unions who have such a tremendous interest in employment in this country and the money used by the ICC, I presume, is used mainly for the purposes of employment.</P>
    <P>The urgency of the unemployment situation seems to dictate to us the necessity for big industry and the necessity for us to get a quick cure for unemployment problems.  Indeed, large industry is a very dramatic, clean cut and quick way of doing this.  I believe that in the long run a proliferation of small Irish-owned industries would provide diversification of financial risks, and we need that diversification in a commercial world which is very risk-ridden at the moment.  In the long term we should encourage that, and the ICC should particularly look into their hearts on that point and see to it that in the long term we get this diversification of risk by having a greater proliferation of small industries.</P>
    <P>This Bill asking for this rather large increase in authorisation demonstrates tremendous confidence by the Irish people in themselves.  It demonstrates the confidence of the Houses of the Oireachtas in their own ability.  Above all it demonstrates the tremendous confidence which ICC have in their future, and I for one, on my very first day speaking in this House, wish them the very best.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill that will meet with widespread support for the precise reason that Senator Brennan has just given.  In passing, may I welcome him.  This is the first time I have heard him speak.  I find <Col N="159" /> myself in agreement with some of the points he made.  I also welcome the Parliamentary Secretary.  I am moved to notice, not because it is important in itself but because it relates to a trend that I find very worrying, a departure by the Parliamentary Secretary from the circulated script. It is a departure of two letters which he may have made accidentally, or it may have been subconscious or it may have been altered.  On page three of the script I got, in the last paragraph it states, &ldquo;particularly in the climate of greater optimism which is currently manifesting itself&rdquo;.  What I heard the Parliamentary Secretary say was &ldquo;particularly in the climate of great optimism&rdquo;, not &ldquo;greater&rdquo; but &ldquo;great&rdquo; optimism.</P>
      <P>What worries me about that, and particularly if one takes it in the context of other things which I have heard in the House today&mdash;I will mention what they are in a moment and I am not being mysterious about them&mdash;I am afraid of complacency. The performance about investment, the performance of industrial production and indeed agricultural production, the performance of exports of both kinds, are very good now, but such is the time lag in the collection of statistics and at the level of national Government between decisions and the results of those decisions, such is the inevitable length of the pipeline, that the figures currently available to us are entirely the results of previous activities.  Lest I be taken as simply emphasising the good figures, let me say that the bad figures in the economy&mdash;and there are bad figures in the economy&mdash;are also the result of inherited situations because with the time lag in statistical collection and the time lag in the turning around of such a large engine as the national economy there is, apart from a mood effect, no actual measureable physical effect in the performance of the economy and statistics coming through to us as a result of anything that the new Government have been able to do since 5th of July.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were talking earlier today on another Bill about export promotion <Col N="160" /> about some excellent figures.  There are excellent figures.  But this Bill is about industrial investment and about a large increase in moneys available and that is something that will certainly find no opposition from me.  In regard to investment&mdash;I would be happy to be wrong and it is a thing that we will know one way or the other because these figures will come out&mdash;we have very elegant statistics but I often worry that they are a bit too slow to be of use to those persons who are trying to manage the economy.  They come out of the pipeline so late that by the time we get a useful statistic the opposite trend may have set in in the economy.  They are very well prepared by expert people but I should like to get them quicker.  We know from the figures whether with &ldquo;great&rdquo; optimism or &ldquo;greater&rdquo; optimism is an adequately responsible way to look at the investment situation at the moment.  Let me mention a few things.</P>
    <P>I said earlier today that labour peace, good labour relations is one of the most important single determinants to making a ranking order.  Can it be said in recent months that that characterises this island?  While there will be another debate in another place, we have had a very striking intervention in one large and serious dispute. We cannot say that the labour front, from the point of view of investment, is a happy one at the moment.  Far from it.  We have had the dramatic surfacing in recent times of another very serious treat to investment which is the threat to export tax relief.</P>
    <P>I think it is necessary that every possible working of the corridors and contents and intimate knowledge of the Brussels apparatus will be continuously developed by the new Government.  I say this across the lines of party because this is a thing the country needs quickly&mdash; the best most delicate relationship with Brussels to see that that sort of threat to investment confidence does not surface in the way that it has surfaced. I do not think that the current unemployment statistics and the most recent ones, if you look at the figure again, show any grounds for complacency.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="161" /> I heard the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy suggest here today that the upfloat of the pound from a low of about $1.58 to a current&mdash;I did not see today's figures&mdash; $1.86, an increase of almost 28 cents on a low point of $1.58, was not very important.  I think when we start looking at export figures we have to take the agricultural exports at Community fixed prices to a British market out of them and look at the trend of what our industrial exports are doing on British markets.  If you filter down to the real figures, where they are variable, because we have a good old market in Britain for agricultural stuff and the price of that is fixed, in the areas which are very price-sensitive in the industrial sector I think an increase from $1.58 to $1.86 in a short period is serious.  I would not have expected it to show up yet.  Certainly the downfloat was helpful to us and I say in diminution of the efforts of my own Department, which I am proud of, we were very much helped by the downfloat of the £, and the corresponding upfloat cannot be swept under the carpet.</P>
    <P>Those are four major contributors to investment confidence, none of them great just now.  I was very interested in what Senator Brennan said and was in agreement with it.  What I see in the investment situation in Ireland is a differentiation because of the new high technology&mdash;let us take a pharmaceutical plant as an example with the best technology in the world, the best product development, the best R and D in the world doing superbly with a tremendous return on capital.  What about footwear, clothing, textiles, furniture? As well as a differentiation about product area there is a differentiation about size, and that is where I agree so much with Senator Brennan when he asked what about the little ones and the weak ones?  The dramatic overall figures hide a movement in office, a movement of the strong&mdash;I do not say that xenophobically but factually&mdash;there is a tendency for the strong and the firm to get stronger and for the small and indigent to get weaker.  That is a very serious tendency for our economy.</P>
    <P>When Senator Brennan asked us to <Col N="162" /> remember the role of the ICC and let us remind them to aim their efforts towards the indigent and the small, I agree completely and I am happy to hear it expressed.  Perhaps as a result of the efforts of being in Government I realise that structural reforms are very important for getting things done. I am repeating something I said previously.</P>
    <P>I believe that the place of the ICC is in the engine department of economic growth, the Department of Industry and Commerce, which has already been improved by having Energy allotted to it.  I thought we had a decision under the previous Government that the ICC would go to the Department of Industry and Commerce.  They belong there. This is not empire building on my part, it is clearly a new element, and I can make that statement now because it does not concern me any more.</P>
    <P>The Department of Finance, let us use the British name for it, the Treasury, are essentially restrictive. They are a gatherer and a hoarder and they say: &ldquo;Fellows do not get too wild, do not get too expansive, do not go too hard.&rdquo;  A Department of the Economy&mdash;if I use another British word for something that did not happen but the British wanted to happen: poor old George Brown blew it at the crucial moment, but it was a good idea, is essentially a go-go, invest, push Department and there ought to be a balance between them and there ought to be fruitful competition between them. The balance involves the strengthening of Industry, Commerce and Energy and the fruitful competition involves one gathering and holding, the other pushing out and concerning itself with every development.  An organ of development ought to be directed towards the small and the indigent. primarily, because the big and the international are much easier to fund. better connected with banks, have much better return on capital and discount in cash flows.  The ICC ought to be in Industry, Commerce and Energy.  I offer that thought gratuitously to my successor.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself in agreement with the theory of what Senator Keating said about the Department <Col N="163" /> of Finance, although the practical effect over the years has been that the ICC has not been hampered by lack of funds.  I was a Member of this House on the occasion five or six years ago when the forerunner of this Bill, bringing the amount up to £75 million, was introduced.  The activities of the Industrial Credit Company should be encouraged and supported by us all.  They have a record in the last 40 years of encouraging industrial expansion.</P>
      <P>I agree with both Senator Brennan and Keating that the emphasis, whereever possible, should be on risk capital to the smaller type of enterprise and the capitally weaker individuals. This is the kind of person who will not get the opportunity that the big guns can get.  We need to inject a flow capital here.  Senator Keating said that there is a tendency for the strong to get stronger.  We have a very good record in the past ten to 12 years in relation to the creation and development of small industries by the ICC.  The proof is there, and we should encourage the ICC to go further and try to find more outlets for the injection of capital in industrial development. The board and the staff of the company can rest assured that they are making a significant contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate Senator Dolan on his appointment as Cathaoirleach and Senator McCartin, a fellow countyman, as Leas-Cathaoirleach.</P>
      <P>It is very heartening to see that the ICC borrowing is moving up to £200 million.  As Senator Brennan said, unions and people generally should invest money in it.  I read somewhere that private enterprise, whether it is made up of unions or private individuals, has an investment of £80 million in the ICC.  We should encourage everyone to invest in the ICC.  Their terms are good and tempting and I doubt if there is better value anywhere, not alone the value they are getting but the value they are giving to the community as a whole.  The ICC help more than the people in the industrial world: they help people in the retail and wholesale outlets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="164" /> One of the reasons why the ICC were established was to provide finance and capital for industries that could not obtain it from the commercial banks.  It was not readily available at the time of the establishment of the ICC.  They certainly answered the call and provided the money.</P>
    <P>One might say that the ICC are now competing with the commercial banks.  Senator Brennan does not think that is a good thing but I certainly think it is a good thing.  If you approach a bank for loan for a ten-year period they are rather slow to consider giving you money.  They term that as a long period and people in the industrial world who want capital for building extensions to their wholesale or retail business do not think a ten-year period is very long.  For that reason I think it is a good thing that they are there.</P>
    <P>At the same time the ICC provide what is called venture money to small industries.  Some individuals might have a skill that could put them into some type of industry in a small town. They might be only employing two. three or four people.  The banks would be reluctant to give these people any money at all.  Naturally the ICC answer their call and there has been a number of these industries established in rural Ireland. particularly in the west, with the help of the ICC.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance started a small industries scheme and I remember discussing it with him at the time.  He did everything to see that the ICC made money available to those people.  The results are obvious now.  if one looks at the number of small industries in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>There is a question whether the Central Fund should subsidise the ICC because their rate of interest does not compare favourably with that of other lending societies.  The rate of interest of the ICC is in the region of 141 per cent for a ten-year period.  The rate of interest of the Agricultural Credit Corporation is 10½ per cent for a ten-year period.  I do not begrudge the farmers cheap money; the cheaper they get it the more we would all like it because it will go for agricultural <Col N="165" /> development which is an essential to keep our economy right, and I do not want anybody to misquote me on this. However, with the unemployment situation as it is whatever can be done to help the ICC to lend money at a cheaper rate of interest should be done.  Even if you succeed in getting money from the commercial banks for a ten-year period&mdash;and it is rather difficult to get it from them&mdash;the rate of interest is 11¼ per cent.  I am not commending that figure because of the difficulty of obtaining the money from the banks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Wyse)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal briefly with a number of points raised.  I want to thank everyone who contributed to the debate this evening and paid tribute to this State body. As Senator O'Brien said, I would like to see the ICC deposit schemes supported. Very attractive rates of interest are available and I welcome the comments on this aspect of the Bill. It is of vital importance that people would consider investing in something that would give them a return and yet goes directly to the development of industry in this country.</P>
      <P>Senator Brennan mentioned the great increase in small industries. There is a special scheme for under capitalised concerns and a significant amount of money is set aside for small and medium-sized industries.  The functions of ICC are set out here in my speech and I agree with Senator Brennan's point regarding the promotional drive.  A lot of emphasis is placed by ICC on bringing their services before the public.  Senator Brennan also enquired about trade unions.  Trade unions if they so wish could use the deposit scheme at the attractive rate of interest available. Senator Brennan also made reference to the question of rates of exchange mentioned in the Bill and also the very recent developments relating to the pound.  This Bill is really updating a former Bill but these matters will be kept under constant review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Keating referred to the export sales tax relief.  This is being looked at very closely at the moment by the Government and I can assure <Col N="166" /> him he will be hearing something more about it shortly.  There was no departure from the supplied script. We do not just look at optimism.  The figures are there to justify it.  In 1976 it was £27 million and we will be spending over £30 million this year.</P>
    <P>Venture capital is another matter referred to by Senators.  Frequently individuals with good ideas have difficulty in raising funds.  ICC are receptive to these ideas and back them financially.  Senator Keating suggested that ICC would go to Industry and Commerce.  ICC is a financial instittion and as such appropriate to the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with a number of questions in the contributions and I want to thank Senators sincerely for their co-operation and for extending their good wishes to me in my new post.  I only hope that I will be worthy of this appointment.</P>

      <P>I considered when the Second Stage was going on whether I would make my contribution at that Stage or now.  I was made to shrink back into my place by the contributions that were made, because the points I wanted to make are on a different level, a type of technical level and not an unimportant technical level. It is with regard to the format of this Bill.  It is appropriate to look at this section when we are talking about the format of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Without hearing what the Parliamentary Secretary had to say or having followed what went on in the other House, what in God's name would that seem to someone who had not spent a long period of time locked up with <Col N="167" /> a series of books and a series of crazy tutors telling him how to read them? We are on the margin, &ldquo;Amendment of Schedule to Industrial Credit Act, 1933&rdquo;.  What is that to begin with? Why did they not bother to tell us what the Schedule to the Industrial Credit Act was?  Later the Bill states that &ldquo;paragraph 4 is hereby amended by the substitution in clause (i) of sub-paragraph (d)&rdquo;.  In case for a moment one is beginning to grasp what they are at they knock one crooked by adding, &ldquo;(inserted by the Act of 1971)&rdquo;.  They will not even tell one what section of the Act of 1971 it is.  One has to search through the entire Act of 1971 to find out what the section is.  I could go on but I have made my fundamental point here.</P>
    <P>It is a bit of fun for the likes of me to be trotting around these Bills but the more our statute law becomes a kind of professional secret shared between the enlightened lawyers and civil servants who he behind ever changing Ministers, the worse it is for those who have to do business knowing what their rights are.  What is disappointing to me is that at a certain stage during the late increasingly lamented regime some attempt was made to improve the quality of draftsmanship.  That attempt, I regret to say, having read some of their most recent Bills, was abandoned. A new practice was developing.  I dug up portion of one section which states:</P>
    <P>and the said paragraph, as so amended, is set out in the table to this section.</P>
    <P>One could read the whole paragraph and know that the 75 chickens cut up at the dinner had finally reassembled as in the paragraph or table.  That that has been abandoned is bad enough but what is worse is that this is the worst drafted Industrial Credit Bill since 1933 and they have had 44 years of attempting to achieve the record.  Every single previous amendment does the very thing I suggested this section ought do.</P>
    <P>If one looks back for example, having plenty of time on hands like me, to discover the actual section 5 of the Act of 1971 which inserted this stuff, one finds that the side note to section <Col N="168" /> 5 which would have been a great help to anyone reading this Bill the first time, states: &ldquo;Power of the company to raise or borrow by means of debenture or otherwise&rdquo;.  One cannot discover that except by an internal reference to the substitution in paragraph (d) of what was put in in 1971 of the following sub-paragraph for what was put in in 1974.  One can only infer that this is actually giving increasing borrowing power to the company.  Why do they not say that in the side note?  A very funny thing happens.  This may seem like a lot of nonsense because the Seanad have heard the Parliamentary Secretary talk and Members probably looked at the debate in the Dáil if they were misguided enough to think that that was a wise thing to do.  But time will pass on and the debates will get separated from the Bills, the Bills will be bound when they become Acts. They will be bound in a big volume and if one turns to that volume one has to go to an index to discover the other Acts referred to.  One has one foot here, another foot there, two feet holding down different documents trying to bring them all together, Of course, one does not have the Parliamentary Secretary's explanation about what it all means; that is in another volume.</P>
    <P>This is immensely important.  I am going to pin the blame for this on the Department of Finance, not on the parliamentary draftsman.  The parliamentary draftsman or whatever office he is in, which I believe to be the Attorney General's in ultimate representation, does what his client tells him to do, like any lawyer.  If his client tells him to make it clear he makes it clear but if his client tells him to make it obscure he makes it obscure.  I invite the Minister for Finance, through the Parliamentary Secretary, to give directions hereafter in relation to the preparation of Bills in his Department, if the Government do not accept the suggestions of Senator Keating that the whole thing be transferred from him anyhow to the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy, that these Bills be made as quickly readable as possible for people who have to operate them.  Apart from ourselves, apart from solicitors, there are, believe it or not, people who <Col N="169" /> will want to know and who will have to make rapid decisions.  They cannot spend hours at this and will go away crying if they cannot work it out.  It may marginally affect their position but they must waste time on it, time that could be better spent and, may I say, they will waste money also.</P>

      <P>This criticism is most unfair.  I should remind the Senator that we cannot repeat all previous legislation.  This Bill is just amending existing legislation but we cannot repeat all of it.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to delay the House but I did not invite the Parliamentary Secretary to repeat all previous legislation.  I invited him, however, to consider how this could be clarified.  For example, there is no problem about the side note.  One does not have to re-enact anything about the side note.  Secondly, there is no difficulty whatever about putting in a table at the foot of section 2 a summary of what the effect on paragraph (IV) of the Schedule is on the amendment affected by this section.  That presents no difficulty to any draftsman.  He has only to be told to do it.</P>

      <P>I do not think that what Senator FitzGerald is saying is intended to be a criticism of the draftsmen. He is finding it difficult as I do when I come to a Bill like this.  If it was not for the debate and also the debate in the Dáil it would be difficult to figure out what the thing is about. I have got into the lazy habit of looking at the money figure and that is <Col N="170" /> the key to me.  It is almost, in a sense, a sign language.  The suggestion Senator FitzGerald made that the explanations be expanded a little is a good one.  It is not a difficult thing to do and it could be helpful to some of us who are not accustomed to legislation of this type.</P>

      <P>In his mode Senator FitzGerald is both vehement and funny but in this matter he is very important.  I have no intention of opposing this section, the matter is urgent and, in general, we approve of it.  What I take Senator FitzGerald to be doing is making a plea, to which I should like to add my voice, to all those persons involved, be they in the parliamentary draftsman's office or any Department, and who have to try to express themselves in legal language, to do so as clearly as possible so that the law we are here enacting may be as accessible as possible and as applicable as possible as easily as possible by the largest number of people.  That is a proper plea and I support it.</P>
