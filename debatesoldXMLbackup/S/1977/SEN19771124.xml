      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 1, 2 and 3 in that order.  I also propose, with the agreement of the House, that if all stages of the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Bill, 1977, are completed today, the order fixing the Fifth Stage of the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 1977, for next Wednesday be discharged and that the Fifth Stage of that Bill then be taken.</P>

      <P>The motion which would establish the Joint Committee on European Communities Secondary Legislation was circulated yesterday and is No. 12 on the Order Paper today. Could I ask the Leader of the House if time will be given as a priority on the first sitting day of the Seanad next week so that we can debate the expediency motion and do all that we can to establish the Joint Committee on European Communities Secondary Legislation?  Also on the Order of Business for today, the Labour group propose to put down some amendments to the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Bill and we would hope to have an opportunity of discussing these on Committee Stage next week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelMulcahy" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I was putting emphasis on the need to look at what I called the planning imperatives as opposed to economic planning imperatives. The point I was trying to make is that planning, in itself, has a set of imperatives, and these have emerged over time as people have experimented with methods of planning.</P>
      <P>I would see these as coming under the following headings.  Planning is a process and, as I said, Eisenhower is said to have said plans never work but planning is everything.  So it is a process.  Any organisation system that deals with it has to recognise what is known as the law of requisite variety. Planning involves a goal-setting process which, in itself, has an inherent logic.  If we take those three first: planning is a process.  It must be interactive in that people who are interested in the evolution of a particular system, like a country or any corporate entity like a company, have to come together in what might be called a problem-solving mode, not just a consultative one.  It is my view that the failures of planning in the past have been due to the fact that people have tried to operate in this consultative mode which meant something like: &ldquo;We are doing a bit of planning; we have reached certain conclusions about the goals that should be accepted; and we are now consulting you about those goals.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If you like, the planning section of the Department of Finance, or some group from the National Economic Council, or the National Industrial and Economic Council as it was before, meet with businessmen and say: &ldquo;We are now consulting you.&rdquo;  But the businessmen did not have the opportunity to go through the same process the civil servants or the advisers went through in reaching an understanding about those goals.  As a result, the consultative process was a flop and did not work.  So planning must be interactive. The people involved must interact in reaching an understanding about desirable goals and how they might be achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously it must be adaptive and, by adaptive, I mean that if the conditions change, or the assumptions <Col N="469" /> under which plans are evolved in the beginning change, well then there must be a process of adaptation.  That must be planned and organised for itself.  It must roll forward.  The usual way of looking at that, as Senator Whitaker said, is that you have an annual review and you update, knock off one year, add another.  If you have five year planning you add on one more year. This is one way of doing it, but we need not be tied to it.</P>
    <P>Then there is the question about when the review should take place. There is no necessarily absolute logical agreed approach that the review should take place at the same time as the annual budget is taken.  As a matter of fact, I have found in my own work in corporate planning with companies, that it can be counter-productive to review a longer term plan at the budget period because, very often, the evolutionary and speculative and creative nature of the planning process can be drowned out by the realities of an annual budget and, if it is taken in the context of the Santa Claus atmosphere, as Senator Whitaker mentioned, that only makes matters worse. So there may be a case, in fact, for reviewing the&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether or not my colleague Senator FitzGerald is with me, but I believe the atmosphere of the annual budget can be counter-productive to creative planning.  That is what I mean by the process imperative.  It has to be organised for, and my conclusion is that the Department of Finance is not the place for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The law of requisite variety states that, if any unit of an organisation is going to plan for, control and regulate the operation of some organisation, it must have sufficient variety in its make-up to deal with the complexities that are ahead of that particular organisation.  It cannot be done by one <Col N="470" /> person.  The organisation for planning must be capable of dealing with those complexities.  If it does not, planning will not work.  The third imperative I am speaking about is the imperative of goal-setting.  If there is any aspect of planning which has reached some acceptance, any principle of planning which has reached some acceptance, it is the process of goal-setting.</P>
    <P>There are three levels of goal-setting researchers agree exist: the so-called normative level, the so-called strategic level and the operational level.  All three must be covered in any planning process.  The normative level has to do with the value system which the planners car those responsible for running a particular organisation or country have.  In other words, they say: &ldquo;Such and such ought to be done.&rdquo;  They do not necessarily know how, or in what time it can be done, or if the resources are there to do it, but they have the value which says: &ldquo;Such and such ought to be done.&rdquo; For instance, in five years' time our GNP <i>per capita</i> ought to be at a certain level, the output of our manufacturing industry ought to be at a certain level, the reward systems ought to be, and so on.</P>
    <P>Given that some attempt is made to take a visionary view of things along those lines, it is possible to move to the next level which is the strategic level.  This level has to do with: how can we move towards that vision we have of what ought to be done?  What is on, in other words?  What resources have we at our disposal?  How might we deploy them across alternative routes to that desirable end position? Very often people who are good at operating at the strategic level, that is, working out these various options, generating and evaluating them, may not be the type of people capable of taking the normative view.  This has to be recognised.  In any Government system I would see the Cabinet coming forward with some normative views. That is what they are elected for.  I would see a different layer, having a look at the strategic aspect and that is why I think it is a good thing to have a separate planning Department. People have to be fast on their toes <Col N="471" /> when dealing with strategy.  Clauswitz said: &ldquo;In der Bewegung liegt der Sieg.&rdquo;  (&ldquo;In movement lies victory.&rdquo;)</P>
    <P>The third level is the operational level and this is where each Department gets on with the action which is cleared within the time period of, say, one and a half years.  The strategic time period is usually more like one and a half to five years.  The normative is more like five plus.  Taking the operational level, each Department get on with the job, come up with their annual targets based on the budget within the goal set in the evolution of the strategy.</P>
    <P>Senators may feel that sounds a bit like a lecture on planning but it is an opportunity to get across at a national level that planning, in itself, is a complex process and must be handled as such, even though its various elements are simple.  To the degree that these steps I have outlined are ignored, planning will fail as it has in the past.</P>
    <P>The next question is the measures one will use to help to set goals.  The measures, words and yardsticks used in themselves can be inspirational or motivational.  The late Seán Lemass made GNP popular.  He brought it to the point where any individual felt he knew what gross national product meant.  Therefore, it was something worth working for, worth tracking.  I believe another measure should be made popular and I hope the new Department might work at it.</P>
    <P>The gross national product is made up of the sum total of all the added values produced in the country by every company, organisation, and by Government activities.  I would like to see people thinking along the lines of: &ldquo;What did I do this week to create a little more added value for my country?&rdquo;  The more of that that is created, the more successful we will be economically.  If parallel with that we can discuss and resolve how that added value is to be shared out amongst the various interested parties, then we might take some of the heat out of this year-to-year fuss that goes on about wage negotiation.</P>
    <P>If the goal of added value is used <Col N="472" /> more often, and less emphasis is put on the proportions of the added value various interested parties want to optimise in their own interests, for instance profit, wages or tax, all of which together make up the added value, this is an area where somebody else could make a name for himself.</P>
    <P>The rewards for input to any social and economic system will be looked at by the interested parties.  Labour will look at it in terms of wages for work done.  Capital will look at it in terms of a fair return on investment. Enterprise has to be rewarded and this depends on how much residual is left at the end of the added value.  Risk, which is an essential part of enterprise, must be rewarded also.  If those interested in profits, returns on investment, wages and enterprising action, do not come together and recognise that they are all in for added value, then we will continue with the type of conflict we have had over the years.</P>
    <P>We had a number of contributions on the power required.  It was suggested the Department would not have enough teeth.  Power in any organisational system might be classified under the headings of structural power, sapiential power and moral power. Most of the discussion so far has been about structural power.  What power will the Department of Economic Planning and Development have over resources?  Can they influence income and expenditure?  There is structural power in this system.  Senators will recall from the debate on the Bill on science and technology that there is a science budget.  The science budget, in itself, will provide teeth for this Department. Periodically the Department will have to look at expenditure across the country in this area.  It has been written into legislation that this must be done.  Likewise, we have the National Economic and Social Council to examine on an objective basis what is going on and, obviously, the planning system will come under that. There is an influent power available there.</P>
    <P>The sapiential aspect of it is that the Department will be organised specially for planning.  One would hope that, <Col N="473" /> when we look at that Department, we will see expert planners and, as a result, we will listen to them.  The moral power will be there because planning tends to be seen as good.  Very few people knock planning.  The most famous of the researchers who has written on this area, a man called Lindblom, talks about an alternative to planning being muddling through. Even he has regard for the planners in the more elegant sense, in that he has made a name for himself by taking them on and coming up with an alternative which he calls muddling through.  God keep us from it.</P>
    <P>The next area I should like to refer to on the structural side is the whole question of the Devlin recommendations. Obviously, this Department will affect the approach to the reorganisation of the public service, and the Tánaiste has responsibility for that area.  I have written in the past that elaborate organisational development approaches to the reform of the public service may take decades.  Four functional specialists on planning, organisation, personnel and finance should be appointed to every Department immediately. This can be done within a few months.  It does not have to go through any of the more elaborate so-called organisational development approaches.</P>
    <P>The notion of the Aireacht and the notion of delegation of authority and responsibility from the Minister to other officials in the Department, making up the Aireacht, can follow.  In itself it is a notion which is fraught with many obstacles, the very least of them being the political obstacles. People do not like sharing power.  As long as people do not like sharing power, the notion of the Aireacht will be difficult to implement.  If those four functional specialists are placed in each of the Departments of Government&mdash;the planning, organisation, finance and personnel specialists&mdash; their very presence in the nest of the Minister in the Department will produce the change that we all want.  I will go further and say, I would hope that a goodly percentage of those specialists, say 30 per cent at the very least, should come from outside the <Col N="474" /> service, I guarantee that would produce change.</P>
    <P>The next areas I want to explore are the international aspects.  There is no doubt that planning, as an approach, has caught on in the more developed countries.  Other countries have Ministers for planning.  We know the more obvious ones like France &mdash; they have been at it for a long time &mdash; and we can see how the Japanese have worked operating with a Minister for planning. One area that impressed me immensely in the French scene, and it has something to do with better planning for industrial sectors, was a group set up under a Professor Tabatoni who is now a Minister of State in France to examine the strategic options available in each of the main industrial sectors.</P>
    <P>I would hope that within this new planning Department that we will have a project of this kind and the Department, working in parallel with the IDA, the IIRS and other State agencies who are taking an interest in this, will come up with a comprehensive review of the strategic options open to any company operating in a particular industrial sector.  In that way, they will help to produce a more sophisticated approach in the companies themselves.</P>
    <P>I recall that the National Industrial Economic Council in the 1964-65 period recognised the importance of planning at company level.  One of the ways they came up with to encourage that was the publication of an occasional booklet entitled &ldquo;Planning your Business&rdquo;.  That booklet was brought out to encourage Irish businessmen to plan and the carrot held out was that 50 per cent of the cost of a consulting assignment to get a planning system going in a company would be provided by the Department of Industry and Commerce.  After one year of its existence, and a fair amount of promotion of that book, I checked with the Department of Industry and Commerce to see how many people had taken up this option.  After one year two companies had done so.  That, to me, was failure.  It was failure because the planning imperatives I mentioned were not followed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="475" /> Even three or four years ago &mdash; ten years after the incident I have just related&mdash;the Irish Management Institute did research, and one of the dimensions of research they looked at was the extent to which planning was operating in various Irish companies.  Again, the figures were dismal.  Something less than 40 per cent of medium companies planned or attempted to plan in any organised way beyond one year.  Even in the larger companies, with over 500 people employed, some 20 per cent of the directors of the boards of companies stated there was no need for them to become involved in planning in the long-term sense.  I believe the steps taken by the new Government to set up a new Department for planning, as such, are giving good example to the country as a whole, and may well not only lead to better planning at Government level but also improve the approach to planning at corporate level and at the level of business.  I would be willing to take bets on that.</P>
    <P>Some points have been made about the failure of planning across the water in the planning department set up under George Browne.  While recognising some of the very valuable contributions made to the notions of democracy and administration by Britain, we should not be tied to their views because they slow us down.  We should look further afield.  We are now part of the EEC We can look at other countries.  Our Ministers interact with other Ministers outside that system, and we should look at the best, and not necessarily at one.</P>
    <P>We all know, again referring to the Crossman diaries, why there was failure there.  It was because the individual concerned lost the moral authority required.  He lost the support of the Prime Minister.  He did not have the complete collaboration of the Treasury Department which is required.  It is essential, regardless of what personalities occupy the roles of Minister for Economic Planning and Development or Minister for Finance, as Senator Whitaker said, that the officials of the Department of Finance co-operate in this.  In the same way, the financial controller of a company must co-operate with the corporate planner of <Col N="476" /> a company, and that in relation to financial aspects of the planning he does his bit.  It should not become a question of almost crying over the fact that a particular Department is losing portion of its original powers and some of its functions.</P>
    <P>Senators will recall that I said one of the first steps in the goal-setting process was getting the normative aspects sorted out, that is, what ought to be done.  This Department should not necessarily get licked into the economic issues alone.  It should suggest scenarios which are more visionary for the country as a whole and bring them before the Cabinet.  A well-known leader of this country produced various scenarios in his time among them the scenario of the comely maidens.  Perhaps we should be talking now about the scenario of the well-integrated, well-edncated, skilful young people of Ireland with a lot of confidence in themselves and their skills so that they will be able to run a nation which provides full employment and has an identity which is recognised and has evolved into a culture which in itself is distinctive and recognisable from the other cultures that we have to live with in the harmony of the EEC.  In other words, planning in total must take in all the dimensions, not just the economic ones alone.  We know that the social aspect is covered in that as well.</P>
    <P>The EEC are now talking about a five-year plan which involves the convergence of the economies of the constituent countries.  I believe the Minister was at a meeting this week where that particular plan was discussed. He will have seen there the complexity that lies ahead in dealing with and contributing effectively to that planning process.  I believe that this Government, in establishing a new Department of Economic Planning and Development, have taken a very significant step.  I agree entirely with Senator Whitaker when he says that that step will have more influence on changing the workings of Government than the influence of a new set of Ministers of State.  I commend this Bill wholeheartedly.</P>

      <P>It was interesting to listen to Senator Mulcahy speaking with a professional knowledge &mdash; I do not know whether to describe it as a science or an art but we will do the Senator the courtesy of saying it is both a science and an art&mdash;of planning.  I was amused to hear him say he would bet on the successful outcome of the new Department proposed.  I would advise him that the placing of bets is the very antithesis of good planning&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to look at this Bill with a crude political eye for a few moments, possibly in contrast to some of the views that have been expressed on it so far, to see how this Bill arose and where it came from and possibly speculate a little about its genesis.  I would look back as far as 1972, pre-1973, and see what the political scene was then in the Government of the day and how they were dealing with these matters.  One thing that strikes one in doing that is the fact that the present Minister for Economic Planning and Development at that stage was in the process of being a special adviser on the economy to the Taoiseach.  He was in a key position in the running of the affairs of the nation but he was also an outsider.  He was not at the Government table and more particularly and more significantly he had no influence in the Department of Finance, which at that time was the sole planning and financial Authority in the country.  That was the position then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a change of Government in 1973 and again in 1977 and that significant person, who was there in that sensitive place in the Government, is now an elected Member of the Parliament of the nation and is proposed as Minister.  We have to see him in the context of the election campaign, particularly in the context of the Fianna Fáil manifesto which was a most important document; it won the election for the Fianna Fáil Party.  When the manifesto was published it had to be sold.  Initially, there was some questioning about its credibility as to how Government could suddenly produce all of these millions; we had been told <Col N="478" /> for many years that the country was in recession, that the economy was struggling to come out of it, and yet here we had a manifesto producing an immense amount of goodies.  It had to be made credible and the person brought forward to do so was the Minister for Economic Planning and Development. With his status as an academic economist and with the title of university professor, and being an articulate, eloquent and convincing person, he had the job of selling the manifesto, a job he discharged very satisfactorily.  All of us, laymen and students, are in awe of university professors. As long as we are students and laymen we have no opportunity of observing the traces of clay around their feet, and the sale was able to take place effectively.</P>
    <P>The manifesto, with its promises of handouts on a very large scale, was sold successfully and there was a change of Government.  The question then arose of implementing the manifesto and giving out all of these hundreds of millions without, at the same time, unbalancing the economy or throwing things out of joint and undoing the good that had been achieved in the whole economic field. The question also arose, perhaps more important from the political point of view, if it should prove to be difficult or impossible to implement the manifesto fully, of explaining why it was not possible to implement it; why for example, it would be necessary to say that the reduction in unemployment targets could not be reached because of the intransigence of the trade unions or for this or that reason.  Again, to deal, not with the budget of 1978 but perhaps with the budget of 1979 it might be found necessary to improve the revenue-gathering position of the Exchequer in the event of people trying to avoid paying imposed new taxation.  They might have to do that. That would be a terrible blow to public expectation after being led to believe that taxation was even possibly on the way out.  Obviously, this would require some explanation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Senator quote the reference in the manifesto for that statement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying that was in it.  I am just talking of the expectation in the public mind.  Consequently, should that stage be reached where new taxes might have to be imposed in a budget once again, it would take some explaining.  I am sure the Minister for Finance would be pleased to allow that explanation to be handled by the person who would have the overall charge of the economy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Good planning involves looking to the future.  I am just looking to the budget, possibly of 1979 and the explanations that might have to be given.  I hope they will not have to be given but it is prudent on the part of the Government in mind that they might have to be given and provide for an economic overlord to give them in the same convincing way in which the manifesto was sold.  I concede that it was a work of political art. That is how I see the genesis of this new Department.</P>
      <P>I think it is a political exercise because I do not see any need for it.  It will duplicate the structures which already exist in Government to carry out any planning needed.  In the Department of Finance we have a Department which is heavily staffed. According to the State Directory for 1977 this Department has in its economic policy division a total personnel of 83, employing an assistant secretary, three deputy assistant secretaries, seven principal officers and 21 assistant principals. They are all very senior members of the public service and that is a very high level of staffing.  In addition, the public expenditure division has a total staff of 103.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from having a large number of skilled and expert personnel, the Department also has within itself an aggregate of many years of experience in the whole economic, planning, budgetary area.  These are records and files and the whole ethos of the Department is geared towards that sort of activity.  It has contacts at home; it has its own contacts within the public service; it has contacts with the private <Col N="480" /> sector and within banking circles and in industry and contacts in the academic world.  These contacts have been built up over the years and are immensely important in informing a Department such as the Department of Finance as to the general feel and state of the economy.</P>
    <P>The Department of Finance already has this expertise and function.  How will this be disturbed?  Will the section dealing with economic policy be moved completely into the new Department of Economic Planning and Development? Will the public expenditure division stay in the Department of Finance or will a few members from each of these sections move into the new Department? Will new sections be recruited for the new Department?  I do not know what will happen.  I see in the new Department a lot of duplication of what is already present in the Department of Finance.  The question automatically is raised as to which Department will be the prevailing one, which one will make the decisions.  Will the Government be involved in arbitrating on frequent occasions if there is any conflict between the two Departments?</P>
    <P>The Minister said that because they, the two Departments, are both concerned with the central co-ordination of Government business, the Ministers for Finance and Economic Planning and Development and their Departments will necessarily have a very close working relationship.  That is a nice way of putting it.  The Minister later in his speech spoke about the great care with which the Bill had been drafted.  I should like to compliment the person who drafted the speech on the equal standard of care used in getting over the very delicate issues involved.  The Minister then said:</P>
    <P>Although the functions of economic and social planning &mdash;</P>
    <P>that is one set of functions &mdash;</P>
    <P>and of budgetary and financial control will in future be organisationally separate they will both form part of the central co-ordinating system of Government with the main areas of contact in the preparation of the <Col N="481" /> budget and the development of the National Plan.</P>
    <P>Again, that is careful drafting but within that sentence there is the germ of an immense area of conflict, not abrasive conflict, but it has a potential for opposing views and contentious debate, much waste of time and resources and of national effort in trying to resolve these two roles in two different Departments when they should be in the same Department and under the ultimate control of one Minister.  To have the functions of economic and social planning on one side and the budgetary and financial control on the other side seems to me, as a layman and one not versed in this new art of planning, as described by Senator Mulcahy, to be daft.  I wonder if in many cases the planners' common sense sometimes slips out the window.</P>
    <P>What is proposed for the new Minister in the Bill is substantial.  As the Minister says, it has been very carefully drafted.  It would be no harm to look at it as drafted.  The important subsection is subsection (2) of section 2, paragraph (a) which tells us that the new Department will have the function to promote and co-ordinate economic and social planning.  Some Senators asked earlier if the new Department would have a social role and the answer is there&mdash;it has a social role. Even if it was not there, the Minister made it very dear on the Bill on the National Board of Science and Technology that he regards science in that context as not being exclusively the physical sciences but also the social sciences.  He was very specific that the social areas, the social sciences and their development and social planning were to be part of his empire.  We find that idea repeated here in specific terms.</P>
    <P>Senator Whitaker on the same Bill, the National Board of Science and Technology Bill, spoke, possibly through the voice of experience, about the word &ldquo;co-ordinate&rdquo; as it appeared in that Bill when he said that &ldquo;co-ordinate&rdquo; has the tendency to develop into control; that the word &ldquo;co-ordinate&rdquo; when provided for executive areas where there is no spending <Col N="482" /> power tends to be interpreted to compensate for the lack of spending power by turning into excessive interference. That is possibly a point of view which one could apply to the definition here &ldquo;to promote and co-ordinate economic and social planning.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a very specific function and a very specific direction to the Minister from Parliament as to what he is to do. The words &ldquo;direction to the Minister from Parliament as to what he is to do&rdquo; open a whole new area of consideration, the role of Parliament, the role of Minister, the role of Government and the operation of separation of powers, but that is by the way.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (b), after what has been described in the Minister's speech as the general mandate, gives some specific roles to the Department.  It will be required to identify the policies it considers necessary for general economic and social development and to report thereon to the Government.</P>
    <P>I want to draw attention to a sentence in the Minister's speech &mdash; this is an aside &mdash;&ldquo;The Department will be required to report to the Government on the policies it considers necessary for economic and social development.&rdquo; That is a perfectly simple statement which is understood by everybody. That sentence is repeated two sentences later in this fashion: &ldquo;The output of the analytical process will be reported to the Government by the Minister for Economic Planning and Development on the desirable direction of Government policy towards economic and social development.&rdquo;  Just, by the way, contrast those two sentences and I think in the second sentence we see a great deal that it wrong or that is off-putting in this whole planning area, a use of extravagant and contrived language.</P>
    <P>Again, during the Minister's speech he said that apart from its function to promote and co-ordinate economic and social planning and development the Department of Economic Planning and Development will be assigned certain more specific functions to enable it to act in the appropriate areas of Government. I would have liked to have known what these more specific functions <Col N="483" /> are likely to be, how they are anticipated and what is meant by the phrase &ldquo;to enable it to act in the appropriate areas of Government&rdquo;. Does this mean that it is to have some sort of final say in the policy-making in some of the Departments?  I would like the Minister to expand on that and give us some details of the more specific functions that the new Department will have and how he sees its role in relation to a particular Department. For example, the Department of Health is notoriously rapacious when it comes to gobbling up public pounds and it is also a Department with a high social profile &mdash; I am falling into the trap of contrived language that I just mentioned but the House will know what I mean &mdash; when that Department prepares estimates of its financial requirements to discharge its social functions.  The functions of economic and social planning might meet with the total approval of the new Department &mdash; they have been separated in the Minister's speech as being for this new Department &mdash; but could be totally at variance with the budgetary and financial control which might be necessary on the other hand and which will be imposed by the Department of Finance.  You then have a very odd situation, the Department of Health arguing with the Department of Finance for money for its social plans which have the approval of the new Department or perhaps <i>vice versa.</i>  The whole area seems to be fraught with confusion and wth potential acrimony.</P>
    <P>Again, to get back to subsection (2) (c), it gives the new Department the function to identify in consultation with Departments of State and to review and appraise the plans and activities of such Departments, giving effect to the policies for general economic and social development adopted by the Government.  Again, I think we have to look at these words carefully or closely because they have been carefully drafted.  The idea of &ldquo;review&rdquo; is to have a careful or a critical look back: it has the element within it of passing judgment.  I think that is the correct interpretation of the words in <Col N="484" /> this subsection because it is followed by or joined with the word &ldquo;appraise&rdquo; and that generally means to gauge something, or cost it or set a value on it.  Here we have the Department being given the job of identifying in consultation with other Departments of State and then to review and judge and give a value for and put a price on the activities of the other Department. That is a very wide and a very significant power and obviously has the capacity to grow into something really significant.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the empire which is being set up by the Bill is going to become, in effect, the Department of Finance.  What the role in the future for the Department of Finance is going to be, I cannot honestly say. It will possibly be purely a technical Department dealing with the collection of the excise and the administration of the Revenue Commissioners.  But as far as economic planning is concerned, as far as the supervision of the economy is concerned, this function is very clearly going to this new Department. Quite obviously, it is going to impinge more and more on the daily running of the Government and the daily activities of all Departments.  Possibly this may work out in a satisfactory and efficient way but, for the life of me, I cannot see why it is necessary to take from one Department and give to another Department these functions which already have been exercised. The only reason for it is to provide an empire or a seat in the public eye for the new Minister.  There was literally nowhere else to put him.  I think that is the main reason why we are faced with this new empire in this area.</P>
    <P>I hope that it will work because we all want to see our country progress economically and socially.  It is the common aim on all sides of the House. We may disagree as to the means proposed to achieve this end.  Indeed, when I consider this whole field of planning I look back on the last four years and consider the plethora of advice that the Government were subjected to during the time of recession. Captains of industry and princes of commerce at their general meetings, at this dinner and that dinner, the annual <Col N="485" /> gatherings of industrialists, the annual gatherings of trade unionists, all had advice to give to the Government of the day and very often much of that advice was given from the narrow point of view of their own sectional interest.  Of course when it was not taken there were irate reactions.  Likewise, people in the banking area, again speaking from the necessarily conservative standpoint of good bankers, had certain advice to give and no doubt had to suffer the frustration of seeing their advice ignored or not fully accepted.  But what we have to remember is that ultimately the buck stops with the Government of the day.  Planning theories were put forward by Senator Mulcahy, who described the science and theory of planning in relation to private companies.  However, there is a factor present in Government planning which will possibly always upset the most carefully laid plans of the theorists and that is that Governments are composed of politicians who have to fight elections and may find it necessary to fight elections on manifestoes which may be the very contradiction of what the economy needs.</P>
    <P>I think we saw an example of that in the last general election.  This is a political factor which comes into the picture where Governments and planning are concerned.  It is a political factor which is a volatile thing which has to be taken into account constantly and which causes Governments to disregard the strongest advice from the people in a position to give it.  Governments may have to disregard it because it is their responsibility to rule the country as they think best and for the benefit of the people.</P>
    <P>I hope that the new Department will work well.  I see grave dangers in it because it has attempted to duplicate what is already there in the Department of Finance.  I think, and I say this again, the reason that we are having this Department is that it was necessary to find somewhere of suitable eminence to put Minister O'Donoghue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully support the contents of this Bill, not only the concept of planning and development but <Col N="486" /> the proposal to set up a new and separate Department to take charge of planning.  I am not impressed by the arguments which have been put forward that a new Department was not necessary; that the Department of Finance could handle this assignment without the necessity for a separate Department.  The Department of Finance originally had what could be described as an overseeing role.  This was because that Department provided the finance and every other Department had to consult them from time to time.  This gave the Department of Finance an importance and an influence which tended to give them the position of overseer of what then went for planning.</P>
      <P>It must be recognised that up until the late 1950s, the role of the Department of Finance was very much a negative one.  It was a cautious role and it did not have an outlook which would favour planning and development. In the late fifties and early sixties the Department of Finance set up a planning division and in those years a great deal was achieved in regard to planning and development.  The fact that planning succeeded at that time was very much due to the personalities involved and very much at variance with what the history of the Department of Finance had been up to that time.  I pay tribute to Senator Whitaker who was one of the people very largely responsible for the success of planning at that time and for the fact that the Department changed its outlook in this regard.</P>
      <P>In regard to the setting up of this new Department, Senator Whitaker said that he was satisfied that the new Department headed by the Minister proposed for that Department and the Department of Finance under its present Minister would probably manage to get on very well together, that there would be no clashes, and that the arrangement would be a reasonably successful one but, he said, only because of the personalities involved. However, he envisaged a situation in a Government of the future where there might not be an ideological policy agreement between the two Ministers and postulated the problems that could then arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="487" /> I would look at this argument from a different point of view.  I believe that the present arrangement of a separate Department will always have a reasonable degree of success.  On the contrary I believe that personalities would be very important and possibly very disastrous if planning was left to the Department of Finance, because it would then depend very much on who was the Minister of that Department and on who was the secretary of that Department: if they did not believe that dedicated planning and development were necessary then planning within the Department of Finance would be anything but successful.</P>
    <P>I believe that old habits die hard and that the historic role of the Department of Finance is very likely to be repeated in the future, that the Department is quite likely in certain circumstances to revert to type.  By that I mean it will revert to the negative cautious role which it adopted in the past.  Consequently I favour the setting up of a new Department.  I would not think it wise to take the risk of leaving planning and development in a Department which might from time to time in the future revert to this negative and cautious role.</P>
    <P>Quite apart from this danger, I am not convinced that there is any good reason why planning should be in the Department of Finance.  It is not appropriate that planning should be in that Department.  From the practical point of view it is quite inappropriate that it should be in the Department of Finance as it exists today having regard to the very wide range of responsibilities that Minister and that Department have.  The Department of Finance in the last few years has taken on many extra assignments because of our membership of the European Communities. Because of the ever-increasing consultations that must be made with international bodies, the World Bank and so on, the responsibilities of the Minister for Finance are constantly increasing.  All of these responsibilities &mdash;keeping in touch with what is happening in the European Community, making sure that Ireland's interests are protected and advanced and keeping in touch with the World Bank and other <Col N="488" /> international bodies&mdash;are very time-consuming and very important for the economy of the country.  If the Minister for Finance is to do his job in this regard properly in addition to carrying on his traditional job of looking after the budget, he will have less and less time to devote to planning and development.</P>
    <P>In addition to these European and international responsibilities the Minister for Finance is now responsible for the Department of the Public Service. This is a Department which is growing in size and complexity, and it is a Department which is very time-consuming and very important.  It will almost certainly take up more and more time of the Minister for Finance in the future.  There is the added danger, in regard to whether a Minister for Finance would be able to carry on all these responsibilities successfully at the same time, that some responsibilities&mdash;if the Minister for Finance was also the Minister in charge of planning&mdash;would demand immediate attention.  The budget naturally would be the Minister's prime concern and coming up to budget time this would have to get his immediate and almost full-time attention.  When international consultations arose they would have to have his immediate attention.</P>
    <P>Appointments to the public service and all that that entailed when they arose would have to get priority from the Minister for the Public Service.  In that situation priority would have to be given to the budget and to international consultations and to the public service. The net result would very likely be that planning and development would get a very low priority in the time and attention of the Minister for Finance. Planning and development would only be reached when the other more pressing duties, perhaps not more important duties, but more pressing duties, had been discharged.  This would be a very real danger if the Minister for Finance was also in charge of planning.</P>
    <P>Another consideration&mdash;and possibly the most important one of all&mdash;is that planning and development should be considered objectively, at arm's length. <Col N="489" /> I am not suggesting that the Minister for Finance or any Minister for Finance would not be able to do that if he was concentrating only on planning and development.  Planning and development should be considered without immediate reference to the financial implications of the planning and development.  It would be almost impossible for a Minister for Finance going through a period of financial stringency, going through a period coming up to budget time when he realised that he would have very serious financial problems, to bring forward in that atmosphere plans which would have serious financial implications. The Minister would quite naturally put to one side any new plans or developments which were likely to add to the burden of the problems he was already experiencing from the budgetary point of view.  They would be put to one side no matter how attractive, or how interesting, until another time.  This is not the philosophy, or the approach which a Minister for Planning should have.  It would tend to interfere and to delay some plans and developments which a Minister who is not immediately concerned with finance would bring forward.  That is not to say that a Minister for Planning and Development should entirely ignore the financial implications of plans that he is bringing forward.  He would we are told, be in constant touch with the Minister for Finance, he would be conscious of the financial implications but he would not be dominated by these implications.  The Minister would take the view that these are plans which have merit, have validity, which should be considered by the Government and the various Departments and if the Government decide that at the moment they are not possible, they can be put to one side for the moment, but nevertheless would be brought forward as plans which have validity in their own right and should be put into operation sooner or later.  In regard to these nians the Minister for Finance naturally would have his own point of view, would have his say when they came before the Government and would give the expert view as to the likely cost of the plans and the ramifications from the point of view of the <Col N="490" /> national finances.  That is his job, that is what he should do and that is what he should concentrate on rather than concentrate on planning and development.</P>
    <P>Senator Whitaker said that it would be appropriate for the Department of Finance to be in charge of planning because it was the Department which would eventually implement it.  I find it difficult, to understand what Senator Whitaker means by the Department of Finance implementing plans.  In nearly all cases it is not the Department of Finance which implements plans approved by the Government. It is the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy and various other Departments which implement the plans which are approved by the Government.  This is clearly envisaged by the Bill.  The Bill says in section 2 (2) (c) that the function of the Department of Economic Planning and Development would be to review and appraise the plans and activities of the Departments of State giving effect to the policies for general economic and social development adopted by the Government.  The idea that has been referred to by other speakers, certainly in the other House, that the Department of Finance should have planning under their control because they would be implementing plans is not a valid observation and is not a valid objection for taking planning away from the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>I have stressed that the Minister for Finance at present has more than enough to do without being responsible for planning and development as well.  The new Minister for Economic Planning and Development will also have his hands full.  The idea that this job was invented for the new Minister or the idea that he will have very little to do or that he would only be an adviser in a vague way is very far from the truth.  The role of the State in the economic and social sphere is, as we all know, constantly increasing.  Some people may regret that but it is a political and democratic fact of life.  The demands for the State to take a hand in these spheres, to plan in these spheres, to make sure that development <Col N="491" /> in these spheres is on the right lines are ever-increasing.  I have very little doubt that the Minister and the Department will have more than enough to do in the future and that the new Minister will be a very busy man indeed.  It has been alleged that the functions of the Department are vague and do not place any special concrete responsibility on the Minister.  I have heard and read a number of speeches which have made this allegation but practically none has suggested what the role of the Department should be. It is not the functions of the Department which are vague but the criticisms which have been made in this regard.  It is essential that the terms of reference of the Department should be in general terms, as Senator Keating would say if he was here, &ldquo;ongoing&rdquo; A Department cannot be given terms of reference which are capable of being achieved in a short time.  It would be taking the view that this was only a temporary Department.  The only concrete example that was given in this House in my hearing of something the Department should be asked to do, was the suggestion by Senator Robinson that they should set up a State development corporation.</P>
    <P>The trouble about pinpointing things the Department should do is that once they were done the Department would have nothing left to do.  It is most undesirable that there should be any rigidity about the functions of this Department. Planning should not be looked at as a once-and-for-all objective. Even if the Department brought up plans which would solve all our present-day problems and if these plans were implemented and our problems were solved, by the time they were solved there would be a whole lot more problems and the Department would still have a job to do.  The Department should not be looked at in terms of once and for all.  It is not a Department whose terms of reference should be rigid or capable of being achieved and repeated.  The terms must be general and must be in the form which is set out in the Bill.</P>
    <P>One of the criticisms made of the Bill is that the Minister has no power, <Col N="492" /> that he has no teeth and it has been said that the Minister who prepares the plans must be responsible for financing them.  This is getting back to the argument that the Department of Finance should be responsible for planning.  I find it very difficult to understand this argument, because although the Department of Finance, for a while at any rate, produced plans over the years and up to the present day, it was not the Department of Finance who produced most of the plans.  The Department of Industry and Commerce, the Departments of Agriculture, Health, and Social Welfare all produced their own plans, most of which were adopted by the Government and were implemented in turn by these Departments. These Departments did not have the power to finance the plans they produced. They were financed by the Department of Finance with the approval of the Government.</P>
    <P>It is not a valid argument that a Minister who prepares the plans must be the Minister responsible for financing them.  That has not been the practice or the reality in the past, and it will not be the reality in the future. One must consider the implications of the suggestion that the Department of Finance is all powerful in providing finance for any plans that may be introduced.  It must be remembered that although the Department of Finance vets and often vetoes these proposals put before them their function is to examine the financial implications of proposals, to comment on these proposals from a financial point of view. and to advise on them, but in the last analysis it is not the Department of Finance who provide the finance, it is the Government who decides whether or not any plan, policy or proposal will be put into operation.  A Minister whose proposals are turned down by the Department of Finance very often brines the proposals to the Government, and gets the proposals put through if the Government wish it. Even if the Department of Finance looked after planning and development if would not have the final say in financing plans, it would in the last analysis, be a matter for the Government. I am merely commenting on the principle of collective responsibility <Col N="493" /> which is the way in which a Government should work and normally does work although at intervals it does not seem to work very well.  Consequently, if a Government want certain plans or policies the Government will ensure that these plans are put into operation.</P>
    <P>That is a very important principle to remember in the context of this Bill. It is very important when we consider the suggestion that the Minister for Economic Planning and Development will have no power, and will have no teeth.  The Minister will have the power, the support and financial assistace of the Government behind him, if his proposals are proposals which the Government want.  The criticism of the Bill by members of Fine Gael and Labour is misconceived. Probably to some extent there is misunderstanding arising from the fact that the last Coalition Government seemed to lose track of the principle of collective responsibility during its term of office and concentrated very much on the individual power of each Minister. Fianna Fáil believe in planning and development just as they believe in the principle of collective responsibility.</P>
    <P>The idea put forward by Senator Cooney that this Department was only invented to provide a position for the Minister who is proposed for the job is simply not borne out by the history of Fianna Fáil's conviction in regard to planning.  Planning has existed to some extent, but it was Fianna Fáil who in 1957 introduced it in a concrete, comprehensive way.  The setting up of a Department of Planning and Development at this stage cannot be described as a late conversion or as something done merely to provide a position for Deputy O'Donoghue.  Fianna Fáil have faith in the concept of planning and also the determination to make it work in a comprehensive way.  That is why this Department is being set up.</P>
    <P>During the discussion of this Bill both Labour and Fine Gael said in a somewhat half-hearted way that they believe in planning also.  The Coalition Government in their term of office, if they believed in planning, showed no <Col N="494" /> wish or ability to put it into operation in any way.  If the parties concerned are now in agreement with planning and are willing to let it be tried out&mdash; it is evident from Senator Cooney's speech that some at least are not very keen on it&mdash;I welcome their conversion.</P>
    <P>I fully agree with the terms of this Bill.  The setting up of this Department was the most important decision made by the present Government since they came into power.  The lack of planning was one of the basic weaknesses of the Coalition Government.  The problems which have been left to this Government by the previous Administration are serious ones.  It would be impossible to tackle them successfully without dedication to planning and development. Fianna Fáil have this dedication and, with the help of this new Department and the conviction and dedication of Fianna Fáil to planning and development, these economic and social problems will in due course be solved.</P>

      <P>I am not going to begin by defending yesterday's situation or make an argument about whether we were good at planning or whether the Coalition avoided it.  I would remind the Leader of the House that over 30 years ago young Jim Larkin was an advocate of detailed economic planning. Fianna Fáil Ministers of the day scorned the idea and looked on it as a foreign document.  However, they have come around to the idea, and that is a welcome development no matter how late it is.</P>

      <P>I am speaking as a Labour Party person.  I worked manually for my livelihood and I have lived with unemployment both in my family life in a large family and in the trade union sphere, and I know the problems it creates.  Because of my concern about unemployment and my <Col N="495" /> wish to see the numbers in the dole queue cut back, I welcome any measure that might tend to move in that direction.  However, the welcome I am giving it is in the hope that the new Department can play a useful role in influencing the factors that would give more people work.  That is a hope of mine and of the Labour Party and not a belief that the Department can do it.  I am not saying that that is the Department's only function.</P>
      <P>My welcome for this measure is qualified because I would be more influenced by the amount of employment that would be generated than by anything else.  I am a little sceptical of experts.  I have been the victim of them in my lifetime, my family have been victims and so have my friends and the people I represent.  One cannot transfer or hive off certain responsibilities to an expert such as Deputy O'Donoghue and say: &ldquo;These are the tasks.  This is what has to be done and this is how you have to co-ordinate things so that we will realise a good economic and planning development.&rdquo; We have to talk to the business community in the final analysis.  If they are not conscious of the need to help and if they have not the desire to do so, no Minister, no matter how good he is in theory, can get his theories put into practice by these people who have not even got the desire to create full employment. There is no record of real willingness in private enterprise society to produce plans and to work to bring about full employment.  I cannot see how anybody, just because he is going to speak in a different tone and who has accepted new responsibilities, is going to provide us with the 30,000 jobs a year that we need.  It does not matter who is responsible for it.  We are talking about the &ldquo;now&rdquo; situation and it is the &ldquo;now&rdquo; situation that either elects or defeats Governments on the promises they make.  I am not belly-aching about being beaten.  If you do not deliver the goods that is the way you should be treated.  If the people believed that we were not delivering the goods, then they did the right thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am still concerned about society <Col N="496" /> as a whole.  There are many things over which the new Minister will have no control.  He is not going to have any control over the geographical distribution of redundancies.  He is not going to be able to influence people to realise that growth centres should be set up not only in Dublin and in Cork but in other areas where industries would come up as a result.  I do not make any apologies for saying this because from the time I was a boy I have been hearing about full employment.  I was hearing about it when the only social welfare available was the nine bob and two pounds of free beef.  I do not know if anyone in the House remembers that, but I was a member of a family who drew the nine bob and the two pounds of free beef.  I had six brothers and five sisters and my father and five of the six brothers were unemployed. I have been listening all my life to talk about full employment.  I do not think it is within our ability in the society we live in to achieve it.  I cannot see the new Minister, for all his wisdom, will be able to compel employers to employ people over 40.  If this provision is put into legislation the employer will interview every applicant under and over 40 and he will take only those under 40.</P>
    <P>I spoke earlier about the growth centres in Cork and Dublin.  Full employment cannot be created where the entrepreneurs have not the will to do it.  I do not want anyone to think that if we do manage to develop a little in the way that the IDA have been developing it should be at the expense of small towns.  I hope it radiates throughout the whole country if it is going to radiate at all, and I have my doubts about it.  This Department will not make any change without direct State involvement, in other words State investment in industry, either on their own initiative or in joint ventures, and unless the new Department themselves show evidence that they are prepared to take advantage of the native resources and of production by way of spin-offs from the existing enterprises.</P>
    <P>I am not opposed to mixed economy, but, in the manufacturing side of industry I see very little State involvement.  There is a lot of State involvement <Col N="497" /> in the services side, which is vulnerable and this tends to suggest that State involvement is a bad thing. Somebody might criticise CIE, for instance, but it does not necessarily follow that State involvement is a bad thing.  That service has to be provided whether it pays or not.  The Department of Posts and Telegraphs also provide a service and also very good employment and again it is not a question of whether it should be a profit-making concern.  On the other side, the State can become involved in manufacturing industries to a much greater extent than they ever were. They can become involved by either joint ventures or taking initiatives of their own.  Somebody might think that I am talking in an ideological way; I am not.  I am talking about ways to create employment.  Too much is dependent on private enterprise.</P>
    <P>We depend largely on foreign investment. Irish entrepreneurs&mdash;I do not know whether that is the right name to give them&mdash;do not seem to be growth-conscious.  If the Minister can make them growth-conscious, good luck to him, and I wish his Department success.</P>

      <P>If the Senator had been here earlier he would have understood that I was speaking as a Labour Party member and I made that clear at the outset.  I made it clear, not to knock the Coalition Government, but because I want to see things happening that I do not think are happening.  I am expressing my own reservations as to whether the Department will do the job and I am entitled to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new Department could identify the potential viable industries and projects with existing public enterprises or by way of participation in the private sector.  I do not think there is enough of that.  I cannot lay enough stress on the accepted dependence on foreign enterprises in the development of new industries.  If I thought that the new Department could convince me that <Col N="498" /> there is not an excessive dependence on foreign enterprises, that the Irish business people will become growth-conscious, I certainly would be inclined to go a lot further with them than I am at the moment on this Bill.  Over the years there has been no real evidence of the necessary dynamism in the business people of the country. They are more interested in short-term gains rather than in the growth situation. A ship lying in harbour for a long time gathers a lot of barnacles and until you remove them you are not going to move in the right direction. These are the reservations I have.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier why I was more concerned with the unemployment aspect of it than anything else. From 1960 to 1970, taking Dr. Walsh's figures, about 110,000 people left the country.  In 1960 we had a fraction of over one million people at work.  In 1970 we had the same number of people at work, plus the 110,000 people who emigrated.  It was a wonderful decade for profits and it was also good for wages, but it was not good for employment. I am afraid we could get into the same false situation when there is more money around.  People are making more profits, wages are better, but we still have not got sufficient jobs for the youth and to take up the slack in agriculture and other areas where redundancies occur.</P>
    <P>The famous American economist Galbraith describes unemployment as a disaster to the working people.  He calls it personal catastrophe and says that during unemployment, even on insurance benefit, idleness corrupts and the feeling of not being wanted demoralises.  This is very true.  I can bear witness to it as I experienced this situation and that is what brought me into the ranks of the Labour Party.  I felt from the very early stages that the oldest political party in the country were in fact advocating detailed economic planning.</P>
    <P>Young Jim Larkin was advocating that over 30 years ago and everybody scorned him.  Because of all the events since then, and going back to the late twenties and early thirties when I was a boy, I am very doubtful about the <Col N="499" /> society in which we live having a real desire to create full employment.  I do not think any Minister by taking on added responsibilities will bring about the things that are needed.  As a trade unionist the things I feel are needed most are, naturally, full employment as a priority, a steady rise in living standards, equality of opportunity and also a fair distribution of incomes and wealth and the elimination of poverty.  These are things we have been striving for.</P>
    <P>Some progress admittedly has been made by both administrations in the elimination of poverty, the introduction of better social services and so on.  It is not a question of trying to take credit one way or the other; it is a fact I do not mind admitting. Other things have not kept pace with it.  There may have been a steady rise in living standards in the sixties and seventies, but it is not a continuing thing.  There is no guarantee under the new Department that it will be, and there is no guarantee that we can generate full employment.</P>
    <P>The Minister's title is the Minister for Economic Planning and Development. The absence of the word &ldquo;social&rdquo; in the title&mdash;not so much in the text&mdash;gives rise to concern.  If there is no desire on the part of many people to proceed very rapidly in respect of eliminating unemployment, then regard must be had to the fact that a comprehensive and adequate welfare service could well be neglected because, while the Minister may have some authority for it, he has not a first role in that it is not spelt out in the title of the Ministry.  I would like to know why the word &ldquo;social&rdquo; was deliberately left out of the title.</P>
    <P>When the Minister is looking at this question of unemployment he should not allow to continue much longer the excessive dependence on foreign enterprise, and he should consider seriously further State involvement in a joint venture, by initiating viable and potential projects, and by seeing what can be achieved out of natural resources by developing industries from spin-offs, and so on.  I am so concerned about the title of the new <Col N="500" /> Department that I propose to put down some amendments for Committee Stage.  I hope that when we get to that point my mind will be a little easier on the question of whether we can improve employment prospects, particularly having regard to the fact that 30,000 jobs a year will now be necessary.  If the Government are not seen to be heading in that direction they will be the laughing-stock of the nation once again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CLambert" hpid="Mr. Lambert Mr. Lambert">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lambert</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill from a practical business point of view. The establishment of the new Department of Economic Planning and Development is in keeping with the modern practice of private enterprise in introducing at top level a separate corporate planning Department which will operate on the basis of the well-tried principles of scientific management, that is continuously getting the facts, continuously analysing the facts, continuously formulating a plan, and then deciding on activating the plan. In order to achieve the maximum results from participation at all levels of the various Departments their plans need to be linked or, to use the word mentioned by the Minister for the Public Service, &ldquo;meshed&rdquo; into a national corporate plan which can give the separate functional plans impetus and an overall purpose, thus creating a greater momentum for potential success.  Furthermore, a corporate plan provides a blueprint against which progress can be monitored and controlled as in private enterprise, whether at budget time or at any other time.</P>
      <P>Everyone is agreed that there has been insufficient forward planning at national level.  I remember the statement of the last Government on a national partnership in 1975, the principles of which I tried to inculcate within my own industry.  The preliminary appeal of the former Taoiseach evoked a favourable reaction within the workforce.  But we waited in vain for a plan of action and, for whatever reasons, this did not materialise.  As we look back on the past few years, many industries did not survive and many other industries survived in a different form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point I want to make is that <Col N="501" /> this was not the first time industry had to survive during a period of decision not to make decisions.  There have been many other periods of Government indecision which provided breathing space for uncertainties to multiply. I am glad this has been acknowledged in the Dáil debate, and even by the new Minister in explaining his difficulty in adhering to an annual plan because of political strategy.  In fact, Senator Cooney endorsed that this morning.</P>
    <P>Today, we eagerly await the outline of a national economic plan, but we must realise the new Minister has his work cut out in tackling the three outstanding problems of inflation, unemployment and the control of public services.  Last year, there was a proliferation of economic reports, all saying the same thing in a different way: the OECD Report, the McKinsey Report, the IMI submission, the ESRI report, all highlighted the most vital point to us amongst the welter of other statements. I quote:</P>
    <P>An immediate policy is needed to prevent any further erosion of our cost competitiveness in relation to the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>With such easy access to this market from our major British competitors, it is blatantly obvious that we must control our inflation below that of the UK, and this includes Northern Ireland where there are many Border problems as we are aware.</P>
    <P>The Government lost no time in emphasising that moderation in incomes is essential to maintain our competitiveness and contain inflation.  This involves us all, from managing directors, anyone who has a job, down to the factory floor.  This is the first priority. I am sorry Senator Harte is not here because a permanent increase in employment depends on our success in controlling inflation.  Many Irish industries have the dilemma about numbers employed as they aim at steady improvement in the rate of productivity which, in itself, can limit the increase in employment in the short-term.  We must look at the longer-term view of controlling inflation in order to achieve greater competitiveness which, together, will bring greater opportunity to expand our home and export markets. <Col N="502" /> Then, hand-in-hand with growth and output and higher productivity, will come potential for a permanent increase in jobs.</P>
    <P>Another point worth remembering is the experience of the Irish economy, not so long ago, when we had reasonable growth and a rise in real incomes which led to a rise in demand for services, so this improved productive efficiency led to a rise in employment in other fields.  In fact, during the last boom, all the extra jobs in the public service, and other services such as banking, retailing and the professions, were created to service an expanding industrial base.</P>
    <P>During the recession, a number of these jobs remained relatively secure, while the number of jobs lost in industry continued to escalate, adding to the costly imbalance of our economic structure.  This is not a very advantageous point from which the new Minister has to start while such imbalance exists.  Irish manufacturing industries, however efficient, cannot achieve competitiveness with the outside world because they may be loaded with an undue share of public service overheads.</P>
    <P>However, looking to the positive side, it is gratifying that a new realisation of the importance of our manufacturing industries as the generators of wealth has dawned.  This new realisation is fully accepted by our new Government.  Under this Bill I look forward to the reorganisation which will strengthen the Government's capacity to lead more positively the course of our economic development and, with more time and more resources to assess all the factors involved and to plan forward more scientifically.  I agree with Senator FitzGerald that the plan must bring closer together the respective interests of agriculture and industry.</P>
    <P>Regarding the outstanding problem of controlling public finances and planning our capital needs, when I was a member of the Electricity Supply Board, I was made fully aware of the necessity to plan forward ten years in advance, in their responsibility to ensure that electricity generating capacity would be available to service the <Col N="503" /> needs of our developing economy. Recently, we learned that the capital requirements of the ESB alone in the next ten years would amount to £1,500 million, the reason for which I am fortunate to have some awareness, understanding and approval.  Even if 40 per cent is financed through internal resources, it still leaves £900 million, or £90 million a year, to be found by borrowing.  The reason I mention this is that, as a member of the board, I found it extremely difficult to envisage how the ESB's gigantic capital requirements fitted into the total national requirements which must include massive demands for forward borrowing from all the other State and semi-State bodies, including Government services, assuming they provide equally efficient projections.  For me, the longer-term problem of the nation's capital requirements has never been fully explained, presumably because Government Departments have been too involved in day-to-day commitments.</P>
    <P>The new Department can give attention to this major problem of forward planning of our public finances.  I am sure we will be made more alert, not only to what the country can afford during the impending period of economic prosperity, but also to the extent to which too much optimism could lead us to the verge of bankruptcy in the years to come, unless corrective measures are taken in time as cyclical booms and recessions inevitably follow one another.</P>
    <P>In choosing a name for the new Department, the Minister has already made the comment in the Dáil that it is quite ridiculous to talk about social planning divorced from economic planning.  Progress on either of these fronts will be barren unless they are interwoven with our cultural development. Let us not make the mistake of other nations in thinking that economic growth is the panacea for all evils.  Economic, social and cultural development must go hand-in-hand. Unfortunately, our cultural development is still the Cinderella of our national aims in the competition for a share of the financial cake.  We have <Col N="504" /> many evidences of our failures in this respect, when we look round at the appalling planning of some of our new housing estates which provide little or no cultural or social facilities for the local community.</P>
    <P>We must also question the present policy of economic development which allows a situation where it is more profitable to demolish buildings and leave them like derelict bomb sites.  A glaring example of this is not half a mile from here, where we had one of the most beautiful squares in Europe, St. Stephen's Green.  Now we must witness the desecration and visually stomach this for an unknown period of years.  How long will the gaping hole in Harcourt Street be allowed to remain, another small but pathetic exposure of economic development without the guiding hand of cultural responsibility?</P>
    <P>In one form or another, cultural development impinges on about five different Departments, including the Taoiseach's, which is responsible for the Arts Council, which I firmly believe should remain in the Taoiseach's Department, because our Arts Council is of such national significance that only the Head of Government can give it the commitment, importance and motivation needed throughout the whole of Ireland, North and South.</P>
    <P>I hope the new Minister will act as a catalyst in the development of the role of culture in our society and help to plan and co-ordinate the investment in our cultural activity which will reap the rewards of putting us back in harmony with our environment, with our ancient history, with our neglected educators&mdash;our contemporary artists.  In fact, the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, has an unusual opportunity to develop a most neglected human resource, our creative artists, who have an enormous self-employment potential.  I look forward to congratulating the new Minister as a fully-fledged Minister to head up this new vital Department as soon as possible.  Few incumbents have received in advance such confidence and goodwill, and here credit must go to the Minister for the way he has presented this Bill and encouraged the new Minister.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="505" /> I welcome him from industry's point of view because there has been criticism of not providing a plan, but I know he has been doing his home work.  He has been visiting industries like ours, and he has been listening to the hopes and fears, as well as the potential opportunities for expansion and for the creation of additional employment.  I have also found he has had time for relaxation at one of our major cultural events, the Wexford Opera Festival.  I mention this because I note that he has the characteristic which I admire in some other politicians in that he has shown himself to be a well-integrated human being. Senator Mulcahy mentioned the necessity for this type of person, well-skilled, young, well-integrated, and I see the Minister as this at the age of 32, and he should have no ambitions for the crown prince position.</P>
    <P>Above all, let us remember the new Minister has had the unique advantage of working closely with the Taoiseach as his adviser for many years.  Such a close working relationship must mean he has a sensitive perception of the Head of the Government's views on future policy and strategy.  When the final plans are agreed by the Taoiseach and his team&mdash;and I mention this in particular, team of Ministers&mdash;I hope they can be launched with the same verve as the Government's manifesto. Certainly, Irish industry is eager to respond, and I have no doubt that the whole community wish to get involved in creating momentum to ensure the success and survival of the plans.  It will be in everyone's interest, whatever their affiliation, that we move forward to greater employment, greater prosperity and, I hope, a more culturally and socially rewarding life for us all.</P>

      <P>I listened last evening with rapt attention to my Chancellor, if I may so call him, Senator Whitaker.  I thought his contribution was very impressive and, indeed, very independent, so independent, in fact, that if that corner over there gets a bit crowded, I would remind him there are plenty of spacious seats on this side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="506" /> In effect, of course, what he did was to echo the reservations about the measure which have been expressed in the other House, but he did so in a particularly authoritative manner.  He has a clarity and intelligibility which are unusual among economic experts, and a welcome freedom from jargon.</P>
    <P>He is, as well, the moat distinguished voice in economic matters in the Oireachtas.  After all Senator Whitaker is already in the history books: at least he is in my history book.  I am not so sure whether he should be properly labelled by historians as the architect of the economic expansion in the late 1950s, because we have not yet really answered the historical question, and it has a great bearing on what we are discussing now.  Was the resurgence of the late fifties and early sixties simply due to the accident that we were on the crest of an international wave in the capitalist world and when that crest receded in the early seventies we receded with it?</P>
    <P>Perhaps Senator Whitaker's role was more illusory than real in the creation of the economic boom of the late fifties and early sixties.  But one thing he did put his finger on at that time&mdash;and I think this was his real achievement&mdash; it was he who divined the psychologically depressing effects of emigration and unemployment and got the Government to move accordingly.  At any rate, what he said yesterday&mdash;particularly as one of the Taoiseach's 11, and he is the first to have broken the ranks and I am sure the last&mdash;must give us pause.  In effect, in the nicest possible way, he has said the measure is unnecessary and is unlikely to work.  As he put it in an arresting sporting image, the Minister for Finance will continue to play the ball, and the new Minister will be confined to cheering from the sidelines.  The risk of a personality clash, he warned us, may impair the relationship between the two Departments. He might well have added that rival aspirations to party leadership constitute another possible source of conflict.</P>
    <P>My contribution to this discussion is necessarily limited by my lack of knowledge of economics, though I <Col N="507" /> sometimes find a bleak comfort in a lunatic suspicion that even the economists themselves do not know what they are talking about.  I relish the aphorism that every economic analysis is plausible but no more plausible than the converse.  It does not require any specialist knowledge to grasp the main points at issue here, and to relate them to the hopes and expectations of the people who endorsed the Fianna Fáil manifesto, and who now await the delivery of the goods.  That same manifesto, I suggest, should be an indispensable source document for all of us in the next four years.  It rarely leaves my sight and will be in time as well-thumbed as my Gideon Bible.</P>
    <P>Introducing this measure in the other House the Minister said:</P>
    <P>Although, most people intuitively regard planning as a good thing, there is, regrettably, little consensus, even among the theorists, as to what the concept involves precisely.  At one end of the spectrum the term has connotations of rigid compulsion. At the other, it is a loose arrangement for undisciplined forecasting. The Government's view of planning places it between the two extremes.</P>
    <P>This is exactly what I fear because here is the economic counterpart of that bland middle-of-the-road, catchall Fianna Fáil political philosophy.  I am no doctrinaire socialist, but the only hope I see for the economy is more and more public control and direction and ownership.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Harte that it is futile to talk about reducing our massive unemployment, still less eliminating it, in the kind of economy we now have.  I thought Senator Mulcahy was endearingly naïve when he conjured up the picture of workers asking one another over their Saturday pint: &ldquo;How did you do, brother, this week? Did you increase the national product?&rdquo; That conversation is very unlikely to happen in our kind of society, whatever about its likelihood in a socialist economy.</P>
    <P>But, as we now are, and the way Fianna Fáil see the economy, there is only a limited role for planning in a <Col N="508" /> free or mixed economy.  Of course, there is another limitation on planning. Daily we are being reminded that our freedom to plan an Irish economy is being circumscribed more and more by the tightening net of EEC regulations and directives.  It is, therefore, with more hope than confidence that I wish the new Department well.</P>
    <P>This new Department will be inseparably associated in the public mind with the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue.  The projection of the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue as the economic saviour of his country carries with it its own in-built Nemesis.</P>
    <P>If unemployment is reduced or eliminated, whether the new Minister and his Department are responsible for that unlikely development, or whether we will once again ride on the crest of a temporary capitalist wave, his stock is bound to soar and, dare I say it, his succession prospects will soar with it.  On the other hand, if things go badly, the Minister's fall will be all the harder.</P>
    <P>Ultimately, I am not concerned about these Ministers' power politics or about abstract economic analyses. I am concerned about the chances of solving the greatest problem of the day, massive unemployment, so let us wish the new venture well, not this time out of the customary politeness which has obtained up to now in this House, but for the sake of the very survival of the economy and, perhaps, even of this political society as we know it.  Let us hope it works.  If unemployment is not reduced and, indeed, is not seen to be on the way to elimination, social unrest and political revolution loom ahead, perhaps as soon as 18 months to two years' time.  Let us hope that the new Minister and his Department will help to stave off those very real threats to our whole political and social system.</P>

      <P>Ó thosaigh an díospóireacht seo tráthnóna inné is mó tuairim a nochtadh agus is mó cheist a pleadh: ach tá cúpla gné den Bhille seo nár deineadh tagairt dó go fóill, agus tá sé i gceist agam labhairt ar na gnéithe sin ar feadh tamaillín.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="509" /> Nobody has any doubts as to the mammoth task facing the new Minister and his Department.  The tasks before them are stated with stark simplicity in the Bill.  Section 2 (2) (a) reads:</P>
    <P>to promote and co-ordinate economic and social planning for the development of the economy both generally and as respects different sectors thereof and different regions of the country.</P>
    <P>Various speakers, so far, have gone back and made references, some complimentary, others otherwise, to the type of economy promoted by various Governments since the founding of the State, and particular reference was made to what we might call the Lemass era.  Somebody put forward the idea that the economic prosperity which ensued came as a result of chance fleeting circumstances.  I do not think the vast majority of the people would accept that.</P>
    <P>Prosperity came as a result of the sensible and practical planning by the Government of that time and, along with that, the wholehearted co-operation they got from the general public, from officials, workers, and all concerned. If there is one thing in this Bill which pleases me&mdash;and I wonder why Senator Harte did not notice the frequency with which the point I am about to refer to occurs&mdash;it is the repetition of the words &ldquo;co-ordinate&rdquo;, &ldquo;social&rdquo;, &ldquo;social planning&rdquo;, &ldquo;social development&rdquo;, and so on, right through all the subsections in section 2.  We have a repetition of the words &ldquo;co-ordinate&rdquo;, and &ldquo;social&rdquo;, all suggesting that the dry bones of planning are not enough.  We have to have the oil to lubricate the machinery of planning and to see that it works.</P>
    <P>A story is told of a man who, when electric light was available to him as a result of the rural electrification scheme, installed in his house innumerable lamps of various shades and designs&mdash;he actually got the advice of an expert when planning the colour schemes of the rooms, and so on.  He had lamps, lamp shades, heaters, and so on.  A few days after <Col N="510" /> the current was turned on, a friend of his called and admired all the lamps and shades, and went over to the switch to turn on the light when the owner stopped him and said: &ldquo;Yes. You complimented me on the lamps and the lamp shades and on all the fittings, but there is just one little snag.  It will not work.&rdquo;  No matter how carefully one plans, there is always the possibility that the plan will not work.  In ordinary life we see that.  We plan something for next Sunday and we have various ideas in our heads as to what will happen but, when the times comes, due to unforeseen circumstances, the plans just do not work.</P>
    <P>One thing is essential for the working of any plan where human beings are concerned, that is, kindly, neighbourly, sincere and patriotic cooperation. That is lacking at this point in time.  We have strikes, rumours of strikes, go-slows, industrial strife, jealousies, meanness, selfishness, and so on.  There seems to be a malaise in the country at the moment.  To my mind, one of the biggest tasks facing the new Minister and the new Department is how best to overcome this difficulty.  It has to be repeated; no matter how good the plans are, how appropriate the time is, the work cannot be done and, therefore, employment will not be created, unless we have the goodwill of everybody concerned.</P>
    <P>Fears were expressed by some speakers as to personality clashes between various Ministers of State.  I do not see any danger good, bad or indifferent of such a clash.  What I would be worried about is, when the plans are made and generally accepted as being workable, various difficulties, industrial actions, and that kind of thing, as they are euphemistically called nowadays, will intervene and the plans will not be allowed to come to fruition.  That is the greatest danger facing the new Minister and the new Department.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to one section and I hope the Minister will say something about it when the time comes for his reply.  In his introductory speech he said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="511" /> The new Department will have responsibility for the promotion and co-ordination of economic and social planning as respects different regions of the country.  While the reconciliation of the regional and sectoral elements of the planning matrix will require development, the immediate structural effect will be the transfer of responsibility for the County Development Teams and Special Regional Development Fund to the new Department.</P>
    <P>I have a slight fear there may be a danger of local initiative being hampered&mdash;I will not say stifled.  Local initiative is very important to the life and to the prosperity of the nation, and to fulfilment of individuals.  I would be apprehensive lest the new Department, possibly with the best intentions, but with a paternalistic outlook, would be inclined to override the decisions or the findings of the Local Development Teams throughout the country.  Whatever we do, we should not stifle initiative.</P>
    <P>We wish the Minister well in the mammoth task before him.  We wish his Department well.  They have a colossal job to do but I have no doubt whatever that they will do it.  While listening to some of the speakers today, Robbie Burns came back to my mind: &ldquo;The best laid schemes of mice and men gang aft agley.&rdquo;  As far as the mice were concerned, Burns was quite right because, during the past four years of Coalition, certainly many schemes went astray.  Now that the men have come back, I am sure fewer of the schemes will go astray.  The new Department will, I feel, succeed, and must succeed because, since the founding of the State, from no Government has so much been expected by so many.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to improve the protection given to the consumer in existing legislation such as the Merchandise Marks Act, 1887.  Even though this measure was supplemented and revised in 1931 and 1970, its basic provisions are still related to a time when prepacking of goods was rare and advertising did not have its present day scope or impact and there was no radio or television.  The need for updating these provisions has been recognised for quite some time and the first step was taken in the Act of 1970 which provided for compulsory quantity marking on prepacked goods. In 1972, the National Prices Commission were asked to examine the legislative needs in this area, and this task was taken over by the National Consumer Advisory Council when it was set up in 1973.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The council made recommendations to the Minister which were published in 1975, and comments and views on these have been taken into account in preparing the Bill.  The council's recommendations dealt with the subject under four separate headings and the present Bill is related to the first heading only, that is, Deceptive Trade Practices.  A second measure, published in May 1977, deals with contract terms, guarantees, warranties and so forth, that is, the field covered by the Sale of Goods Act, 1893.  This is being examined with a view to early introduction in Dáil Éireann, and work on <Col N="513" /> further measures, in particular a Consumer Credit Bill, is well advanced.</P>
    <P>This Bill might be said to deal with all forms of information about goods and services given to consumers, whether by printing on packs, notices in shops, brochures, leaflets, or by radio or television advertising.  Its provisions are intended to ensure that all such information is neither false nor misleading, and also that essential information will not be withheld.</P>
    <P>The notion of a &ldquo;trade description&rdquo;, introduced in the 1887 Act, was of a statement about goods which, on pain of prosecution, must be true. Only statements about quantity, composition and origin were comprehended by the Act of 1887, so that while it was an offence to make an untrue statement about, for instance, the weight of an article, or where it came from, it was not an offence to claim falsely that it complied with a particular standard.  The new Bill will remedy this by bringing within the concept of trade description virtually all kinds of statements about goods which might influence a purchaser. Trade descriptions will now comprehend statements about such matters as processing or reconditioning, fitness for purpose, compliance with a standard or test, and the standing or commercial importance of the supplier or manufacturer.  A further gap is to be closed by prohibiting misleading as well as actually false statements.</P>
    <P>Also, while the 1887 trade description had to be physically on, with or near the goods, this Bill provides that information given by word of mouth or contained in an advertisement or in fact given in any way may be a trade description and subject to the same requirements of truth and accuracy as if it were physically attached to the goods.</P>
    <P>One of the most controversial areas in recent years has been in the field of price indications and comparisons. These may be implied or direct comparisons with former prices, normal prices, the price elsewhere, and so on. The Bill makes it an offence to give a false or misleading indication as to the price at which goods or services are <Col N="514" /> being offered or have been offered in the past, or of the price for which they can be obtained elsewhere, or of the recommended price or the full price which will have to be paid.  I hope this will remedy the confusion and annoyance so often caused by the &ldquo;4p off&rdquo; phenomenon.</P>
    <P>Another provision which I might particularly mention is the power the Bill would give to the Director of Consumer Affairs to seek an Order in the High Court prohibiting the continued publication of a particular advertisement. The council recommended explicitly that the Court should be empowered to ban an advertisement which is the subject of a complaint. After very careful consideration, I have concluded that the inclusion of such a provision is called for.  What the Bill in general provides for is penalties for a variety of breaches of the law after these breaches have occurred, and while it is true to say that the fear of these penalties is a powerful reason why the breaches should not occur in the first place, this reasoning cannot always be relied on.  I could not accept the position that a series of seriously misleading advertisements should continue to run with no power to stop them other than the threat that at some future date the person responsible would be prosecuted.</P>
    <P>The provision as originally drafted would have given power to any person to seek an injunction of this kind. While this would be the most effective way of doing it, I found that it would be too readily open to abuse.  Under such a provision it would be possible for a trader to stop his competitors' advertisements or delay them in such a way as to render them useless.  I considered the possibility of avoiding this difficulty by requiring the director's consent for applications to the Court, but I am advised that such an arrangement is not practicable for several reasons.  Accordingly, the power has to be confined to the director, but clearly it is open to any person to approach the director and ask him to take action about an advertisement which is likely to mislead and cause loss, damage or injury.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="515" /> It has been suggested that this kind of measure, preventing misleading information, is not much help to a person who has been misled and has suffered loss or damage as a result. Even when the culprit has been punished, the victim goes unrecompensed. This is true, and, to provide for such a situation the Bill now provides, at section 17 for redress for such victims.  The provision is very restricted; it is limited to the amount of the fine, and to claimants who have applied before the case is heard and who are called as witnesses.  It was not possible to allow of any wider scope for compensation here because of legal complications but I think even this restricted provision will do a good deal for victims of any offence under the Act.  I will continue to look for improved mechanisms of redress.</P>
    <P>A further important feature of the Bill is the power to make orders requiring that specified information be included in advertisements in the interests of the consumer.  This is necessary for cases where the omission of some essential information in an advertisement could make it misleading.  Because words or expressions of imprecise meaning which yet carry a suggestion of real or intrinsic value and worth are often used with little or no justification in relation to products, the Minister is also empowered to assign by order particular meanings to expressions commonly used in relation to goods and services to ensure that consumers are not misled by deceptive or vague descriptions.  Similarly, he may require by order that certain goods be marked with or accompanied by specified information or instructions where he feels that this is necessary in the consumers' interest.  The power of making orders which is conferred on the Minister is subject to his giving notice of the making of the order and consulting with interested parties.  Furthermore, the approval of the draft order by both Houses of the Oireachtas is necessary.</P>
    <P>Possibly the greatest single deficiency of the Merchandise Marks Acts is that they relate only to goods and make no provision for protecting the consumer against the dishonest advertising <Col N="516" /> or promotion of services.  Consumers can be misled about services in the same way as with goods; they are, if anything, even more dependent on the supplier's descriptions and representations. The Bill, accordingly, prohibits false and misleading statements relating to services, facilities and accommodation.  The relevant section necessarily differs in detail from those dealing with descriptions of goods but the general aim is to apply the same rules, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>, to statements by advertisement or otherwise, about services as about goods.</P>
    <P>The whole area of consumer protection is noticeable for continual development of new areas of study and demands for public regulation.  This arises from the dynamic character of marketing and product development which, however, described from the point of view of business, contain the possibility of new forms of manipulation to which the consumer may not be alert.  Possible economic loss or damage to the consumer should be under surveillance and capable of being influenced as much as <i>ex post facto</i> sanctions for damage or loss caused.</P>
    <P>To help to rectify this possible danger, I propose to create with this Bill the office of Director of Consumer Affairs who would be charged with the responsibility for keeping developments in trade descriptions and advertising under review in the interests of the consumer, requesting the cessation of prejudicial practices, seeking injunctions where necessary and promoting the adoption of codes of good practice by business groups. The Bill also provides for officers to be authorised by the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy to enforce the provisions of this Bill, generally, and to assist the director.</P>
    <P>There are probably goods on the shelves or in the stores of distributors which were bought by them in good faith, but which might be held, on a strict interpretation of the new provisions, not to measure up fully to the requirements.  I think it would be harsh to leave distributors at a loss in relation to such goods, which they accepted as freely circulating on the market, and I feel it would be reasonable to allow a short period to adjust <Col N="517" /> to the new requirements.  I will be open to suggestions on this point.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Bill does seek to restore a balance which has tilted somewhat against the consumer.  I emphasise however, that it also protects honest traders from their less scrupulous competitors.  It provides adequate defences for mistake, accident and so forth and makes special provision for those who merely publish advertisements, where this is the business they are in.</P>
    <P>This Bill is part of a general policy of consumer protection which could be said to contain three basic elements: ensuring that the consumer gets truthful information; ensuring that the consumer gets more, and more relevant information; strengthening the consumer's position in the market place.</P>
    <P>The first two elements are contained in this Bill and in recent improvements in price display provisions. The third element is dealt with in the second measure I mentioned earlier which was published in May last, and will modernise the Sale of Goods Act, cover services as well as goods, and also in the new measure being prepared dealing with consumer credit.  The overall objective of the policy is to enable the consumer to play a more equal and effective role with the producer and distributor, in an expanding competitive economy.</P>

      <P>I should preface my remarks by saying that this Bill came up sooner than I thought it would and if my thoughts are not as well prepared as they should be I hope I will be forgiven.</P>
      <P>This Bill, in effect, extends and amends the Merchandise Marks Acts of 1887 and 1970.  The 1970 Act is easy to get at but an Act of 1887 is not easy to dig up.  Senators who live in the country and who may like to do some work on a Bill at home would find it difficult to get that kind of information.  Perhaps in future Bills on which the same problem would arise, the sections which are amended or extended would be listed and outlined in the Schedule or in the Explanatory Memorandum.  That would be of great assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="518" /> The Parliamentary Secretary mentioned the general policies of her Department in relation to consumer protection. The three main points were: ensuring that the consumer gets truthful information, ensuring that the consumer gets more relevant information, and strengthening the consumer's position in the market place.  The first two points are covered in this Bill.  The third one is being left to a later stage.  The third one is by far the most neglected one in Irish legislation and the one that requires very urgent and immediate attention.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  Our consumer legislation generally is in such a sorry state that any measure that serves to assist the consumer in any way must be welcomed.  It should be noted, however, that the Bill is very narrow in its application and apart from one notable exception it is a criminal Bill in content.  It creates new offences and provides for the establishment of the office of Director of Consumer Affairs whose main function is to ensure that provisions of the Act are enforced, and to keep the Minister up to date on the goings-on in the consumer world.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not change our civil law.  It does not help in any way the consumer who gets into difficulty in a normal civil transaction.  Anyone who wants to make a claim for damages or compensation arising out of, say, the purchase of goods still must rely on the Sale of Goods Act in our common law.  Even the provisions, implied covenants and warranties contained in the Sale of Goods Act can be very simply excluded from applying to any transaction by the manufacturer or supplier or whoever is concerned by simply saying that they do not apply.  It is in this area, in which we lag appallingly far behind our EEC colleagues, that real legislation is required.  Similarly, the Hire Purchase Acts, the last of which was passed in the 1960s, were intended to cover all transactions that had an element of deferred payment in them. At that time they covered most transactions. Most credit sale transactions were included in the scope of the Hire Purchase Acts.  Since then, through the wisdom and ability of finance <Col N="519" /> companies and hire purchase houses, they have succeeded in creating new schemes and transactions which are not affected by hire purchase legislation. This is an area which requires to be sorted out.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the extension to services as well as goods for the making of misleading or false statements. I wonder whether political parties are in business and whether they provide a service.  If they do, I wonder whether they come within the scope of this Bill.  If they do, and if a political party makes a misleading statement or makes a promise that it does not subsequently keep, I wonder what will happen.  If that applies, I would suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary should put in a section allowing for retrospection so far as the application of the Bill is concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to compliment the Parliamentary Secretary in relation to one amendment which she caused to be made on Committee Stage in the Dáil.  That is the amendment which allows for compensation of a victim. We have precedents in our legislation. The Road Traffic Act, although it is not operative at present because of constitutional difficulties, provided at one stage that where one had a crash with an uninsured driver and the person who did the damage was charged with driving without insurance, an application could be made to the court for the imposition on the miscreant person of a compensatory fine.  The amendment in section 17 is very similar to this and should be welcomed.  It puts a human and sensible face on the legislation and law generally and helps to break the association of the law with an ass.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a Bill which is best discussed on Committee Stage because of the nature of the provisions.  I do not want to get involved in a detailed discussion on the Bill section by section but there are a few areas which I would like to discuss at this stage and perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary might consider some of the ideas that will be <Col N="520" /> put forward and bring in amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the creation of the office of Director of Consumer Affairs.  It also provides in section 9 (5) that the director shall be independent in the performance of his functions.  Unfortunately, the subsection previous to that in section 9 provides that the director shall be a civil servant and initially shall be picked in accordance with offices within the civil service but subsequently that he shall hold office for five years at the end of which term the Minister may choose to re-appoint him for a further five years.  Another subsection provides that the director may be removed from office at any time by the Minister.  Quite honestly, I think that the powers given to the Minister in this respect make a total mockery of subsection (5) claiming that the director shall be independent in the performance of his functions.  I realise that in another subsection it is provided that if a director is removed from office the Minister shall cause to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas the statements of the reasons for his removal.  If he wanted to give that subsection any meaning I suggest that the Minister should give his causes for a proposed dismissal rather than attempt to close the door when the horse has bolted.  This is a post and an office which should be seen to be independent and this is the only way that it can be done.  It has not been unheard of for, indeed, not one office holder but entire boards to be removed by a Minister and reasons given subsequently in the House and just a little of stonewalling done to get over the immediate problem.</P>
    <P>If the Parliamentary Secretary is serious about this, if she wants to say and mean that the director will be independent, let her provide that the Minister may remove the director if she feels that he ought to have that power, but let her provide that the Minister should give his reasons for that before the dismissal takes place. Presumably, as the Bill is drafted, the Minister would remove the office holder and would at the same time arrange for the appointment of a successor or put the operation in <Col N="521" /> motion through the Civil Service Commission.  At that stage, if after discussion in the House, the House and the Government are satisfied that the previous director should not have been dismissed the chances are that somebody else will already have been appointed.  That is one area in the Bill which I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to reconsider.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned about the powers given to authorised officers.  I compliment the Parliamentary Secretary on the powers in this sense that they are effective in themselves; they provide for realistic methods of investigation; there are realistic methods of prosecution in the director's office and the Minister's office and the fines are such as should be a deterrent, which is a good thing.  I am concerned about some of the powers given to authorised officers.  Apparently, they will either be appointed by the Minister or be the whole time officers of a council of a county or corporation or other bodies.  So, local authorities also will have the power to authorise these people.  Paragraph (b) of the list of powers reads:</P>
    <P>...require any person who carries on such trade, business or activity and any person employed in connection therewith to produce to the officer any books, documents or records....</P>
    <P>That is fair enough so far as the principle of the business is concerned. But, so far as an employee is concerned, I wonder if it is fair that an authorised officer could approach a businessman's shop assistant in the absence of the businessman and seek certain documents and certain explanations without the knowledge of the businessman.  And bringing it a step further, presumably doctors, solicitors, provide a service: those people frequently have in their possession documents which are of a highly confidential nature, documents which are possibly privileged, and it is quite possible under the provisions of this Bill, as I read it, that an authorised officer could go into a solicitor's office in the absence of the solicitor and ask a <Col N="522" /> typist to produce a certain file, documents therein or records of any sort in relation to a case he may be investigating. I cannot see the sense in that.  It is extremely dangerous.  While I approve of the general powers and the notion behind them, namely, to have sensible methods of investigation, I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to reconsider that particular paragraph (b).</P>
    <P>There are other changes which I would like to see in the Bill.  I realise the difficulties the Parliamentary Secretary has about giving power to the consumer to apply to the court for an injunction, but I wonder if some provision could be made.  The Parliamentary Secretary mentioned in her statement that she considered the possibility of a member of the public doing it, having received the consent of the director, and that there are legal difficulties here.  I do not know what the legal difficulties are.  I wonder if something could be done in that respect. The director may be very busy.  In relation to the independence of the director, we are not told whether or not he will work under the auspices of the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy.  I presume he will, or certainly under the umbrella of that organisation.  Even that Department has under its control semi-State bodies who are in business, who provide a service and about whom the director might like to make inquiries in regard to some complaints.  That is something which, in my view, certainly hinders his independence and it is just the type of case where there ought to be provision for a member of the public making an application.  The point was made earlier that this director should be seen as utterly independent and, if you like, as the champion of consumers. This is a concept that the Parliamentary Secretary should consider and one which would be very welcome.</P>
    <P>Having welcomed the Bill generally, I would not like to give the impression that I am satisfied now that our consumer protection work is done.  My feelings are quite the contrary to this. Our laws, as I have said, are in such an appalling condition that any attempt in the right direction would have to be welcomed.  What needs to be changed <Col N="523" /> is the substantive law, the Sale of Goods Act, the Hire Purchase Act and similar Acts.  In addition, the whole question of access to justice and access to courts is of the most fundamental importance.  We must remember that, no matter what right we give a person in any legislation, it is not worth a damn if that person cannot afford to enforce that right&mdash;because litigation costs money&mdash;and one of the biggest problems we have is that it takes so long nowadays to establish your right in court because of delays in court, and again some of our courts are not properly equipped to deal with these matters; it is not their fault.  Our court system is inflexible and too formal for certain matters.  Our court system is such as to be intimidating sometimes to complainants, defendants, witnesses who are uninitiated in the court scene and who do not understand it.  We have shied away completely from the concept of courts that are there to deal with specialised problems.  We have the Redundancy Appeals Tribunals&mdash; something like that.</P>
    <P>Why cannot we have a consumer court?  Let it be informal.  Let it move around the country as the need would demand.  Why not have the family law court?  That is the type of way we should be thinking and it applies particularly in relation to matters of consumer concern.  I appreciate that it does not in any way come under the scope of this Bill&mdash;there is no hope of proposing an amendment&mdash;but I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to consider seriously the introduction of a system of consumer courts?  I believe that that is the most effective way in which you could counteract the affairs of dubious businessmen.</P>
    <P>Finally, there is the question of money.  You will never have any consumer legislation worth anything unless you have a system of civil legal aid.  I realise that this is something which has been raised time and time again.  The fact is that that legislation is most needed by the poorer sections in our society.  Those people, no matter what is provided for in any legislation, can do absolutely nothing because they are unfamiliar with court procedures and they have a <Col N="524" /> mental block about going to court because of the possible high cost involved. There is no close association between the court system, and the poorer sections of our society. Although this does not come up directly within her Department, I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to use her influence in this respect.  Until we have a system of civil legal aid&mdash;let it be limited for the moment to family law but it should also be extended to cover consumer affairs&mdash;we will not have effective consumer protection legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EileenCassidy" hpid="Mrs. Cassidy Mrs. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is generally accepted that the consumer is entitled to be protected and informed and the Irish Government made a commitment to this effect when the European Economic Communities preliminary programme for a consumer protection and information policy was adopted by the Council of Ministers in April, 1975.  This Bill seeks to meet this commitment.  Legislation is only as effective as its efficient enforcement. A most useful section to consider in this regard is section 7, subsection (2), which endeavours to define a reduced price or a sale and a recommended price.  How does one define a sale?  It is something that tries&mdash;usually successfully&mdash;to part us from the money in our pockets as painlessly as possible and have us come back for more. Which of us at one time or another has not ended up with our own &ldquo;groce of green spectacles&rdquo; complete with silver rims and shagreen cases?  Let us face it, sales make suckers of us all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a more insidious form of sale which, because it is designed to appeal to the more vulnerable members of society, is particularly reprehensible. I refer to the practice in supermarkets and food stores of offering for sale basic necessities at a so-called reduced price.  One is not told the reason for the reduction or the original price.  One is led to assume, because of subtle advertising, that one is getting more for less.  One cannot check because we have no system of unit pricing.  Limited resources mean limited choice, and whether one is obliged to cater for a large family or whether one is an <Col N="525" /> old aged pensioner fending for oneself, one is pressurised unduly to buy these items.  People like this cannot take advantage of the real bargains that are to be had in buying food.  They cannot buy in bulk and they cannot buy in season.  Shopping for them has become a hazardous and almost a frightening experience.  The housewife today finds the current consumer price index irrelevant.  She carries her own in her head.  She knows from her household accounts that no matter what she paid last month, last week, or even yesterday, she still cannot be sure what she will be asked to pay today for an item.  If this Bill did nothing else but to stop this form of advertising and sale it would be a worth-while achievement.</P>
    <P>Section 9, which sets up the Office of Director of Consumer Affairs, I find a little ambiguous, particularly the subsection which relates to his independence in the performance of his functions.  To be effective the Director of Consumer Affairs must not only be but must be seen to be the watchdog of the consumer.  Therefore he must be completely independent of the Minister and of the Department.  One hopes that the Director will see it as part of his function to cast a cold eye upon the accounting systems of our semi-State bodies and that he will adopt a standard definition of trading terms such as &ldquo;unbreakable&rdquo;, &ldquo;child proof&rdquo; so that these may no longer be matters of opinion.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that the opportunity afforded in this Bill to provide State subvention for an independent consumer association was not availed of. Such an association in providing and disseminating the sort of information consumers really want, such as lists of comparative prices at regular intervals, would help the director to be more effective and dynamic.  We have had in Ireland since 1968 such a consumer association, but they are hampered because they are a voluntary body.  I will not labour the point except to point out that in Denmark, a country about the same size as Ireland, they have had such an association with Government subvention for over 40 years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="526" /> I agree with the Parliamentary Secretary's description of the provisions of section 17 relating to the provision of compensation for those who may suffer loss and damage as being very restricted if for no other reason than it appears to the layman that in a criminal court the onus of proof is very much greater than it is in a civil court.</P>
    <P>I express the hope that the director will not see it as part of his duty to chase from our television screens the gorgeous super-mums.  I must admit they add a touch of glamour and romance to what seems by comparison the squalor of my domestic existence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>Consumer protection, even though there have been laws dealing with it on the Statute Book for a considerable number of years, is something which has only relatively recently been given its due attention.  It is recognised now that, due to the many sophisticated methods of marketing in our shops, stores and the general market place, protection for the consumer is increasingly required.  The extent of that protection is dependent upon the promptness with which action can be expedited to protect the consumer and on the amount of redress available to the person who has suffered some form of deceit in his purchases.</P>
      <P>This Bill will be generally welcomed by the consumers association.  It may not go as far as they would wish to protect consumers in their marketing affairs. It is only the first stage in what I would like to think is an assault on deceitful trading techniques now increasingly being practised, and I hope it will lead to further measures in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consumer protection is something which needs regular review because we are today confronted with a very sophisticated market place.  Purchasers are faced more and more with very tempting lavish goods and there is a great temptation to buy impulsively. On giving into those temptations the consumer at times finds on arriving home that he has been duped.  The redress which this Bill offers to a consumer who has suffered is not at all adequate.  I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to spell out in more detail <Col N="527" /> why redress more commensurate with the loss could not have been given.  If adequate redress were available to a person who has suffered, that would be a wonderful deterrent in relation to deceitful practices.</P>
    <P>It is also good to see that services are included under this Bill.  There has been a vast expansion in the field of servicing in recent years.  Before now consumers had not protection in relation to services.  That there is a period to enable both traders and consumers to adjust to the new requirements of this Bill is acceptable, but when the new director is appointed he will have a sufficient record of cases of deceitful trading techniques on his hands, so that he will not have to wait for any undue period before bringing measures into effect.</P>
    <P>The director, no matter who is appointed to that position, be it a civil servant or a non-civil servant, will always be open to criticism.  No matter who the person is, it is imperative that he be seen to be acting promptly and impartially.  It is unfortunate that the Bill does not allow a person to take action directly by way of an injunction. A person must, according to the Bill, go through the director.  This can lead to delay and detracts somewhat from the principle of protection for the consumer, which is the basis of the Bill.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary can, if not by way of an amendment to this Bill, in some future legislation to extend the scope of protection to the ordinary consumer by injunction rather than having to go through the office of the director.</P>
    <P>Business groups can do much to ensure that proper ethical standards are applied in marketing techniques.  That some people were getting away with unethical practices in recent years has been a temptation for other groups to operate unethically.  The director can be an instrumental force in persuading business groups to unite on this matter. It is in their best interests that the customer should recognise that he is being treated fairly when buying in the market place.</P>
    <P>The Bill, the first stage in the large area of consumer protection, is welcome. <Col N="528" /> I hope that future consumer legislation will extend the scope of the provisions contained in this Bill.  Perhaps then we will, from our experience of the operation of this Bill, be able to improve on its measures.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill. I do not intend to make a speech but should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary some brief questions.</P>
      <P>I am not quite sure whether houses other than single-sale, person-to-person houses are included.  Would the Parliamentary Secretary explain the effect of section 17?  Could one infer from it that the director could, on behalf of a person who has been misled, secure compensation for that person?  We all know of many cases where people have in good faith, purchased houses because of the structure, the site, the amenities and so on and subsequently found that it was not what they thought.  Can the Minister use this Bill to secure redress for such persons? It is very important because this usually happens to members of society who are not in a position to go to court or to engage in litigation of one kind or another.</P>
      <P>Is it a good practice to advertise an article by saying that if one buys such an item, he will have an opportunity to get a year's housekeeping money or a new car?  This type of advertising has been increasing recently.  If that is not a good practice, will the Parliamentary Secretary take steps to deal with it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  I am often puzzled by the fact that there is the possibility of pressure on the partners in industry to come together to make decisions but the consumer, also a partner in industry, because he purchases goods, is regularly left out. Sufficient measures have not been taken over the years to protect their interests.  It may be too ideological to have consumers sitting on boards of companies, but it is possible at some level of Government, apart from the prices commission to have consumers interests represented.  Consumers' interests should be considered in the drafting of legislation which does not deal directly with consumer protection. In a Bill relating to industry for <Col N="529" /> example, there is no reason why consumers interests should not be consulted.</P>
      <P>In this Bill when we talk about land, we are talking about houses.  People own the land that houses are built on and there is no way that the land can be taken from them unless a person has sufficient wealth to develop it.  In the context of this Bill the House is a consumer product and I do not see why a house should be referred to in the context of land.  In this connection, are people who purchase houses getting a fair crack of the whip?  It is possible that many builders are not registered.  Many of the complaints representatives receive arise out of problems connected with house purchases. It is a pity that more interest is not taken in the house as a consumer product, and that more protection is not given.</P>
      <P>Any developments which protect the consumer are very welcome and I wish the Parliamentary Secretary well.</P>

      <P>I thank the Senators who took part in the debate for the welcome they have given the Bill.  All of us agree that consumer legislation, particularly in the recent past, has been neglected. As sales promotion and methods of advertising have improved considerably in the past ten years, there was a genuine need for legislation to protect consumers and to assist genuine traders and distributors throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Various points have been made about consumer legislation generally. I said in my opening remarks that this was the first measure in consumer legislation.  I hope that early in the next session after the Christmas Recess, the Consumer Protection Bill will be brought before Dáil Éireann and as quickly as possible after that to this House.  Later on in the session I hope that the Consumer Credit Bill will be introduced in the Dáil.  It is important that consumer legislation of all kinds should be brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas and the provisions put into practice.  Most <Col N="530" /> traders and distributors are genuine, but a certain minority who may not be behaving in the proper manner are getting away with and have got away with a lot under our law.  There is a genuine need to amend it.</P>
    <P>Senator Molony said that this Bill referred to the Merchandise Marks Act, 1887.  The Act has been reprinted and is available from the Government Publications Sales Office.  On the Sale of Goods and Services Bill, the Senator asked that guarantees, warrantees and exclusion clauses should be included.  The Bill does cover these points.</P>
    <P>The welcome given to section 17 is well warranted.  A certain measure of civil redress was asked for by the many people who made comments on this Bill since it was first introduced in the Dáil during the period of the last Government.  We have gone as far as we can possibly go, but the situation is under constant surveillance. Reference was made by a number of speakers to the appointment of the Director of Consumer Affairs and this is possibly one of the most important sections of the Consumer Information Bill.  Without the appointment of a Director of Consumer Affairs the whole Bill and, indeed, consumer law generally, might be inoperable.</P>
    <P>It is important that a distinction be made between the Bill as it now is and the Bill as it was originally drafted in relation to the appointment of the Director of Consumer Affairs.  The position will be advertised and will be filled by means by public open competition. This will be done by the help of the Civil Service Commission who will set up this public competition which will be open to everybody, male and female, throughout the country. It is important that it be seen that this position is not confined to a civil servant or within the civil service area. The best possible person for the job will be appointed.  I assure this House, as I assured the Dáil, that this will not be a party political appointment. This is tremendously important.</P>
    <P>As regards the independence of the director, the office of Director of Consumer Affairs will be similar to that of <Col N="531" /> Examiner of Restrictive Practices in that he will be under the aegis of the Minister, but will be independent in the performance of his duties.  As Senator Molony rightly said this is really a matter for in-depth discussion on Committee Stage.  I look forward to the Committee Stage because it is then that the problems or flaws which may be found in it by Senators can be thrashed out and dealt with in detail. Senator Molony said that perhaps the independence of the director would be negatived by the term of five years office for reappointment, and he mentioned that the Minister can at any time fire the director.  This would only be done if the case should arise.  If it were found that the director was not performing his duties in a proper manner the Minister would have no alternative but to dismiss him.  There may be other aspects which would interfere with the directors in the performance of his duties.  I have probably referred to them in the Dáil on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary consider providing in the Bill that the Minister give his reasons to the House before removing the director, and so give the House an opportunity to discuss it?  Subsequent to that discussion the Minister could do whatever he thought proper.</P>

      <P>This point was raised on Committee Stage in the Dáil and to a certain extent it is a valid point.  In presenting his report to both Houses of the Oireachtas after the dismissal of the director, it would not be so much the reasons why the director was dismissed that would come up for debate, as whether the Minister had acted correctly in dismissing him.  The Senator might like to raise this point again on Committee Stage when we can deal with it in more detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Several Senators, Senator Cassidy and Senator Molony particularly, suggested that any member of the public should be able to seek an injunction. This has been discussed and it was felt that the power to seek an injunction should be confined to the director.  There were pros and cons on <Col N="532" /> both sides.  In the Dáil both sides agreed that what came out in the end was the best possible way.</P>
    <P>As regards the setting up of consumer courts and the question of civil legal aid, I am examining a better system of redress such as informal tribunals run by industrial distributors or consumers.  I have asked the Department of Justice to consider any improvements that can be made in the District Court system.  It is intended to look at the case for a small claims' court.  We are examining the experiences which other countries had in relation to this.  Small claims courts, outside the normal system, cannot dispense justice or impose penalties. They can order replacement or they can arbitrate, but the Constitution confines any more than that to the normal courts.  All aspects of redress will be looked at.</P>
    <P>Senator Cassidy dealt with prices, scales and what constituted a sale. The provisions in section 7 should bring more truth and clarity to this area.  I agree with Senator Cassidy that there is tremendous confusion amongst a great number of consumers.  Consumers are confused about the phenomena which has grown in the past number of years where one sees an item marked a certain price with 4p off.  When people wish to know what is the 4p off the information given is sometimes very vague.  As regards consumer information.  Senator Cassidy said that perhaps the director would not be able to do enough.  The law and legislation can only go so far.  A lot of things can be done by the consumer movement.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Consumers Association of Ireland and the IHA for a document dealing with the setting up of a research and information centre which they presented to me and which has been referred to the National Consumer Advisory Council.  There are some very valid and very good points in it.  I hope to have a report from the council on their proposals and hope to take action in the very near future, certainly early in the New Year.</P>
    <P>Senator Markey talked about redress for a consumer who has suffered and of course defects can be actionable <Col N="533" /> irrespective of any description or even if there was no description at all. Senator Harte talked about houses and asked if they were included in the terms of the Bill where it mentions &ldquo;land and things attached to land&rdquo;. In our law when we refer to &ldquo;land and things attached to land&rdquo; houses are included.  Senator Brugha mentioned defects in houses, and all of those matters would be included where a house would be sold through an advertisement in the paper, as most houses are.  Senator Brugha would have in mind large housing schemes which are sold in bulk, so to speak, through an advertisement in the paper or through an auctioneer, and the advertiser is liable under the Bill.</P>
    <P>I thank the Senators for having a relatively short Second Stage because I feel that the meat of the Bill is in Committee Stage, and I hope that Committee Stage will be soon, possibly next week, with the agreement of the Cathaoirleach and the Leader of the House.  I am glad that the Bill has reached this stage in the Seanad, I said on my promotion to the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy that it was my intention to ensure that all consumer legislation would be taken through both Houses of the Oireachtas as quickly as possible.  We have started properly and I feel that with the co-operation of everybody, as indeed we have had, our consumer law will be considerably improved upon by the time the next election comes round.</P>

      <P>I was very glad to hear the speeches of Senator Lambert and Senator Whitaker yesterday evening and this morning.  The contrast between the approach of the two Senators was something I found encouraging because, whilst Senator Whitaker, speaking from the background of his experience, was discouraging, the commonsense evidenced by Senator Lambert, whose approach would be rather similar to my own as a business man, gave me more hope.</P>
      <P>Senator Harte indulged in a considerable amount of what I might describe as justifiable disillusionment when he referred back to earlier periods of high unemployment and problems he had seen himself.  I am sorry that he is not here, because one of the remarks he made is a rather challenging one, that &ldquo;full employment in his opinion is not attainable in our society&rdquo;.  In reply to that I say that anything is possible in any society if people believe in it sufficiently and really want to see it come about.  In the economic circumstances in which we live, and particularly in view of the very large number of people not in employment, it is the duty of all leaders of society, politicians, industrialists, trade union leaders, those engaged in private enterprise and all other influences, to persuade and encourage people in this community to make the effort to accept whatever sacrifices will be necessary to expand the economy and to provide work for people, particularly for so many young people who need it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the objects of setting up this new Department of State is to try to ensure co-ordination of forward thinking in economic development which can be sufficiently flexible to take account of day-to-day economic changes while concentrating on essential long-term expansion.  There is a need for a consistent side by side planning by all State Departments and <Col N="535" /> semi-State bodies in co-ordination with the enterprise sector, that is the State enterprise side and the private enterprise side.  Co-ordination here involves the allocation of essential capital for expansion in the correct proportions.  This co-ordination can best be carried out by a Department of Economic Planning and Development such as is proposed in this Bill.</P>
    <P>To promote and to co-ordinate expansion of our resources to the utmost it is necessary to plan for expansion of resources and for expansion of employment, not on a day-to-day basis responding to the ordinary pressures that we all experience from day-to-day, but in a more determined and fundamental way.  We have an enormous work force available to participate in the development of our economy and the solution of the problem of providing employment will have to come from practical decisions rather than from pious hopes and political speeches.  Practical decisions should be end product of the work of this new Department.  A notable period of expansion in the period from 1957 on has been referred to here.  I do not think it is a coincidence that it began with the publication of what became known as the Grey Book by Senator Whitaker.</P>
    <P>I remember attending a reading by Senator Whitaker of a paper in Irish at Parnell Square around about that time, now 20 years ago, and I remember asking myself afterwards whether Senator Whitaker was speaking with the approval of the Minister or speaking off his own bat.  However, that economic document hit the right note at the right time and caught the imagination of the people. First of all, no one should assume that that event was normal or usual. It was unusual in that it was a case of an exceptionally able senior civil servant in the Department of Finance either taking a risk or being encouraged to do so in effect by participating in politics in putting forward political economic proposals to the people, and in effect to the Government of the day.</P>

      <P>This was not normal and I fancy it could still today be seen to be abnormal. I am not suggesting that the Minister for Finance would not encourage a similar exercise but I am merely pointing to the unusual circumstances of the time and to the beneficial results that were derived from it.  I would also say that we cannot expect or depend on the arrival of a Senator Whitaker every 15 or 20 years.  It is one of those things that occurred and was a contribution for which we are all thankful.  In recent years there have been too many gaps and vacuums in the development of our economy.  We have had something like an economic planning lull over the past three to four years.  We were told from time to time in the Dáil that the problems of inflation and the world trade situation meant that there was really no point in planning and it did not seem to be necessary anyway. Those who expressed that sort of view at that time were entitled to their opinion but we are entitled to disagree with it, as we did at the time, and to conclude that a part of our lack of progress was due to an unco-ordinated approach to economic development and to a lack of planned development in the use of our resources.</P>
      <P>While I respect totally Senator Whitaker's opinions I would say that he is not a politician.  His approach may be based too much on the experience of the civil servant and perhaps too little on the result of what I would describe as an article of faith, in the belief of a people to do a job and to make a success of our own economic developments.  One can say, as some members here have said, that the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Economic Planning and Development might not pull together.  I think they will but I think that one can look on both sides, the good and the bad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also suggested that there might be friction between the two Departments.  Again there might not, <Col N="537" /> and I take the view that it is the human element in the State structure and in our political affairs that counts and that it all depends on the approach of that human element to its work.  I am satisfied that in the present administration we have the politicians who want to make it a success and I am pretty sure that those who will be taking part on the civil service side in the new Department for Economic Planning and Development and those in the Department of Finance will be just as enthusiastic in ensuring that this programme will be successful in the interests of this nation which we all are bound to serve.  Of course it has been said that it remains to be seen if an Economic Planning and Development Department and a Finance Department can work together side by side.  There is no means of knowing this except by trying it out and that is what this administration is doing in introducing this Bill.  It is the results that count and if we do not get the results that we want then let us take a fresh look at the problem in a couple of years time.  The reality of our economic position is that practical long-term planning and development has not been taking place and we hope this Bill will provide an effective machine in the shape of an economic planning Department with its own Minister that it will ensure that the vacuum will be removed and our development will accelerate.</P>
    <P>The public, in the recent election, called for a new approach and for results.  Many young people and concerned parents voted in the last general election for change and for a new, vigorous and determined approach to the management of our economy.  This Bill is one of the proposed solutions to that question and to one of our problems. I hope we will all stand together and give it the opportunity to work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJMcCartin" hpid="Mr. McCartin Mr. McCartin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>Echoing the idea put forward by the last speaker, I would say in every election the electorate are looking for a new initiative, a new move and asking somebody to solve problems on their behalf.  Never more <Col N="538" /> so than in the last election was it obvious to people, through a great change in national and international circumstances, that now is the time when we must do something.  We have unemployment running at a dangerously high level and any Government in office must feel a great urgency to solve this problem.</P>
      <P>I give my assent completely to the idea of a new Department which will seek to solve this problem.  When we think of economic planning in the past, and the programmes for economic expansion, the first programmes had some degree of success.  After this there was failure, and almost a complete giving up of the effort to make planning successful.  This pattern leads us who are not as well aware of the facts of the situation as Senator Whitaker to question whether the concept of planning was ever made to work.  Its miserable failure in recent times leads one to believe that the progress we achieved in those years might have been achieved with or without that plan.  That is a question I am not competent to answer, but it is one an ordinary intelligent observer must ask himself.  It is never too late to get a new idea, or to make a move. Now is a good time to take a new look at the situation, try a new solution and make the best of it.</P>
      <P>In the past we looked too much at our own weaknesses and expressed too many doubts about our vulnerability. We looked at our situation on the map, at our economic strength, at the openness of our economy, and we thought up all sorts of excuses why we were not doing better.  We sought at times to protect and insulate ourselves.  We failed to look at the other side of the coin, to look at our strength and resources, and ask what were the strong points in our characteristics as a people, in the kind of resources we had and what we could make of them.  We did not exploit our agricultural resources. Our agricultural industry, until recently, was primitive in its approach to production.  Nevertheless, it produced and sold well-produced goods, at the right price, perhaps not always well processed or well presented, but in competitive markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="539" /> Looking at our social structure we have houses, schools and parishes full of young people, brought up in the right kind of environment, not in an urban structure where a high proportio of young people were spoiled by a wrong upbringing in slum areas before they got a chance to start in life or by family circumstances and their environment.  Over the past ten years, or so, we had the ideal kind of young people to start building an economy. A high proportion of them came from a rural background and even in their early childhood, developing skills, learning to solve problems, to cope, to improvise, and to work.  They knew what it was to work, and most of them experienced want to some degree.  We had a great start on which to build a competitive economy.</P>
    <P>We lost many opportunities in the past.  We did not seek to develop our own brains and encourage our own entrepreneurs or business people.  We did not have that tradition.  We did not encourage young people to go out on their own and take a chance.  That kind of industry would have served us much better in the long run.  We got assistance from large firms such as Asahi and Ferenka.  However, I do not see it as the same healthy natural development we could have got if we had approached the problem from the other side.  Our planners depended too much on solving the problems of an under-developed rural area by bringing in one industry.  The social changes were too fast.  We had too much of a rush for housing in some small urban areas while houses were being vacated in other areas.  People came in here with the skills and the machinery and they knew the products they wanted.  They wanted the people to do the job.</P>
    <P>I have no grudge against these people but, on the other hand, I do not like what too much of this kind of industry too suddenly can do to people.  They came in here.  They invited in the union.  They paid rates of wages which were generally acceptable because most of these industries were fairly profitable.  In the end, they created conditions in which it became more difficult for the local entrepreneur to develop.  We expected international <Col N="540" /> standards of wages.  We looked at Britain, France and the United States, and we wanted their standards. Suddenly we found ourselves looking for the standards of living in those countries while we were still a poor country.</P>
    <P>The small manufacturer, the person starting off in industry, had to compete with the wages paid by these people. The small industrialist starting on his own might have the idealism to carry him through difficult times and through years of small or almost no profit.  It is very easy to transmit that idealism to workers and the majority would be quite happy to come in and work in this sort of industry and acquire skills.  It would absorb the school leavers year after year as it grew in a particular area.  It would be a much healthier development. Now, in recent years this small industry has had to compete in wage levels with the other type of industry I mentioned.  While an industry paying good wages may seem very successful, ultimately it might not be the healthiest in our economy.  This is an aspect of planning we overlooked to some extent.  That basic trend I mentioned and the quality of the people freely available to build industry all over rural Ireland have been neglected.  Planning here has usually been taken up by a small number who were regarded as highly qualified people.  They spoke the jargon of the highly qualified and the educated.  They kept the subject to themselves and very often it was difficult for the average worker or the small industrialist to understand the thinking or the logic.</P>
    <P>I have listened to a number of speakers and some of them indulged in planning jargon.  They discussed it on a level that does not make sense to those people who must necessarily be involved if we are to take the whole subject seriously.  Ironically, it was left to the higher level ex-civil servant, Senator Whitaker, from whom the public might not normally expect to hear the most understandable language, to speak in a language which the average intelligent person, interested in the subject and observing what was going on, could understand. I do not completely agree with the <Col N="541" /> theory he put forward but he spoke in terms which showed he knew what he was talking about.  His speech was obviously aimed at the rank and file who must understand what we are talking about.  The problem is to make the idea acceptable and so the whole concept of planning must be discussed in a language that will be understood by the people who must, in the end, fill the jobs that we hope to create and reach the targets that we hope to achieve.</P>
    <P>To a large extent the trade unions do not seem to have participated in the actual planning of whatever progress we have made to date.  Trade unions, for some reason or other, have not been involved as they should have been.  In recent years I have noticed that people who speak for trade unions very often involve themselves in a sort of political ideology which the average worker does not understand or may not be interested in.  They profess to believe that the system in which most of us must work is wrong and they are, in fact, actively working to get rid of it.  It is very hard to participate in planning progress when, at the same time, you appear to be convinced and you try to convince people that the aim is the destruction of the whole system at the earliest possible opportunity.  This is a pity.  If we are to have proper planning towards which everybody will contribute then we must have all sections involved.  Plans are not something for a Minister and his Department.  Neither are they something for lecturers at university level.  Plans are something in which all sections of the community must be involved if they are to reach fruition ultimately.</P>
    <P>We all know how slowly the civil service moves and how slowly civil servants take to change.  Some people say this is a good thing.  It is healthy. It is as it should be.  I do not know. But, if we seek to bring about change through existing Departments, it will be a very slow process.  That is why I believe a new Department, through which we will have the opportunity to build from the ground up what exactly we want, where we will not be tied by the conflict of personalities seeking <Col N="542" /> promotion, where there are many inbuilt restrictions, is so important.  I would like to see a new Department in which the Minister would be free to take people from outside, from industry and from the civil service.  I would not exclude civil servants.  We must have a good mix.  We must have people from the trade unions at every level.  We must have a good mix of ideas.  We must be able to move personnel and recruit those with the required skills at the right time to do a particular job.  A new Department gives us a new opportunity.  There will be plenty of work in this new Department for a Minister.</P>
    <P>Somebody mentioned the bringing in of another Minister to the Department of Finance.  This idea could do with a little more study.  I have often wondered about the choice of the people available for the Cabinet.  One goes into Defence, one into Fisheries, and so on, and then one comes to the Department of Finance and it is suggested there should be an assistant appointed. It must obviously be somebody from a lower level, somebody who has already been passed over.  That is the impression I get.  But that assistant will require more skill and more ability than, in fact, the Minister does.  In an area like Defence&mdash;I am not saying it is not an important area&mdash;probably most of the important decisions there are made collectively by the Government. The day-to-day running of the Department would not involve the same ability as that required of an assistant in the Department of Finance. I see no reason why we should be restricted at that level.  In a Department like Finance we should have a strengthening.  The old system of taking the 15 and then taking the leftovers for the assistants should be looked at.</P>
    <P>County development teams will be taken over by the new Department. This system has been in operation for a few years now.  I am delighted something is going to happen which will enable us to take a new look at this system, its structure and its operation to date.  The idea was a good one originally.  The structure of these development teams&mdash;executive officers from the different areas in their counties, <Col N="543" /> the CEO, the county engineer, the county secretary&mdash;sounded good at the time but it is not sufficiently broadly based.  We have not got the sort of people there that we need, particularly in severely under-developed counties. Industry should be represented.  The staff should be strengthened.  At the moment everything depends on the county development officer.  If, when these teams were organised, the right man was given the right job then the team was a success, at least for the moment.  If the wrong person was given the job, the county development team was a failure.  It was as simple as that.</P>
    <P>The time has come to take a new look at this, to broaden the representation, and to bring in people from industry. If the staff of a county development team is being expanded, it should not follow that somebody from the county council is recruited into the office and serves as an assistant, and in that way the service is expanded. That is entirely wrong.  If an assistant is required, the job should be advertised openly.  As well as industry being represented on the boards of these development teams, we should seek to provide, through the development teams, people who understand the requirements of the smaller industries, because they depend on the teams.</P>
    <P>The development teams have not been giving a very good service, apart from filling the application forms and making the case for the payment of grants to the Department of Finance. After that, the service given by the county development teams appears to dry up.  There is no follow up, and no advisory service available in finance, or technology, or anything else.  The industrialists in the less developed areas are left on their own and through their own devices they have to seek and pay for whatever advice they get.  Very often this sort of advice comes from sales representatives and perhaps it is not in our best interests to leave small or young industries completely in their hands.</P>
    <P>I look forward to a revamping of the county development teams and a new look at the system of encouraging <Col N="544" /> small business people to get started and guiding them for the first years of their existence.  I hope the new Department will be successful in the work they set out to do and, whatever weaknesses may develop, the idea is basically a good one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ValentineJago" hpid="Mr. Jago Mr. Jago">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jago</NameTxt>
      <P>When I first learned it was proposed to appoint a Minister for Economic Planning and Development my reaction could be described in two words &ldquo;at last&rdquo;.  During the past few years, the lack of planning was very obvious and the effect of this lack was a disaster in the area of our economy.  I firmly believe we lost financial aid from the EEC because properly costed plans were not put before them.  This is not an opinion without a base.  It is based on talks I had with representatives and civil servants in Brussels and Luxembourg about two or three years ago.</P>
      <P>Mention has been made of the first, second and third programmes of economic development, as introduced by Fianna Fáil, in the context of their success as attributed to planning by the Department of Finance.  Those programmes were guidelines and they achieved success, in part, because they gave a lead to industry and others, and so an indication of the road to travel.  In recent years, no indications were given in any field. There was no lead, and the result was stagnation.  Thus, when it was indicated that we were now to have a Department reserved for planning and development, it was certainly welcomed by me.  This decision proves that, at last, we have a Government with the courage to move away from traditional structures.  Too long have we accepted what has been established without question.</P>
      <P>In recent years even our economists have had what may be called some traumatic experiences, in that the gospels on which they based their theories and which they accepted as infallible had to be discarded as they could not stand up in our changing society.  To me the formation of a Department for Economic Planning and Development is a first step in changing the structures of government. At least, I hope this is so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="545" /> I listened carefully to the statement by the Minister for Economic Planning and Development in relation to the first Bill and the Minister for the Public Service in relation to the second Bill, and I think there is every indication that this may be so.  I feel further changes will prove to be necessary. The Minister mentioned that the detail of how the new Minister will proceed was not put into the Bill so that he would not be confined.  That is understandable as it is a new venture.  I should have preferred if the word &ldquo;economic&rdquo; had been left out of the title, as this may prove an impediment if progress is made, as I see it, in a practical manner.  It is obvious that every aspect of development will have an economic element, but it is not obvious that the only way to control development is by economic measures. Some still hold to this belief.</P>
    <P>I believe the presence of the word &ldquo;economic&rdquo; has inhibited the speeches to a degree that all other factors have been put in the background.  The prophets of doom concentrated on the danger of clashes between the new Department and the Department of Finance.  Why should this happen, any more than a clash between the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy and the Department of Labour? The Minister for Labour is responsible for controlling and supplying an essential element without which the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy could not function.  Why has nobody suggested that the Department of Labour should be made redundant and the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy be given a Minister for State to assist him.  The two are analogous.</P>
    <P>This argument has been pressed so far that Senator Whitaker finished on a hopeful note yesterday evening that the personalities of the new Minister and the Minister for Finance might allow for success but he then added the query: What would have happened if we had a different type of Government? Respectfully I suggest that Senator Whitaker mixed up the hen and the egg.  He did not prove that the two Ministeries could be incompatible <Col N="546" /> or that the structure of the two Departments is a wrong structure.  He proved what I learned over 20 years ago, at great personal cost financially, that that type of Government which he referred to does not work anyway.  What we have now is a one party Government. We have a Cabinet which works as a team, with collective responsibility, under a Taoiseach who is the elected leader of the party.  The Ministers on that team must inject the civil servants in their Departments with a team spirit also and, in this way, results will be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>As I see it from the discussions we have had today, there seem to be two approaches to what is meant and what will probably be the function of the Department of Economic Planning and Development.  There is one school of thought which looks on it as the former type of programming we had before, and another which looks on it from the point of view of what is happening in industry today.  I side with the view taken by Senator Mulcahy, Senator Lambert and Senator Brugha, because I have taken part in this corporate planning in industry and I agree the corporate planner should not be the finance controller.</P>
    <P>Some Senators have said here that possibly the new Ministry is to relieve pressure on the Minister for Finance. I assure the House&mdash;and there is nothing personal in this&mdash;that if he was only working half a day as Minister for Finance I would not put him in charge of the Department of Planning. I will illustrate what I mean.  It creates a Jekyll and Hyde situation.  It could be said to combine the Department of Finance with the Department of Health because when all is said and done it is Finance that controls the development of health.  But could anyone imagine the present Minister for Health sitting down and finding that on one side he has an expense account for advertising to stop people smoking and on the other hand he has the income from excise duty on tobacco?  I see the same distinction between the Minister for Finance having control of Finance and a planner who has a different function, to plan and develop.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="547" /> It has been accepted that what will happen is that there will be a long-term plan made: it will be adopted and put into effect.  Suggestions have been made that this could be reviewed once a year at budget time.  There is also a case at present for short-term planning. I do not know whether that has been envisaged or not.  We are trying to develop our resources.  Our basic resources at present are our people, water, the air over our land, the land and its contents and the sea around our coasts and its contents.  We have not even begun to develop some of that yet.  As far as we are concerned, we have one great asset, that is, water. Many countries have not got that.  In fact, the United States has to pay Canada an enormous sum of money every year to get water.  We have this asset; yet we have not distributed it to the right points of our country so that it can be used.  Our road services are not even suitable to develop.  Their condition and width is dependent on the particular county through which the roads are going.  These are all basic services.  With any plan you must first of all develop the resources you have in order to make a start.  This could be done immediately without waiting for a final plan.  This is what, to a certain extent, Senator Mulcahy was referring to.  We have the water at present: if it were properly developed and efficiently used, it would have a certain added value.</P>
    <P>Whether my interpretation of what the Department will do or not do is correct I welcome the Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring only to the process of planning.  I thought, as far as I could recollect, only one Senator, Senator Cooney, expressed doubts about the whole process.  In so far as there were differing views expressed, they seemed to relate to the method by which this could be done.  I hope to come shortly to the views in that regard expressed by Senator Robinson. Senator FitzGerald made two points I should like to mention.  He made one point&mdash;I do not think he intended to make a big point out of it&mdash;that we had lost the best part of six months in planning and that we are still setting up the Department.  Lest anyone be concerned on that point, I want to point out that although the Department has not been legally set up, it is, like the Department of Public Service, operating on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis at present and it is doing a certain amount of work, by no means as much as it will do in due course because, for one reason, the full operation of the new Department will depend on the establishment in other Departments of the various units recommended by Devlin but, in particular, planning units.  In addition, we have the nucleus or basis of a plan already in our election manifesto. I shall have more to say about that later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald also expressed the hope that at some time it would be possible to make allocations to Departments and to allow the Ministers concerned, to decide their own priorities within the overall allocation.  Up to a point, I agree with him.  It is not a traditional view in the Department of Finance; it is a view which has been changing over the years.  There are, of course, obvious limitations.  In so far as longer-term policies are concerned <Col N="549" /> and commitments being made to longer-term policies, then these decisions should be made by the Government collectively.  In so far as small commitments made now might lead to huge commitments in a year or two, obviously, the Department of Finance must concern itself with that.  I have always taken the view that what has been regarded as the traditional role of the Department of Finance was somewhat wasteful and inefficient; that it resulted in a number of people in the Department of Finance having to act as though they were experts in various fields, be it health, education, social welfare or whatever, when, in fact, they could not be such experts, competent as they are.  Up to a point, I agree with the view expressed by Senator FitzGerald in that regard.</P>
    <P>With regard to the situation of the production of a national plan by the new Department, the intention is that it will produce an outline plan within a few months and a much more detailed plan, hopefully sometime during the course of 1978 or certainly I hope not later than early 1979.  When that plan is available, the budget which will be produced thereafter will be aimed as far as possible at implementation or aiding the implementation of such a plan.  That is the whole object of the exercise, that the activities of the Government will be designed to ensure the implementation of that plan. Of course, one of the important activities of the Government is contained in the annual budget.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I should like to stress that a great deal of exaggerated importance can be attached to the annual budget but the reality is that the great bulk of current expenditure is committed and neither the Minister for Finance nor the Government has any real opportunity, certainly in one year, of making any substantial changes in commitments on current expenditure.  The same is true, though not to the same extent, in regard to capital expenditure so that the area for manoeuvre within any annual budget is quite small in relation to the total expenditure.  That is not to say that annual budgets cannot make a fairly significant contribution to the <Col N="550" /> direction of Government policy and to the extent that they can do so it will be important in the future when we have a full national plan laid out to ensure that budgets do help towards achieving the implementation of that plan.  But I would not like the importance of the budget in that context to be over-estimated.</P>
    <P>It is, however, clear that if only for the reason of the influence that the budget can have&mdash;and there are other reasons&mdash;it is necessary to have, and provision is being made to have, a fairly close connection between the Department of Finance on the one hand and the Department of Economic Planning and Development on the other so that the Department of Economic Planning and Development can, if I may use the phrase, be plugged in with regard to budgetary preparation and thinking and, on the other hand, the Department of Finance can be plugged in to the preparation and thinking in relation to the preparation of a longer term national plan.  It is essential that there be close co-ordination in this regard and arrangements have been made to try to ensure this.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment Senator Hillery, if I may, on his maiden speech.  It was very interesting and I agree with him that the question of the regions is vitally important; the question of the development of the different regions of the country will be a particular concern, of course, of the Minister for Economic Planning and Development.</P>
    <P>Senator Hillery also referred to the limited executive functions proposed for the new Department.  Indeed, Senator Robinson laid some stress on this and asked some questions about it. In general, I would just like to explain the thinking in this regard. On the one hand, the great danger for the planner is that he will end up in an ivory tower producing beautifully reasoned and calculated documents which bear little or no relation to life as it really is.  On the other hand, a group of men and women who are so heavily involved in the mundane affairs of the man in the street as the ordinary Minister and his Department are, find it difficult to get the necessary degree <Col N="551" /> of detachment to do the longer term thinking that is needed to produce the basis for a proper longer term national plan.</P>
    <P>We want to get some kind of compromise between the two extremes in relation to the Minister for Economic Planning and Development and it is proposed to give that Minister the executive responsibility in regard to the county development teams and regional development generally in an executive sense and also responsibility for the various bodies that I detailed when introducing the Second Stage. That latter responsibility in regard to these bodies is not a very heavy executive function because it means that the Minister will be concerned primarily with the financing requirements of these various bodies and will, of course, be in contact with them on occasions in regard to the kinds of policy they will be pursuing.  But in the main, their activities will be ones that will be geared to the activities of his Department.  The executive responsibility, therefore, of the new Minister will not be excessively heavy but will, we hope, be sufficiently heavy to keep his feet on the ground.</P>
    <P>We are trying to get the balance between keeping his feet on the ground&mdash;and I am speaking in that sense not of any individual but of the Minister for Economic Planning and Development whoever he may be from time to time&mdash;and on the other hand, the opportunity to, as I said earlier, be sufficiently detached to have the kind of perspective on matters that is needed to produce a longer term national plan.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson seemed to suggest that the only real answer to all our problems was the establishment of a national development corporation.  I must confess I have yet to be convinced that a national development corporation is the most likely vehicle for national economic and social planning. But Senator Robinson put one or two questions in regard to the proposed Department of Economic Planning and Development and she asked how would the new Department establish their priorities over those of, for instance, the Department of Agriculture <Col N="552" /> or the Department of Finance.  I wonder if she has thought about this problem because I would ask how would a national development corporation establish their priorities over the Department of Finance or the Department of Agriculture or any other Department. There is only one way that I can see that they could establish their priorities in such circumstances and that would be if they were constituted as a supra-Departmental, supra-Governmental body.  I have always suspected that was part of the thinking behind the proposal for a national development corporation.  What Senator Robinson said rather makes me suspect that my suspicion was justified.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I said it was a concrete approach to planning and part of an overall plan.  It appears here that the Department have to have some relationship with other Departments, any Department, and I would welcome an elaboration in answer to the question that I put.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Robinson did, I would suggest, imply if not say, that a national development corporation was the only real answer to the problems that we face and what I am suggesting is that if one applies to a national development corporation the kind of questions that Senator Robinson applied to the new Department, one gets a rather interesting situation emerging.  However, it seems it is merely theoretical and what we are really dealing with is a Department of Economic Planning and Development. The position is this, that if planning is to be effective it has to be operated within the governmental system and it has to operate effectively.  The whole planning process must be part of the governmental system and that is why we are providing for a Department of State, not something like a national development corporation which would be outside the Department of State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>But is not this the basic flaw that Senator Whitaker asked about?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be coming to Senator Whitaker in a minute but I would welcome it if Senator Robinson <Col N="553" /> would elaborate for a moment on what she means because I am not quite clear that I understand how she would envisage, say, a national development corporation operating outside the Departments of State.  It seems to me that if the thing is to operate at all within the system as we know it, the ordinary democratic system, then it must be geared into the departmental, governmental system and that is what we propose to do. We provide Departments and Ministers. We give them the functions set out in the Bill and, hopefully, we give them the resources to carry out the jobs that they are being asked to do. Assuming that the job is done&mdash;but only for the moment assume that it is done in the ivory tower sense to which I was referring earlier&mdash;then the question is: how do the proposals for a plan from the Department of Economic Planning and Development see the light of day? What happens to them?  What happens is that the new Department through its contacts particularly with the planning units in each of the other Departments will be co-ordinating all the plans of the Departments of State into a coherent whole and in conjunction with the Department of Finance, particularly in relation to resources and likely availability of resources and, indeed, in relation to other matters especially in the short term, will then produce a draft plan and that plan will then be brought by the Minister for Economic Planning and Development before the Government. At that stage every Department and every Minister will be entitled to express his views and reservations, support or whatever in regard to a draft plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ultimately, a decision will be made by the Government.  The Government could decide to adopt the plan as drafted.  It could decide to modify it or it could decide to drop the whole thing.  Any of these decisions are possible, but it is very important to understand that the decision will be made by the Government, not by the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, not by the Minister for Finance or not by any other Minister, but by the Government.  Once <Col N="554" /> that decision is made, if it is a decision to proceed with the plan or to proceed with it in a modified way, then the full authority of the Government is behind it and it is not for any one Minister then to try to push it or to block it and if he does, then there is a procedure within the Government whereby that problem could be dealt with.  But I would not anticipate that arising.</P>
    <P>A great deal of misunderstanding has arisen.  It has not been expressed, I think, in this House to the same degree as in the other House, hopefully because debate in the other House helps to clarify the situation, but there was a considerable amount of misunderstanding about the role of the Minister for Economic Planning and Development or the role of the Minister for Finance.  The essential thing to understand is that there cannot be in any properly run Government a super-Department or a super-Minister and that decisions are governmental decisions and that the whole operation has to be a team operation.  If one understands that and that one cannot get a decision on major matters of this kind without a whole team operation then I think one gets the thing into much clearer perpective.</P>
    <P>I come to Senator Whitaker's contribution. I suppose I hardly need say that any contribution from Senator Whitaker but particularly on a topic such as this must be treated with the greatest respect and the greatest possible amount of weighty consideration given to his experience and his record.  I should say, perhaps, that not surprisingly when one knows Senator Whitaker his approach was of course quite logical and consistent unlike a number of other people who seemed to think&mdash;and I am not speaking solely of contributions in this House&mdash;that in effect much more power and, in particular, power over the control of public expenditure should be given to the Minister for Economic Planning and Development. Senator Whitaker is much too experienced and intelligent to follow that line and what he was suggesting was that the Department of Finance <Col N="555" /> should have been confirmed and strengthened in its functions.</P>
    <P>He is aware, of course, of the functions of the Minister for Finance which include, by law, functions of the Minister for the Public Service because by law the same person must be Minister for both Departments. The burdens involved are very very considerable and they are increasing. I know that Senator Whitaker suggested that these could be reduced to what one might call tolerable levels by the appointment, say, of a Minister of State with responsibility for the public service and another Minister of State with responsibility for the control of public expenditure.  I do not think that this is practicable especially in present circumstances. By that I mean that in relation to the public service this Government are committed to a considerable acceleration in the reform of the public service as a basic item of policy.  I do not want to develop the reasons for that now: I do not think it is relevant, but it is a fact and I think we have made it perfectly clear publicly.  Indeed, the Bill before the House at the moment is part of that.</P>
    <P>Given that commitment and given the difficulty that attends efforts to reform the public service I do not think that it would be effective.  I think we would be in danger of losing the battle&mdash;it is a battle and it is going to be quite a substantial battle&mdash;in our efforts to reform the public service if we were not responsible for it and responsibility for dealing with other Departments and other Ministers, a senior member of the Government. I would very much fear that in the absence of that arrangement the whole effort to reform the public service would fail.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, a Minister for State having responsibility for the control of public expenditure could well find him or herself in a very difficult position in relation to other Ministers in exercising certain controls, when saying &ldquo;No&rdquo; for instance, as has to be said on many occasions.  It is a difficult enough job for the Minister for Finance but I think it could be <Col N="556" /> extremely difficult for a Minister of State.</P>
    <P>I would like to make it clear that I, personally, would welcome any workable method that could be devised to lessen the burden but there are many problems involved which are not easily overcome.  If I can find a way, whether on the lines suggested by Senator Whitaker or otherwise, I shall certainly be endeavouring to do so, but it is not a simple matter of deciding to have the Minister of State in one area and another in the other area, as suggested by Senator Whitaker.</P>
    <P>There is more to it than that.  If one did this, and if one could assume having done it, that the Minister for Finance could then concentrate on the duties now being laid on the Minister for Economic Planning and Development what does that achieve?  Senator Whitaker knows it is not as simple as that, there are other duties that would not be encompassed by the two suggestions made.  It is in effect hiving off the major portions of responsibility of the Minister for Finance in order that he can do the job we are asking the Minister for Economic Planning and Development to do.  That seems to be a rather cumbersome way of going about the problem, with the result being that we would be maintaining the structure and integrity of the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>I know that Senator Whitaker is too intelligent to be carried away by sentiment but, nevertheless, he is human and he has spent many successful years of his working life in the Department of Finance.  As former Secretary of it he would not be human if he did not have a certain feeling of regret at seeing the Department of Finance further&mdash;I do not think he would be tempted to use the word &mdash;&ldquo;butchered&rdquo; but he knows what I mean.  I would not for a moment suggest that this is the only concern motivating Senator Whitaker but I am suggesting that it is a factor which might tend to colour his views.</P>
    <P>Far be it for me to say that we have the final answer to this problem. I do not pretend that the right way to go about this is an easy thing to work out.  I indicated in the other House, <Col N="557" /> that we did not claim we had the final answer and that we were going to have to, in effect, experiment.  If there are, as a result of experiments and of experience in running this Department, improvements or more fundamental changes to be made, I would not be misleading this House if I said that the Minister for Economic Planning and Development and myself, would probably be the first to want to make those changes.  I am quite certain that we must do something, we cannot carry on as we have been.  I believe, on the information available to me at the moment, that what we are doing is the right thing, but I do not claim we have the source of all wisdom and, therefore, cannot claim that no improvement can be made in this structure. I recognise the possibility that a number of improvements may be necessary in the future.  Given the options that were open to us I believe we have made the right choice in this.</P>
    <P>I do not accept suggestions that have been made in some quarters, including this House, which were to the effect that the Department of Finance have been and is, mainly a kind of a dead hand operation, and that it is not concerned with development.  This would be quite contrary to the facts as we know them, and contrary to the fact as they will be when the new Department is set up.  The role of the Department of Finance will not cease to be developmental.  It will be concerned with the budget and the budget perspective of necessity has to be at least 18 months, and it will be concerned with using the budget as a developmental instrument.  If only to that extent&mdash;I think it will be much wider than that&mdash;it will continue to have a developmental role and not merely one restricting public expenditure, but rather of trying to ensure that public expenditure is expended productively.</P>
    <P>Senator Whitaker said in effect that a pre-election manifesto was one thing and a plan was another.  That is true. But, the pre-election manifesto that one thinks of when one talks about an election manifesto today, was the most detailed and precise document that has ever been produced by any <Col N="558" /> party in any election.  I venture to suggest that it was more detailed and more precise than many documents produced officially by different Governments with all the resources of Government behind them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may live to regret how precise it was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It was detailed precision.  We could have produced a very fudged manifesto but we did not. We believed in what we were doing and we were prepared to put ourselves on the line and we have done so.  We are performing in accordance with it. Do not under-estimate our pre-election manifesto.  Do not let anybody dismiss it as though it is just another election leaflet.  It is not and anybody who reads it will see there is much more to it than that.  It contains not just promises or commitments, but an integrated programme which is operating at this moment in regard to the preparation of the Estimates for next year.  They have to be prepared within the framework laid down in our election manifesto.  While I accept what Senator Whitaker said, I want to make it clear that this is no mere election leaflet or what might be off-handedly disposed of in that way.</P>
      <P>One other point made by Senator Whitaker gives great food for thought.  The Senator referred to a situation where we could have the Department of Economic Development on the one hand and the Department of Finance on the other and where we would have a Coalition Government with a member of one party in one Department and a member of the other party in the other.  I confess that that is not a prospect I like to contemplate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>However, we will have to assume that when we set up a Department of State we are setting it up to be operated by a Government operating in accordance with the Constitution, on the basis of collective responsibility, but the fact that on occasions we may be inflicted with a Government which may not always <Col N="559" /> operate in that way and, indeed, may operate quite differently, gives one food for thought.  We cannot afford to neglect the development of this country on the offchance that we might get another Coalition Government.</P>
      <P>Senator Mulcahy gave us a lecture on planning.  It was very interesting and I was glad that it came out my way.  He had a very important point when he said that the process of planning is of itself the important thing. That is perfectly true and I hope that we will be able to demonstrate that.  I am familiar with his concern with the added value concept, but I will not pursue it here, or we might go off on another tangent.  I want to assure the Senator that the setting up of units, for the four different functions to which he referred in each Department, is proceeding as fast as possible but priority is being given to the planning unit in each Department.</P>

      <P>Senator Cooney purported to examine the political background of this Bill and suggested that it is needed as a process by which Fianna Fáil will explain the failure of their manifesto.  The manifesto has <Col N="560" /> not failed.  I do not think it will fail. I do not really think that that is what Senator Cooney meant, although that is what he said.  I think Senator Cooney was adding another bit to the myth which the Coalition parties are steadily trying to foster that they lost the election because Fianna Fáil produced a list of promises of goodies that were impossible to resist.  The people are not that stupid.  We did not just produce a list of goodies, we produced a manifesto which, as I said on numerous times during the election, was not just a list of goodies, but an integrated programme which had many attractive items but which had other not so attractive items, for instance, in relation to moderation in pay, on which some of my colleagues and I were very closely questioned on radio and television before the election.  It also has limits on borrowing requirements which, as I mentioned earlier, are operating in regard to the preparation of our Estimates for the coming year.</P>
      <P>It is no use Senator Cooney or anybody else trying to foster this myth. It is a myth that the people were simply gulled by a list of promises of goodies.  They were told very clearly that there was much more involved in it than that and it was spelled out for them.  They voted for it.  For good or ill, that is what they wanted and that is what we aim to give them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Cooney also indicated that he saw no need for this kind of planning. He is being consistent about that.  It is very surprising to me that any member of the Coalition parties would dare to open his or her mouth in regard to planning when one thinks of what has happened, leaving aside all that happened before 1973, which was referred to in the debate, during the last four years, when there was a refusal to accept the whole idea that there could be planning, and eventually under a great deal of pressure the Coalition ministry said that they would produce a plan.  They made numerous promises about when it would be produced none of which was kept.  I am sure we all recall the now notorious promise to produce a plan by mid-summer, the promise that was made <Col N="561" /> after mid-summer, that eventually culminated in the fiasco of the green paper.  Given that kind of background I would be surprised at any Coalition Deputy or Senator really having the nerve to say anything about planning, about what should be done about planning or what should not be done.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear again in relation to what Senator Cooney said, that there is no question of the new Department dictating policy to other Departments.  The overall plan and policy has to be approved by the Government.  Senator Cooney seemed to attach a great deal of significance to the phrase in the Bill about reviewing and appraising the activities or the progress of the plan in other Departments.  It is an absolutely essential part of the planning process that there be regular review and appraisal. It does not mean that the new Department will be able to say to other Departments: &ldquo;We have reviewed and appraised your performance and that will not do, you have got to do this, that and the other.&rdquo;  They can review and appraise, and they can say &ldquo;we think that you should operate this way or that way in order to correct a course&rdquo;.  The other Department does not have to accept that.  That is a matter for the Government.  The only power in that regard for the new Department is to do the job that has to be done.  Somebody has to review and somebody has to appraise but the decision as to what has to be done is for the Government not for the new Department and not for the Minister.</P>
    <P>Senator Eoin Ryan referred to the historic role of the Department of Finance and said that it might happen again.  I cannot deny the possibility that it might happen again, especially because it would appear from such evidence as has appeared from time to time recently that there was during the past four years a tendency for the old role of the Department of Finance to come to the fore.  I say that because of references made by former Ministers in the other House particularly which would indicate that there was a tendency in that direction, but I think it unlikely that that will happen.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="562" /> The whole climate, economic and otherwise, in which the Government are operating today is quite different from what it was even ten or 15 years ago, and therefore I think it unlikely that it will go back to what it was in the bad old days.  I am speaking of a good bit farther back than ten or 15 years.  Senator Ryan in his description of the role of the Department of Finance in regard to planning and development accurately described the position when he had talked about planning getting a low priority because of more pressing duties.  He was careful to point out not necessarily more important duties but more pressing duties of the Department.  In all honesty one has to admit that this has happened in the past under various Ministers including myself.  It is precisely because of that that I believe that without an arrangement such as is set out in this Bill we will not get effective planning. Maybe we should be able to get it, and maybe theoretically it would be better in the Department of Finance. We have heard arguments on this.  But whether that is true or false theoretically, in practice, I believe on the basis of the evidence available that we will not get effective planning if we continue as we have been going.  The efforts at planning that took place in the past to which reference has been made and which were quite successful were not anything like as detailed and as comprehensive as they will have to be now.  That should be understood too.  It is a much more detailed and comprehensive operation than was involved in the past.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan also made some comments with which I would agree, when he said that it was nonsense to say that this job of Minister for Economic Planning and Development was created for the Minister concerned.  It is nonsense. We are very fortunate to have the Minister concerned available to do this job.  It is a job which has to be done and I cannot think of anyone better qualified to do it than Deputy Martin O'Donoghue, the Minister for Economic Planning and Development. Senator Ryan also pointed out the contradictory arguments we have had on the one hand that the Department of Finance have too much power and <Col N="563" /> will continue to have it and will prevent this Department operating, and on the other, that the Department of Finance were losing all or most of their power.  This is not a question of power but of effective administration. If one understands all the time that the ultimate decisions on major matters are made by the Government and not by individual Ministers, one can concentrate on effective administration and distribution of duties, and not waste one's time on futile speculation in regard to power.</P>
    <P>I noted that Senator Harte claimed credit for the Labour Party many years ago advocating economic planning, and that may be so.  However, actions speak louder than words and the people who have done economic planning were Fianna Fáil not the Labour Party in Coalition or otherwise.  He also said that he had been listening since he was a child to talk of full employment and he had become somewhat disillusioned with the whole concept of the idea that anything could effectively be done about it.  I understand that, but I bet he was also listening since he was a child to talk about emigration and putting an end to emigration.  Senator Harte probably would have been equally justified in saying: &ldquo;Well that is talk, but we will never see that.&rdquo;  But he did see it.  In the late sixties and in the early seventies there was an end to emigration. I will bet that when he was a small boy he never thought it would happen.  We can get full employment. It certainly will not be easy, but it is possible, it is attainable and it is a national aim.  If we devote ourselves to it, and if we organise ourselves effectively for it we can achieve it.  I would encourage Senator Harte to be of good heart.  It can be done.</P>
    <P>I was very interested in Senator Lambert's practical business viewpoint on this.  His contribution was very interesting and heartening.  I noticed that he got onto certain other of his favourite topics very quickly, but I will not follow him on those in this debate.</P>
    <P>Senator John A. Murphy felt that the only answer is more and more public direction and control.  It is a <Col N="564" /> point of view, but I do not think it will happen and certainly not in the short-term.  Senator Murphy made a point in regard to the Minister for Economic Planning and Development on which I wish to comment.  I put on the record in the other House, and I want to put it on the record here now that whatever happens to our plans for development, for the success or failure of our manifesto, it will not be either the fault of, or due solely to, the Minister for Economic Planning and Development.  I am saying that now before we know which way it will be.  It is easy for people to make snide remarks such as were made by Senator Murphy in regard to the Minister for Economic Planning and Development.  The fact is as I have tried to explain, that anything that will happen as a result of the activities of that Minister will be as a result of decisions by the Government. If they are successful it will be because of the right decisions being made by the Government and if they are not successful it will not be the fault of the Minister for Economic Planning and Development.  It will be the fault of the Government who are collectively responsible for their decisions or lack of them.  I want to make that perfectly clear at this stage.</P>
    <P>There was another point made by Senator Murphy which I regarded as very arrogant on his part.  I am sure it was unconscious arrogance.  One hears it from people like him on occasion and one normally ignores it but I must comment on it.  Senator Murphy having alleged that the new Minister for Economic Planning and Development was engaged in some kind of power play then went on to state that he, Senator Murphy, would ignore this power play and would leave it to the Minister and that what he was concerned with was the real problem of unemployment.  I suggest that the Minister is at least as concerned about unemployment as Senator Murphy.  This kind of posing does not impress me and I doubt if it impresses many other people.</P>
    <P>The transfer of responsibility for the county development teams should <Col N="565" /> not mean any danger of restricting initiative in that regard.  Senator McCartin, in a very down to earth commonsense contribution, which one might expect from a man of his background, made some very interesting comments on the operation of the county development team, which I will ensure are examined by the Minister for Economic Planning and Development.  Senator McCartin knows what he is talking about in relation to the operation of the county development teams in certain areas.  The problem is that they operate differently in different areas, but I am ensuring that what he said in that regard will be drawn to the attention of the Minister.</P>
    <P>A point was made that the circumstances of 1957 and 1958 and the production of the grey book, and so on, were quite unusual.  I agree they were.  As Senator Brugha said, we cannot depend on the unusual occurring regularly to answer our problems. I was interested in what Senator McCartin said about the effect of big industries in rural areas and so on. We could have a very interesting discussion on that but perhaps it is not too appropriate to do it on this Bill. I found it very hard when, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, I set up the small industries programme, to persuade people in towns and villages around the country that small industries were far more advantageous to them than big foreign, or Irish industries.  I am aware of the problems <Col N="566" /> to which he referred and I agree with a great deal of what he said in this regard.</P>
    <P>It is true, as Senator Jago said, that there is a certain dichotomy of interest between the Ministers for Finance and Health in regard to tobacco duty.  It is not one that is fundamental or cannot be resolved. We will shortly be seeing this matter in a somewhat more acute form than we have been accustomed to and I think we can resolve the problem fairly well.  I was glad Senator Jago agreed that given the circumstances we are in the kind of approach we are adopting is correct.  I thank the Senators for their contributions which were invariably interesting even when, and perhaps because, I did not agree with them.  I hope the House will be satisfied to pass the Second Reading of this Bill.</P>
