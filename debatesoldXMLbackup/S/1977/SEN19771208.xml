      <P>In relation to the message from the Dáil that the Dáil has passed a Resolution, in which the concurrence of the Seanad is desired, stating that it is expedient to establish the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Community I should like to welcome the fact that the Dáil has passed the expediency motion and asked the Seanad to pass one in similar terms.  I should like to draw attention to the <Col N="799" /> fact that the expediency motion seeks to enlarge both the size of the Joint Committee and the terms of reference of that Committee.  I welcome this change in the terms of reference from the original Joint Committee established in 1973.  It is in line with the 55th Report of the Joint Committee on the functions of work of the Joint Committee.  That was a unanimous report.  It emphasised that the original terms of reference were too narrow and tended to confine the work of the Joint Committee to a technical assessment of the implications of draft directives or draft regulations.  It was the unanimous view of the members of that Joint Committee that the relationship between them and the civil servants in the relevant Departments had been a very good and constructive one but that the Joint Committee lacked political impact, lacked impact in relation to both Houses of the Oireachtas, and lacked impact in calling on the Minister to be accountable to the Joint Committee and to participate in sessions of the Joint Committee where particular policy matters were being discussed.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the membership is being enlarged because of the very substantial workload of that Joint Committee and its sub-committees. I welcome the fact that the terms of reference have been enlarged, in particular that under the first term of reference the Joint Committee would be enabled to examine such programmes and guidelines prepared by the Commission of the European Communities as a basis for possible legislative action and such drafts of regulations, directives, decisions, recommendations and opinions of the Council of Ministers proposed by the Commission.  The possibilty for the Joint Committee to examine programmes and guidelines prepared by the Commission as well as actual draft legislation will open up the scope for examination of policy matters, such as the energy programme, the programme for social action or the programme for regional policy or development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The importance of this is that it is vital that, when the Joint Committee prepared a report, at the stage where <Col N="800" /> the full committee are discussing the draft prepared by the sub-committee, if it is a matter of important policy content, the relevant Minister participates in the discussion before the Joint Committee.  This is not something we can insist upon in an expediency motion.  It is going to be a question of the attitude of the Government Minister to the work and the functioning of the Joint Committee.  Similarly, and I believe this is a matter for the House, it is important that the reports of the Joint Committee be discussed on a regular basis by both Houses and, in particular, by this House which has more time at its disposal for such matters than perhaps the Dáil might have available.</P>
    <P>The previous Joint Committee in four years in operation brought out 59 reports and not one of those reports was discussed as such by either House. Even though the Joint Committee's function is to report to both Houses, not a single report was tabled, discussed and examined for its implications. It is extremely important that the Seanad not only consider this Message from the Dáil and expediency motion to establish a Joint Committee but consider a change in our Standing Orders in the Seanad in order to provide for a regular debate on reports of the Joint Committee because unless we have that automatic facility for debating the reports it is going to be very difficult to ensure that time is given on a regular basis.  In the 55th Report of the Joint Committee a suggestion was made that both Houses should amend their Standing Orders to allow time for debates in the Houses.  It is under paragraph 5 of the Joint Committee's Report and it states:</P>
    <P>If the work of the next Committee is to be effective, the Joint Committee believes it is essential that a definite arrangement be made under which the Committee's reports are debated in each House at regular intervals, and, in the Committee's view, the minimum required is two such debates each year.  The Joint Committee would see no objection to the debate taking in other Community matters, if the Houses so <Col N="801" /> desired, but it does not believe that the debates should depend on the Government making time available as opportunity offers.  The Joint Committee recommends that each House should make an order appointing a definite time for such debates.  If thought desirable because of the pressure of other parliamentary business, there could be a limitation as to the time allowed both for overall debate and for individual speeches.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Leader of the House for his attitude to this suggestion of the Joint Committee knowing that he was an active member of the Joint Committee.  I should like to ask him if he would be prepared to bring in a motion for an amendment of Standing Orders to allow for an automatic debate twice a year on such reports of the Joint Committee as warrant this type of debate.  Obviously, some of the reports of the Joint Committee which are concerned about the implementation of EEC regulations or directives in Ireland may be very technical.  Some may just be examining the way it was implemented and not be a matter of important policy content or of political impact here.  Others, particularly when we broaden the terms of reference of the Joint Committee, will be of very crucial importance.</P>
    <P>It is vital that the Joint Committee relate to both Houses of the Oireachtas. It has a good working relationship with Departments and a reasonably good working relationship with the various sectors of society which might be affected by a particular proposal, but it has failed to establish a proper dialogue with the Houses themselves by having its reports debated on a regular basis.</P>
    <P>Having waited so long for this motion to come before us, the last thing I want is to delay it being accepted by the Seanad.  I should like to ask the Leader of the House if in his view it will be possible for us to proceed to establish the terms of reference of the Joint Committee and have the Committee of Selection meet in time for this Joint Committee to have its first meeting, elect a chairman and <Col N="802" /> establish a work programme before Christmas?</P>

      <P>I should like to support what Senator Robinson said because this Joint Committee is of tremendous importance.  It has a very heavy workload. There is a danger that we let our position go by default as far as legislation from the European Community is concerned.  Unless there is an opportunity for a regular critical look at legislation being passed in Europe, we are not doing our duty as the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>For members of the Joint Committee there is a great deal of paperwork. It meets very frequently and there is a heavy workload.  I should like to pay tribute to the small group of members of the Joint Committee who in the previous session worked particularly hard to try and sieve through the legislation coming from Europe, particularly Senator Robinson who represented the University Members and Independent Senators on that occasion.  She did a great deal of work of a necessary type.  Unless Members are prepared to do this they should not go forward for this Joint Committee because it is a very important body.  It is the main link between the Houses of the Oireachtas and the European legislative body.  Unless we are prepared to go through critically what is coming to us from Europe we are failing in our duty.</P>
      <P>Some of the other difficulties that face our legislators were touched on yesterday in the debate on the Bill dealing with direct elections.  There is no doubt that the workload of the Joint Committee has increased.  The Minister said yesterday in the Dáil when he was setting up this Joint Committee he hoped that the composition of the Joint Committee would be similar to that of the last session and that there would be a representative of the Independent Senators.  I hope this will continue.</P>
      <P>I support the motion.  It is important that the Joint Committee be set up as speedily as possible.</P>

      <P>With regard to the amendment of Standing Orders, there is a lot of merit in that suggestion and <Col N="803" /> it should be considered by the Joint Committee when it meets.  If they agree with that proposal suitable amendments can be drafted.  In regard to setting up the Joint Committee I will do my utmost to see if it can be done before the Houses recess.  In that case we could have a meeting of the Joint Committee early in the New Year.  I will do my best to ensure that.</P>

      <P>This order will enable CIE to set up a special superannuation scheme and fund for Irish members of the British based Railway Clearing System Superannuation (RCSS) Fund Corporation which is in the process of being wound up.  There are 188 contributing members and 171 superannuated members of the RCSS Fund affected by this order.  These members are or were formerly employed by the Great Northern Railway Board, the County Donegal Railways Joint Committee and the Irish Railway Clearing House.  The history of the RCSS Fund Corporation dates from 1873, when the fund was established for the payment of superannuation benefits to the salaried officers and clerks of such British or Irish railway companies as joined the fund.  When the Great Southern Railways Company was established under the Railways Act, 1924, as the main rail company in this country, all eligible clerical and salaried employees of the company were members of the RCSS Fund.  The RCSS Fund was reorganised in 1941 and the then Great Southern Railway Company (GSR) decided to withdraw from the fund and set up its own superannuation scheme and fund under the Great Southern Railway Company (Superannnuation Scheme) Act, 1947.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the establishment of CIE in 1945 and with the passing of the GSR <Col N="804" /> (Superannuation Scheme) Act, 1947, the only RCSS Fund members who were left in the country were employees of the Great Northern Railway Board, the County Donegal Railways Joint Committee, and the Irish Clearing House.</P>
    <P>Under Acts passed in 1958 and 1971 the undertakings and staff of the Great Northern Railway Board in the State and the County Donegal Railways Joint Committee, respectively, were taken over by CIE.  However, as CIE were not authorised to subscribe to the Railway Clearing System Superannuation Fund those staff who were members of that fund were only seconded to CIE, and the Great Northern Railway Board and the County Donegal Railway Joint Committee have been maintained in nominal existence pending the making of permanent arrangements for the preservation of the superannuation rights of such persons.</P>
    <P>The Irish Railway Clearing House discontinued business in 1971, and those staff who were not retired on pension with compensation were seconded to CIE pending legislation to enable them to become employees of CIE and become members of the appropriate superannuation scheme. This legislation is in course of preparation. In the interests of the remaining Irish members it is now urgent to make this order as the RCSS Fund Corporation which is being wound up has very few remaining contributing members.  This arises from the withdrawal of the British Railways Board from the fund and the passing of the Railway Clearing System Superannuation Fund Act, 1976, in Britain to dissolve the corporation and the fund.  CIE are now required to make independent superannuation arrangements for the Irish members of the fund, whether as existing contributors or superannuated members.  If such arrangements are not made by 1st January, 1978, in accordance with the terms of the Railway Clearing System Superannuation Fund Act, 1976, the powers, functions, rights and obligations of the RCSS Corporation will be vested in CIE.</P>
    <P>As the Senators will appreciate I am anxious therefore that CIE be empowered <Col N="805" /> as soon as possible to make special superannuation arrangements on behalf of the Irish members in advance of the date of the winding up arrangements of the RCSS.  This order will so empower CIE and in addition the GNR and County Donegal Railways Joint Committee can be wound up.</P>
    <P>I commend this motion to the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to put a specific question to the Minister.  In relation to the Irish members who will be affected by this motion, I was wondering whether the Minister could indicate whether any female employees are affected.  Yesterday we had a discussion in the House about the pension rights of females and the discriminatory aspect of this as regards Members of the House or Ministers of State and I wonder if the same point might arise in relation to the transfer of the contributing members of this fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got the information as to whether they are all males or whether there are females involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister be able to make this information available to me?  I want to know if there are female members affected and if they are discriminated against in their pension rights under the fund. This was discussed in the Seanad yesterday and the Minister for Finance gave an undertaking to examine the matter but I do not think we should extend any further discrimination pending examination of the matter.</P>

      <P>On section 1, the definition section, there is a definition of the postal voters list with reference to the Electoral Act of 1963.  On Second Stage Senator McDonald and myself raised the question of the possibility of postal rights for Irish citizens in another member state.  Senator McDonald mentioned the large number of Irish citizens working in Brussels and Luxembourg.  We were anxious to know whether the Minister would consider giving postal rights to these citizens to vote in the elections to the European Parliament.  It is my understanding that other member states, such as France and Denmark and, perhaps, others, have extended these rights to their nationals in other member states or elsewhere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>The postal vote is confined to members of the Army and the Garda and this is the same as in Dáil elections.  We did have postal votes for local elections a few years ago and it was not a very successful operation. The whole question of postal votes will be considered in the next year or two.  We are having a general examination of all the electoral Acts existing at the moment in an effort to improve on what we have.  This matter will be considered again but not for this election, just the Army and Garda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed with the Minister's reply because the point I made yesterday, and which Senator Robinson has made, is a very special one.  We have working for the Community in the institutions situated in Brussels and Luxembourg a relatively small number of very high-powered Irish citizens, in the main former civil servants and their wives. It is unfortunate that these people, who are responsible citizens and who can easily be classified or listed because they work for the institutions of the Community, should be denied the right to vote for members being directly elected to the European Assembly.  It is not a big job.  I am not suggesting to the Minister that all Irish people living abroad should be entitled to vote, because if one takes the <Col N="807" /> situation in the United Kingdom then the job would indeed be difficult.  I am asking that people who are seconded to Europe, who in the main are civil servants, be entitled to be registered for postal votes in their own constituencies without having to comply with the residency qualification of 15th September which is necessary in the normal way.</P>
      <P>I do not see, by virtue of the fact that the numbers are very small, that it would present an insurmountable task to the Department.  I should imagine that there are fewer than 1,000 people involved.  They need to keep close ties with home and, from my experience of making representations or going to see people in the Commission or the other institutions, it is important that they should have the closest possible ties with this country. They are in positions which can have great benefit to the people who applied for aid whether it is for FEOGA grants or whatever kind of scheme they are working for.  The Minister should seriously consider the situation because it does not present a big problem.  I submit that the European election is a new field and the intention, as I see it, is that there should be a unified system for the second elections, due five years after the first election.  We should at least have made some kind of provision now for breaking new ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be difficult to justify giving a postal vote to the people the Senator refers to and at the same time exclude hundreds of thousands of Irish people living abroad. I do not see any justification for being selective just because people happen to be working in Brussels.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I wanted to raise a point which was passed over.  It was mentioned by Senator McDonald, but he was suggesting that it was too difficult to deal with.  It seems to me, in relation to numbers of people, to be much more important.  It is a question of information which might require a liaison between the United Kingdom and ourselves.  I do not claim expertise on this, but in regard to Irish citizens &mdash;I do not mean the descendants of Irish citizens&mdash;resident in the UK I understand that they are permitted to vote in local and in Westminster national elections.  They are indeed numerous by standards of the total population of Ireland.  If the British extend the same right to them in Community elections that they possess in Westminster elections, then they will be exercising a vote and I would not claim that any such arrangements should be made.  However, if the British are not doing so they would be disenfranchised in circumstances where we retain the power, if we choose to use it, to enfranchise them via a postal vote system.  That is something that should be looked into.  We have a little time.  It is in yesterday's paper and again in to-day's paper.  Obviously the time scale of the elections is going to be a little later than we thought.  We have time to check as to whether they will be enfranchised in Britain and, if the British are not doing it, we have the power in this Bill to do so, and I should like preliminary comments from the Minister on that question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a query.  On section 3 with regard to the preparation of the register, I am not quite clear as to what the procedure will be.  Perhaps the Minister can enlighten me.  As I understand it, the present situation <Col N="809" /> with the register for Dáil elections is that there are two classes of people registered.  There are the ordinary electors who can vote in both a general election and a local election and then there are people who have an &ldquo;L&rdquo; put against their name, who are not citizens of Ireland, who can only vote in local elections and not in a general election.  Obviously this will not do for this purpose because we will have to distinguish between, say, a Swiss citizen and a German citizen.  The German can vote in the direct election and the Swiss cannot.  I take it you have to have three categories: Irish citizens who can vote in all elections, citizens of other member states who can vote in direct elections and local elections but not Dáil elections, and citizens of third countries who can vote in local elections only.  I presume this is the way it will have to be done.  One gathers the preliminary version of the register has already been circulated in the ordinary way.  I was just wondering could the Minister tell us what procedure will be adopted to amend this register.</P>

Most of these are nationals of the member countries but, in order to distinguish them from people who are not nationals of member countries, they will be defined as &ldquo;LE&rdquo;.  The register is not complete yet of course.  It is only the draft register at present, as of 15th December. It will not be completed until February.

      <P>This section concerns the size of the deposit.  This matter was raised on Second Stage by a number of Senators.  I should like to ask the Minister why the figure of £1,000 was fixed.  I know this was in the original Bill and has been carried on by this Bill.  It does seem to be high, and to be unnecessarily high as a deterrent. I am in favour of this type of protection against frivolous or irresponsible candidates.  I would prefer this way of doing it than something which required nomination only by the political parties or by some other limited mechanism.  I wonder whether a deposit of £500 would not be an effective deterrent to ensure that only serious candidates offer themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume £500 would only be half as effective as £1,000. However, the intention is to discourage frivolous candidates.  A deposit must be substantial if it is to be effective and, very roughly, each Assembly member will represent about ten times a as many people as a Dáil Deputy represents, and a figure of ten times a Dáil deposit is £1,000.  It is £100 in Dáil elections.  Of course, the deposit will be refunded to any candiate who <Col N="811" /> gets more than one-third of the quota. It will also be refunded if the candidate withdraws, is elected, or dies before the poll is closed.  In the UK a deposit of £500 is proposed while at parliamentary elections it is £150.  The figure of £1,000 is possibly the most effective figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Why are we concerned to have a deposit which is twice as high as the deposit in the United Kingdom?  The danger is that this may, in fact, deter somebody who has not got substantial means and this would be undesirable.  I do not think it is the Minister's intention to do this but, if a figure of £500 is thought adequate in the British context, why are we making it a figure of £1,000?  It should be clear to the electorate that it is not the intention to confine the possibility of candidates standing to members of political parties and that there should be an encouragement to other people. Part of the object of direct elections is to encourage general public interest and that includes not just the interest of voters but the interest of those who feel that they could be representative of one of the four constituencies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>In fact, £1,000 is no way excessive.  A better way of dealing with the English situation would be to ask why are they fixing a figure which is half ours rather than asking why are we fixing one double theirs.  We are entitled to our view and they are entitled to theirs.  The Minister will probably agree with me when I say the deposit originally fixed for the Dáil was about equivalent to this, because it was fixed in 1922 at £100 and £100 in 1922 is not far off £1,000 now.  What has happened is that the <Col N="812" /> Dáil deposit in real terms has been growing lower and lower and we have seen in recent by-elections that it is no longer a deterrent.  People are standing now for election and putting down their £100 just for the free publicity they can get on television programmes and so on.  It is no longer in any sense a deterrent.  It is not very nice to make a comparison between the £1,000 and the Dáil deposit.  We have to think of the £1,000 in itself.  In an election in constituencies of this size the smallest of which has a population of some 600,000, anyone who cannot put up a deposit of £1,000 has no business in the race at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said he is looking at electoral laws generally. I should like to echo the point Senator Yeats made about the size of the deposit in the context of by-elections. In a substantial number of recent by-elections, candidates have appeared on the scene and it was quite clear that they appeared for the publicity they could buy for £100.  That should be avoided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>We will certainly be having a look at the deposit and many other factors in the general electoral law in the fairly near future.  I agree with Senator Cooney that £100 is a ridiculous deposit because there are frivolous candidates.  We had one instance in my own constituency in the last election where one newspaper published something to the effect that there would be no election in Clare and the following day we had a gentleman from another county arriving with £100 to ensure that there would be an election.</P>

With regard to the deposit of £1,000 here and £500 in Britain, this Bill was published before the British published theirs, and I do not believe we should just do what the British do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>This section deals with casual vacancies which is a novel feature of the Bill.  It is the appropriate way of dealing with the question of vacancies occurring rather than to have a by-election.  For the reasons given on Second Reading.  However, there are a number of questions I should like to ask the Minister about the filling of casual vacancies.  The first relates to the situation where the person was a candidate of a political party and is no longer a member of the European Parliament and there is <Col N="815" /> to be a casual vacancy from that person's party.  It does not seem to me that the section requires that the person has been a candidate in the same constituency.  Is it the intention that the person should be a candidate in the same constituency of the political party of the person for whom the vacancy occurred?  That is the first question.</P>
      <P>It is not clear to me what the position is if the member of the European Parliament was not a member of a recognised political party.  For example, if the person was a farmers' candidate, if it happened that the IFA, for example, or the farming organisations had put forward a candidate and that person died, and it was a question of replacing him, would it be necessary for the Dáil in filling the casual vacancy, to fill it with a representative of the farming organisations if that was the wish of the electorate?  Or would this fall back into the catchment of the Dáil and, therefore, presumably of the majority party at the time?  Is there any restriction on who would be the person to fill that casual vacancy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>It is intended that&mdash;call it a by-election if you like&mdash;any such vacancy will be filled from the party which originally won the seat.  Even though the person may have died or changed parties once or twice in the intervening period, it will be the original party who will fill the vacancy. With regard to a non-party candidate, I suppose it is safe to assume than anybody who will be capable of winning a seat will have the backing of a party.  It is probable that is the way it will be, but it will be at the discretion of the Dáil to fill a vacancy in that event.  I am sure the Dáil will take note of the fact that the person represented an organisation and was capable of getting elected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a second part to my first question.  I am aware that the casual vacancy would be filled from the same political party as the person who had been elected and died let us say, but what I am asking is whether the political party would be <Col N="816" /> required to choose a candidate who had stood in the same constituency or was from the same regional constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>No, not necessarily a candidate who stood in the same constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that at the moment the delegate from the Oireachtas fulfils a delegate function, but it seems to me that, if we are having regional constituencies and a direct election, and the people living in one of the regional constituencies elected somebody to represent them&mdash; let us stay the Connacht-Ulster Constituency elected somebody who had very strong roots in that area, who understood the pre-occupations and priorities, and let us say it was a Fianna Fáil representative in Connacht-Ulster who died&mdash;and then the Fianna Fáil Party decided they wanted to give experience to a Dublin based Fianna Fáil person, surely this would not represent the needs and desires of the regional constituency?  Would it not be preferable in the text of the Bill to insert a requirement that the casual vacancy be filled not only by a person from the political party and grouping &mdash;and I can see the considerations that would weigh in favour of that&mdash;but also somebody from a particular regional constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I really do not think Senator Robinson need worry.  I cannot conceive of any political party who had lost a member of the European Parliament from Connacht-Ulster putting up somebody from Dublin.  That would be the easiest way to create a revolution in the ranks.  I just cannot see anybody doing it.  So, it seems pointless to try to enshrine it in law.</P>
      <P>In any event, even if you did, you would still have problems.  Take Connacht-Ulster: suppose the person who died came from the Ulster section, from Cavan or perhaps Donegal, and someone from Clare is put up instead.  Obviously he would have local problems to contend with. I really cannot see any political party getting embroiled in that kind of problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have hoped the Minister would look at the electoral laws in either Holland or Denmark. They have a kind of list system. In Denmark they have a system of <i>suppliants</i>, or temporary stand-ins I suppose you could call them.  For by-election purposes they fill the vacancies with the runner-up of the party under the list system.  Since we are going into a European-type election and since it is hoped we will have a unified system for the second election, should we not start on a semi-list system by writing into the Bill that any casual vacancy should be filled by the runner-up of the party whose member ceases to be, for one reason or another, a member of the Assembly of the European Communities.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>What was suggested by Senator McDonald was considered before this Government took office and again by us.  We were unanimous in rejecting it.  We think this is a fairer system for this session of the Assembly, whatever the Assembly will decide in the future.  Senator Robinson's concern about somebody outside the constituency representing the constituency, should not be a matter for concern.  Many people outside constituencies have represented them for many years, including my own.  The founder of our own party never lived there.  That did not militate against the constituency.  I do not think it is something to be too concerned about and it is unlikely to happen very frequently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Another query.  The section provides that the vacancy is to be filled by the party to which the deceased member belonged at the time of his election, and not necessarily the party to which he belonged at the time the vacancy occurred.  If that party are still registered, then that party can claim the vacancy.  I wonder is there any possibility of a situation arising where that party might have amalgamated with another party or changed their name.  What would be the position then?  Which party would be entitled to fill the vacancy?  Would it be <Col N="818" /> the same party under their new name or is there any need for provision for that?  If it was an amalgamation between two parties, would the new amalgamated party be entitled to the vacancy, or would it go by default to the Oireachtas generally?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>

      <P>Could I ask the Minister to enumerate some of the reasons why both the previous Government and the present Government decided not to have a kind of list system for the filling of casual vacancies?  The Minister did not say why.  He just said both Governments considered it.  I do not take that as a full answer to the point I raised. Would the Minister be kind enough to mention one or two of the reasons?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill was drafted by the previous Government except for the constituency changes.  The same Bill was considered by this Government and we were satisfied with the Bill as drafted.  I have not got access to the specific reasons why the previous Government did not adopt the list system.  I would suggest this is a discussion on the general principles of the Bill which would have been more appropriate on Second Reading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>There is, perhaps, some confusion in Senator McDonald's mind about this.  First, the list system would be a totally different system of election. It obviously has the great and, perhaps, only advantage that you can just add in the next person on the list if there is a vacancy.  As a completely different system of election which nobody has ever used in this country, it could obviously have grave disadvantages at election times.  People who have been used to voting by proportional <Col N="819" /> representation for 50 years all of a sudden would have to transfer to a new and strange system.  This would represent problems which might cause a certain amount of ill-feeling amongst the public, particularly the power it gives to parties to nominate the candidates on the list.  It does not seem to me that, once you are using PR, it is possible to have a provision that the next man who did not get elected will get the seat.  First, the next man who did not get elected, might not be a member of the same party.  Secondly, if you say it will be the next man on the party's list, there might be no next man.  The party might have elected all its candidates or might only have put up one.</P>
      <P>In the list system there is always somebody below because you put up far more than you can get elected, but in PR that does not necessarily apply. So there is no automatic person.  You could also have the situation that the next man on the list in the PR election might have got a couple of hundred votes and would not be a suitable person to nominate.  I do not see how it could work.</P>

      <P>On the definition of a casual vacancy, subsection (3) defines a casual vacancy in two ways in paragraph (a) and paragraph (b).  Reading them, I am wondering which of those paragraphs applies to the casual vacancy arising from the death of a person.

      <P>With regard to the security for costs which is provided for, the maximum sum provided for is extremely high and, of course, I can see the very great importance of ensuring that frivolous petitions would not be taken.  The whole election machinery could be brought to a halt. This could hold us up to a certain amount of ridicule internationally, but nevertheless one can see a situation where the requirement of security could be an inhibition on a person with a genuine grievance but not clear legally.  He would be inhibited from getting clarification from the courts by virtue of this provision.</P>
      <P>The court can reduce the amount of security required to whatever level it considers appropriate.  Would the Minister consider, for the extremely rare case where there would be some difficulty in finding security, giving power to the court at its discretion to dispense with any lodgment of security?  The court in effect has that power because it can reduce the amount to be lodged to a nominal penny presumably.  Why not make that clear to the court and write in &ldquo;or may dispense with any such lodgment&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that if we write in that phrase it would show the court the mind of the Legislature quite clearly on this matter, that the Legislature envisage only a nominal sum.  What the section says is &ldquo;such lesser sum as the court considers appropriate&rdquo;.  The court's idea of a lesser sum might still be substantial having regard to the ceiling of £5,000 which is the sum fixed.

Since however this Schedule extends over 42 pages, I suggest for the convenience of Senators that we take it page by page. If Senators have any points to make on any page they can do so as I call it. Amendment No. 1 in the name of Senator Robinson.  As amendment No. 2 is consequential on amendment No. 1, both may be taken together.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 40, Part IV, Rule 71, lines 23 to 29, to delete paragraph (1).</P>
      <P>These amendments refer to Rule 71 of the First Schedule which provides for the prohibition on voting more than once.  I raised this matter on Second Stage.  The purpose of the amendment is to delete subsection (1) of Rule 71. That subsection provides:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="823" /> A person shall not any year in which an Assembly election is held both,</P>
    <P>(a)  apply for a ballot paper or vote at the election, and</P>
    <P>(b)  apply for a ballot paper or vote at an election being held as regards any Member State other than the State in pursuance of any provision laid down under any or all of the treaties.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned on Second Stage, this subsection appears to be in conflict with the approach by some other member states to the system of voting in direct elections to the European Parliament. I asked for some clarification from the Minister on this.  I understand the French Bill which was passed last June provides voting rights for French citizens living outside France during the European elections.  I also understand that the Danish Bill has been passed, and provides voting rights to Danes living in other member states.</P>
    <P>This provision seems unnecessary. Why should we concern ourselves about how other countries approach the question of direct elections?  Why should it be an offence in this country for French citizens to do what they would be entitled to do under French legislation for direct elections to the European Parliament?  Why should it be an offence for the Danes to do what they are entitled to do under Danish legislation?  While direct elections are still at this interim stage and until there is a uniform electoral procedure&mdash;I do not want to be as pessimistic as Senator Yeats was about the time scale we are talking about in moving to a uniform electoral system&mdash;there are bound to be certain anomalies between the methods chosen in the different member states.</P>
    <P>As I said on Second Stage I very much welcome the fact that we give voting rights to nationals of other member states.  That is what the European elections are about.  I do not think we should turn around and penalise nationals of member states who have availed of the rights to participate in elections here but who, under their own national legislation, are given the right to vote in either <Col N="824" /> the French of Danish elections using the postal vote.  I welcome a response from the Minister and I hope he will find this amendment acceptable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this provision is to ensure that nobody votes twice under Article 8 of the Act which is part of the Council decision of 20th September, 1976, which is the instrument relating to direct elections. It provides that no one may vote more than once in any election of representatives to the Assembly.  Under this article which applies not just here but throughout the whole Community, double voting at Assembly elections in any circumstances is forbidden.  Thus the Act of the European Communities lays down the principle of one man one vote in relation to Assembly elections.</P>
      <P>It would, of course, be inappropriate for an instrument of the Communities to create a criminal offence and to prescribe a penalty for it.  It is, therefore, left to the individual member states to provide in their national law for the implementation of the principle of one man one vote and this is precisely what Rule 71 (1) does.  It provides that it will be an offence under our law for a person to vote at an Assembly election here and at the same Assembly election in any other member state. Rule 71 creates the offence and Rule 91 lays down the penalty for it.  We are complying with the article of the Council decision on this matter.  I feel certain that each member country will do likewise.  They might permit a citizen living outside their national territory to vote, but we will not permit the same citizen to vote here and for his own country.</P>

      <P>Given that this is a new situation for nationals of member states living in this country, for example, French or German or indeed British citizens who are not accustomed to voting in the general election here and who are now being given voting rights in this European Assembly election, is the Minister satisfied that they will be sufficiently aware that if they choose to vote in Ireland in the Assembly elections they may not use the postal votes?  When they get through the mail from France or from Denmark, information about exercising their right to postal votes there, will it be drawn to their attention sufficiently that if they exercise that right they will be committing a criminal offence under our law which would incur substantial penalties?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of what the Minister said, although the convention is not in favour of double voting, in the situation where national countries are approaching the framework of direct elections in different ways and where anomalies may arise, it goes further than our requirements under the convention actually to provide for a criminal offence in this country and it may cause considerable hardship to some persons.  For example, a French citizen living here may apply for a ballot paper for a postal vote in France but may not actually vote, he may find himself liable to prosecution for a criminal offence.  The wording of the section said that &ldquo;if a person either applies for a ballot paper or votes&rdquo;.  A French, German or Danish citizen might apply for a ballot paper under his own national system or might wish to exercise his voting right here for the Irish representatives to the European Parliament.  The election would take place on the same days, that is, during whatever period is fixed by the Council of Ministers.  This seems to be <Col N="826" /> a potentially very harsh provision, in particular because it means not just a question of voting but of even applying for a ballot paper to vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>This could not be worded any other way because one can easily prove that somebody has applied for a ballot paper but how could you prove he had voted?  I cannot conceive how you would begin to do that, short of asking the Italian or French Governments to break the secrecy of the ballot by looking at the ballot papers.  I am not sure if they could even do that.  The outward and visible sign of having done anything is that you have applied for the ballot paper.  I do not see how it can be worded in any other way.</P>
      <P>With regard to the main points, Senator Robinsin was quite wrong in suggesting that we are in some way exceeding our requirements under this head about double voting and that nobody is really bothering.  From the very start, right through the early debates in the Parliament and right up to the end of the whole process, there has been a very strong and universal stress laid on the need to avoid double voting. This has been made quite clear at all stages.  Not only has every country provided that you cannot have double voting, but they are bound by law to do so.  We are all bound by the convention which has been agreed by the council and I suspect&mdash;I do not want to get involved in legal niceties&mdash;that even if our Act did not say so, it would be an offence under Community law to vote twice.  I do not think we are exceeding our requirements in any way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. MacDonald Mr. MacDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to prolong the argument.  It would have been advantageous if the Minister had read the Schelba Report which was the subject of a considerable amount of discussion in the parliament on the rights of citizens of the Community and the desirability of extending the vote to them especially to migrant workers. The Minister is being a little too restrictive. I am not advocating that people should be allowed or facilitated to vote twice.  I do not think that question arises as Senator Robinson said. Nevertheless, people should be facilitated to exercise a choice.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem is do they have a choice?  If a person wants to exercise the choice, probably under the postal voting system he would have to apply for a ballot paper in order to decide whether to exercise the choice.</P>
      <P>I am not familiar enough with the French or the Danish proposed voting systems to know if this will be a problem, but if the French and Danish law allows citizens living in other member states to vote in the French or Danish elections, what happens if they send them ballot papers?  Although a person has not applied for it an unsolicited ballot paper may arrive in the post and what then is his position under this section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>He would not be held to be guilty of an offence if somebody posted him a ballot paper, but applying directly for a ballot paper to vote in his own country and to vote here also would be an offence under this Act.  The applying for the ballot paper becomes an offence as well as voting twice.  We are really only complying with the article of the Council in doing this.  As Senator Yeats said, it would be very surprising if the other countries did not do this also.  With regard to the manner of voting, it is possible we will have a large number of Italians who may be permitted to vote in their own country.  Arrangements will be made between our Foreign Ministry and the Italian Foreign Ministry to allow them to vote.  It may be postal or otherwise&mdash;they have not yet decided. We will discuss this at a later date if the Italians permit it.</P>

      <P>In the light of the fact that the Minister does not seem to envisage that it will cause unintentional hardship on nationals of other member states, a difficulty arises because we are opening up our electoral system to nationals of other member states which is something with which I very much agree.  The wording of Rule 71, considering the severe penalty it can invoke, seems too <Col N="828" /> harsh but the Minister is satisfied, and if airing the matter in the Seanad this morning has helped to clarify the situation for nationals of other member states, then I am happy to withdraw the amendment.</P>

If he rules that the paper is invalid, he shall include a statement of his reasons.  His decision under this Rule shall be final subject only to reversal on a petition questioning the election.</P>
      <P>It might be difficult to provide for an earlier questioning of his ruling. Having regard to the majesty of petition proceedings, it is really an impractical way for a person to challenge a ruling on the validity of the nomination paper.  The constitutional requirements may demand that some provision be there implicitly. Some provision for the earlier questioning of the ruling on the validity of a nomination paper should be written in.  I do not think it would hold up the election proceedings because the courts would provide a mechanism for a speedy decision on such a query.  It seems to be a situation which potentially could lead to injustice if the questioning of a ruling on the validity of a paper had to await a petition questioning the election.</P>

      <P>On page 22, the arrangements for polling stations are pointed out, but there is no reference anywhere that polling stations must be easily accessible.  The reason I am raising this point is that during the Dáil <Col N="830" /> election before last in one town the polling station was put on the second floor of a building.  In one case an elderly person was not able to mount the stairs to vote and inquired about his right to vote.  He was told that if he could not go up the stairs he could not vote.  The person concerned wrote to his returing officer but got no satisfaction whatever.  We make arrangements in the Bill for blind people but there is nothing in it that says the polling station should be accessible to elderly or infirm people.</P>

      <P>In rural areas, as in the case mentioned by Senator Jago, there is a revision of polling districts or polling booths.  There is an opportunity in the local authority to delete a polling booth or add a polling booth. This occurs in some cases where the returning officer chooses the location of the polling booth and also has a right to delete, but it must come before the local authority because they must give their blessing before this can be done.  I understand that the returning officer has also the right to delete, and has deleted in certain areas, without the authority of a local authority.  I suggest that the authority for the deletion or addition of a polling booth should be the responsibility of the local authority in the county council electoral areas.  These people are close to the electorate especially in very remote rural areas.  The case mentioned by Senator Jago occurs very frequently.  People have to travel long distances and in some cases they pass polling booths on their way to the polling booths where they are supposed to vote.  There must be some liaison at local level between the voters and <Col N="831" /> those amending the polling booth regulations.</P>

      <P>It is solely the function of the local authority.  The returning officer has no power to delete any polling station unless he is unable to provide a suitable building in that area.  That is the only circumstance under which he may do so.  It is solely the function of the local authority to provide the station for an election.  It is the duty of the returning officer to select the polling station within a particular area.</P>

      <P>On page 26 there is the thorny question of the illiterate voter.  The provision is that the presiding officer marks the ballot paper in the presence of the personation agent and no other person.  This positively excludes the poll clerk and garda who may be on duty.  It is wrong to exclude those persons because it is conceivable that there would be polling stations where there would be no personation agents in attendance.  The presiding officer would then mark the ballot paper in the presence of the illiterate person only.  This is undesirable.  There should be the check of having present the second publicly appointed official, the poll clerk, and, in addition, the garda on duty should be allowed to remain.  It cannot be said that the secrecy is any more damaged by allowing these people to remain than it is by the presence of the personation agents and the presiding officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Once any person other than the voter becomes aware of how a vote is cast, secrecy is no longer a factor. Secrecy is not maintained if a person other than the voter is aware of how the vote is cast.  If there is any question of trying to preserve secrecy, it has already gone out the door.  At that stage our minds should be directed to ensuring that the vote will be cast in accordance with the wishes of the illiterate person and that the ballot paper be marked in accordance with those wishes.  I am aware of a case where a ballot paper was checked before it got into the box and it was found that it had not been marked in accordance with the wishes of the illiterate voter.  It is a safeguard to <Col N="832" /> ensure that the poll clerk is there along with the presiding officer, personation agents, if any, and the garda.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the situation where there would be no personation agents. A more likely case is that there would be a personation agent present for only one party.  The situation where there would be the presiding officer and a personation agent for one party only and an illiterate person's ballot paper to be marked is not an ideal one.  The Minister takes very well the point I am making.  Secrecy is no longer an issue where the voter is not marking the paper himself.  Once secrecy is not an issue, we should direct our minds to ensuring that we have a system which will exclude irregularity.  The best way to do that is to have extra people there; I would suggest the poll clerk and a member of the Garda.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the same as the existing Electoral Acts for the Dáil. The original intention was to preserve secrecy as far as possible.  This permits three or four people, depending on the number of personation agents to be present.  By extending this, we would be infringing further on the secrecy of the ballot.  It is possible that we might change this in a general review of the law but it is the same for this assembly election as it is for the Dáil or council elections.</P>

      <P>The legal position as set out here, which the Minister says is the position under the Electoral Acts generally, is never honoured in the case of illiterate voters.  There is a general belief&mdash;I suppose we must blame presiding officers for not reading their instructions properly and politicians for not instructing their own agents properly&mdash;that the poll clerk and the garda are entitled to remain while an illiterate voter is casting his vote.  That belief has been translated into practice and these people are invariably present.  In his review of electoral law, I would urge the Minister to bring the legal situation into conformity with what has been the practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I disagree with the Minister that, in confining the number of people, we are preserving secrecy.  The point I <Col N="833" /> was making originally was that secrecy is no longer an issue because the vote is open.  By definition it cannot be secret. If secrecy is to be preserved then I would exclude the personation agents, the political agents on the scene, and leave the poll clerks and the garda. There would then be a better likelihood of confidentiality being maintained. In his review of the electoral law I would urge the Minister to change the law to permit the poll clerk and the garda to be present when an illiterate voter is voting.</P>
    <P>With regard to the hall being cleared when an illiterate voter is voting, in a premises such as a dance-hall there might be four polling stations around the floor and there might be a deaf and illiterate voter.  The conversation between him and the presiding officer would obviously be heard throughout the hall.  There is a requirement to clear the area and have nobody present except the presiding officer, the agents and the voter.  Does that include the officials who are working at the other polling stations in the same hall?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not have to. In a hall such as Senator Cooney mentioned, the usual procedure is that the presiding officer and the personation agents would go with the voter to a far corner of the hall, out of hearing of anybody else, and do their business without being heard by anyone.  It is the usual practice to go to the far end of the hall without clearing the whole hall.</P>

      <P>I am not aware, as Senator Cooney suggested, that presiding officers and polling clerks are politically appointed.  I am aware that personation agents are appointed politically.  The case cited by the Senator, where you may have a presiding officer, a polling clerk and a personation agent from one political <Col N="834" /> party, is an unfair criticism of our returning officers.  I have no experience of the type of appointment mentioned by the Senator.</P>
      <P>The word &ldquo;illiterate&rdquo; should be deleted from all electoral laws that come before both Houses because I do not believe there is any such thing as an illiterate voter.  There may be some incapacitated voter, a voter whose vision may be impaired. Visibility in the polling booth may be very poor; the voter's hearing may be poor; the voter may be incapacitated in one way or another rather than illiterate.  As a result of the spoiled votes in the last Seanad election and the recent Seanad by-election, is the Senator suggesting that Members of both Houses are illiterate?  I believe there is no measure of illiteracy in either House and that votes were spoiled from some other reason, perhaps impaired vision.  The number of spoiled votes in the Seanad election should be compared with the number of spoiled votes in the general election. I am not a mathematician, but let the mathematicians&mdash;and I am sure we have plenty of them&mdash;work that one out.  I appeal to the Minister that the word &ldquo;illiterate&rdquo; should be deleted in future from all electoral laws.  I agree with Senator Cooney that incapacitated voters may not have sufficient secrecy where two polling booths are operating under the same roof.  It is very hard to maintain secrecy in those circumstances.</P>

      <P>When a poll closes at 9 o'clock, from 5 o'clock on the presiding officer, at his discretion, may refuse an illiterate vote on the grounds that it would interfere with the poll. Does the Minister consider four hours to be excessive?  Would two hours not be adequate, or possibly three hours?  One can imagine a person who has been at work not being available to attend the polling booth before 5.30 or 6 o'clock.  Rarely is there such a rush at that hour of the evening that the presiding officer would feel compelled to use his powers.  If one had a fussy presiding officer he might use his powers.  The discretion should be restricted to two hours.</P>

      <P>In regard to page 27, paragraph 7, it has always been assumed that the duty of the presiding officer in the case of an illiterate voter was to read the list of candidates to him so that he could make his choice. There is no such duty specifically given in these rules.  Rule 5, page 26, states that the presiding officer marks the ballot paper.  Rule 7, page 27, states that the presiding officer may assist the elector by reading out in full from the ballot paper the particulars stated in respect of each candidate. Presumably that means the address and political affiliations of candidates rather than their names.  I presume we have to rely on the good sense of the presiding officer to read out the names of the candidates to the elector.  One is entitled to assume that a voter will know who is in the field. In an election like this, where names would be strange to electors because of the size of the constituency, they may not know the names of the candidates. There should be a positive duty on the presiding officer to read out the names and particulars.  In other words, to compensate for the lack of reading ability on the part of the voter.</P>

He may be a man who has never been to school and has not the capacity to remember, but he may have a great sense of allegiance to a political party. He may not be aware of a new candidate in his area and because of altered constituencies or some other reason he may be confused by being in the polling booth with a lot of strange faces around him.  He has been trying to remember what was drummed into him outside the polling booth.  It may be fair for the Minister to say that, in the circumstances, it would be easier for him not to have other candidates' names put before him.  In fairness to the voter and in justice and equity, the names of all the candidates should be read out because it would enable the voter to look over the field of contestants. He may be committed to a candidate other than the one he was being forcefully persuaded to give his allegiance to outside the booth.  It will enable the voter to give his allegiance where he normally should.  Anyone associated with elections is well acquainted with that sort of canvassing and persuasion outside polling booths.</P>

      <P>On top of page 28 the parliamentary draftsman is calling &ldquo;literature&rdquo; what we politicians issue at election times.  I am glad that our own word has not been taken up and put into a statute.  We should feel flattered, even though it is probably abuse of the English language to describe what we issue as &ldquo;literature&rdquo; in the normal sense of that word. Does &ldquo;literature&rdquo; in that sense cover the wearing of party emblems in polling booths?  At election times, the wearing or non-wearing or entitlement to wear party emblems in polling booths is invariably the cause of contention. This is particularly so at times of by-elections.  It is my understanding <Col N="837" /> that until this matter was put there there was doubt about it.  Some presiding officers and returning officers excluded the wearing of party emblems in the polling booths.  Others permitted it on the grounds that they could not find any rule to entitle them to exclude it.</P>
      <P>I would suggest to the Minister that it should be put beyond any doubt that the wearing of the emblems in booths should either be included as permissible or excluded totally.  I would suggest excluded totally, because if you permit it at all the danger is that it could be abused and a discreet emblem could turn out to be something of the nature of a mini-poster through time.  I would be glad to hear from the Minister on that point.  Does &ldquo;literature&rdquo; include party emblems?</P>

      <P>I am still wondering about this emblem problem.  As we know, for years past presiding officers had been telling people to remove emblems.  I wonder are they not absolutely entitled to do so under Rule 42 (1) of this Schedule, which reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="839" /> If any person misconducts himself at a polling station or fails to obey the lawful orders of the presiding officer for that station he may immediately have to be removed.</P>
    <P>The question is, what is a lawful order?  If the presiding officer tells you to remove an emblem, is it lawful within the meaning of this sentence? I suspect it is.  The presiding officer would be entitled to say, &ldquo;Remove that emblem.  I will throw you out if you do not&rdquo; on the grounds that the carrying of the emblem is likely to cause disputes, problems, troubles, disorder in the polling station.  By the exercise of his discretion the presiding officer could make you remove it in order to avoid disorder.</P>

      <P>Rule 46 provides that at the time fixed for the closing of the poll the presiding officer is not to admit anyone else to the polling station, but any elector on the premises at that time shall be entitled to receive the ballot paper and to vote.  I am not sure what this means.  Take a national school where there might be a couple of polling stations in classrooms and an entrance hall.  Does that entitle persons in the entrance hall&mdash; they are on the premises but not in the polling station&mdash;to vote?  Is some confusion creeping in here?  A few minutes ago we were referring explicitly to a definition which says that for the purpose of this rule polling station shall be deemed to <Col N="840" /> include any land &ldquo;within the curtilage&rdquo; of the building in which the polling station is situated.  We will have to be more precise in Rule 46 in regard to the polling station and the premises.  Are they two different things?  For example, a country school with a yard and a hall and in the classroom the polling booth.  If a person is in the curtilage, is he on the premises?  Does he have to be in the hall or does he have to be in the polling room?  I suggest to the Minister it is not clear.  Come 9 o'clock a large number of people could claim the vote on the grounds that they were on the premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Within the building, the actual building, is the way it is. He would undoubtedly have to exercise his discretion because you could have a very big building in some parts of the country.  As it stands it means &ldquo;within the building&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, it is not at all clear that &ldquo;premises&rdquo; means &ldquo;building&rdquo;.  It is established that &ldquo;premises&rdquo; can include both the building and the curtilage attached to it.  &ldquo;Curtilage&rdquo; has a very definite legal meaning of being attached to and being part of a building.  If the word &ldquo;premises&rdquo; is used that admits persons who are in the yard of the premises, who have gone through the entrance gate or in the yard.  At that stage if the law says that person may have a vote I do not think there can be any question of the presiding officer having a discretion to say: &ldquo;you are not to have a vote&rdquo;.  I do not think there can be any question of discretion.</P>
      <P>If a person is in the right spot before closing time and the statute says he is to get a vote he must get it.  If the statute is not clear as to whether he is in the right spot that is the fault of the statute and should be cleared up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously, there is room for clearing up here because one phrase in a subsection refers to &ldquo;admitted to the polling stations&rdquo; and the next phrase to &ldquo;any elector on the premises&rdquo;. Before that we have a careful definition for the purpose of removing <Col N="841" /> literature, a much less important thing than a voter getting his vote.  There is a specific reference to the curtilage.  I strongly urge the Minister to look at Rule 46, irrespective of what delay it may cause because there is a very important principle at stake.</P>

      <P>The wider definition referred to in Rule 42 has to do with posters.  That covers the larger area but my Department have always advised presiding officers to interpret premises as the building or, indeed, part of the building in which the polling station is situated.  That is the advice that has been given to them. There is a question of locking the polling station also.  If one locks the door, which one has to do at the close of poll, the people outside cannot be admitted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">

      <P>What is to be locked? Is it the door of the room in which the ballot boxes are situate, is it the door into the building or is it the gate into the yard of the building?  I suggest to the Minister that the position is not clear and there could be potential trouble arising from this. Obviously, this was foreseen in the earlier rule covering the removal of literature.  That rule spoke about a power to remove from the polling station and yet it was felt necessary to go on and define polling station to include <Col N="842" /> all parts of the building and any land within the curtilage.  Why not have a similar definition after the use of polling station in this other rule that no further Assembly electors can be admitted to the polling station and the polling station shall include all parts of the building and the curtilage. The matter is beyond doubt there.  At the moment it is full of doubt.  The Minister has admitted as much himself when he said that the instructions from his Department are to admit people who are in the building and then he said, or maybe in half the building. That suggests the predicament the Minister is in.  The provision is not clear.  Is it, as Senator Honan said, that the door of the place where the ballot box is is to be locked and that is the end, or are people in the corridor outside that to be admitted or are people further back in the hall to be admitted or are people in the yard outside to be admitted?  I strongly urge the Minister to remove the doubt in this rule.</P>

      <P>With respect to Senator Cooney, one can be as hypothetical about this as one wants, because polling booths, as all of us know, range from a room in a private house somewhere down the country to a room in Bolton Street College of Technology. We could argue all day&mdash;I am not suggesting that we do not properly debate it&mdash;and look for more clear legislation to cover what was termed as a polling booth or a polling station but people involved in politics or public life readily accept that there is a clear definition about a polling station or a polling booth.  At the end of the day we are dealing with a human being who will be exercising some degree of discretion. I have seen the presiding officer come to the door of the building. He was very slow to close and exclude somebody.</P>

    <P>It is clear and easily understood what the premises are in so far as boundary walls and the putting up of posters are concerned.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and regulations. However, we can get over-technical. Any amendments of any law are always demanded by the abuses we have had in the system.  I do not know if there are any blatant abuses or if many people are denied the right to vote if they approach the premises around 9 o'clock, whether that be at the door or at the outer perimeter of a particular polling booth. The cardinal rule in this House is that if a Member is approaching the door when the division bells have ceased the usher does not lock him out but lets him through.  The same applies down the country or in urban areas in any polling booth.  It is not something we should be over-concerned about but I can imagine the technicalities that could be involved.  If it is taken reasonably, and if the law is put into effect reasonably, it is only where there is criticism of abuses that one needs to consider amending the law. If one amends it in this case it will have to be amended for general elections, by-elections and local elections. We must have the same law applying for all elections.</P>

      <P>If we spot what appears to be a fault in the law we should not wait for it to become an abuse in practice before we seek its remedy.  That is what I am seeking to do here.  The point has been made that this could be answered by the discretion of the presiding officer but whether a citizen has a vote or not <Col N="844" /> should not be a matter for the discretion of the presiding officer.  He should, so far as possible, be guided by a specific Act of parliament entitling the voter to vote.  I am asking that in the phrase &ldquo;elector on the premises&rdquo; that &ldquo;premises&rdquo; be defined so as to indicate clearly to the voters what it means.  If a person is in the hall of a school, is he then on the premises and, therefore, entitled to vote or has he to be in the actual room which is the polling station itself.  It was thought fit to define it in regard to less important things, such as the right to remove election literature from the polling station in order to clear that particular right.  It was thought fit to define &ldquo;polling station&rdquo; as including the building and any lands within the curtilage of the building. This is a recognised legal way of defining the location or extent of a premises.  I am asking that that definition be repeated in this more important section.</P>

      <P>Senator Cooney says that no discretion should be left with the presiding officer and that the right to vote or the right not to vote should not be left at the discretion of the presiding officer either.  How would he handle a situation where a man arrived at the door, or was on the approaches to the building or stood outside the door arguing until it was two seconds to 9 o'clock on his watch and the presiding officer's watch showed 9 o'clock?  There is a fine element and the discretion would have to be finally left to the presiding officer.</P>

      <P>The situation is clear.  On the &ldquo;premises&rdquo; means to me inside the structure of the building in which the voting is taking place. There is a main door to any building or structure and if one is inside that main door before the specified time, which is normally 9 o'clock, he is entitled to vote.  If he is not inside the door before 9 o'clock, in my opinion, he is not entitled to vote.  I have not seen any abuses of this aspect of elections down through the years and I have been associated with many. I have not seen any great disputes. <Col N="845" /> The doors were closed on the dot of 9 o'clock by the time-keeping of the presiding officer with which he began in the morning.  People are fairly accurate about time now.  They are listening to radios, looking at television and their watches are accurate enough.  My acceptance of the definition would be, inside the main door of the building or the structure at the time specified, 9 o'clock, and that satisfies me.</P>

I am asking that it be put into the Bill so that it is not just the Senator's opinion or my opinion but that it becomes a matter of law.  I also agree that a person inside the main door, as suggested by the Senator, should be entitled to vote. I have seen situations where presiding officers genuinely thought that if the person was not inside the door of the classroom within that building they were to be excluded and the people in the hall were thereby excluded.  I agree with the last Senator that such people in the hall are intended to be covered by this rule.  All I am asking is that the rule makes it clear.</P>

Senator Robinson will support me when I say that &ldquo;premises&rdquo;, in the legal sense, is taken to mean both the building and the curtilage of same.  The Senator is suggesting that &ldquo;premises&rdquo; in this sense should mean only the building. <Col N="846" /> That is why I say it is necessary for us to be precise on what exactly we mean by premises?

      <P>The instructions we give to presiding officers interprets it as the building in question.  That is according to the instructions as opposed to the grounds.  The problem arises here because of Rule 42 (3) where it is set out much more clearly with regard to the surrounding area.  This has to do with posters and the like and it only applies to Rule 42.  We are speaking about Rule 46.  That is why the problem arises.  It is interpreted as the building and it has not created any serious problems to my knowledge.</P>

      <P>If the Senator wants to keep following this&mdash;Senator De Brún mentioned discretion&mdash;one has to have some discretion.  If one takes a country house, there are many of them where the people oblige the returning officer by giving him a room in that house to be used as a polling station. When it comes to 9 o'clock should he not at least use his discretion?  Should he lock the door of the room of the polling station or should he lock everyone, <Col N="847" /> the woman of the house and so on, One has to have discretion, in rural Ireland anyway whatever about urban areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Cooney is being very tenacious about this.  I tend to give him support.  He has a genuine point.  For instance, if it is an enormous building, the size of University College, Dublin, or Trinity College, for instance, could not someone turn up half an hour late and say that he had come through the front door of that building on time but he had a lot of trouble finding the room.  I know hard cases make bad law and all that, but if we could copper-fasten it and define it even more precisely it would be better.  We have a number of Bills at the moment, particularly the one about the description of fraudulent practices, and we know from them that the closer a law can be to absolute enforceable fact the better it is as a law.  I agree with Senator De Brún that we need discretion; there is always an area of discretion but the area of discretion should be as small as we can justly make it.  Senator Cooney has a good point.  There are certain circumstances within which some contrary voter who turned up late, found himself in the building, arrived at the polling booth 35 minutes after the closing time, could say: &ldquo;I have been on the premises. I have been wandering around&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Can one lock the door. There are some where the door cannot be locked.  That is the point the Minister has made, one cannot lock the doors when one is under the hospitality and forbearance of the people in charge of the place.  One cannot make the place one's own.  For instance, if there was a polling booth in Bolton Street there is no guarantee that one can close the door of that building against everybody because lots of <Col N="848" /> people go in for other purposes than for voting.  There is a loophole there. It is not a litigious point or a party point.  If the degree of discretion could be narrowed it would be a good thing for the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator made a point about some person turning up 35 minutes late saying that he was somewhere in the building but he cannot possibly vote because the ballot box is sealed immediately after the closing.  He cannot claim a vote once the box is sealed.  This is the extreme case.  How extreme are we going to be? I am at a loss to know how we ever conducted elections all these years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>We conducted them because people were not aware of their rights.  That is precisely the position.  I was under the impression that a person had to be in the actual polling place, in the classroom of the school, and that if he was in the hall or the corridor outside he was late.  That is the way the matter was operated in practice. I am now beginning to find out that if he is in the corridor he is in order.  I should like to read again the subsection:</P>
      <P>At the time fixed for the close of the poll the presiding officer shall take steps to ensure that no further Assembly electors are admitted to the polling station, but any elector on the premises at that time shall,...</P>
      <P>It does not read clear to me and perhaps we could end the discussion if the Minister could assure me that in a building such as a national school the people in the hall and in the corridors of that school come 9 o'clock are entitled to be admitted into the room where the ballot is taking place and be allowed vote.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kilbride</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to the points made.  The principle one was made by Senator Cooney.  I recall circumstances where in rural areas there was more than one booth situated in a building.  We have a circumstance where two booths adjoined in different rooms with a common hallway or corridor. <Col N="849" /> A person going to vote could understand that his vote is in Booth No. 1 while he should have gone to booth No. 2.  Supposing that person approached the presiding officer in booth No. 1 at 8.55 p.m.&mdash;most polling stations close at 9 p.m.&mdash;and he spent ten minutes trying to get the vote when he discovered that his vote was in booth No. 2.  It was after closing time but because he was on the &ldquo;premises&rdquo; was he entitled to vote?  Is he entitled to go from booth No. 1 to booth No. 2, arriving there at 9.15 p.m. or 9.20 p.m. and demand his vote?  It could happen that 20 people would abuse the law, people who are anxious to create a circumstance that is legal but unfair to the structure of what we intend the law to be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kilbride</NameTxt>
      <P>I want the right of a person to be clarified.  If he is on the premises but not in the polling booth, as Senator Cooney said, has he the right to vote?  When he gets into a building or on a premises connected to another polling booth by a corridor and has 15 or 20 people with him, are they all entitled to say that once they were inside the outer door they are all entitled to go into No. 2, having found out that they did not have their votes in No. 1 and vote?  This should be defined to the extent of specifically saying whether entitlement applies within the room or within the building.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect to Senator Cooney, he is pressing a wrong point although he probably feels firmly about it.  I can only imagine that he has been fortunate in politics up to now to have had somebody to do this work for him because if he insists on a definition which is not possible to get it shows lack of practical knowledge of what happens on the ground. The fact is that all of us who have taken part in elections realise that.  I have not seen a booth being locked or the door closed in a manner that it is not possible to gain access to.  I have never met a presiding officer who did <Col N="850" /> not use his discretion as an usher would use his discretion here.  I have arrived a fraction too late and I have never seen the door being hammered closed. I have never seen anything but the utmost discretion used by all presiding officers.</P>

      <P>If he was the presiding officer and I arrived as he was closing the door would there be an element of discretion to be exercised there?  No matter what the book says, no matter how the legislature has written it he must use his discretion. There is a clear definition in my mind, and in everybody's else's mind.  It is said that elected Members have such an attitude.  We spend a lifetime fighting this type of small print and we quarrel with the parliamentary draftsman to the point where we feel there is not enough discretion.  It is sad for some of us here to be differing to the extent that there is really nothing to differ about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Last word, and I am sure the Minister will be glad to hear that.  Senator McGowan raised the question of the presiding officer who is closing the door and sees somebody coming.  Which door is he closing?  Is it the door of the building or the door of the polling booth?  That is what the whole argument is about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>If we decide that it it is the building that matters then he has no discretion if the time has gone and he is closing the door of the building. If we decide that it is the school room that matters and the time has gone he has no discretion.  Once the hours comes that is it, there is no room for discretion.  What we want to decide is, at which physical point of the building does he exercise his discretion. The Minister assured me that &ldquo;premises&rdquo; means the building within <Col N="851" /> which the polling places are situated. That will do me; I will accept that.  I have to say to the Minister that is not a proper interpretation of the statute.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask whether Senator Cooney has an emendation to this.  Is there a formula he could put in there?  I take his point, and I think it is a good one.  I agree with Senator McGowan and Senator Cooney.  There is always an area of human discretion which has to be there.  We are not machines.  The point is, that should be reduced as much as possible in any legal enactment.  Is there a way?  I should like to put this, through the Chair, to Senator Cooney, who has declared he has now fallen implacably silent on the entire issue.  Is there a better formulation?  Can he suggest a better formulation?  If he cannot, then let us stop the entire matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I can.  You can define premises, but the Minister is in a difficulty. We are in a rather farcical situation and it is near <i>déja; vu</i>, as far as I am concerned, in regard to the situation the Minister is in.  He has to have the Bill.</P>
      <P>On page 32, on the rule which deals with the procedure for opening postal ballot papers, I am trying to reconcile Rule 50 with Rule 56 (2) and Rule 75 (1) (b).  Rule 56 (2) says that the returning officer shall cause the papers to be kept face upwards and prevent numbers from being seen at the count. Rule 75 (1) (b) makes it an offence for a person to attempt to ascertain the number on the back of the ballot paper. This is a duty of the returning officer when he is taking out the postal vote. I have heard of an instance where a returning officer felt the best way to deal with them was to deal with them back up so as to prevent any sort of account being taken of how the postal vote was running at that stage in advance of the postal vote box being opened at the actual count itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can see situations where the returning officer would have to open the postal votes, possibly to check was the receipt in the ballot paper envelope <Col N="852" /> instead of being separate.  It may be necessary for him to open the postal vote again to ensure that there is no irregularity, that two votes were not folded up together in the one envelope. As a matter of practice, returning officers open out the postal votes before putting them into the postal vote ballot box.  I wonder is he committing an offence if he opens them out with the number up.  It is not an important point but I should like it clarified.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>In practice they are unfolded and have to be unfolded for a number of reasons.  The most obvious one is the one envisaged in the preceding page, which deals with the situation where the receipt does not appear to accompany the ballot paper envelope. The polling officer is entitled to examine the ballot paper to see if the receipt is with it.  Again, he will want to check to see would two postal votes be folded together, which of course would be highly irregular in the case of the postal vote.</P>

      <P>I would not like the Minister to think when I speak of what I heard, I saw it.  I did not.  I do not identify my neck of the woods. On a point of clarification with regard to the recount, on page 38, Rule 65, it is provided that a candidate at the conclusion of any count may request the returning officer to re-examine and recount the papers during that count. Then at the end of the total count there is power to have a total recount. What appears to be missing is a power to recount an earlier count than the immediately last preceding count.  I wonder if the Minister would consider that there should be such a power that, if there is a call at the third count for a recount of the first count, there should be power to enable that to be done.</P>

One of the principal reasons for getting everything completed before the recess is the fact that the electoral lists are now being compiled.  If we fail to do so before the Christmas Recess, we will not have an up-to-date electoral list.  We must still assume that the election will take place in May or June until somebody decides otherwise.  It has not been decided <Col N="857" /> otherwise, so it is probable that we will be using the electoral list now being compiled whenever the elections take place within 12 months.</P>

      <P>That the Social Welfare (Alteration of Rates of Contributions) Regulations, 1977, proposed to be made by the Minister for Social Welfare and laid in draft, sanctioned by the Minister for Finance, before Seanad Éireann on the 7th day of November 1977, under subsection (9) of section 6 of the Social Welfare Act, 1952, be approved.</P>

      <P>These regulations, which it is proposed to make under subsection (9) of section 6 of the Social Welfare Act, 1952, may not be made until a resolution approving them in draft form has been passed by each House of the Oireachtas.  The necessary resolution was passed by Dáil Éireann on 17th November, 1977.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the regulations is to reduce by £1 a week the employee's element of the first-rate social insurance contribution in the case of workers on weekly earnings under £50.  This reduction was promised in the Government's election manifesto.  It will benefit all insured employees apart from permanent and pensionable employees in the public sector who are insured for limted benefits, mainly widows' and orphans' pensions and deserted wives' benefit, all of whose social insurance contributions are less than £1.</P>
      <P>Earnings for the purpose of the £50 limit means gross earnings less superannuation contributions.  These are the earnings used for income tax purposes and on which the existing 3 per cent pay-related contribution, where payable, is based.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The regulations provide that the reduction will take effect from Monday, 2nd January, 1978, which is the beginning of the contribution year for men. It is proposed to provide a new series <Col N="858" /> of social insurance stamps at the reduced rates for the various classes of contributors involved and to place these on sale alongside the present rates which will continue to be payable in respect of persons earning £50 a week or more.</P>
    <P>An average of over 300,000 insured persons a week will benefit from the reduction which will be of particular value to young people commencing employment and to many women workers.  The measure is expected to cost some £13 million in a full year.  I commend the motion for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Mr. Moynihan Mr. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, may I take the opportunity of welcoming the Minister to the Seanad and wishing him well with his very important portfolio of social welfare and health. We are all conscious that there is no segment of budgetary policy more eagerly watched and of such importance as that governing the State's social welfare commitment to the community. On behalf of the Labour Party, I welcome the motion in so far as it represents a reduction in the employees' contribution towards the Exchequer.  I have, however, some misgivings in relation to the ultimate value it will represent, and to those who will benefit. Anyone dealing with wage structures will realise that gross earnings of less than £50 per week are becoming the exception rather than the rule in any well-established wage structure.  I accept that in the case of female employment, it will have widespread effects for some time to come.  In male employment, except those outside trade union responsibility, there are few cases where the wage scales are below the gross income.  Did the Minister take this fact into account and also the fact that, despite the statistics he has, out of a total insurable labour force of 700,000, in excess of 300,000 people are below a gross aggregate income of £50 per week?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the next national wage agreement or free-for-all, whichever it may be, just around the corner, it is reasonable to assume that a reasonably substantial volume of insured workers, including female workers, who are below <Col N="859" /> this income will go above it, substantially or otherwise.  I take the guideline of the ordinary county council labourer or forestry labourer.  All along the line they have been accepted as possibly the lowest paid male employees among the unskilled groups. Those two categories have now reached the basic figure of approximately £48 per week.  With the impact of the impending wage adjustment, these people will be better off.  These are people whom the Minister would still have in mind to get the benefit of this easement in the contribution.</P>
    <P>If the national wage agreement&mdash;not agreements under any other heading&mdash; after the operation of the scheme puts people out of benefit, these adjustments should be ignored.  Generally national wage agreements merely restore the purchasing value of an employee's money rather than greatly increasing his standard of living.  While the Minister may have no control over it, in non-union areas of employment employers could say to workers &ldquo;Arising from the fact that your social welfare stamp is costing £1 a week less, I will not be deducting this and I am restoring £1 a week to you&rdquo;.  It might well be argued by unscrupulous people to unprotected employees in unprotected areas that it was a wage increase, which of course is not so.  The Minister is providing it from national taxation to alleviate hardship.  It should not under any circumstances be taken by such workers as the basis of a wage adjustment to which they would be clearly and justly entitled.  I welcome this.</P>
    <P>I would be doubtful if there are still so many employees in the social insurance industrial codes below the gross of £50 per week.  I have in mind female employment, shop assistants and hotel workers.  I would like to make a point regarding hotel workers.  Will the service charge, which is a feature of a hotel workers' wages, be taken into account in an assessment for eligibility within or without the pound reduction? These are the type of factors with which employees will be concerned in the operation of this scheme.</P>
    <P>I welcome this scheme and hope it <Col N="860" /> will work.  It represents a milestone, as indeed did the introduction of pay-related benefits and other aspects of the social insurance code which was expanded to include deserted wives, unmarried mothers and so on.  These are milestones in our progression towards a proper social welfare code that will take regard of the hardships of all sections of our community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the motion, which will be welcomed by employers.  The principle implied in it is very important because it shows the employer that the Government are aware that extra incentives are needed and that they are prepared to give those extra incentives.  I would not have any fears that it will be recognised as an increase in wages because the worker is going to benefit.</P>
      <P>We all recognise that this is the type of incentive that produces benefits, because the social welfare contribution is a major overhead in any man's employment. This is a first step in the right direction and certainly is one to be welcomed.  Unfortunately&mdash;and I say that deliberately&mdash;there is still a large number of people earning under £50 a week.  It is right that this benefit should go to that section of the community.  I can think of a wide range of people&mdash; agricultural workers, county council workers, forestry workers, those involved in the garment industry&mdash;whose basic weekly wage is under £50.  These people will benefit.  This motion will encourage employers, along with the incentives given by the Department of Labour, to provide more employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not too long ago the authorities in Northern Ireland introduced a selective employment tax.  They quickly recognised the folly of doing that.  This motion is consistent with Government policy, and it encourages the employer to look forward hopefully to greater recognition of the difficulties facing them.  I am satisfied that employers will welcome this and that it will encourage them to retain all the people they employ.  All too often an employer is inclined to solve some of his problems by reducing the numbers employed.  At the end of the year when he gets his balance sheet, he looks at the picture and he feels life has been <Col N="861" /> pretty difficult for him.  To some, unfortunately, the answer to the problem is to reduce the number employed.  It is important for the Government to show that they are genuinely prepared to help.  This is a first step, and I think it will be recognised and welcomed in the employment sector.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PierceButler" hpid="Mr. Butler Mr. Butler">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this motion on behalf of the Fine Gael Party.  I believe any contribution or any increase in the take home pay of workers earning less than £50 per week must be welcomed by all.  One thing that worries me about the motion is that for young people earning £50 or close to £50 per week, who do some overtime and increase their gross earnings to over £50 a week, this would have a detrimental effect.  To rectify the situation one should take into consideration the yearly earnings of people earning £2,600 a year.  Then one could counteract to some effect the gross earnings of people who do overtime. I am talking about apprentices. I know they do not earn £50 a week, but there is a certain amount of overtime in industry which would increase their weekly earnings, although over the year it may not increase their earnings to over £2,600.  I suggest that some amendment might be made to the motion to allow for that situation.</P>
      <P>It surprised me to read that 300,000 insured persons a week will benefit from this scheme.  I did not realise we had so many people earning less than £50 a week.  It surprises me that in this day and age we have so many people earning such a low wage. That the measure would cost £13 million also surprises me.  I am working in industry and I know the type of wages people are earning.  In the industry in which I work I do not believe there would be 1 per cent of the employees earning less than £50 a week.  Perhaps later the Minister could give me a breakdown of the type of work those 300,000 people are doing.  People, like myself, in trade unions, would like to find out what type of work these 300,000 people are doing because we might be able to make a case for them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Minister for mentioning the many women workers who will benefit from this scheme.  Many of these women who are employed in manufacturing industries will be the beneficiaries of the Minister's largesse only because they are the victims of discrimination in the matter of equal pay.  If our Government's prediction of a 5 per cent increase in wages holds good for next year, and if our experts have done their sums correctly women in this category will continue to benefit for another 12 months or so.  But, with the success of more equal pay claims, the gap will become narrower.  I would ask the Minister at this stage to keep under review this ceiling figure of £50 per week and to raise it so that they will continue to benefit.  In that way our Government will not seem to be giving with one hand what they intend to take back with the other.</P>
      <P>This is the sort of unrealistic Alice in Wonderland approach to social welfare benefits that was characteristic of the National Coalition Government in their last days.  In our January Budget, for example, the old age pensioners were promised a rise, but it only applied to those of them who were fortunate enough to survive the rigours of a particularly harsh winter. Those of us who benefit from children's allowance were told to expect a bonanza in the summer.  It came the month after several of our children had left school but we pocketed our small change and said nothing because we were aware of the sinister rumblings that the then Minister for Finance was threatening to remove from us altogether what some of us in our foolishness had come to regard as a right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People are not fools and this sort of political chicanery seems to me to be calculated to drive most of us frantic with sheer frustration.  Basically, social welfare is a matter of insurance&mdash; insurance by the State against revolution and by the citizen against unemployment and sickness.  But, as our social attitudes have changed slowly, and become more liberal, the State has had to accept the responsibility for more than just the aged and the infirm. <Col N="863" /> The State now accepts responsibility for the abandoned, for the deserted wife, for the single parent families; and, of course, with this increase in responsibility the whole scheme has become more unwieldly, more bureaucratic and more impersonal.  With this more liberal attitude also there is proportionately a decrease in what I would like to call social responsibility for the principles of social justice.  We have the curious situation today that when social welfare benefits are costing more than ever before, we have more real poverty and less individual and less community responsibility or awareness.</P>
    <P>If I am prepared to pay more in taxes so that the social welfare scheme can increase, have I thus made the State the custodian of my conscience; or does the stage come when the State says to me &ldquo;This is as far as we go, the rest is up to you?&rdquo;  I do not want to get involved in talking in high-faluting terms of social justice&mdash;I think these things are better left for the boys in the episcopal bonnets&mdash;but it occurs to me that we take our social justice in small weekly doses along with our Sunday sermons.  We can never hope to eliminate poverty, but we can be a caring community if we are given a lead by a Government prepared to base their social welfare policy upon the notion of helping out rather than merely handing out.  We can perhaps hope in this way to alleviate some of the more dreadful consequences of what Shaw called &ldquo;the greatest of evils and the worst of crimes&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister for Health and Social Welfare here. If he comes with good tidings as often as his predecessor and his Parliamentary Secretary did, he will have served a very good term indeed.  Any reduction in any form of taxation, be it income tax or social insurance stamps, is always welcome; and nobody could begrudge any reduction.  However, we have to look at it a bit more closely from the national and from the Exchequer points of view and weigh up the situation.  Just as there is always a choice to be made between demands on expenditure, so also, when it comes to giving out central Exchequer funds, <Col N="864" /> the choice has to be made as to the best way that money is to be spent. If I had £13 million to distribute, as the Minister for Finance and Minister for Social Welfare have, I doubt if I would spend it in exactly the way it is listed here to be spent.  Thirteen million pounds is a lot of money in these times.  If we look at this a little closer, we find areas which raise certain doubts about both the long-term efficacy of the legislation and its general benefit.</P>
      <P>First, let us look at the question of the date.  I could be partisan and say &ldquo;Why not October rather than January,&rdquo; but I will accept the Minister's and the officials' arguments that there are adminstrative problems here and that we have to exhaust the current year's insurance stamp supplies before we embark on a reduction in the contribution.  Another Government found it was feasible to give benefits in October when previously it had been said that they could not be given in that month.  I could also say that perhaps this reduction could have been given a little earlier than January. However, we will leave that.</P>
      <P>We will move on to the number of people who will benefit from this because they earn less than £50 a week. This is a grey area and some doubts have been raised as regards the numbers who will benefit.  If I accept the Minister's statement of 300,000, it leads to the further question about the long-term efficiency of this reduction of £1.  For instance, if there is another phase of the national wage agreement, which will bring many of these 300,000 employees over the £50 margin, what happens then?  Will there be a further upgrading of the ceiling figure?</P>
      <P>The most important question is this. Is this the best way of spending £13 million?  How will the young people&mdash; and it is the young people the Minister expressly declares will be particularly appreciative of this measure&mdash;react to this extra £1 which they are going to have in their pockets?  I can think of many other people&mdash;fathers and mothers, for instance&mdash;who if they had £1 extra in their pockets would probably put that money to better use than the young people will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="865" /> Will the employer take advantage of this £1 reduction?  There is an element of truth in the assertion which has been made that there will be cases where the employer will take advantage of that.  I am not going to say it will be taken advantage of generally, but there will be cases where it will arise. If it does arise, that will take away from the general benefit of this legislation. The most important question is this.  Will it do anything to encourage employment?  I cannot see any way in which this £1 reduction will encourage employment.  I do not think the employers are going to snap it up as an opportunity to increase the numbers in their employment.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, I am not going to begrudge any reduction in any form of taxation.  However, if I had the personal decision to make as regards the expenditure of £13 million from the Central Fund.  I am sure I could find far more needy cases within the social welfare category than this section of the community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Markey raised a number of interesting questions of a practical kind, just as Senator Cassidy raised questions of a philosophic kind. I wish she had spoken longer because I found what she had to say on the whole subject of social welfare extremely challenging and interesting.  I am not holding any brief for anybody, out I believe the question Senator Markey asked is the one that is in everybody's mind: if you had £13 million to spend, would you expend it in this way?  That is a very weighty question.  If I sought for a means of justifying the application of this £13 million to what seems a trivial thing &mdash;putting £1 a week extra in the pockets of people earning less than £50 per week&mdash;I would argue that it is probably well spent for one reason: that it would be a small but genuine incentive to people to stay in employment. A great malaise afflicting our society at the moment is the manner in which the gap between what you can get when unemployed and when employed is narrowing so much in certain areas that almost a death wish is falling upon our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="866" /> I am not going to generalise about Ferenka, but everybody recognises the fact that the satisfaction of working, of doing a job and of drawing a commensurate salary, is something that is slowly dying&mdash;pride in work is dying. This is one of the biggest afflictions not of Europe, but of these islands&mdash; Britain and Ireland.  If you have people working and earning less than £50, anything that would keep them working is a good thing.  One of the challenges facing our society at the moment is to make the rhythm of going to work, earning money, being paid in a commensurate wage, not being over-taxed, and not being made to feel that the more you exert yourself the more you are going to be taxed. The more we can alleviate that, the more we are going to add to the health of our society.  Senator Butler raised the question of people doing overtime. I welcome this idea because even if people do &ldquo;nixers&rdquo; it means they still recognise that you should work for your money.  That is a very important aspect of our society.</P>
    <P>This is a tiny measure.  The Minister would not claim it is a large measure, but it is a fairly well-placed measure with regard to the allocation of £13 million.  That reflection was sparked particularly by the point made by Senator Markey.</P>

      <P>I would like to join in welcoming the Minister to this House and to wish him every success in his office.  This increase will be welcomed by both the lower paid worker and the employer.  To the lower paid worker it means at least a 2 per cent increase, free of tax.  To the employer it is an indication that what can be termed taxation on employment is being reduced. I presume that the part of the stamp the employer will pay in the future will not be changed.  He will still pay the same amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The stamp always inhibits casual employment. If an employer gives a person a day's work it will cost him the stamp.  The sooner the stamp is removed the better for casual employers. Also from the employer's point of view, it means that there will be more money spent locally.  Money in circulation should improve trade in the home market. <Col N="867" /> One thing that worries me, and perhaps the Minister can clarify this point, is the administration of this measure.  There may be a number of employees whose basic wage is under £50 per week but there are differentials and, as has been mentioned, overtime. One week an employee might earn less than £50 and the next week over £50.  Does that mean that a different stamp has to be put on for a different week?  In industry a person is paid a fixed basic amount per week and at the end of the month any overtime or differential due is paid.  Do you take the average per month or do you have the low rate stamp on three weeks with a higher rate on the fourth week? These are some of the problems I see in the administration of this scheme.  Perhaps the Minister could clarify this.</P>

      <P>I would like to say at the outset that this is a very simple, straightforward proposal.  It is a fulfilment of an election promise.  It will give 303,000 lower paid workers an extra £1 per week.  It is as simple, as straightforward and as direct as that.</P>
      <P>I shall deal with how I arrive at the figure of 303,000.  This matter was adverted to in the Dáil but it is a very accurate calculation; I will put it more precisely, it is a very accurate projection.  We have approximately 900,000 insured employees in this country.  Of those about 200,000 are in the public sector or elsewhere, and we are left with the figure of 700,000 which is the relevant figure for this calculation.  The most accurate projection we can make by analysis, from statisticians' and the Revenue Commissioners' figures is that approximately 43.4 per cent of that number is under £50 a week&mdash;a figure which, when superannuation is deducted, is £50 a week or less.  This means that 43.4 per cent of 707,000 is approximately 303,000.  I do not think there is much point in arguing a great deal about that. It is an interesting figure from the point of view of the indication it gives us as to how our workforce is constituted. As far as this proposal is concerned, it is as accurate as it can be and points directly to the cost of the proposal, that is £13 million in a full year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="868" /> The existing system of a flat rate contribution for social insurance is in essence unfair.  It does not matter what a person earns at the moment, provided he is in a particular category he pays the same level of contributions. I want to emphasise that this reduction of £1 a week in the stamp for people earning less than £50 a week must be regarded as an interim measure. I intend, by April, 1979, to introduce a fully pay-related system of social insurance where an employee's contribution will be directly related to what he earns.  This will be calculated on a percentage basis.  That is the right and fair way to give effect to insurance. As I said, I hope that will be in operation by April, 1979.  I wished to bring it earlier but unfortunately this sort of changeover can only be given effect to at the beginning of an income tax year because we will be using the Revenue Commissioners' PAYE mechanism for collecting this contribution. It had to come into operation either in April, 1978, or April, 1979.  Unfortunately, because of many complex administrative difficulties it cannot be brought in by April, 1978, so we have to wait until April, 1979.  It will be coming in then and people will contribute to the insurance fund in exact proportion to what they earn, with a cut-off point at a certain figure above which the contribution will not continue to increase.  This proposal is seen in the light of that change-over.  This is going some way towards that.  In that it reduces the burden of the insurance contribution on the lower paid employee. It is as simple and straightforward as that.  As Senator Martin says, in the present circumstances we could not use this £13 million more equitably in that area.  It is an immediate relief of this flat rate contribution burden on lower paid employees.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators referred to the manner in which the £50 will be calculated.  As I have already indicated, it will be the gross figure less superannuation.  Thereafter it will be calculated in the exact same way as income is determined at present for the 3 per cent pay-related social insurance <Col N="869" /> contribution.  Each week by itself will be taken and the employer may be affixing the lower rate stamp one week and the higher rate stamp the next week.  That, unfortunately, cannot be avoided.  Everything that is normally included as pay will count&mdash; overtime, bonuses, holiday pay, danger money and so on.  Anything that is brought into account for income tax purposes will be brought in to determine the £50 level.</P>
    <P>There is one important point I should like to make.  In the case of people who do not work a full week, if a man or woman works one, two or three days it would be the actual earnings that would count.  The two or three days' income will not be projected over the whole week to give a higher figure with the possibility of bringing the person over the £50 limit.  It will be the exact earnings for the week that will count.</P>
    <P>Deputies are suggesting that this £50 limit should be reviewed.  They are, I think, overlooking the fact that, in any event, this will all be subsumed into the new pay-related insurance contribution system which will be introduced in April, 1979.  To that extent it is not a long-term proposal.  It will only operate between now and then at the very outset.</P>
    <P>Senator Moynihan specifically asked about hotel workers.  In so far as the service charge goes into their pay in the normal way, it will be included for the purpose of determining the £50 per week.</P>
    <P>I think these are the main questions raised by Senators during the debate. I am glad that, with the exception of minor criticisms, the proposal has been welcomed by the Seanad, as I expected it to be.  It is an interim measure, ultimately to be assumed into a much broader and more comprehensive and fairer arrangement for social contributions. It does make an immediate, positive, helpful contribution to the lot of 303,000 lower paid workers, young people and women workers especially.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasWhitaker" hpid="Dr. Whitaker Dr. Whitaker">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Whitaker</NameTxt>
      <P>Ní bhfuair mé faill aréir ach chun fáilte a chur roimh an mBille seo.  Ansin, b'éigean dom scoir. Last night, in welcoming this Bill to authorise further aid for the Third World, I was saying how appropriate it was that such a Bill should follow so soon on the Economic Planning Department Bill which was concerned with our own economic and social development.  I say &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo; because I have always felt that we should never become so preoccupied with our own problems, serious as they may be, so preoccupied with our own advancement, as to forget the fact that we are already amongst the 25 richest countries in the world.  In fact, we are No. 21 on the list.  An enormous gap separates us from the 1,200 million people&mdash;over 40 per cent of the world's population&mdash;who, despite all the efforts made so far, still have to try to survive on less than £1.50 per head per week.  They are, in other words, condemned to live in squalid and degrading circumstances.  Amongst these, as the Parliamentary Secretary remarked, there are at least 750 million in a state of absolute poverty, at the very margin of physical existence, and the sad fact is that their condition has virtually stagnated over the past decade, which has been accepted as a decade of development.</P>
      <P>I have been brought to a knowledge of these grim facts by the assiduous and eloquent concern of Mr. Robert McNamara, who is President of the World Bank and President of IDA, the organisation for which we are in this Bill providing additional finance. I have had the honour of being for a period of years alternate governor for Ireland of these institutions, the Minister for Finance being the governor for Ireland.  Mr. McNamara's speeches at the annual meetings have focused on the plight of the poorest nations.  In one of his latest speeches, the one he delivered in Manila last year, he summarised this plight in frightening terms. I quote from his speech:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="871" /> Compared to those fortunate enough to live in the developed countries, individuals in the poorest nations have:</P>
    <P>&mdash;Remember, these are the 1,200 million people I referred to&mdash;</P>
    <P>an infant mortality rate eight times higher; a life expectancy one-third lower; an adult literacy rate 60 per cent less; a nutritional level, for one out of every two in the population, below minimum acceptable standards; and for millions of infants, less protein than is sufficient to permit optimum development of the brain.</P>
    <P>This, to me, is one of the most startling and appalling things of all.  In other words, what is being said is that children are mentally retarded or stunted permanently without hope of recovery simply because of a deficiency of protein in their early years.  To resume Mr. McNamara's speech:</P>
    <P>This is what absolute poverty means for some 750 million human beings in these nations.  With an average per capita income of less than $100 today, and little more than a faint promise of a miniscule $2 annual increase over the next decade, they are locked into a set of circumstances that they cannot break out of by themselves.</P>
    <P>It is not a scene that any one of us here, so favoured, so fortunate, so surrounded in our personal lives by privilege and advantage can contemplate without compassion and resolve.</P>
    <P>Mr. McNamara has said with frightful clarity that it is beyond the power of any set of statistics to illustrate the human degradation involved.  The picture I have just given persists in spite of the great increase in aid, both on commercial terms through the World Bank and on concessionary terms through the IDA, over the last 15 years.  It persists mainly because other forms of official development assistance have tended to slacken off or decline.  It is now a good many years since a target of 1 per cent of GNP was proposed as a reasonable indeed, moderate measure of the resources which the richer countries <Col N="872" /> should be passing, through official and private channels, to the poorer countries to help them develop.</P>
    <P>Further precision was given more recently to the official aid content in this 1 per cent.  The United Nations in 1970 and the EEC in 1974 prescribed 0.7 per cent of GNP as the minimum target to be reached by each economically advanced country&mdash;and we are in that category&mdash;by the mid-seventies. Unfortunately, these developed countries have in general come only about half-way towards this prescribed minimum.  Mr. McNamara has described their performance as &ldquo;disgracefully inadequate&rdquo;.  In our own case, as the research paper published last week by Trócaire and the Irish Commission for Justice and Peace points out, we have gone less than one-quarter of the way towards that 0.7 per cent minimum target.  We are only about the 0.14 per cent stage. Any indication, such as this Bill provides, of our willingness to do better is to be warmly welcomed.</P>
    <P>Without being captious I was sorry to see one particular word in the Parliamentary Secretary's opening statement.  It was the word &ldquo;unfair&rdquo; in reference to what I think he meant was a disproportionate suggestion for increase in our concessionary aid through IDA.  From my point of view I should like to avoid any suggestion of unfairness in reference to the contribution we should be making to the Third World.  Having said that, I do want to say that great credit is due to the former Minister for Foreign Affairs and to his Finance colleague for the quite remarkable advance in our official development assistance from less than £1 million in 1972-73 to £7.3 million for the current year. I do not intend to go into past history and criticise anybody for not doing better in the past because I am sure the present Minister for Foreign Affairs and his Finance colleague will carry forward this trend so that within a reasonable period of years Ireland will at least catch up with&mdash;and I would love to see it give a lead to&mdash;its fellow countries in the better-off category in terms of percentage commitment of GNP to official development assistance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="873" /> In this context I would urge on the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Parliamentary Secretary the desirability of early decisions on the structures for an effective and expanded programme of Irish co-operation in the development of the poorer countries. As you may know, I, as the Chairman of the Agency for Personal Service Overseas, had the privilege of presiding at a meeting in the spring of 1975, attended by a wide range of organisations, not just voluntary organisations in this field, but organisations representing trade unions, industry and farmers and I am glad to say we reached a consensus in recommending what these structures should be in relation to the expansion and better direction of our programme of development co-operation.  These are on the table of the new Minister.  I understand that he hopes soon to be able to announce his decisions.  I very much hope he will at least accept the desirability of the early setting up of a National Development Co-operation Council because it would serve two urgent needs, not only that of bringing the advice of voluntary agencies and other interested bodies to bear on the formulation of Government policy about overseas development assistance but also, as a second important function, of bringing back to representative bodies and to a wider national public a more lively education about the need for a greater effort in development co-operation.  This educational process would, I hope, increase public support not only for greater overseas development assistance but also for greater development co-operation in the wider sense which includes very awkward things like agreeing to admit the products of less developed countries more freely.  In so far as this educational process worked, it would make it easier for the Government to increase their commitment; indeed, it would also put some valuable pressure on the Government to increase their commitment.</P>
    <P>This commitment takes various forms.  As Senators know, there is a distinction between multilateral and bilateral aid.  Multilateral aid, which is the biggest element in our official development assistance&mdash;it represents 80 <Col N="874" /> per cent of the £7.3 million&mdash;includes what we are talking about today, the contribution to IDA.  It includes also our contribution to the World Bank, to the World Food Programme, to the EEC Development Fund and so on. Bilateral aid covers personal service overseas, with which I am particularly concerned, and it also covers the development projects which, to an increasing extent, the Department of Foreign Affairs is mounting in a selected number of less developed countries.</P>
    <P>Having mentioned personal service overseas, I should like first of all, to say that it seems&mdash;and I am answering Senator FitzGerald in part here&mdash;to be a form of aid singularly free of any corruption or any possibility of corruption because it is given directly. The aim behind all the voluntary service and expert service which APSO assists is not only to pass on aid now through the persons sent abroad, whether they be volunteers, experts in agricultural science, irrigation or genetics, but also to build up in the countries concerned native skills in these particular occupations.  In the past bilateral aid was usually looked upon with some misgivings because of the possibility that it was commercially oriented or in some way tainted with a form of neo-colonialism.  One can say without any hesitation that no such stigma attaches to our aid.  It is no way questionable.  In fact, one could even think of it as being more altruistic, perhaps less commercially orientated, than some of the end-products of multilateral aid.</P>
    <P>While I am talking about commercially oriented as against altruistic aid, I express the hope that in Ireland, while we may pursue our legitimate entitlement to a proper share for our own nationals whether they be individuals, companies, professional firms or State bodies, in the final spending of multilateral funds, we will always give primacy to the altruistic aspect of our concern for the Third World?  We should remember that we are not the losers for being generous.  In this matter of development co-operation, there are not two sharply divided categories of givers and receivers.  We are all engaged in what has been rightly called <Col N="875" /> by a very distinguished Frenchman in the voluntary service field, the Abbé Pierre, un development humain reciproque, a mutual human development, from which both sides gain significantly. Moreover, I firmly believe that helpful concern and compassion for the peoples of the Third World would do much to put our own problems in perspective without in any way diminishing our capacity or determination to remedy them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome this Bill as a positive contribution to Ireland's official development assistance. Regrettably, Ireland's record at the official level in providing aid to developing countries does not match in any way the voluntary contribution it has made.  I should like to pay tribute to Senator Whitaker, as someone involved in co-ordinating that voluntary commitment and who speaks with great authority on the subject.</P>
      <P>He mentioned some valuable research which has been done into Irish Government aid to the Third World, specifically the review and assessment carried out by Mary Sutton and published by Trócaire and the Irish Commission for Justice and Peace.  Copies of this research are being sent to Members of this House and it is certainly well worth reading, but it is chilling and rather depressing reading.  Although the research is balanced and thorough, the tone of the assessment is very critical.  It is critical of the Irish Government down through the years.  The Irish Government act on behalf of the Irish people, so we have nothing to congratulate ourselves on as far as the official picture of Irish aid to developing countries is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Whitaker made reference to the United Nations target of official development assistance from the more developed countries of the world, and Ireland is in that category.  This target was first proposed by the World Council of Churches in 1958.  It was adopted by the United Nations in 1970 and by the EEC in 1974, and it lays down that each economically advanced country will progressively increase its official development assistance to the <Col N="876" /> developing countries and will exert its best efforts to reach a minimum net amount of .7 per cent of its gross national product at market prices by the middle of the decade.  The decade referred to is 1970-80&mdash;the target was by the mid-seventies&mdash;so, in essence, we are past that point.</P>
    <P>As I say, the record is a dismal one and neither Fianna Fáil nor the Coalition Government can congratulate themselves.  The record of Fianna Fáil down the years does appear to have been substantially worse than the record of the Coalition Government in their relatively short span in power. This may be to some extent because the term of the Coalition Government coincided with our membership of the EEC.  Undoubtedly, from 1973 on, the commitment to set a target for official development assistance was a much more precise one.  In 1974 a very clear target was fixed by the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Garret FitzGerald, when he provided that the Government was comitted</P>
    <P>... to aiming at an annual increase in ODA of the order of .35 per cent of GNP, taking one year with another over the next five years.</P>
    <P>This fixing of a definite target was a milestone in the history of our official aid to the developing world.  It meant that those who were involved in providing and promoting the aid were dealing with a definite target, a definite official commitment.  However, this .35 per cent target does not appear to have been maintained and that is regrettable.  It was a very substantial achievement to fix the official target and it is regrettable that it does not appear to be maintained.</P>
    <P>One of the weaknesses was that the amount of official development assistance which was intended to be paid each year was not fixed either as a percentage of GNP or in money terms. Statements at the time from Deputy FitzGerald, from Opposition spokesman Deputy O'Kennedy, and from other interested persons and groups, showed that at least from May, 1974, until the autumn of 1975 the target statement was taken by all concerned to mean that by 1979 official development assistance would be up to the <Col N="877" /> target of .35 per cent of GNP, that is half the UN target.  By 1979 it was expected that we would have reached half the UN target which had been established in 1970 and accepted by the EEC in 1974.  However, after July, 1975, and since that date, there appears to have been a certain revision downwards in our target and we now appear to be aiming at .25 per cent of GNP.</P>
    <P>One very important point is that as yet the Fianna Fáil Government have not made an explicit commitment as to the present target for official development assistance.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to state clearly what that target is, to make it as explicit as possible so that we can know what is being aimed at.  In his speech introducing this Bill he appeared to be very vague on this point.  He mentioned that:</P>
    <P>The fact that Irish contributions to IDA take up well over 10 per cent of our total annual spending on official development assistance speaks for itself and the proposed contribution of almost £6 million enables us to demonstrate our continued support of the association.</P>
    <P>That is the only explicit reference I can find to this being a certain proportion of official development assistance. I should like to be much clearer on what the target is, what will be realised each year, and what the percentage will be in 1979.  I would welcome a specific commitment on this.</P>
    <P>I am aware that since the change of Government the Minister for Foreign Affairs has spoken on the subject.  In November, 1977, he said that there would be a difficulty just to catch up with the target of .5 per cent annually. I should like to know whether this means that he intends to overcome that difficulty and achieve the target, or whether he has decided to set the target at a lower level.  The research review analyses fully the position both of the Coalition Government, of Fianna Fáil prior to that, and subsequently, and this very close monitoring of the political position makes depressing reading.  Many people here, emphasising the voluntary commitment to helping developing countries, believe that we play our full part in aiding developing <Col N="878" /> countries, and in taking what Senator Whitaker rightly calls &ldquo;sometimes very uncomfortable and tough decisions&rdquo;, not just of giving financial or other type of aid but also of allowing these developing countries to build up their own industrial base, giving them access to our markets and, therefore, necessitating very tough decisions because of the possibility of endangering Irish jobs.  This is all the more difficult because of the unacceptably high rate of unemployment here.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, it is the desire of the people that the Government play their full part in the official development assistance, but that, unfortunately, we are not doing.  In a sense we seem to have forgotten our own roots as a people.</P>
    <P>We have relatively recent experience of being a small, underdeveloped, exploited country that had to struggle to achieve independence.  We have very recent recall as a nation of a famine that blighted the whole country; we know deeply what poverty, starvation and deprivation can do to a people.  It is not just a question of providing further encouragement of voluntary commitment and voluntary resources&mdash;welcome and important as these may be&mdash;it is also a question of ensuring that we maintain at least the target set in 1974 and that we then think in terms of the target in the years after 1979.  There are two parts to the specific point I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to comment on: what is the official development assistance target up to 1979?  Is it the target set in 1974?  Secondly, from 1979 for the next few years, what is the time scale to achieve the minimum of .7 per cent of GNP which was set by the United Nations?</P>
    <P>I should like now to turn to the actual contribution which the Bill will make towards our official development assistance.  If one looks at this measure in the context of our membership of the World Bank it is not really as generous as it may seem, to note that we are contributing over £5 million, because Ireland joined the World Bank in a very self-interested way, to avail of the substantial loans which would be available.  I should like to refer to <Col N="879" /> the analysis of this in the review, &ldquo;Irish Government Aid to the Third World&rdquo;, already referred to, which states:</P>
    <P>Ireland has been a member of the World Bank since 1957.  By joining the Bank the Irish Government hoped to obtain both expert advice on the development of the Irish economy and financial assistance to supplement the domestic funds available for productive capital investment. Ireland has secured eight World Bank loans, the first in 1969 and the latest in 1975, the total funds approved over this period amounting to $152 million.  These loans have been obtained at interest rates slightly lower than those prevailing on world capital markets. Ireland would not have been able to borrow the large sums involved without having made the capital subscriptions demanded of members. Nevertheless, the entire capital subscription is described as Official Development Assistance.  To date Ireland's capital subscriptions have amounted to £3.5 million approximately.</P>
    <P>The report states that it is useful to consider the International Development Association, which is an affiliate of the World Bank, and then goes on to assess Ireland's membership.  The report states:</P>
    <P>The IDA is an affiliate of the World Bank.  It was established in 1960 to provide financial assistance on easier terms and for a wider range of projects than the World Bank.  Only developing countries are eligible for IDA Loans which are usually free of interest, enjoy a 10-year grace period before repayments begin, and have a much longer than usual repayment period, usually 50 years.  The IDA depends for its resources on subscriptions from member governments all of whom are members of the World Bank. Ireland has been a member of the IDA since its establishment in 1960. In 1973 it became a &lsquo;Part I&rsquo; member, thereby committing itself to taking part in all future replenishments of the Association's funds. The fifth replenishment is at present <Col N="880" /> being negotiated.  It, like the previous replenishments will cover a three-year period, in this case July 1st, 1977, to June 30th, 1980, with Ireland's contribution likely to be around £5.8 million.</P>
    <P>Indeed if one recalls the analysis of the actual way in which the payment is structured, contained in the Parliamentary Secretary's introductory speech, we will see that it is not even a commitment over three years.  It is, as the Parliamentary Secretary said, a commitment over a period of six to nine years.  As the Parliamentary Secretary said, it is a question of non-negotiable, non-interest bearing demand notes deposited with the IDA and, in effect, we will pay the £5.8 million over a period of six to nine years.</P>
    <P>If one further considers that it is because of our membership of the World Bank that we are members of the International Development Association, the figure of our contribution is a comparatively modest one in contrast with the very significant benefit we ourselves have received from the World Bank.  The point I am trying to make by emphasising this is that whereas in a western-European or Anglo-American context Ireland is still a developing country with substantial problems of regional development, high unemployment, acute problems of a young population&mdash;and none of us wants to see this population forced to emigrate from the country to look for jobs and a future&mdash;if we look at Ireland in world terms and think of the development of countries in the world we are in a privileged and advanced position in comparison with a very significant number of other highly populated countries.</P>
    <P>Because of our own historical development, our identification with developing countries and our knowledge of poverty and deprivation we should ensure that at official level we keep pace with the target set at an international level.  Furthermore, we should actively encourage the kind of voluntary contribution which Senator Whitaker spoke about.  However difficult it may be in the internal political context, we should ensure that the Irish target for official development <Col N="881" /> assistance fixed up to 1979, and from 1979 for the next few years, reaches the minimum target set by the United Nations in the shortest possible time. At the very least the Parliamentary Secretary should give a clear and specific indication of Government thinking on this question of the target. He should indicate in quantitative terms what this would involve for the country.  I deliberately did not emphasise unduly the very dismal record in recent years of official Fianna Fáil contributions, while in Government, to developing countries.  It is important that the largest political party here have a clear commitment, implemented when in Government, to allocate a sufficient amount of official aid to meet the United Nations' target.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator was speaking about the Fianna Fáil contributions. I hope to leave mention of the various political parties out of this debate.  It is a major world problem and it is a matter for the nation as such.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is abundant and shocking evidence that an increasing number of human beings suffer from hunger and malnutrition.  Estimates from the World Bank at the moment suggest that possibly as much as one billion people do not receive sufficient food and most of these live in poor or developing countries.  Malnutrition causes millions of premature deaths every year.  It is a major contributing factor to disease.  In some developing countries up to 40 per cent of children die before they reach the age of five years.  That is a shocking statistic. Most of these die from nutrition-related <Col N="882" /> diseases.  A substantial proportion of the children who survive suffer severe handicaps of learning and behaviour and work capacity because of their inadequate diet.</P>
    <P>Hunger and malnutrition have plagued the world throughout history. With the rapidly increasing growth in world population the magnitude of the problem is escalating in that the absolute number of undernourished people is increasing daily.  I appreciate that the overall percentage has decreased somewhat.  The severity of malnutrition varies among countries.  In the poorer countries, with GNP per capita up to £100 per annum, which includes almost 1½ billion people, in 36 extremely poor countries across Asia and the middle of Africa, an estimated one-third to one-half of the people are malnourished.  These low-income countries provide the least amount of food per person and are also in the terrible position of having limited capabilities for increasing food production per person or for financing food imports in their own right.</P>
    <P>Nutrition is fundamental to life.  The United States Report on World Food and Production came to the interesting and startling conclusion that in developing countries effective nutrition interventions are likely to have more of an effect on human health than comparable investments in medical care. In other words, if we have money to spend then for God's sake spend it on nutrition.  In that context it is even more important&mdash;if one can make that terrible decision&mdash;than spending it for medicinal purposes.  The most important requirement for the Third World today is to alleviate malnutrition.  That rather authoritative report backs up that point strongly.  The only way this can be done is to double the food production in the Third World by the end of this century.  Ultimately, that must be the major target in tackling the huge world catastrophe of today.  This goal is attainable given the political will of the developing and higher-income countries.</P>
    <P>The problem of alleviating hunger and malnutrition, as we all know, is an extremely complex one.  The success of it will depend on how effectively we <Col N="883" /> undertake such major tasks as increasing the supply of the right kind of food, improving the stability of food supplies and decreasing the rate of poplation growth.  International organisations, such as the World Bank and the institution we are speaking of under this Bill, have a vital role to play in helping the poorer countries to help themselves and to help them to attain the necessary doubling of their own food supplies by the end of this century. In 1975 and 1976 the IDA's lending was designed to benefit an estimated 18 to 19 million of the world's rural poor with the aim of doubling their income and increasing food production substantially.</P>
    <P>The present Bill relates to the raising of the limit of the Irish contribution to £5.8 million, as part of the fourth replenishment to the IDA.  I recognise the important contribution which the IDA have made to helping developing countries feed themselves and because of that this Bill is most welcome.  It provides concrete evidence of our commitment to aid developing countries.  It also slots in as a major part of our contribution under Ireland's own development assistance programme.  In 1973 the Irish Government formally undertook to increase assistance to developing countries.  The Government committed themselves to increasing aid each year both in absolute terms and as a share of GNP.  The result of this policy is that Irish assistance has increased eight-fold from the figure of £937,000 in 1972 to a budgeted figure of more than £7.3 million in 1977.  It is estimated at almost .15 per cent of GNP.  The fact that it has increased eight-fold since 1972 is some progress.</P>
    <P>Within this increasing allocation the Government established in 1974&mdash;and I give them credit for this&mdash;a bilateral aid programme which pays attention to sectors here which have a special interest or competence.  Thus the programme is concentrated on education and training.  One of the National Science Council's functions is to advise the Government on matters relating to science and technology.  They act in an advisory capacity to the Government in the scientific and research type activities of the Irish aid programme. <Col N="884" /> The National Board for Science and Technology when established must get increasingly involved in this problem and be of increasing assistance to the Government in this whole area of underdeveloped countries.</P>
    <P>In addition to the formal programme of aid to the developing countries a great deal more activity is taking place in Ireland which is directly or indirectly related to the needs of developing countries.  Because of our relatively recent development&mdash;Senator Robinson made this point&mdash;and the intermediate position which the country still occupies on the development spectrum, it will be seen that the level of activities in Ireland, and our experiences in developing ourselves, are more relevant to developing countries than to those of the more industrialised countries.</P>
    <P>There is therefore plenty of opportunity and scope for co-operation and assistance to the poorer countries.  To this effect I know some important initiatives have already been taken by all governments.  Irish public enterprises have recently organised themselves into a co-operative consortium called DEVCo and, because of the importance of the public enterprises in the Irish research and scientific set-up overall, these public enterprises can play a major role in Ireland's undertaking to the Third World.  They are ideally situated to provide the scientific and technological background to aid the Third World.</P>
    <P>Another development is the recent organisation of a higher education consultation group, which is identifying possible areas of technical co-operation within this whole area.  The third level institutions here are, as they should be, the reservoir for much of our scientific and technological expertise.  They have an obvious important role to play in the whole area of education and training activities.  However, they can do a lot more than they are doing at present. Trinity College, for example, has commenced a master's degree programme in systems development.  The purpose of this is to give students from developing countries a good grounding in systems analysis techniques and how they might use these techniques in administration, commerce and industry. <Col N="885" /> A feature of this programme is the time which students will spend working in relevant Irish organisations and thus gaining practical experience of solving problems which face them in their own country.  Again, perhaps Trinity College could do a little bit more in this regard.</P>
    <P>A centre for development studies has recently been set up in University College, Dublin, in which attention is being paid to the models of development being adopted by national and international agencies.  Overall, apart from the Government drive, our higher education bodies and our universities in general should take a closer look at their involvement in this whole area.</P>
    <P>I should like to take the opportunity of putting a proposal to the Parliamentary Secretary which might be considered at another time.  It is very important to understand that in this tragic and human problem which I feel is the major problem facing the world, as many of us as possible outside the bounds of parties should try to come to grips with the real solution. It is very simple to say that we will sign a cheque, that that will bring up our percentage from point something to point something else, and then say we can wash our hands and finish with the Third World.  I do not see it that simply.  Each of us has to decide the more practical and more definite steps we can take.  In this regard I have identified the major problem as one of education and training requirements.</P>
    <P>I should like to recommend to the Parliamentary Secretary that a training institute&mdash;be it a State training institute, or a semi-State institute&mdash;be set up here specifically designed to meet the requirements of developing countries. Developing training centres exist in many other countries and the establishment of an equivalent institute here would have many advantages not only in helping the Third World but also for the image of Ireland as being a caring island which cares for the problems of the world.  Despite the undoubted demand for training and education, the actual number of students in Ireland from developing countries is still disgracefully small.  The lack of <Col N="886" /> a formal mechanism for getting the students to Ireland, coupled with a lot of administration difficulties, is a major impediment which can be overcome if the suggestion I put to the Parliamentary Secretary is implemented.</P>
    <P>The institution I suggest should be specifically designed to meet the major training requirements of developing countries and that, in a nutshell, is the need for well-trained technicians.  It might, therefore, be envisaged as an AnCO type operation concentrating initially on agriculture, food technology and, certainly, on marine science.  These are the three areas where the developing countries require skilled technicians, and Ireland has the capabilities and experience to provide the relevant training.  What we need now is the political will to do that.</P>
    <P>The question of funding such an institution would obviously be a problem and I see no reason why the World Bank or, indeed, the International Development Association, coupled with, perhaps, an increase in our own programme, would not solve that difficulty over a period.  While the objective of the proposed institution is clearly to assist developing countries, it would also, from a selfish point of view, have some long-term return for Ireland.  I reiterate that that should not be our main concern.  It has been shown that very often when students are trained in a country like Ireland in a certain expertise, that expertise comes back to benefit the country itself.  For example, if students in the establishment suggested were trained on farm machinery, tractors and Irish equipment, when they would return to their own country as fully trained technicians they would be inclined to buy that equipment from us as their own countries develop.  That should not be an important consideration, but nevertheless it is a consideration.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to say that we have had much emotion in regard to this problem.  Ultimately, when one looks long and hard at it, Ireland can do a lot for developing countries&mdash;perhaps not so much in monetary terms&mdash;whether or not we get up to the 1 per cent.  Of course that is important; but for our longer-term image, and in helping the Third <Col N="887" /> World, if we have the right type of institution, the right type of approach and can act as an arm-twister in the councils of the world, if we can say at the UN and other world bodies that Ireland has at the top of its list of priorities help for these people of the Third World, then we can do more for the Third World than by simply signing a blank cheque.</P>

      <P>I have no wish to be either lengthy or contentious on this Bill.  I cannot help observing that Senator Brennan's concern for rapid population growth and the need to slow down that population growth as a solution to the Third World problems, stands in somewhat amusing contrast with the lack of initiative of his own party in regard to any kind of family planning development here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I could be much more contentious.  I welcome Senator Whitaker's contribution because he drew attention to the fact that it is necessary to educate our own public opinion at home on the urgency of doing what we can for the underdeveloped countries.  For historical reasons our people, up to about the last two decades, when they thought of the necessities of the outside world tended to think in terms of the spiritual needs of black babies.  It is only really with the television age, and the age of the media, that the incredible poverty and subhuman existence of nearly a quarter of the world is being brought home to them. We have our poverty at home, which is all too apparent to anyone who walks through the city, but that should not exempt us from our obligation to alleviate the larger and more terrible poverty which prevails throughout much of the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to keep my contribution broadly philosophical and say that we must convince people that there are a number of reasons why this problem <Col N="888" /> is an immediate one even for a small country like ours.  There is the absolute elementary feeling of human compassion, of altruism, of humanitarianism. There is enlightened self-interest which can be explained at several levels.  Senator Whitaker pointed out again it is a question of mutual development, of commercially being dependent on one another ultimately in world trade.  There is another aspect of this enlightened self-interest and that is the fear that, if the poverty of the Third World continues to accelerate and the wealth gap continues to be more stark, in the end we will be overtaken by a global Nemesis.  Now that is altogether apart from another aspect of enlightened self-interest, namely, that if we are sincere in our allegiance to western values, the values of western democracy, and if we want to preserve, if you like, the Third World from what we seem to regard as the horrors of communism, then clearly that is another reason why we should put our hands in our pockets.  I must say that, if I were a politically conscious member of one of these dreadfully poor nations, I should have no hesitation in choosing between the Marxist concept of freedom, which is freedom from want and freedom from unemployment, and the western concept of freedom which, alas, is a luxury afforded only to the very few.</P>
    <P>The debt of obligation is another aspect of our duty to the Third World. I mean&mdash;not for us, perhaps, but for some of our EEC partners&mdash;there is a sense in which they have to discharge an historical debt.  Senator FitzGerald yesterday raised the question as to whether the connection between Third World poverty and western wealth is a causal one: that is to say, does the wealth of the western world rest on a stratum of exploitation of the Third World?  My own feeling is to think that it does but, even if it did not there is the fact that the west has done well out of the world that it colonised and imperialised, to which it says it has brought civilisation and trade.  But these were frequently euphemisms for exploitation.  In our own case we have none of this murky imperial past and that is all the more reason why, Senator Robinson reminded us, we have much <Col N="889" /> more in common with these wretchedly deprived people than our wealthier European partners.  Because we were one of the first victims of western European imperialism we should have a special rapport with the poor developing countries, sharing with them a common history of colonial exploitation.</P>
    <P>Senator Whitaker stressed how important it was that aid such as this should be free of corruption.  It should also be free of any strings attached. Again we are strongly placed in this regard.  I would hope that there survives for us something of that high regard in which we were held when our foreign policy was much more independent than it now is.  Bodies like the episcopal commission have a perfect right to criticise the level of our contribution. Obviously we must give as much as we can.  Senator Robinson and others have spelled out the detail of that and there may be an argument for increasing this contribution.  But ultimately, and I agree here with Senator FitzGerald, it is the responsibility of the Government answerable to the Oireachtas and, for the moment at any rate, I am very happy to welcome this measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome this Bill.  The principle is an excellent one.  It is very evident that nobody here is going to disagree with it but is the method, I wonder, really the best method?  However acceptable the principle, I think the method of emphasis on aiding Third World countries, of aiding developing countries, by financial means must be very suspect. It is the method that has been tried now since the Second World War.  It has been tried for the last 20 to 30 years.  The simple fact is that Third World countries are falling further and further behind and so we should have great reservations about this financial basis for aid to the Third World.  One or two Senators have dealt with the matter, Senator Brennan particularly. The human factor is very much more important than simply giving financial aid which quite rightly, I think, allows the wealthy countries to pat themselves on the back, to talk about the percentage <Col N="890" /> of aid which they have given, with the occasional <i>mea culpa</i> that it is not any more.  It is a higher percentage but nonetheless basically saying: &ldquo;Look at all this money we are giving to the developing countries&rdquo;.  In actual fact from the point of view of Irish official aid, first of all, one must be a little dubious about the principle and, secondly, relatively we have made a very substantial financial contribution, one which has recently been much increased, when you recognise the fact that we are making a contribution out of relatively limited resources.  It is far easier for one of the wealthy industrialised nations to give a very small percentage of its financial resources to Third World countries on the basis, No. 1, that such wealthy nations have a relatively large amount of cream and, taking our proportion of it, it is much easier than for us with very little cream in our finances. Secondly, in actual fact a great deal of this money comes right back again to the enhancement of industrial countries in one form or another and, naturally, this will not happen with us to any significant extent.</P>
      <P>In the past we have done a great deal in relation to human aid which basically is infinitely more important. We have done a great deal already&mdash; our missionaries have been mentioned &mdash;in practical terms as teachers, whether missionaries or not, as nurses, as medical people.  We are, I think, now seeing a new era and this is where I would like to see the Government emphasis on encouraging such bodies as our semi-State concerns and private enterprise, but particularly our semi-State bodies, in such areas as electricity, by the provision of electrical engineers and advice on electrical plant.  Some of this has been done already but it could be further encouraged.  There could be communications experts on the running of airlines.  There could be all these in addition to what we have already been doing as regards teachers and medical and paramedical personnel.  This is where we can make a far greater contribution than by arguing about the point of a percentage of financing which we are giving or not giving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="891" /> It is an unfortunate fact that the gap is widening, that very few of the developing countries have managed to pull themselves up and come anywhere near the developed countries.  The exceptions, and perhaps those who have been referring to the socialists and the communists may be a little unhappy about this, are, on the one hand, those countries which have had the good fortune to discover vast natural resources, such as Kuwait, for example, and, on the other hand, those countries which have followed principles of private enterprise, which we certainly might well consider excessive, countries such as South Korea, which not so many years ago was a desperately poverty-stricken, extremely backward country, and which now is becoming very rapidly an extremely advanced country with a very rapidly rising standard of living.  Taiwan, under some form of military occupation, is another curious example of a country developing purely from the point of view of the economic development of the wealth of the people.  Singapore is a somewhat different example.  These examples are very few and I wonder does the pouring in of money really help anymore.  One sees this in all sorts of different circumstances.  We should look at this idea of financial assistance as the answer, and an answer which, when given, we can to some extent forget about.  We should query it very much.</P>
    <P>We have to suggest what in practice we can do instead.  Senator Brennan referred to education.  I do not altogether agree with his criticism of the third level institutions here.  Both Trinity and National have done a great deal in this respect.  I think what he is suggesting really is that they could do a great deal more.  If they are to do a great deal more they must get Government support.  The taxpayer is paying for this and I think our money could well go in this direction to a greater extent.</P>
    <P>I would like here, if I may, to pay a small tribute to the institution where I am employed as a professor.  One-third of our intake of medical students are from the developing countries. For example, we take a group of <Col N="892" /> students from one of the developing countries which is unable to have a medical school of its own, not simply because of lack of wealth, although this is a part of it, but also because the population is insufficient to provide an adequate basis for a medical school.  In this practical way we could do a great deal more for the developing countries.  The second point, which we should be very clear about since it is repeated so often by people whom one would hope would know better, is with regard to food production.  We have heard so often that population is outstripping food production.  In actual fact, since the Second World War, it has been the other way around.  Food production in relation to population is increasing and could well be increased a great deal more.  The problem is one of distribution.  We know that this country&mdash;perhaps again this is a practical way in which we could help&mdash;is capable of producing far more food than it already does.  The problem is to distribute this to areas where people are dying of hunger.  Surpluses are being regarded as a disaster in EEC countries and in the United States while, in other areas, unfortunate children are starving to death.  We should look at the hard realities of this overseas aid about which one hears a great deal.</P>
    <P>I support the Bill, but I am very dubious about the emphasis on finance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be brief.  My observation on this sort of measure is that it appeals to humanitarian dictates in that we should provide financial assistance to Third World countries, appeals to even moral obligations in that we should help those less well off and give so much from the Exchequer each month to help Third World countries.  It seems to me to fall to a certain extent on barren ground like all appeals for more education and a greater provision of State funds for the improvement of our educational system seems to fall on barren ground. There is a human problem in this as it pertains to us just as much as there is a very human and tragic problem pertaining to financial assistance to people in Third World countries.  What we <Col N="893" /> should be bending our minds to is not so much the principle since there is a very broad consensus in both Houses that aid should be given.  What we should be bending our minds to is why allow shortfalls in the target set and allow this to happen repeatedly.  This is what we should try to resolve. There must, first of all, be a political commitment on the part of the Government to fix a target and stick to that target.  Any government, of course, will always be prone to the temptation in times of recession to cut back expenditure across the board.</P>
      <P>One way in which a target can be made stick is by setting up some structure, or some body, which will be responsible for the administration of the funds voted by the Government. If that structure or body were to submit annual reports and publicise the work being done with the moneys voted, then the Government would find it difficult to cut back on the moneys voted.  What we should aim at is setting a target and making sure it sticks.  We should also acquaint the public more of what it means for these people in the Third World countries to receive funds from countries which are regarded by them as being better off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This country has not in the past century experienced the impoverished state that these countries have to live in from day to day.  They are merely existing.  They are not living as we live. It is only when we see catastrophes depicted on our television screens or read about them in the newspapers, catastrophes like the recent Indian disaster as a result of cyclones, that the full impact of the bare subsistence level at which those people live from day to day is brought home to us. Recently one of the Peace women from Northern Ireland&mdash;perhaps she was caught offguard&mdash;when interviewed about winning the Nobel Peace Prize and asked to what she would devote the money, immediately answered that, as far as she was concerned, the conflict in Northern Ireland was only a trivial conflict as compared with the troubles which afflicted countries in the Third World.  That was a realisation on her part.  I think it is a realisation on the part of anybody who goes abroad and sees the subsistence <Col N="894" /> level at which these people live.</P>
    <P>I would go along with the point that we should not regard financial assistance as the only form of assistance.  For centuries this country built up a very commendable reputation for the great voluntary work it did through its missionaries, its teachers and its nurses and, in more recent years, through organisations such as Gorta, Trócaire and so on. The Electricity Supply Board has in recent years done survey work and research work for many Third World countries.  Admittedly, they do this on a fee basis but I think the long-term results of what they are doing will be far more beneficial than an annual subvention. Our Industrial Development Authority could, perhaps, help as regards giving the benefit of their tremendous skills, expertise and knowledge gained from the development of industries here over the past 20 years.  Why is it&mdash;this is something I find difficult to accept&mdash;can we not see our way to giving the full amount asked for by the International Development Association?  The difference over a period of five or six years, and it takes that length of time for the money that we vote to be actually taken off, is I think £1½ million&mdash;that is the difference between what we are giving and what is being asked of us.  We should have met that target in full and, having met that target in full, the only thing that remains then for us is to set up a State structure which will ensure that that money is spent in the best possible way, spent correctly, and that there are regular and annual reports to the Oireachtas as regards its expenditure. We have all the arguments and all the statistics but I am sure the people of these impoverished nations do not want to have statistics flourished in their faces.  It is not percentages they want to hear about. It is food in their stomachs that concerns them.  When all is said and done, the political commitment must be there for a start, followed by the means to ensure the implementation of the commitment.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill.  I would have hoped that the Government would <Col N="895" /> meet the full target and that we could start off on a sound footing for the future to ensure that similar targets would be met in future.  I also look forward to other assistance continuing in the form in which it has already been given over the last century through our various voluntary bodies and I hope some of our own semi-State agencies will be encouraged, like the Electricity Supply Board, to go into this field.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LadyGoulding" hpid="Lady Goulding Lady Goulding">
      <NameTxt>Lady Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>Food is not enough. If we produced more food here and gave it to Indians or Malaysians they would still starve because they cannot stomach the food we eat.  Money is what we must give.  Our voluntary organisations are all excellent but I would ask that just one thing be borne in mind.  When the money leaves Ireland and goes to any of these countries, would it not be possible for someone from Ireland to go with the money and see that it goes where it should go?  I am not pointing my finger at any country or at any organisation, but I feel that the money should, up to 80 per cent, get to the point of disaster where it is needed.  It is not just food.  It is agricultural equipment, everything.  I may sound a bit emotional about this but I have been in the Far East and day after day I have walked down roads and seen dying children on the pavements, dying and odorous.  I have seen them and smelt them day after day.  Therefore, I urge that we send every penny we can but, for goodness sake, let us see that it gets to the right place, at the right time. I urge the same approach in regard to the right equipment and the right food.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been a very interesting debate.  It shows first of all, that we have a strong commitment to help the Third World.  It is a proud part of our historical tradition that we should welcome the fact that the de-debate has shown, from very many different points of view, that people really do care.  The question is how do we translate that caring into something concrete.  Our tradition is one of personal service and not of financial aid. It is a very proud tradition.  First, we have the missionaries who have provided <Col N="896" /> educational and medical services, a basis for these services for many Third World countries.  It is a very touching thing for anybody going abroad to meet Irish missionaries who have worked overseas all their lives and who have really made a tremendous contribution to a country's development, much more than just looking after black babies or something like that.  It is something of which we can be very proud.</P>
      <P>We also have another tradition which we sometimes overlook and that is the fact that we supplied very many of the leading administrators in the British colonies.  Whereas we sometimes tend to decry our links with imperialism, in fact I believe that the Irish administrators in the British colonial service were particularly good because they saw colonialism working in reverse in this country and, when they went abroad, they had a wider view of the way in which life should be administered.  Coming from the home country, they had seen the disadvantages of imperialism as well as some of its advantages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, those avenues of service are not now so popular for various reasons.  For one thing, the British Empire has disappeared.  Younger people do not all wish to go into Holy Orders to serve abroad and so we have a whole growth of voluntary organisations&mdash;Gorta, Trócaire, APSO have been mentioned by Senator Whitaker&mdash; and I think that our people are expressing their desire to serve abroad through these organisations.  The tradition remains.  It is just the avenues that have changed.  New avenues have been found.  They have also been mentioned. DEVCo is a particularly important one where the expertise of our semi-State bodies is now being used and found to be of benefit to the developing countries.  A number of semi-State bodies have been mentioned which have taken part in DEVCo.  I should like to mention the work done by an Foras Talúntais in its programme of research.  It has done a great deal of consultancy work for the developing countries.  One of the reasons that I opposed bringing an Foras Talúntais into the national agricultural advisory <Col N="897" /> service was that it seemed to me there was a danger that the tradition developed by the scientists in the agricultural institute could have been stymied by extra civil service control.  The fact that they went abroad and the fact that they got paid consultancy fees for working abroad would have been somewhat stifled if the body were brought entirely under civil service control.  I am glad to see that their autonomy will be preserved.  They have a tremendous contribution to make because, as has been pointed out, money is just not enough.  One wants to increase our financial aid to meet the target set but it is equally important that we should have some input into how the money is spent.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance is the person who, as a director of the World Bank&mdash;the Parliamentary Secretary can correct me&mdash;would actually put our input into the system and, therefore, would feed some of our ideas into how the money should be spent by the spending agency.  It is important that we do this because&mdash;I think Senator Conroy made the point that it is just not enough to give blank cheques&mdash;you have to have control over the way the money is spent.  In fact, it seems to me, that some of this money will be spent by the World Bank in sending Irish personnel out to set up a training scheme in the developing countries. That would seem to me a very useful exercise.</P>
    <P>Senator Brennan talked about the basic need being one of education and training.  I would agree with him there but I would disagree slightly when he says that we should continue to develop programmes in this country, bringing people from the Third World here, educating them and then sending them back.  Now the philosophy is changing somewhat.  In certain areas this will have to be done.  In Senator Conroy's own area, in a country where you have not got a medical school, you have got to have your doctors trained abroad.  The increasing advantages of having people trained on the spot is paramount.  Take a particular subject in my own area of mathematics. I have been involved with UNESCO in a scheme for the development <Col N="898" /> of mathematics in Africa.  The Africans are not receptive to the idea that a training centre in Trieste is the place where Third World people should be trained.  They want, and I think basically they are right, to have a centre established in an African country. Of course, as soon as you do that, all sorts of political problems arise. I was on a committee discussing this and the number of countries&mdash;even the Africans themselves admit this&mdash;that are politically stable enough to have such a centre in which one can hope for at least ten or 20 years of untrammelled development are very few. The number is now down to about two or three and it seems to me that the stability depended on the longevity of certain old men who were in the driving seats in these particular countries.  There are always difficult problems administering something on the site.  It is much easier for educators and so on to operate here in an environment which they know but I think what we should look to more and more is to have teams going from here abroad and actually, when we encourage our universities to set up training schemes, we should encourage them to set up training schemes with Government assistance and World Bank assistance in the country in which the schemes are going to be applied because it might be nice to use Irish agricultural equipment on the beet fields in east Cork in December but you will not find those conditions in the Sahara or in any other part of the developing world.</P>
    <P>We want to change our philosophy there, but I would like to see more control over the way in which this money is spent and that is up to the Minister for Finance.  The philosophy behind today's debate is that there are many problems but at least we are beginning to see the problems of the Third World.  We are beginning to appreciate these problems and Senator Whitaker made this point forcibly, by looking outside, and by appreciating the fact that other people are in situations which are not comparable with ours, that they have problems of a magnitude which ours will never line up with, this helps us psychologically <Col N="899" /> to get our position into perspective and to develop our own national life.  I am sure all the efforts that we put in, particularly through our personnel going abroad, our training schemes and educational programmes for developing countries have a tremendous feedback and a tremendously beneficial effect on life and industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ValentineJago" hpid="Mr. Jago Mr. Jago">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jago</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add some information to what has already been said.  There are four main organisations in this country that collect money for the Third World&mdash; Trócaire, the Bishops' Appeal Fund, Gorta and Concern.  It is only with one of those that I have any association and that is, Concern.  Concern was formed way back in the time of the troubles in Biafra; at that time it was called African Concern.  When the Biafran troubles were over, because of the troubles in Bangladesh and elsewhere, they changed the name of the organisation to Concern.</P>
      <P>Over the years they have had teams of volunteers working in various parts of the world.  Those teams are financed from Ireland and by help from other countries.  During the last 12 months the amount of money available from private sources for Concern has been reducing.  I understand that at this moment the amount required from Ireland is about £1,000 per day to keep this organisation on its programme. Today it is a case of living from hand to mouth.</P>
      <P>In the next few weeks Concern will be putting on a fast.  The idea behind that is for Irish people to fast a certain amount over Christmas and give the money to the people in the Third World.  Part of the policy of Concern is to get people to help themselves. The teams who go out there are to a certain extent experts in engineering and other fields, helping people to build houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One point which I do not think Senator Whitaker brought out was that it is very difficult to help them. Due to the lack of protein and to their physical and mental condition, you cannot help them because they are not capable of being helped and they cannot help themselves.  This is a <Col N="900" /> problem which we have got to get over.  Concern at present tries to help them by giving them handicrafts to make which are then brought to Ireland and the Irish people are asked to buy them.  If some of our local people come to the Minister for Foreign Affairs I would ask him to treat them generously so that this work can continue.</P>

      <P>I want to make two short points.  After the Lomé Assembly meeting last week in Lesotho, I took the opportunity of going into the Republic of South Africa and looking at an area which attracts a lot of Press publicity.  Many of the points that have been raised this afternoon are valid.  I compliment the Parliamentary Secretary not only on the inter-governmental aid but on the support he is giving to the non-governmental agencies. Our bilateral programming in Lesotho is one that every citizen and taxpayer can be proud of.</P>
      <P>I had the opportunity of speaking with Mr. O'Hara, who is seconded from the ESB and who is managing director of the Electrical Corporation there, and with Mr. McCarthy on the distance teaching.  The work they are doing there is of tremendous importance.  As has been said, they do not disburse any moneys but they are giving people tremendous technical know-how.  Our teaching organisations could play a tremendous role by making available to some of the African schools wall charts and various aids which are not obviously available in a number of the schools I visited.  I would also like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary if he would increase this year the amount of aid that has been made available to the non-governmental agencies which includes the missions.  Our Christian missions are doing tremendous work in seven or eight African countries which I had the opportunity of visiting over the last few years.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate: Law Reform Commission Reports.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinison Mrs. Robinison">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinison</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise on the Adjournment the requirement for laying the annual reports of the <Col N="902" /> Law Reform Commission before both Houses under section 6 of the Law Reform Commission Act, 1975.  To my knowledge, although the Law Reform Commission have been in operation since October, 1975, no such annual reports has been laid.</P>
      <P>Section 6 of the Act provides as follows:</P>
      <P>As soon as may be after the end of each year, the Commission shall make a report to the Attorney General of its activities during that year under Section 4 of this Act, of any preliminary working papers published by it during that year, of any examination during that year of the legal system of a country other than the State and of the activities during that year of any working party or advisory committee established by it.  The Attorney General shall, as soon as may be, send a copy of the report to the Taoiseach, who shall submit it to the Government and copies of the report shall, as soon as may be, be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>In my experience this is a particularly elaborate and detailed provision for the laying of annual reports before the two Houses, both as to its content and because of the fact that the Attorney General would forward it to the Taoiseach who would ensure that it was laid before both Houses.  The elaborate procedure reflects the emphasis which was placed on this section when the Bill was debated in the Seanad on 10th April, 1975.  In introducing the Bill the then Attorney General, Deputy Declan Costello, who was a Member of the other House, said at column 210 of the Official Report:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be observed that section 6 of the Bill will require the commission to furnish an annual report of its activities during the year.  The report will also contain references to other matters referred to in the section.  After submission to the Government, copies of the report will be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  This section, together with the preceding section which provides that a copy of the commission's <Col N="903" /> approved programme is to be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas, will facilitate discussion in the Oireachtas on law reform matters in general and the work of the commission in particular.  I feel sure that Members of this House will welcome the opportunity which will thus be afforded to contribute to the ongoing work of the commission.</P>
    <P>Subsequently, when section 6 was discussed on Committee Stage in this House I referred to the terms of the section and welcomed it.  I was followed by Senator Alexis FitzGerald whose contribution at column 264 was as follows:</P>
    <P>I would just like to say that it is because of the existence of this section and the preceding section that I welcomed this Bill as creating a structure which should ensure that we will get law reform and that it is meaningful.  It is very important that the provisions of this section seem to me to go very far and they will have to give a full account of themselves.</P>
    <P>Members of the Seanad had welcomed the fact that there would be an annual, detailed and meaningful report from the Law Reform Commission about their activities, about how they were performing in relation to their programme, about the working parties they might have established, about the extent at which they had examined the law in other countries.  The Attorney General emphasised the importance of this and it was stressed by us on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Regrettably, however, the clear legislative intent does not seem to have been carried out.  The Bill was passed in April, 1975 and the commission were established and came into full working order in October, 1975, so that they have been more than two full years in working existence, but no annual report has been tabled.  Consequently the Members of this House and the other House have not been able to fulfil that constructive role of examining the progress of the Law Reform Commission, of helping perhaps to reassess priorities and of contributing to the debate on law reform.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="904" /> I would like to make it clear from the beginning that my primary purpose in raising this matter is not to be critical of the Law Reform Commission, but rather to be supportive of the purposes of the Law Reform Commission. I warmly welcomed the Bill to establish it.  In my view the necessity to concentrate on law reform is a real priority and it is because of this basic belief I want to insist that the annual reports are laid and do stimulate the type of debate which was intended and promote a constructive appraisal of law reform.  The extensive scope of the first programme of the Law Reform Commission, which was submitted to the Government in December 1976 and laid by the Taoiseach before both Houses on 4th January, 1977 as provided in section 5 (2) of the Act makes this all the more important.</P>
    <P>This programme is very broad and ranges over extremely important areas of law.  It is important that both Houses monitor the progress on it of the Law Reform Commission.  For example, it would be very interesting to Members of both Houses to know at what stage the commission are in their work. They have only published one occasional paper so far&mdash;working paper No. 1 of 1977 on &ldquo;The Law Relating to the Liability of Builders, Vendors and Lessors for the Quality and Fitness of Premises&rdquo;.  That is an extremely important report which has very substantial implications.  I would like to see the substance of that report debated in this House and, personally, I would like to see its recommendations implemented.  Obviously I cannot go into detail on it now, on the Adjournment, but it is a very worthwhile report.</P>
    <P>However, it is only one item in a very substantial programme of law reform. I would like to be able to ask to what extent the Law Reform Commission have contracted out work and research to other bodies as they are entitled to do under the terms of the Act.  To what extent have they sought help from academics in the law schools or from other disciplines in the universities. To what extent have they made use of other research facilities in the country?  It seems to me that if <Col N="905" /> the Law Reform Commission were not to produce substantial reports in the areas included in this programme, there is a danger that no law reform will take place in these areas.  In that way the existence of the Law Reform Commission could delay the possibility of reform because it would be an excuse not to make progress in reforming the particular areas.</P>
    <P>I was very disappointed to find that the term of appointment of one of the five commissioners had expired on 20th October, 1977 and was not renewed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>It is in the context of the absence of the laying of any annual report that I am refraining from going into the substance of the working paper that was published.  So I am making real efforts to be good and I am not going to delay the House much further on the point.  If an annual report had been laid we would have had an opportunity to comment on the fact that the mandate of one of the commissioners, Mrs. Helen Burke, was not renewed and that she was replaced by somebody from a very different background&mdash;a civil servant with legal training.  The significance of this does not stem from the personalities involved, but from the fact that during the debate in the Seanad emphasis was stressed on the importance of including a non-lawyer on the Law Reform Commission&mdash;someone from a related discipline.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that it is your job to keep me within the terms of reference, and I am not going to make it more difficult.  Nonetheless, the parliamentary intent was very clearly stated by the Attorney General in introducing the Bill in 1975 and by Senators in welcoming the terms of <Col N="906" /> the Bill.  Members of the House made it clear what they felt was important and that the annual report of the Law Reform Commission would give an opportunity to comment on progress on law reform, priorities in law reform and in particular the area of family law reform which is so critical in Ireland at the moment.  We are being deprived of this opportunity to contribute. Moreover, there is a danger that no other agency would be actively involved in law reform&mdash;be it the Department of Justice or another Department&mdash;so there is a potenial negative effect of establishing the Law Reform Commission unless they react very positively, get through their volume of work in a satisfactory way, and in particular discharge their responsibilities for that part of the programme which concerns family law reform.  I regret that the individual member of the Law Reform Commission who had a particular contribution to make in that area was not reappointed.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary, to indicate when the first annual report of the Law Reform Commission will be laid before the Houses under section 6?  Furthermore, would he ensure that in future years the annual report is laid within the calendar year so that the Houses are afforded an opportunity to examine progress and to make a constructive contribution to the work of the Law Reform Commission.</P>
      <P>I repeat that the motivation behind this motion on the Adjournment is more to be supportive of the vital work the Law Reform Commission are doing than to criticise in a negative sense. The Seanad cannot be supportive of law reform if we do not have the opportunity in both Houses of examining progress to date and commenting on it.</P>

      <P>I take the Senator's point. I accept the spirit in which she placed the motion before the Seanad.  If I may deal with one point.  She mentioned a member of the commission, Dr. Helen Burke.  As I understand it, Dr. Burke, who gave inestimable service and who is a very highly respected person in <Col N="907" /> her own professional vocation, was a member of the commission for the full period of her appointment, namely, two years.  The expiration of her period of appointment coincided with her appointment as a full-time statutory lecturer in University College, Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have the background to that aspect readily available I understand that she would not have been able to give more than half the time she devoted to the commission as a part-time commissioner. She would understand the realities of that, having regard to the fact that the Senator said an awful lot of work would have to go into law reform and that the people who are giving such devoted service to it will have to give as much time as they physically can.</P>
      <P>The Law Reform Commission were formally established on 20th October, 1975.  They had no office until April, 1976.  The first member of their professional staff joined the commission in July, 1976; the second member in October, 1976, and the third in January, 1977.  Effectively they only commenced operation in April, 1976 and then on the very limited scale available to them in the absence of professional staff and in a building which has not yet been completed. Section 6 of the Act provides that as soon as may be at the end of each year the commission shall make a report to the Attorney General (a) of their activities during that year under section 4 of the Act and (b) of any preliminary working paper which was published by them during the year, (c) of any examination during the year of the legal system of a country other than the State, and (d) of the activities during the year of any working party or advisory committee established by them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commission did not in either 1975 and 1976 establish any working parties or advisory committees.  They did not undertake the examination of <Col N="908" /> the legal system of any country other than the State, save in so far as, in the course of the work they did undertake, it was necessary to make certain inquiries from other States on particular points, the answers to many of which did not arrive until 1977.  No preliminary working papers were published by the commission during the years 1975 or 1976.</P>
    <P>In 1976 the commission spent some time in drawing up a programme for submission to the Government pursuant to section 4 (2) (a) of the Act.  The study and choice of subjects for inclusion in that programme was a matter which in itself took some time and finally the programme was submitted, on 1st December, 1976, to the Government for approval.  The programme, having been approved by the Government was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 4th January, 1977.</P>
    <P>The programme, as well as setting out the matter which the commission propose to deal with as part of their programme, also referred to matters which had been submitted to them by the Attorney General, pursuant to section 4 (2) (c) of the Act.  These latter matters are referred to at page 4 of the programme, the first two of which were submitted by the Attorney General to the commission on 23rd December, 1975, and the other two on 26th August, 1976.</P>
    <P>The first of these subjects&mdash;the law relating to the age of majority&mdash; required a great deal of research and study and the working paper on the same is now with the printers and will be published within the next week or so.  The second subject&mdash;the law relating to the domicile of married women&mdash;required a very considerable degree of research and a draft working paper on that subject has already been prepared but is currently being reviewed by the commission and should be published in the near future. It might be added that this particular subject is an extremely complex one and will affect not simply married women only but also must necessarily relate to the domicile of children and husbands and to the question of whether the concept of domicile as <Col N="909" /> such should be retained or should have some other concept substituted as a connecting factor in conflicts of laws.</P>
    <P>Items 3 and 4&mdash;the prohibited degrees of relationship in the law of marriage, and the application of foreign law in cases in which the courts of this country have jurisdiction to grant a decree of nullity of marriage &mdash;are to be taken together with the examination of the law of nullity which was referred to the commission by the Attorney General on 24th August, 1977.</P>
    <P>In regard to the subjects contained in their programme, the commission have already published a working paper on the law relating to the liability of builders, vendors and lessors for the quality and fitness of premises and this paper was completed for publication on 22nd June, 1977, and was published within a matter of two or three weeks afterwords. Each Member of the Oireachtas has already received a copy of this paper.  Also in pursuance of their programme, the commission have completed a working paper upon the civil liability for animals which is also with the printers at the moment and should be available for distribution early in January.</P>

      <Col N="910" /> Nineteen seventy-seven has effectively been the first full working year of the commission and the report for 1977 which will be published early in 1978 will deal not merely with the work which has been carried out in 1977 but will also give an account of the activities of the commission prior to that year.
