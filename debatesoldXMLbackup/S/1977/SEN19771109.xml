      <P>I have notice from Senator Mary Robinson that, on the motion for the adjournment of the House this evening, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The decision to refer the White Paper on Nullity to the Law Reform Commission.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter as suitable for discussion under Standing Order 25 and it will be taken from 8 p.m. to 8.30 p.m. or earlier if the business ordered is concluded.</P>

      <P>On the last occasion the Seanad met I raised the question of when the necessary motions were going to be tabled, including the expediency motion and the motion establishing the terms of reference, to set up the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities.  I emphasised the urgency of reconstituting this Committee and of getting it into a work routine.  More than five months have now elapsed since the previous Joint Committee met and examined draft European proposals.  On the occasion last week the Leader of the House undertook to look into the matter and to provide information for the House. I would ask him if he has any clear information about when the motion will be introduced.  Unless it is done very rapidly I cannot see the Joint Committee getting into working operation before Christmas, which would be <Col N="172" /> disgraceful.  I would welcome some clarification on the point.</P>

      <P>In regard to the EEC Committee, the Senator is aware that the outgoing Committee recommended certain changes in the terms of reference. These proposals are, I understand, being considered by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  The same applies in the case of the other one. The Minister for Finance, the Minister concerned, is looking at the terms of reference of the Committee on State-sponsored Bodies.  I echo the hope of the Senator that consideration of the terms of reference be concluded swiftly and that it be possible to set up these Committees soon.</P>

      <P>During the period of the last Seanad, when Deputy Lenihan was the Leader of the Opposition here he gave a commitment that if in Government they would speedily introduce a Bill to deal with the problems of family planning.  We all know that there are incredible anomalies in the law regarding family planning since the McGee case in the Supreme Court, and I should like to ask the Leader of the House if the Government have made any move to fulfil their commitment.  Can he give us any idea of the date when legislation will be prepared and introduced to fulfil the commitment given by Deputy Lenihan?</P>

    <Title>Garda Síochána Bill, 1977: Second Stage</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Col N="177" />
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary purpose of this Bill is to amend the Garda Síochána Acts so as to enable effect to be given to an agreement that was reached during the term of office of the previous Government regarding changes in the status and functions of the Garda representative bodies.  The agreement was concluded with the representative body for inspectors, station sergeants and sergeants and the representative body for guards following negotiations with the Department of Justice, Discussions have also taken place with the representative bodies for chief superintendents and superintendents and it is expected that agreement will soon be reached with them as well.</P>
      <P>The statutory provisions that require to be amended are contained in section 13 of the Garda Síochána Act, 1924.  This section provides for the establishment in accordance with ministerial regulations of representative bodies elected by the members of the various ranks to enable them to consider and bring to the notice of the Commissioner and of the Minister for Justice matters affecting their welfare and efficiency, other than questions of discipline and promotion affecting individuals.  The section prohibits the bodies from associating with any body or person outside the force.  Under the existing regulations the affairs of the bodies, including such matters as the conduct of elections and the dates, frequency and duration of meetings, are closely regulated by the Garda authorities.  All members may vote, or be nominated for office, irrespective of whether they are subscribers to representative body funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These arrangements are no longer acceptable to members of the force and, in the course of the negotiations that took place during the past year the bodies pressed strongly to have the various restrictions imposed on them by the 1924 Act abolished.  Initially they sought full trade union status, with the right to strike, which is prohibited by section 14 of the Act.  My predecessor made it clear to them, however, that he could not agree to concede trade union status or the right to strike, as he considered that concession <Col N="178" /> of these matters would be incompatible with the functions and responsibilities of members of the force. He did agree, however, that the existing controls should be relaxed so that the bodies will be able to reconstitute themselves into the equivalent of an independent staff association with freedom to draw up their own constitution, conduct their own elections and generally manage their own affairs.</P>
    <P>Some of the desired changes can be provided for in new regulations but it is necessary also to effect certain amendments in section 13 of the 1924 Act.  Firstly, an amendment is necessary to enable the new bodies to represent their members generally in all matters affecting their welfare and efficiency and not just to bring such matters to the notice of the Commissioner and the Minister for Justice. Secondly, the prohibition on the making of representations on behalf of individual members in matters of discipline and promotion needs to be repealed. Thirdly, the wording of the section needs to be amended so as to enable participation in the election of representative bodies to be confined to those who pay their subscriptions to body funds.  It has been agreed with the bodies however that in the first elections to take place under the new arrangements every member will be entitled to vote.</P>
    <P>The amended section will modify the present prohibition on representative bodies associating with bodies or persons outside the force.  The Minister for Justice will in future have power to authorise the bodies to associate with outside persons and associations subject to such conditions and restrictions as he may specify. Agreement has been reached with the bodies as to the kinds of outside organisations with whom they may expect to be allowed to associate.  It has been agreed, for example, that it would be appropriate to allow the bodies to liaise with international associations of police organisations whose function is to exchange information on matters of common interest. The bodies may also wish to employ outside consultants to assist and advise <Col N="179" /> them on the preparation of claims and other matters.</P>
    <P>Lastly, the term &ldquo;association&rdquo; is being substituted for &ldquo;representative body&rdquo; as the present bodies wish to get away from the old terminology to help to improve their status and image.</P>
    <P>The text of section 13 of the 1924 Act is being re-enacted in full with the various amendments incorporated in it.  The substantive amendments are confined to subsection (1) and subsection (5), which is a new subsection. Subsections (2) and (3) each show one minor textual amendment and subsection (4) is unchanged.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill proposes a change in the procedure governing Garda pensions orders.  What is proposed is the adoption of the procedure that has already been sanctioned by the Oireachtas in relation to pension schemes elsewhere in the public service including the Army.  At present before a Garda pensions order can come into operation it must be confirmed by resolution of both Houses.  The new procedure would enable the order to come into operation immediately it is made.  The order would, however, be laid before each House and could be annulled by resolution of either House within 21 sitting days.  I am sure the House will agree that the simpler procedure at present applying to other public service pensions orders should also apply to the Garda orders.</P>
    <P>As far as the main purpose of the Bill is concerned, namely, the introduction of changes in the status and role of the representative bodies, it is right that I should acknowledge the part played by my predecessor in bringing about the agreement which was negotiated on the subject with the bodies.  That agreement is one to which I and my colleagues in the Government have been happy to subscribe, as we believe that it correctly reflects the needs of the situation as is exists in the seventies as compared with half a century ago.  We all recognise, I think, that it is essential to the well-being of the community that we should have a contented, strong and efficient police force.  I have every hope that, by facilitating the functioning of good personnel relations within <Col N="180" /> the Garda Síochána, the new charter which is being written for the representative bodies will contribute to that objective.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Firstly, I should like to welcome the Minister on his first official visit to the Seanad in his new role as Minister for Justice.  I have already congratulated him privately on his appointment and I am glad to have the opportunity of doing so now publicly. I wish him well in what I know is a difficult office.  I will not wish him a term free from headaches because that would be to wish the impossible to any Minister but especially to a Minister for Justice.  I do however, wish that his headaches will be few and mild.</P>
      <P>I note, too, in a passing comment relevant to the Minister's assumption of his office, that he has suffered a fate that has befallen all of his predecessors. I am sure Deputy O'Malley will share the view with me that it was my hope that the Minister would come safe, but it is not to be.  I refer to the fact that the Minister, like those who went before him, has become &ldquo;the prisoner of the Department of Justice&rdquo;, that &ldquo;he is a malleable thing in the hands of those grim and Machiavellian men who head that Department&rdquo;.  I say this as a fact.  I know it to be a fact because &ldquo;I read it in the paper&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill deals with a very net point, the amending of the parent Act to provide for changes in the structure of the representative bodies.  I understand that, as a matter of procedure, our contributions on the Bill will have to be related to what is in it and to matters that would be very much tied to it. We are all aware that the subject of the Garda Síochána is attracting more than a little interest at the moment because of allegations that have been made and the whole controversy in that area.  A debate which deals with Garda Síochána and does not touch on that area will, I suppose, seem somewhat unreal to those outside.  It is not that there is any lack of concern I am certain on the part of Members of this House with regard to that matter.  I would have some things to say on it but it is as well to put it on record that the rules of procedure, and the Cathaoirleach <Col N="181" /> can guide me on this, would put anything said in that regard out of order and we must confine ourselves to the changes made in the 1924 Act, as set out in the amending Bill, and to matters that would be very closely relevant thereto into terms of personnel policy.  I would be glad for the guidance of the Cathaoirleach on that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

      <P>This Bill has a limited scope and we would be well advised to keep to the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Chair's ruling that I cannot speak on these matters.  I accept it with some disappointment and some fear that lack of reference to these matters in this House during this debate might be misinterpreted outside as lack of interest or care about them.  Rules of Order are there to be observed and I assure the Chair that I accept the ruling and will endeavour to abide by it both in the letter and in the spirit.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill because it puts statutory clothing on an agreement reached when I was Minister, as this Minister has generously acknowledged. I should like to pay tribute to all who were involved in those negotiations, the representative bodies for gardaí, sergeants and station sergeants and inspectors who, of course, are the main bodies involved on the Garda side.  Originally one of those bodies, the representative body of the gardaí, as far as I recall, made a suggestion that the time had come for us to permit a trade union in the Garda and that the right to strike should be looked at.  We debated that matter amicably and they agreed with me that such structures within a police force would not be appropriate.  They accepted that willingly.  In such acceptance they were, in fact, reflecting what I am satisfied is a widely held view in the force: the vast majority of members see striking or membership of a trade union in the traditional sense as being incompatible with their job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like, too, to pay tribute to the officers of the Department who conducted these negotiations on behalf <Col N="182" /> of the Government, to pay tribute to their patience and skill in reconciling what at times seemed to be immovable objects and irresistible forces. There is a myth in the media that there is a state of constant suspicion and hostility, if not downright war, between the Department of Justice and the representative bodies of the Garda Síochána.  I should like to put it on record that this is not so.  It seemed clear to me as an observer close to the scene and seeing both sides separately and informally very often, that this is definitely not so and that the relationship personally and corporately was friendly.</P>
    <P>It was evident to me that there was mutual trust and respect and trust by each side in the <i>bona fides</i> of the other and respect on each side for the negotiating prowess of the other.  It is important that that be put on the record so that there will be no misunderstanding about it.  Difficult negotitions were conducted skilfully and with patience and they were successful. We have to remember that this Bill represents agreed changes and that that agreement could not have come without the co-operation and assistance of the Commissioner and the headquarters staff of the Garda.</P>
    <P>It is important also to put on record that that co-operation was willingly forthcoming.  All the parties involved in these negotiations were motivated by one thing only: to devise a regime that would be broadly acceptable and generally good for the well-being and morale of the force.  The Bill does not reflect, because it does not have to, the full extent of the changes agreed. The Minister touched on the questions of discipline, transfers and promotion needs.  These are, obviously, very thorny matters in a large organisation but they are brought to particular difficulty when the organisation in question is one which is subject to formal discipline and the members of it have to serve right throughout the country in every corner.  It is an organisation which has an informal hierarchical structure and obviously questions of discipline, transfers and promotions are matters that could lead to difficulty and misunderstandings. <Col N="183" /> I was pleased that the changes which are being brought about will provide for structures in which many of these misunderstandings can be removed and in which there will be confidence and satisfaction with the procedures in all of these areas, that all the members will be satisfied that the procedures are equitable, even-handed, unbiased and totally fair.  I found also that there was a fund of goodwill towards the changes and a desire to make them work.  I noticed&mdash;this was very striking to me in my relationships with various members of the force from the highest to the newest recruit&mdash;that there was a great loyalty to their force and a great wish to see it as a successful one and to see that it would be a contented force.  These changes will go a long way towards achieving that. Other changes are necessary.</P>
    <P>During my time I commissioned a survey by a firm of management consultants of the Garda force.  The force as we have it today is structured as it was founded in the twenties and there have been no substantial changes since; but the society which it serves is vastly different from the society of the twenties.  I thought it time to look at the force from a quasi scientific point of view and to see if its structures are suitable for today and if unsuitable, or even partly suitable, how they might be changed and to recommend changes. I also wanted to look at the personnel problems of the force.  That work has been completed and the reports were available a matter of days before I left. I did not have more than a passing interest in them at that stage.  I imagine that by now my successor has had the benefit of departmental analysis of the reports and the benefit of his own readings of them.  I would be interested to hear him, when he is replying, give some indication of action that may be coming on foot of these reports, his views generally on what has been recommended and whether he accepts the recommendations or whether he thinks they go far enough, do not go far enough, his general state of satisfaction, or otherwise, with the analysis done by the management consultants.  I should say <Col N="184" /> that there was no clash between these changes and what the consultants were briefed to do.  These changes are quite net and quite narrow, affecting the statutory position of the representative bodies.  I have no doubt that the management consultants having regard to the wide terms of reference and the detailed survey they conducted will be reporting on matters very fundarnental to the structure and organisation of our police force.</P>
    <P>Allied with that I would be glad to hear from the Minister what his views would be on the question of the setting up of a police authority.  I indicated on many occasions that I was generally in favour of that idea.  I have been accused by a newspaper of having abandoned the idea.  On many occasions I made it clear that I had not abandoned but that it would be pointless proceeding with something as fundamental as a police authority in advance of the findings of the management consultants.  Now that those findings are to hand I would be interested to hear from the Minister if he considers that the idea of a police authority is still relevant to the Garda Síochána scene and if it would be compatible with the findings of the survey team and what his personal views are on it.  I will not ask him at this stage to give any indication of how he thinks it might be constructed and its powers and role.  That would be a matter for a separate debate and something on which he would want more notice.</P>
    <P>This Bill is to legislate for changes which have been agreed with the representative bodies and which will go to effect the sense of well-being in the forces.  It is an updating, in a small but significant way, of the personnel policies being practised in the force. To have proper structures and a proper legal framework is important so that the parties involved will know the limits of their rights to negotiate and act on behalf of their members. It is important for the welfare of the force that these things are settled.  I am glad that there is no agitation here, as there is in an adjoining jurisdiction, on the question of pay.  Our police force is well paid and it is well equipped.  The numbers are being increased <Col N="185" /> substantially.  They were increased over 1,000 during my term of office and the Government of which I was a member had sanctioned an increase by a further 1,000.</P>
    <P>There was dissatisfaction from time to time with the amount of overtime available for police to provide extra services.  In this year the figure provided in the Estimate was £5 million and a further £450,000 was made available for overtime.  I know the Minister, when in Opposition, was concerned that overtime was not being paid sufficiently generously and that as a result there was lack of police presence.  I would be glad to hear from him at this stage, the second last month of the year, the level he thinks overtime will run at for this year and if it will be much in excess of £5,450,000.</P>
    <P>I hope that the new members coming into the force will obviate the need for a considerable amount of overtime. We should know by this time next year how they will affect the position.  It certainly would be a happy day for the force if they could be relieved of the burden of having to work long hours of overtime.  Secondly, overtime inevitably brings dissatisfaction to a force as large as this by reason of the fact that some members are in a position, <i>bona fide</i>, to earn more money than colleagues on the same grade.  It would be a good day for the Garda Síochána if overtime as such could be abolished.  We will not know until, possibly, this time next year when most of the extra 1,000 men are serving, how the extra numbers are coping with the increasing demands on police time.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, it does seem from the crime statistics that the crime problem will not get smaller.  It may well be that the increase in the number of men will only keep pace with the increase in the number of problems they have to deal with and the need for overtime may continue.  That is in the future, but to give us an indication of what the situation is likely to be in the future I should be glad if the Minister would give some <Col N="186" /> idea of what he expects the out-turn to be this year.</P>
    <P>I note that it is proposed to change the title of the representative body and to use the word &ldquo;association&rdquo;.  I suppose this is the age of the euphemism and there cannot be any objection to that but an association will still represent its members and a representative body was an association of gardaí which had come together for that purpose. If it has the effect of improving the personnel position within the force and of making it easier for the members to liaise with outside bodies, then that is a perfectly acceptable change.</P>
    <P>The role of a representative body in a force that is disciplined and hierarchical in structure is, of course, a difficult and delicate one, particularly when it has the statutory duty and obligation to represent their numbers in all matters affecting their welfare and efficiency.  Now it is being given a role in matters concerning promotion, trasfers and discipline.  This will obviously place a serious but delicate burden on the members of the representative body.  They are essentially an association representing particular grades.  They do not have any function in the organisation and management and determination of the role of the police force.  Nevertheless, in discharging the statutory functions it obviously must have concern in these areas.  How that concern is expressed and how the expression of that concern is received are obviously areas that could be potentially abrasive.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that, with the changes made here, we will see in the future a very harmonious relationship.  I am not suggesting that in the past it was anything other, but I am saying that in the future we will see a consistently harmonious relationship in which the representative bodies will be conscious that their prime function as an association representing particular grades in the job is to see that their well-being and efficiency are looked after.  Their prime function is not to tell the Government or the persons charged by statute with running the Garda Síochána how the Garda should be run or what the role of the Garda should be.  Certainly they will have an <Col N="187" /> input like any other citizen in matters of major public importance.  I merely mention these points to show the difficulties that are present in practical terms for a representative body discharging its functions.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the officers of the representative bodies are sensitive to these situations and to the delicacy and the responsibility of their position. They are sensitive to the important role they can play in engendering a mood of satisfaction and contentment among the members of the force.  That, in turn, will bring with it a certain heightened sense of morale which is basic to a high level of performance.  I am satisfied that they are aware of the importance of their role in that regard.  I am equally satisfied that with the changes that must inevitably come from the management consultants report and the changes forced on any police force in an evolving society, we will continue to be well served by our Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in my opening remarks, a Chathaoirleach, it does seem rather odd that in discussing the Garda Síochána we cannot touch on matters which are of current controversy.  I accept your ruling on it.  I think it is common case that this nation has been well served by the members of the Garda Síochána.  In so far as this Bill goes to improve their lot, it is welcome and I hope it will be successful in its operation.</P>

      <P>I, too, would like to welcome the Minister for Justice on his first visit to this House, wish him well in his office and hope that he will have as peaceful a term as he can possibly have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is one of these unusual ones which we are experiencing in this House since we began this session.  It is the result, in a sense, of agreement between both administrations because it was in draft by the previous administration and is being put through by the Minister on behalf of the new Government. Therefore it represents a consensus of view in the matter of improve the relationships in the Garda Síochána. It is satisfactory to note that the agreement is one that has resulted <Col N="188" /> from discussions, not alone with the representatives of inspectors and other higher ranks in the Garda Síochána but also with the gardaí themselves.  I do not think it is necessary to say very much about it.  It is quite obvious that it is much more intelligent and sensible to create better working relationships than to wait until conditions have reached a point where one would have to create them.</P>
    <P>It is also hardly necessary to say that the original conditions laid down when the State was being founded, described under section 13 by the Minister, related to the right to bring matters other than discipline and promotion to the attention of the Commissioner or the Minister or both.  It must be fairly obvious to everybody that in a strong force matters such as abrupt transfers could easily lead to a worsening of relationships.  Where disciplining of that kind is necessary it could be more easily dealt with by having some method of communication so that grievances, if they do build up, can be communicated upwards and a better atmosphere brought about.</P>
    <P>Although the Bill itself confines what we may say about the Garda, it is the sort of measure which everybody throughout the country will welcome.  There is no doubt about it, any discontent, disquiet or unease in the Garda force is a matter for serious concern.  We are all aware of the increasing level of violence that has been taking place in recent years.  Indeed many of us are conscious that the whole question of law and order and the maintenance of proper order is beginning, in some degree, to come into question.</P>
    <P>From that point of view many people will welcome the institution of a practical measure, such as has been described by the Minister, to provide a freer association for gardaí, a method of consulting and bringing to the notice of those responsible any grievances that may arise.  Thereby it removes the danger of a build-up of resentment which very often can be the result of something totally unintentional.  The old system whereby a person did as he was told or else, as in the first Great War, is not always the best system. <Col N="189" /> I, of course, would say that there must always be discipline in an organisation but there must also be understanding. Perhaps in the future industrial or personnel relationships in this area may arrive at the position where agreement would come between the authority and the personnel on the forms of punishment that might be given out for breaches of any regulations.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is necessary to deal at any length with this measure.  I should like to commend the Minister and his predecessor on the work done by them, the representatives of the gardaí and the representatives of the Department.  I would hope that, as the Minister said, this sort of measure would bring a contented, strong and more efficient garda force into existence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join with the other Senators in welcoming the Minister into the House and in wishing him well in his office.  The particular Ministry which he has can be a difficult and burdensome one.  But it is also one with, perhaps, the greatest potential for achieving social change in Ireland and also of responding to the rapid social change that there has been. I hope the Minister will take every opportunity of bringing in necessary legislation particularly in the area of family law reform which could have him remembered as a significant Minister for Justice.</P>
      <P>We, in the Labour Party, welcome this Bill as a limited measure which is the result of protracted discussions and negotiations between the representative bodies and the Department of Justice.  We are conscious of the fact that any discussion of the role of the Garda Síochána must be based on an awareness of two essential prerequisites: firstly, that the police force of the State must be united, well disciplined and have reasonably high morale; secondly that there must be good relations between the police force and the citizens whom it protects and in whose name it acts when enforcing the criminal law.  These are essential basic prerequisites to our democratic system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="190" /> One must preface a contribution on this Bill by saying that with regard to both of these essential prerequisites there has been considerable doubt and concern in the past few years.  There has been concern about whether the Garda have had good morale; about the adequacy in their working conditions; about the responsiveness of the authorities to the needs of the ordinary garda in his work and about personnel relations within the Garda Síochána. Secondly, there has been widespread public concern about the relations between the gardaí and the public arising from the allegations of brutality by certain members of the Garda.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>References to brutality do not arise on this.  This Bill is concerned solely with changes in the structure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that.  I am just making the point that in examining a Bill relating to the Garda Síochána there are really two different aspects of their role which could be considered: one relates to the internal discipline, the morale and the working conditions of the Garda; the other very important dimension&mdash;which, as you say, is not within the terms of reference of this debate&mdash;concerns the relationship between the Garda and members of the public and the responsibility of the Government to ensure that steps are taken to reinforce that relationship and to create structures which guarantee a way of resolving doubts or conflicts and of examining serious complaints which are made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to turn to the question of the possibility of freedom of association being extended to members of the Garda, the right to join a trade union, the right to be affiliated to Congress. This was one of the earlier matters of negotiation which the representative body sought.  I should like to see fuller discussion about the basic principles involved.  I would like to hear the Minister elaborate more fully on why the Garda are not to be afforded full status and full freedom of association.  It might be said that it could create very serious difficulties if you give the right to strike to members of the Garda, but there is an equal <Col N="191" /> possibility of very real difficulties if the internal morale, discipline and responsiveness within the Garda reaches such a low level that there are persistent rumours of the possibility of a go-slow, a work-to-rule or the taking of a sick day off at a particular time. If, in other words, there is an inadequacy of negotiating machinery, an inadequacy of responsiveness within the Garda force, this can lead to a kind of malaise because of the failure to have a proper forum in which to resolve these problems.  It would be preferable to allow full freedom of association, full trade union status, full possibility of bargaining for terms of conditions and work. This does not mean that a body like the Garda Síochána would use that power irresponsibly and seek to disrupt the community by calling for a strike at the drop of a hat.</P>
    <P>It is worse to have inner tensions which can only be vented by underground action and resentment, and by the threat of either a go-slow or the taking of a period of sick leave by the gardaí themselves to register protest if they feel that their conditions have deteriorated or that there is no adequate response to their legitimate claims in the matter.  So, I would welcome further discussion by the Minister in his reply on this particular point, and I would welcome the possibility of his considering it at a later stage and bringing in further legislation on the matter.</P>
    <P>I would join with Senator Cooney in asking the Minister to reveal to the House his thinking on the question of establishing a police authority.  Indeed I would go further and ask that the report and findings of the management consultancy firm be made public.  This is an important matter of public interest.  I think that when a report of this sort is commissioned it should be open for public perusal and public discussion, and I await the response of the Minister on that point.</P>
    <P>Apart from the question of a police authority and the publication of the findings of the management consultancy survey, I would also welcome a statement by the Minister as to whether he intends to establish a <Col N="192" /> permanent complaints body to examine complaints made by citizens against individual gardaí in particular instances?  Again I appreciate that, strictly speaking, this question is outside the terms of the Bill before us, but it is the first opportunity we have had of questioning the Minister in the House on a Bill relating to the conditions of the Garda Síochána so I would welcome a statement from him as to his intention on this matter as well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that. But, as I say, it is the first opportunity that we have had and I am refraining from straying further in the hope that the Minister will respond to the question. I would also welcome some clarification from the Minister as to the general recruitment policy into the Garda Síochána.  There has been immense evolution in the whole scale of activity by operations on the criminal side in the use of technology by criminals, the sophisticated methods that are employed.  This demands a much more sophisticated response from the Garda themselves both at a training level and at a technological level.  I have noted that in other countries&mdash;particularly the United States but also in many other countries&mdash; there is a conscious attempt to recruit expertise into the police force; to establish a specialist research centre, to establish a sophisticated capability by the Garda.  I would welcome the Minister's views on recruitment and training of the Garda Síochána.  Apart from those particular questions on which I have asked for information, I welcome the Bill itself as a relatively limited measure but one which should improve the working conditions of ordinarly members of the Garda Síochána.  For that reason it will be welcomed by the Labour group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>May I first of all offer my congratulations to you, Sir, and to the Leas-Chathaoirleach on your appointments and to the Minister on taking up his heavy burden, and may I express my hope that his optimism and bonhomie will rub off a little on that grim Department?  May <Col N="193" /> I also express briefly my hope that this assembly will continue to realise its potential as a deliberative assembly? If from time to time through no fault of our own we on this side of the House stumble on articulateness and eloquence, we hope we will be forgiven by the Senator from the other side who on the first day expressed his distrust of people with a command of English.</P>
      <P>May I assure you that I do not intend to wander outside the scope of the Bill?  That scope has been made clear enough, but if I appear to do so briefly I would ask you to remember that I am, to use that horribly arch phrase, making my maiden speech.  I would hope that what I have to say relates to the measures before the House all of the time I am speaking.</P>
      <P>It is a good thing that it is an agreed measure, as the Minister pointed out in the Dáil.  It was agreed in a double sense&mdash;agreed between the Minister and the representatives of the Garda and agreed in the sense that there is bipartisan agreement between Government and Opposition.  I welcome it because certainly it will tend to improve industrial relations.  It will help to relax the rather paternalistic atmosphere which for historical reasons has prevailed within the police force in this country.  Perhaps more centralised and paternalistic police structures do and have prevailed in Ireland from the 19th century than in the other island.</P>
      <P>I accept, of course, that to speak of democratising the Garda is in a sense contradictory, given the obligation of morale and discipline and so on, but I do welcome the measure to the extent that democratisation is possible within the force and to the extent that it will go some way towards meeting the frustration which certainly exists among individual members, as anybody knows who has talked to them. Therefore, I think it is a positive step that in terms of terminology the phrase &ldquo;representative body&rdquo; gives way to the term &ldquo;association&rdquo;.  That reflects a process in adult development, so to speak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The more the Garda are content <Col N="194" /> within themselves, the more it follows that their relations with the public at large will improve.  To a certain extent it is difficult to avoid reference to their relations with the public, but if they are more democratised in their own body they will be compelled to take a larger interest in the country at large and in their relations with the citizens.  It is a cloud-cuckoo concept to think that somehow the Garda exist in a cocoon of discipline and loyalty, and that they never think about the underlying basis of their relations with the citizens.  I would hope that as they grow in self-responsible status they will come to realise that they themselves are ultimately the people who are responsible for law and order, not the Minister or the Commissioner.  In the end the answer to the age-old question <i>Quis custodiet ipsos custodes</i>?  may after all be very simple.  It may well be <i>ipsi custodes.</i>  As they improve in status I would hope that they will take a greater interest in politics in the widest sense.</P>
    <P>When we contemplate the poor relations between the Garda and some sections of the population&mdash;the underprivileged sections and the youth&mdash;it becomes clear that the people who oppose the Garda and regard them with hatred see them not as the defenders of the community as a whole, of the State as a whole, but as defenders of a particular regime, defenders of the <i>status quo.</i>  I submit that it will be good for all of us when the Garda themselves come to realise that their duty is not to uphold any particular ideology but to protect the citizens as a whole.  I look forward to the day when the Garda come to aspire to a truer democracy than we have at present and to the day when they can confidently uphold law and order in the sense that it represents the law and order of all the people and when they can defend property when property means the widest possible distribution of wealth.  Not until then can we speak of the Garda in the prematurely optimistic phrase of Thomas Drummond 140 years ago and say that they are a truly popular force.  I welcome this Bill as a small but important step in that direction.</P>
    <Col N="195" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom ar dtús comhgáirdeas a rá leis an gCathaoirleach agus fáilte a chur roimh an Aire. I know the Minister to be a very understanding person and I wish him well in his office.  I hope that the Cathaoirleach will be equally understanding to me because this is my first opportunity to speak in the Seanad.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill because of the greater freedom it gives to the members of the Garda Síochána.  Under this Bill they have freedom to draw up their own constitution, freedom to conduct their own elections and generally manage their own affairs.  As the Minister stated, under the existing regulations the affairs of the representative bodies are controlled to a considerable extent by the Commissioner.</P>
      <P>This Bill will help the morale of the gardaí and this is very important because the gardaí have worked in very difficult circumstances, particularly ly during the last few years.  They must receive support to combat the evil that is causing so much distress to our community in the streets of our cities. It is admirable that this association, this new word which will replace the words central bodies, have drawn up a constitution, one object of which, I should like to quote is:</P>
      <P>to provide the means through which the members acting as a body can influence and promote the development of the Garda Síochána and contribute to greater administrative efficiency and service while having regard to the welfare of each member and the opportunities to enable him to realise his own potential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one question I should like to raise with the Minister in connection with the welfare of the gardaí and that is the question of housing.  I wonder what representations the Minister has had from the representative bodies concerning this.  Speaking to members of the Garda I have found that there is a lack of housing particularly in rural areas and indeed also a lack of facilities in many of our Garda barracks throughout the country.  In my area gardaí have to build their own houses and live sometimes outside the areas in which they serve.  Many of the <Col N="196" /> barracks need improving and I have noted that near some of the Garda barracks that are now being built, prefabricated houses are being provided. It is a pity that solid concrete houses are not being built.  There should be living quarters provided in new barracks being built.</P>
    <P>When a garda dies, his wife and family must quit the house provided for them.  I know it is a difficult problem because there is a lack of housing at present, but it places the widow and family in a particularly difficult situation. The Minister is a compassionate man and he might be able to help families of gardaí who have suffered bereavements in that way.</P>
    <P>I welcome particularly the Minister's commitment to recruit extra gardaí. This was outlined in the Fianna Fáil manifesto before the recent general election.  I would also point out that there is a need for extra gardaí in rural areas as well as in the cities and larger centres of population.  Thirdly, the members of the Garda Síochána are very closely associated with the people. They play a great part in our community, but at present many gardaí cannot live in the areas in which they serve.</P>
    <P>I compliment the former Minister on having reached agreement on this measure.  I would also congratulate him on recruiting extra gardaí.  I would criticise him, however, on the delay that took place when we were looking for extra gardaí at a time when they were very badly needed.  Last year more than 3,000 young people applied to become members of the Garda Síocána. For that reason it seems obviously necessary that extra gardaí could be recruited as they are needed, and the Minister has already committed his Government to that policy.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with the question of training.  Many people have expressed the idea that the training at the moment, which I think will last approximately five months, is not long enough.  Whether that is so or not, I think there should be ongoing training in the Garda as is the case in many other professions.  I ask the Minister to consider that point also.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="197" /> I welcome the section that deals with the procedure on pensions.  It is time that Garda pensions were brought into line with other pensions, particularly those of the Army, and I am glad this has been included in this Bill.  On the question of criticism of the gardaí generally and of public relations, the Garda Band and the Garda Choir are just two examples of the kind of good public relations exercise that the Garda engage in.  This is a short Bill and I welcome it and wish the Minister every success in his office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and wish him well in his onerous tasks and thank him for following up so quickly the work of his predecessor and for giving credit to his predecessor for what has been done in this respect.  I have mixed feelings about it in the sense that it is sad in a society that demands so much democracy that it has taken so long for some of that democracy to spill over into the Garda Síochána in the sense of their rights. However, better late than never.  When one considers the amount of time that has gone by when they did not get their rights, even though I would have some reservations about the extent to which this Bill goes, in the sense that it is not enough, I see it as a major step forward and I look forward with confidence to some more development particularly when they enable the Garda to manage their own affairs, when they themselves would be able to bring about the proper types of agreed procedures within which they could process their grievances in accordance with trade union practice but not in accordance with the full rights of trade unionism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was a little bit worried that the previous Minister, even though he was a great democrat, did not find it possible to grant the Garda trade union status and what stops me from pressing it is the fact that the Garda body freely accepted that there were difficulties. However, I was a little disappointed that they let go so easily on that point. I congratulate the Garda representatives who negotiated the terms of the agreement that brought about the Bill, in the sense of being sensible, in not digging in on pay and other rights. <Col N="198" /> That was a very sensible approach, because otherwise they would probably be still arguing about what the Bill would contain.</P>
    <P>The other point on which I should like the Minister's assistance is the question of association, the right to associate with outside bodies.  What I am trying to establish is whether the association could be considered to be in the same context for instance, as the airline pilots' body can affiliate with the TUC.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that in certain conditions they can have this association. Is there anything that would prevent a Garda body affiliating to a registered trade union?  Is there anything in the Bill that gives scope for this as an initial step towards full integration into a trade union movement?</P>
    <P>Like Senator Kitt, I am delighted about the easing up of the procedures in regard to pensions orders.  It is desirable.  When we are dealing with a force so vunerable, where they are exposed regularly to malicious injuries, to a situation where armed robbery has practically become the norm, we cannot go far enough to facilitate them and to give them security.  I would be the first to stand up to lend support to anything that could be enacted to assist them.</P>
    <P>We are looking for good type of gardaí and we have them, but in order to get them there is a certain procedure which destroys some enthusiastic young men who have a consuming desire to become gardaí, and that is the interview procedure.  They are controlled by the conditions, on the education side, of the Civil Service Commission, and if you fail the Irish, that is it.  Yet the astonishing feature of this&mdash;I suppose nobody else but myself would have the hard neck to say it&mdash;is that if a garda stops you on the road and if the conversation goes beyond two or three sentences, the garda is lost in respect of Irish.  Yet lack of a knowledge of Irish prevents young men from becoming members of the Garda Síochána.  This should be looked at.  I am not saying that Irish should be removed as a condition of the civil service examination.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="199" /> That is the first step in the procedure. The second step is that the recruit gets a test in oral Irish and a medical test and then he goes for interview.  If he fails the interview the problem can be looked at, but if he fails at the examination side of it, merely in Irish, that seems to be the end of it as far as the Garda Síochána is concerned.  I should like to know is that the end of it?  Would it not be a practical proposition that in a case specifically where the amount of Irish they would be involved in would be minimal, there would be another opportunity given?  When somebody tries to become a member of the Garda Síochána, some special concession should be made whereby the person could sit for the Irish interview again, and not turn him down at that completely. He may be rejected later, possibly in the medical test or the interview, but it is sad to think that somebody's world can collapse because he failed the initial Irish test.  Candidates can be very bright, healthy, energetic and carry a trauma with them for the rest of their lives because they fall down on something which they may never have to use again to any extent. It is the end of an opportunity for a career for them.  It would not happen in any other circumstances.  The Minister should think seriously about it. I am not blaming the Minister for this. I am blaming the system.  With particular regard to the question of affiliation to a trade union and the question of failure in Irish, I should like to know if something cannot be done.</P>
    <P>For people who might get frightened when I speak about trade unions, I may add that nurses have the right to strike and have had it for a long time but they do not go on strike very often.  We hear of threats, but nurses and a lot of other people who have the right to do so, never go on strike. It is not such an outrageous thing to think that some day, through affiliation with a trade union, gardaí will become full members of trade unions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is obviously the outcome of rather detailed and complex negotiations with the people <Col N="200" /> involved.  It seems to represent a compromise between the trade union claims on the one hand and the present outmoded arrangements on the other hand.  It seems to me to be a job well done.  The Minister for Justice, and indeed the previous Minister for Justice, are to be congratulated on the work put into this Bill.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I must take issue with Senator Harte on one point.  I regard the Garda Síochána as a disciplinary force, as being of the people and being there to serve the State and the people.  For this reason one would have to be extremely careful, as it is an extremely delicate matter, in talking about the right to strike in a case like this.  On the one hand, Senator Harte points out that it is no harm to give the right to strike but of course they will not use it.  I could not accept that because if you give people the right to do something, you cannot quibble if they do it later on.  You must think it out clearly in advance. I regard the Garda Síochána as a disciplinary force and it is in that context we should&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I believe that.  I should like to refer briefly to the crime situation which the Minister is doing his best to combat.  There seems to be an increased number of gardaí on the streets.  In the Minister's fight against crime on our streets, the people are behind him.  We say to the Minister to keep the pressure on, put on more foot patrols.  I believe that the foot patrol is a superior method of combating crime than any mobile method. The people of Ireland are saying that the Minister has their full support in taking whatever action is needed on the streets to rid our cities, in particular, of crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increase in the number of robberies, which appear to take place on Fridays, leads me to believe that we should take a serious look at the method of payment of wages.  I have no ready-made formula for answering that problem but perhaps payment of all workers by cheque or money order, with suitable cashing arrangements, <Col N="201" /> would be desirable.  Perhaps this whole area can be looked at and that the trade unions could be spoken to about it.  It would take a lot of pressure from the Garda Síochána in protecting wage rolls on Fridays, and I am sure it would ease the minds of a lot of workers.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect of the Bill I should like the Minister to comment on, which provides for the Minister to authorise a body with which the Garda association may associate.  How broad is it?  Has the Minister got a completely free hand in designating those bodies with which the Garda association may associate themselves or is he circumscribed by some law which exists in the Statute Book?</P>
    <P>Overall, this Bill marks a step forward in the staff arrangements with the Garda Síochána and I wish them the very best with the new arrangements and hope they will work satisfactorily.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on his appointment and wish him every success in the years ahead.  I should like to make a few points on the Bill.  First as regard the association, the gardaí have been denied the right to join a trade union which is the right of all other people.  In view of this, the association now envisaged should be, in my view, sufficiently strong with power to deal effectively with the Department. Elected members of the association should not be the subject of victimisation regarding promotions and so on, as was the case in the past. They should be consulted in police matters, such as managerial changes, transfers and so on.</P>
      <P>The proposed association are not the answer because of the way they are being organised.  The reason for this is that they are divided into groups. First, you have the garda ranks, who have accepted this with reservation, and second, you have inspectors and sergeants, among whom there is a split because a section of the inspectors are seeking a separate association and sergeants have not agreed with such a provision. I believe the answer is one association for all ranks with a branch for each rank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to training, at present a <Col N="202" /> recruit gets 21 weeks training.  In the times and society in which we live this is totally inadequate.  This has not been changed for 24 years and that in itself is reason for change.  A recruit should get at least one year's training after which he should be sent to a small station in the country where he would deal with everyday matters in a relatively quiet atmosphere and where he would be properly assessed to see if he would be suitable for country, large town or city service.</P>
    <P>At present the position is that a recruit after 21 weeks training is sent to a large centre where nobody has time to bother with him, and the result is that a good number of young men are going the wrong road.  Recruits should be trained in human and public relations and so on, which is not being done at present because time does not permit.</P>
    <P>The grave mistake of closing stations needs to be looked at again.  In the light of the rise in unlawful organisations and serious crimes which occur daily throughout the country, the removal of a Garda station from any village or suburban area is wrong because you lose touch with the ordinary people whose wish is to have a Garda station in their areas.  Then there is a reduction of station staff.  You have stations with only one junior garda where there was a sergeant and three gardaí a few years ago.  A more ridiculous situation still is where you have one sergeant who is in a supervisory rank.  In those stations you have a sergeant supervising himself.  The answer is a Garda station in all small villages throughout the country with a sergeant in charge of three, operating as one unit.</P>
    <P>The present position on transfers is a penalty on promotion resulting in the better type garda not seeking promotion, as happened recently where a garda being promoted to sergeant was informed he would be transferred 200 miles to a northern county.  He requested demotion.  What advantage is it to be transferred 200 miles from base for less than £2 per week rise in pay?  I know three sergeants in the Cork area who were transferred to Border counties, Donegal, Monaghan and <Col N="203" /> Cavan, at great expense to the State and to the individuals alike, and members from the northern counties being transferred to the Munster area.  The men sent to Border areas could have been transferred to stations in the Munster area.  I should like to ask the Minister to have a look at those points when he is summing up.</P>

      <P>Fáiltím roimh an mBille seo.  Pé rud a dhéanfaimís chun cabhrú leis an Gharda Síochána, is ceart agus is comhair dúinn é sin a dhéanamh. Táimid buíoch díobh.  Táimid buíoch dá ndíograis agus, dar ndóigh, táimid an-mhorálach as a misneach in am an foiréigin.</P>
      <P>On page 2 of the Minister's statement it is summarised very clearly for us what the Bill intends to do.  There are three major reforms listed here. I will not go through them as Senators will have them read.  When the Minister was reading his statement the thought crossed my mind, how was it we never did that before?  The three major reforms there look very reasonable, mild and deserving when you consider the demands being made in other areas of employment in the age we live in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda deserve well of the Irish people.  They are a splendid force of which any nation could be proud. They come from every stratum of Irish society.  They are of the people and for the people.  Their title, Garda Síochána, is a happy one.  We should not call them police, but what they are, Garda Síochána, men whose business and vocation it is to keep the peace and to see that it is kept.  I wonder had Shakespeare some such title in mind when he said long ago that the quality of mercy is not strained.  At least it should not drop as a brutal baton on the skull beneath.  Thank God, by and <Col N="204" /> large, the overwhelming majority of our Garda force have been kind, solicitous and fatherly in their dealings with the public.  That is an extraordinary tribute when you consider the long history of disillusionment, disappointment and hatred for the forces of &ldquo;law and order&rdquo; which was there before the advent of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>A garda lives among the people, and to complete his vocation to the ultimate satisfaction the good garda will always be associated with the people in their joys, sorrows, in their clubs and societies, thus laying the foundation for a very happy relationship between the garda and the people he serves.  It is inconceivable that the garda who mixes with the people socially, who plays on the hurling and football teams, joins their societies and works with them would not get assistance from those people when it is needed. There is a big social aspect in all of this.  We are dealing with human beings.  A garda, like the parish priest or the schoolmaster, the lawyer or solicitor, is dealing with people.  He is not dealing with inanimate objects or animals; he is dealing with human beings. Therefore, the basic question is one of human relationships.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the type of training necessary for a garda.  Other Senators have referred to what they consider as the inadequacy of garda training.  I understand the period is five months most of which is devoted to physical development, weapon training, legal matters and so on.  There should be a thorough grounding in the social needs of a community, the part a garda can play while living in that community, and the type of activities he should engage in in order to gain and promote the confidence of the people.</P>
    <P>Another important point which it saddens me to mention is the reluctance of the gardaí, especially the younger members to use the Irish language.  I do not know the reason for this.  Perhaps it is that sufficient emphasis is not placed on the importance of our language and culture during their period of training.  If that is so, then it <Col N="205" /> should be corrected.  I do not intend to pursue this point, but this has been my experience.  On the other hand, I have had very pleasant conversations with members of the force in our language and they were very glad of the opportunity to speak Irish with me.</P>
    <P>In the last paragraph of his speech the Minister said:</P>
    <P>We all recognise, I think, that it is essential to the well-being of the community that we should have a contented, strong and efficient police force.  I have every hope that, by facilitating the functioning of good personal relations within the Garda Síochána, the new charter which is being written for the representative bodies will contribute to that objective.</P>
    <P>I am sure every Member of the House concurs with that hope.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all let me say that any Act which has been on the Statute Book for 50 years is bound to show some signs of stress and strain after such a lengthy period.  This Bill deals with certain aspects of the Garda Síochána Act, 1924, and perhaps there may be other aspects of that Act which also need an overhaul as has been done with the personnel matter we are dealing with today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a certain amount of sympathy for members of the Garda Síochána because I feel that they are no longer held in the same public regard in which they were held hitherto.  I believe they are aware of this lessening of esteem.  Through this Bill we have improved their negotiating ability, giving them extended negotiating facilities and the basic democratic facilities which exist for other associations in regard to pay and living conditions.  But we must bear in mind that we have held from them the right to affiliate with the Congress of Trade Unions and so hold trade union status. The question of whether the Garda Síochána should hold trade union status and be recognised as such may be an academic one as I believe that the Garda Síochána, being the responsible body of men they are, would be most reluctant to wield the strike weapon which would be available to <Col N="206" /> them.  That strike weapon is at the disposal of other professions and organisations which occupy crucial positions in the State but yet is not exercised by them.  I would be confident that the Garda Síochána would be as reluctant to exercise that weapon.</P>
    <P>Having withheld the authority from them to affiliate to the CTU we must ensure that they have at their disposal the basic negotiating rights which exist within any associations or trade unions.  We have gone part of the way in that respect, and two questions are posed.  Firstly, what will be gained, from what has been given, by members of the Garda Síochána?  I have no doubt that from their point of view they will regard it as an opportunity to regain some of their former public esteem and also they will see it as an opportunity to pursue with greater vigour than before their claims for improvement in their living standards and remuneration.  Secondly, what will be gained for the State?  We should look with confidence to an improvement in the efficiency with which the members of the Garda Síochána carry out their duties and to an improvement in relations between the Garda Síochána and the public.</P>
    <P>We have in the past on occasions, expected more from the Garda than we were prepared to give when settling their complaints.  We thought that if we gave them adequate overtime payments it would go a long way towards easing their complaints.  Overtime, in the short-term, is a welcome measure for a garda as for any other citizen but in the long-term it becomes the minimum expectation for that person and his family.  There are other ways besides generous overtime facilities in which we can obtain from members of the Garda Síochána the service we expect.  For instance, traffic wardens now assume some of the duties which were hitherto carried out by gardaí. There could be further extensions in this field which could lead to a diversion of manpower within the Garda force to more important matters.</P>
    <P>Also in every superintendent's headquarters there are rank and file gardaí holding clerical positions.  I question this.  These clerical duties could be performed <Col N="207" /> by young boys and girls who have not undergone training for the Garda Síochána.  This would again divert trained members to more important security matters and to the preservation of the peace.</P>
    <P>Finally, in the matter of bank and payroll security, it is long overdue that banking and other large commercial institutions should bear some part of the burden, and not have members of the Garda Síochána on Fridays and other days of the week standing outside such establishments in practically every town in the country.</P>
    <P>When we speak of the Garda Síochána we have always at the back of our minds the image created in the early nineteen twenties at the foundation of that force that they are above any political association or influence in Ireland.  I feel that the Garda Síochána should be divorced a little bit more from the Minister for Justice so that that image is maintained.  If we are to expect from the members of the Garda Síochána the continuation of the service that we started out with 50 years ago we must always remember that the quality of that service is always dictated by what is put into it in the first instance.  The training courses which gardaí pursue&mdash;I think it is about 21 or 22 weeks&mdash;seem very short for what is possibly the most important public function in this State. The necessity for continuing and regular refresher courses becomes more important and I feel the Department of Justice should look here a little more closely.  If the Garda Síochána have, as a result of what we have given them today in this Bill, a greater self confidence and if they have greater trust that they can pursue for themselves adequate remuneration and adequate living conditions, then I think that the State can with confidence look in return for increased efficiency and also a better output from them.</P>
    <P>I think the courtesy from members of the Garda Síochána not generally, but in certain isolated instances, has been somewhat less satisfactory than the treatment accorded by members of, say, the RUC.  I hesitate to say this but it has also been voiced to me by <Col N="208" /> people who had had on many occasions to travel into Northern Ireland and meet the various road checks on both sides of the Border.  I think this matter of public relations&mdash;I suppose it boils down to the simple factor of courtesy&mdash; is something which I think we are increasingly conscious of as being desirable in all State agencies in this country, and I do not intend to direct it in a general fashion to the members of the Garda Síochána.  It perhaps goes back to the training course in the first instance and to the need for refresher courses to give them confidence that they can co-operate with the public in this country, and that they need not be afraid that the public will turn on them in any way, or will be suspicious of them in any way.</P>
    <P>Having those few words of reservations I must extend tribute to the Garda Síochána as a whole.  I think we have been more than fortunate in having them at our service for the past 50 years.  We expect an awful lot from them and we should at least try to give them what they see other organisations enjoying.  We must always remember that if we leave any State agency personnel in a position that they feel they are being treated differently and accorded different facilities than other organisations then we must accept that such will only lead to frustration and strain, and the Garda Síochána is certainly one force in which we do not want this to happen.</P>
    <P>There is just one section of the Bill about which I have a little reservation. It is section 1 (5) in which the Minister, where he is authorising the association to deal with outside agencies or bodies, will be able to specify conditions and restrictions and will be able to withdraw any such authorisation at any time.  I feel this may be a little too restrictive on the freedom to negotiate, and it may lead to a certain amount of friction in future in negotiations.  I think we could well see the situation where the Minister can say &ldquo;No, you cannot enter into discussion with such a body for advice&rdquo;.  I think the wording in the section could be a little less restrictive.  I would like to have the <Col N="209" /> Minister's assurance that he has nothing in his mind as regards undue restrictions on the gardaí in their entering into discussions with other bodies to further their case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ValentineJago" hpid="Mr. Jago Mr. Jago">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jago</NameTxt>
      <P>There cannot be any opposition to this Bill.  However, it does create matters on which comment may be made.  When I was a boy&mdash;and this may be history in the Minister's book&mdash;my first contact with policemen was with the RIC and the DMP and there were many fine men in those bodies.  Then there was a gap in which we had no policemen.  I remember a time in Cork when a body came on the streets in civilian clothes with a white band marked CCP, and that was the Cork Civil Police. What happened in Dublin at that time I do not know, but I can distinctly remember how proud I felt when our own Garda Síochána came on the streets in Cork in their blue uniforms, with their bright shiny buttons, their batons in a leather case strapped to their sides and their helmets with their shiny mountings.  You felt the presence of law and order in the streets when you saw those men attired as they were.</P>
      <P>Since then there has been a change. We have had the advent of the squad car, the advent of the motorcycle gardaí, and I wonder whether we have improved efficiency with the change.  I wonder why the helmet disappeared. Was it because it was uncomfortable or was it because it cost too much?  As they used to say in the old music hall song, &ldquo;Ask a policeman, he knows everything, he is everything to everybody.&rdquo; It was a comforting sight at night when you saw a guard in a darkened helmet without the shiny mountings, going round checking every door.  I wonder has the change been for the better.  However, I leave it there with that question.  Suffice it to say that the image of the integrity of the force has been upheld despite those changes. There have been accusations made of late but I will not comment on them because they may be <i>sub judice.</i>  The majority of our community still hold the force in high regard.  In introducing the Bill the Minister said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="210" /> My predecessor made it clear to them, however, that he could not agree to concede trade union status or the right to strike, and considered that concession of these matters would be incompatible with the functions and responsibilities of members of the force.</P>
    <P>It is heartening that this was accepted, evidently without question, by the Garda.  It proves their responsibility as a force.  They know that the community would suffer if they were to take irresponsible action.  This raises the question whether the right to strike is compatible with the functions and responsibilities of other sections of our community. The association to be formed and I quote the Minister, &ldquo;... is to help to improve their status and image.&rdquo;.  The word &ldquo;maintain&rdquo; should have been used instead of &ldquo;improve&rdquo;. The word &ldquo;status&rdquo; is used to refer to the high regard with which they are held at present.</P>
    <P>Finally, I hope, and I commend this to the Minister, that the improvement in their conditions will be speedily gained under this legislation to prove that justice is attainable by procedural methods without the strike weapon. The strike weapon can spread in many directions, damaging the innocent bystander and boomeranging on the marksman.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill and I hope that it will have a speedy effect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I have noticed that most of the previous speakers extended their congratulations to the Minister. I extend him my good wishes for a successful term in what I recognise as a difficult Ministry.  I should also like to put on record my appreciation of the courage and commitment of the Minister's predecessor, Senator Patrick Cooney, who was Minister for Justice during what I regard as being the most difficult time we have had since the establishment of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this Bill and I feel that it is long overdue.  I recognise that there were difficulties and that there was a sense of grievance among many members of the police force, especially in relation to the absence of effective channels through which they could <Col N="211" /> discuss and resolve difficulties that arose in relation to their welfare, efficiency, promotion and discipline. I sincerely hope that the implementation of this Bill will see a new situation in which there is satisfaction among the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister said that he shared the common belief that there is a necessity for a contented, strong and efficient police force.  I would hope that, having brought about that situation, we would have and could look forward to the members of the Garda Síochána having a new sense of commitment and a new sense of dedication to the job they have in hand.</P>
    <P>I would be less than honest if I did not say that there is a growing sense of frustration in our society and many people are questioning the capacity of the Garda to fight and overcome our growing crime rate.  It is a serious matter when people are being attacked and assaulted in their homes, when business premises would appear to be sitting ducks for armed thugs.  That feeling of frustration and questioning is justified.  There is an obligation on the Minister and on the Garda authorities to leave no doubt in the minds of our people that they are determined to provide the resources, be they in manpower, equipment or method, to combat this growing wave of crime and murder.</P>
    <P>If we expect the Garda to act as a barrier between the people and lawlessness, we should support and encourage them in the discharge of their duties.  I doubt that we have given sufficient encouragement and support to the Garda in recent times. Have we always given them support? Have we always recognised their successes?  On the other hand, we have often been willing to condemn their failings at the slightest opportunity. Some of our people have been willing to join hands with sources of doubtful purpose and character in undermining the morale of our police force.  Our courts have not always given the members of our police force the support and encouragement they deserve.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made this afternoon to the training of our gardaí. I share the views that have been <Col N="212" /> expressed.  After a period of 24 years the time has arrived to examine whether the methods of training are sufficient and adequate.  If they are not adequate, they should be improved.</P>
    <P>One final point I should like to make is that our security situation has lead to a real deployment of the police force.  One of the side effects of that is the reduction of Garda strength in provincial and rural areas.  Another of the side effects of that reduction has been the increase in petty crime and vandalism.  While we can say that the serious crimes we are concerned with at present are confined to our largest centres of population, it may well be only a question of time before the same undesirable situation applies to other areas.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  I expect that its passing may bring about a new feeling of satisfaction and commitment in our Garda and for that reason it has my full support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelMulcahy" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Ar dtús ba mhaith liom fáilte a thabhairt don Aire chun an Teach seo.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh an Bille mar taca don Aire.</P>
      <P>I, like everybody else, welcome this Bill.  I thought it might be opportune to deliberate, as my colleague, Senator Murphy said, on some of the factors behind it.  The emergence of a peace-keeping force by the Act of 1924 has provided the country with security over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All institutions must over a time adapt as cultural development takes place.  Periodically a change is needed. The 1924 Act seems to have served us well.  In industry we have done a lot of research on what it is that gives job satisfaction, and some of the findings from industry are obviously relevant to the job of the Garda Síochána.  It is helpful to distinguish between those factors that generate the environment in which a person has to do a job and those which provide the real satisfaction in doing the job. They are both different.  The absence of some of those factors&mdash;what one might call the environmental ones&mdash; might inhibit somebody getting satisfaction from doing a job well.  Making the barracks brighter and cleaner <Col N="213" /> might make it better for the garda and give him a better environment in which to work, but it is not necessarily going to give him any real satisfaction. That will come from the way he goes about his job, from the recognition and sense of achievement he gets for doing it and the opportunity he has to grow.</P>
    <P>It is up to the State, the Minister and his Department to do their best in both areas and this is more pressing at a time when the demand for democratisation is growing in our institutions.  How is it possible to reconcile all these?  Does it mean, for instance, that putting a policeman into a car and making him mobile to survey Sheriff Street through a motor car window is a better way of getting job satisfaction?  I doubt that.</P>
    <P>As a public representative interested in that area I had occasion to walk around those streets and I enjoyed joining the Garda foot patrols, walking side by side with Inspector McDermott and his colleagues.  It was very heartening to see the way the people of that area met and chatted with them.  Good relations are based on on-going communications, face to face communications. I tend to support the Senator who said that a foot patrol may very well give not only a better service but a better sense of satisfaction to the individual garda.  The development of a community spirit in this regard is a very welcome one.  It is interesting to see now that the Garda are attending to this and are being identified with some of these communities.  To some extent this might raise the notion that having a branch or portion of the force identified with a particular area might not be a bad idea.  I commend that to the Minister for further attention.  The old DMP is a typical example.</P>
    <P>On the question of the role and job of the Garda it is useful to think of Weber's famous definition of a State, that is, a territory in which people live where only one group has the right to use force.  Our police force are in a unique position.  They are, as Senator Brennan said, a disciplinary force and, if necessary, have the right to use force.  This right carries with it concomitant obligations.  It is because of <Col N="214" /> that that we cannot entertain the idea of a strike.  At no point in time should it be possible for a force, which by its existence defines a State, have the right to withdraw its services.  The people contract that situation and the Garda, therefore, must forego the right to strike in principle.</P>
    <P>I agree with the comments made about training.  It may be that the approach to training needs possibly some outside help as far as the Department and the force are concerned. There is a lot to be learned from the field of adult education in this regard because that is what they are at.  It is on-going.  The Minister should give that some consideration.</P>
    <P>Finally, two congratulations&mdash;one to the Minister who, I notice, is taking the opportunity publicly to defend his colleagues and the officials of the Department who have to deal with these matters.  It is a good thing that he should be doing that.  Congratulations are also due to the four officers who recently graduated with university degrees.  This is a sign, I hope, like the Senator who spoke earlier, that it is an indication that the force are increasing in sophistication and taking the steps needed to combat the sophistication of the criminals of today.  I do not wish to give the impression that we want a technological Garda Síochána and I praised the good paternal relationship that exists&mdash;I have seen it in the streets of Dublin, in Sean MacDermott Street&mdash;where some of the older gardaí seem to act as grandparents to the children of an area.  It is fascinating and I am proud to note it here.  But there is a need for the development of a more sophisticated force and I hope that the fact that four officers obtained their degrees is the first sign of that.  I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAMartin" hpid="Dr. Martin Dr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill also and I should like to endorse what Senator Mulcahy said.  Every point he has made is relevant and important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make one or two points relating to the situation out of which this Bill has emerged, at least the need that produced a Bill of this kind.  The situation with regard to the Garda is, and has to be, that they cannot go on <Col N="215" /> strike.  Senator Mulcahy has made that point and it has been made by other Senators.  The fact that they cannot go on strike, therefore, makes it difficult for them to negotiate as other bodies of organised labour can.  It is more or less established, at least in the West, as an absolute right that a person can withdraw labour.  Gardaí cannot do that.  The result is that it is incumbent on the State to see that that deprivation does not bite deep into their morale, into their sense of their duty and of their status.</P>
    <P>This Bill is therefore welcome in the sense that they can at least negotiate but it should be recognised&mdash;the Minister has shown some sensitivity in this matter&mdash;that what they are doing is of vital importance.  It should have a built-in guarantee that they will get not just the minimum to which they are entitled but something more than that.  There should be a built-in guarantee that the gardaí should be paid more and treated better.  In other words, they should be treated as well as they would negotiate for if they had the right to withdraw their labour.</P>
    <P>We should be extremely sensitive about that point.  We are dealing with people who are very highly motivated, who are there to defend our liberties, who frequently put themselves in danger but who have not the right to withdraw their labour or strike.  It should be recognised that in such groups as these a special tenderness should be shown towards them and their requirements with regard to conditions and their remuneration.  One of the things which has emerged is the fact that the structure in the Garda Síochána is rather old fashioned.  It is like the old military style.  The military style has to remain the same but, as Senator Mulcahy and others have pointed out, the role of the gardaí has changed because society is more problematical now than it was.  The normal garda is required now to marshal a good deal more of the social skills, of the ability to talk to people, to cajole people, not just to arrest them.  We are dealing with a society which is going to pose a problem.  We would all like our community to be more liberal, to abolish all forms of constraint, abolish <Col N="216" /> corporal punishment&mdash;that is gone&mdash; and capital punishment which is gone, except in special cases.</P>
    <P>We would like to get rid of imprisonment also.  The majority of our people want that.  But if even a small body of people in our society withdraw their consent&mdash;supposing we have a situation like the Bader-Meinhoff group in Germany&mdash;no matter how much one wants to liberalise society if a determined group say they do not want it, then the role of the Garda in that situation becomes more and more problematical, requires more and more finesse and, therefore, requires a better kind of operative.  That kind of person can only be cultivated and attracted into the force if he is given the dignity of negotiation on the one hand but, more so, a greater devolution of power down through the ranks. The absolute diktat of one man, of one Commissioner at the top, might have been all right 30 years ago and was all right but is not all right now.  I urge the Minister to carry out a strenuous re-examination of what the structure should be like, in other words, negotiation within the Garda on how to deal with an increasingly fluid and, in some ways, an increasingly explosive social situation.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the last point.  Last night there was an extremely impressive and disturbing television programme about the firemen in England. A number of firemen in the Liverpool area were interviewed.  They were asked why they are going on strike.  The question put to them was a fair one: they had joined the fire fighting force because they were well motivated and wanted to help the public; they wanted to put out fires.  They agreed and replied that they feel great when they rescue two children from a skyscraper; but when one brings only £35 home to one's wife on a Saturday, having done all that, the feeling is not quite so great.  As a matter of fact, there is a tendency to feel that one is a sucker, a fool.  One has been working from the point of view of idealism but the society which is using the effort uses it in a far less charismatic way.</P>
    <P>If we are to expect the Garda Síochána to go on acting as well as <Col N="217" /> they have been&mdash;they have a pretty good record by and large&mdash;and if they are to go on and improve their status and give us a service which is going to become increasingly urgent, we must improve their conditions.  The question of unmotivated violence is quite universal now.  It has hit us in some ways but some of its more brutal, anarchist and nihilist forms have not quite hit us yet.  By and large the subversive forces in the country are motivated by rather old fashioned and archaic notions of patriotism and nationalism misunderstood and so forth.  There is a kind of mindless violence that struck the 19th century and one has only to read Conrad to grasp it.  That kind of unmotivated violence is coming closer to us; and to cope with that we need a police force which is pretty massively equipped and which should feel extremely well motivated in going about its daily duties.  Therefore, this is a step; but it is only a first step.  I suggest it be seen in that context and that, in fact, a restructuring, a rethinking of the whole role of the police force in our society is overdue.  In other words, I see this as a kind of piecemeal job. The larger and more philosophic operation of the police in our society at the present moment is something that should be urgently considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Lady Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the House to bear with me because this is my maiden speech and it will therefore be a short one.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill very much but I would like to ask one thing.  I agree that gardaí should not be members of a union but I believe they should have the right to strike.  I know this goes against a lot of what the other Senators have said, but if the gardaí feel they have the right to strike they are less likely to do so; and we would not be in a position like the Government across the water where the police say they are going to strike whether it is said they can or not. Within their association they should have the right to strike.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words in welcoming the Bill. Most of us realise that the provisions of the Bill are necessary.  Without <Col N="218" /> casting any reflection on the previous Minister for Justice, the Government and the Minister inherited a lot of problems and discontent in the Garda force.  For that reason we should all be associated with welcoming the Bill.  It will provide the gardaí with an association they can consult and negotiate with.  It can only do good.</P>
      <P>I should like to say something about what I consider to be a special problem in Border areas.  In spite of the fact that the restrictions imposed in the 1924 Act are unacceptable to the gardaí it should be remembered that the restrictions imposed on the gardaí in Border areas were not intended in the 1924 Act.  However, they were not covered in this amendment to that Act.</P>
      <P>I shall give the House an idea of those restrictions.  Senators will realise that Border duty for a garda is part of his normal service in the force.  It takes him up to the Border counties.  Many of those policemen come from towns with a population of about say a town of equivalent size in Cork 2,000 people and five gardaí and a sergeant. In the Border towns they work from stations that have 25 gardaí and five sergeants.  There are restrictions imposed on those gardaí in so far as they have to go out around the neighbourhood, around the general public almost to the point of harassing them because they are asked to produce results in traffic offences.  The chances of one being charged with a minor offence in Border counties are more than five times greater than they are in the rest of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is bringing about a lot of disquiet among the gardaí themselves. They are under a lot of pressure and there are restrictions and pressures being put on them that are not applicable to the rest of the country.  The end result of that does not bring about the desired effect in so far as the gardaí, who depend largely on the public in the execution of their duty regardless of what part of the country they are in, have to deliver summonses for minor offences to farmers and so on.  If they meet somebody who has not a vehicle properly lighted they must issue a sheaf of summonses.  However, the gardaí must often go back to those <Col N="219" /> houses and talk to the same people seeking information in connection with more serious crimes.</P>
    <P>The restrictions and pressures put on the gardaí are self-defeating in so far as they cannot do any country work without the help and support of the community.  In the Border counties we have a serious problem in this regard. It is certainly an area of great disquiet. Most gardaí must face the problem.  A special note should be taken of this. The gardaí should not be asked to persecute the public in Border counties. Some better method of approach should be adopted.  It is most unreasonable that the present state of affairs should be allowed to exist.  I am hopeful that with the introduction of these new methods the Minister will see fit to examine that area of complaint and see that a reasonable system applies in future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make one short contribution to the debate.  I hope there has been some attempt made over the last few years with the increase in the complexity of commerce and industry here to develop what is popularly known as the Fraud Squad, and the skill of that squad.  It is very important for the reputation of our society that there be machinery to swiftly and effectively get through the complexities that often have to be got through to discover who it was that was responsible for the frauds that lie behind some quite notorious insolvencies. It is important that the people who perpetrate crimes far more damaging and graver than those who commit petty thefts from shops or lift goods from shops or engage in embezzlement, where they are all too certain to be found out, are brought to justice for the sake of the reputation of our society and to protect the innocent people &mdash;sometimes ultimately very small people whose savings are destroyed by those concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope there is a section of the force where such skills are being developed, as they must be developed, to cope with the kind of investigations which need to be carried out quickly.  I have in mind the kind of investigations which can be carried out efficiently, for <Col N="220" /> example, by the Revenue Commissioners where there are any kind of customs and excise or value-added tax type of frauds.  They have available expertise which can get readily and quickly to the heart of the complex matter to the perpetrators of the frauds concerned.  That is my only contribution to this debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the reservations expressed here by speakers in regard to the negotiating rights of the new body and, in particular, with their reservations expressed in connection with the right to go on strike.  The negotiators on both sides have done a good job for the State.  We have at last found agreement between the Garda Síochána and the relevant Department on matters which were festering over a long number of years.  The fact that they have only come to head now is something which we all have to be thankful for.  Over the years many felt that the Garda were under attack from many sides, that they were not getting support from the Department or from the public Because they felt they did not have the proper negotiating rights they were becoming distressed, and this distress was creeping into the feeling of malaise Senator Robinson spoke about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A happy Garda force is what we need here.  If we go along with this Bill we can get such a happy force.  The negotiating rights are there now.  They negotiated with the Department a set of rules they agree with.  Mention has been made of the PR arrangements within the Garda.  We do not use the Garda too often as a PR instrument. How often do we see Garda superintendents going to our schools?  How often do we see them going to social functions in uniform?  This does not happen too often.  Because we often meet gardaí in stress situations we become afraid of them.  Children first see a garda when he goes to their school to check up on the roll book. He goes in there in a stress situation. If they paid regular visits to schools and institutions of all descriptions and talked about the work and problems of the Garda we might not have as many problems as there seem to be at <Col N="221" /> present.  Gardaí should be proud of the uniform they wear, and we should be proud of it also.  If they are attending social functions they should attend in uniform.  A dress uniform such as the Army have should be available to them.  Why should we be ashamed of having gardaí in uniform at our functions?  They are the guardians of the State just as the Army are.  Better use could be made by the public of the gardaí as PR agents for the force.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made also of the training received.  Over the years there has been little change in the length of time Garda recruits spend in training. However, I have not seen any great deterioration in the functions carried out by the gardaí.  They come on the streets better able to perform their duties than they were in the past.  The training they are getting must be of a high quality.  The training they get when they go to their stations is often forgotten about.  The practical training and advice they get from senior officers within the force is part of their training also.  Having spent some time on practical work there should be a college for further training in specific areas.</P>
    <P>The question has been raised about the housing of gardaí in NBA houses. This is a festering sore that will continue until something is done about it. Not alone have the gardaí not got the right to purchase their houses, which every other citizen in the country has, but they find that too often they are waiting for years to have repairs carried out.  The condition of these houses is often in complete contrast to that of the other houses in the area.  In certain areas the fronts of houses have not been painted for years.  This leads to a lessening of the feeling that the gardaí are people who deserve recognition in society.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a welcome one.  It should have the support of everybody.  The Garda Síochána have worked very hard through the years.  Their conditions are difficult because they generally meet people in stressful situations. Anything that can be done to enhance their working and living conditions should be agreed by everybody.  Having <Col N="222" /> said that, I sincerely hope that it will not be the year 2024 before the next Bill comes before the House for amendments to be made in Garda conditions.  It is ludicrous not to have had a change since 1924 in our evolving society.  I sincerely hope that if the necessity arises we will have changes.</P>

      <P>Following custom I should like to congratulate the Minister on his appointment and, since he is here, I congratulate Deputy D. Andrews on his appointment as Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
      <P>Obviously this Bill is the result of protracted negotiations.  Senator Cooney must be congratulated for the successful outcome of these negotiations which appears before us in the form of this Bill.</P>
      <P>Society relies enormously on the Garda.  We ask them, in effect, to do the dirty work of society.  We ask them also to be public relations officers, social workers, brilliant detectives, guardians of the peace and very many other things which have been mentioned by other Senators.  They are in effect, asked to preserve our whole way of life.  We also ask them to be models for our children to respect but not to fear and to turn the other cheek if they are mercilessly provoked, which they are in many cases&mdash;and then we ask them to waive the right to strike</P>
      <P>I had the honour recently to speak at a meeting of the Irish Medical Union in Galway.  I had a long chat with a juvenile liaison officer of the Garda who works in the Dublin city centre area.  He said that more than 50 per cent of their work was social work for which they were not trained. Twenty-two weeks in Templemore of physical training and instruction is not training for social work.  Social workers come from universities with three or four years of practical and theoretical training behind them.  This is not fair either to the gardaí or to the people they have to deal with while doing their work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From what has been said here today and from what I hear in many areas, it is clear that a big question mark hangs over the whole training of the Garda.  Something will have <Col N="223" /> to be done about examining that system, for the sake of the Garda and for the sake of society.  Irish society, like many other societies in Western Europe, undervalue certain professions. Nurses and teachers are undervalued. I certainly think the police force is undervalued.  Teachers have the right to strike, though it is circumscribed to a certain extent.  Nurses, as has been pointed out, rarely use this right to strike.  I sometimes wonder if it is because they are women and less ready to let down weaker sections of society.</P>
    <P>We make enormous demands on the Garda.  We put them on a pedestal.  I disagree with Senator Lady Goulding, because we cannot give the Garda the right to strike.  It is not possible.  But because we cannot give them this right which other sections of society have it places a much more severe responsibility on Members of the Oireachtas. We must give the force every possible encouragement in terms of money and housing&mdash;it is a disgrace that they should have housing problems&mdash;and in terms of helping to modernise and vitalise the training system and, most of all, by letting them have the right kind of modern associations.  We must encourage a continuing increase in the self-regard of the gardaí themselves, and in their concern for standards.  We depend on their standards for a safe and civilised community.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill because anything which updates the very outmoded machinery concerning the Garda must be welcomed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. D. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am taken somewhat by surprise here, but on behalf of the Minister I understand I am to conclude briefly.  He specifically asked me to thank the various Senators who paid tribute to him on his appointment as Minister for Justice.  He has asked me to thank them for their kind remarks and I also thank those who remarked upon my own appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to congratulate those people who spoke in the Seanad for the first time.  I realise how difficult <Col N="224" /> it is to stand up and make one's maiden speech.  Nevertheless, the maiden speeches were to the point and brief.  This might be adopted as a guideline for future speeches.  The content of a speech is not necessarily measured by the length of it but in many instances by its brevity.</P>
    <P>The conciliation machinery under the Garda Síochána Bill, 1977, has been well outlined by the Minister in his introductory remarks.  I do not think there is any need for me to go over what he has already stated.  It is well to place on the record of the House the general unanimity expressed in relation to the work being done by the Garda Síochána.  As has been stated, they are a force who in general receive the support of the public and it is proper that they should receive that support.  They have the almost unanimous respect of our population, except for a small element in our society who would wish to destroy both the Garda Síochána themselves and the society which the Garda are protecting.  It is important to remember that the Garda Síochána remain as an unarmed force.  It is proper that that should be so.</P>
    <P>In regard to the matter of increasing the Garda force, I understand that the previous Government gave approval for increasing the strength of the Garda Síochána by 500.  The present Government, in addition to continuing on with the induction of the 500 approved by the previous administration, have also given approval for another 500.  We will see over the next 12 months the induction of over 1,000 men into the Garda force.  This will give considerable encouragement to our society.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  For the Senator's information, 500 and 500 make 1,000, according to my mathematics.</P>
      <P>The matter of the consultants' report was also raised.  The problem there is due to staffing problems in the Department.  This is a matter which will also be dealt with in the near future.  The question of official living accommodation is also the subject of discussion and negotiation under the conciliation and arbitration scheme. The House will agree it is proper that the Garda Síochána should receive the full support of the taxpayer in giving them proper living accommodation. The type of accommodation they will get is the subject of discussion and negotiation under the conciliation and arbitration scheme.</P>
      <P>Senator Cooney made the following main points.  He paid a tribute to those who have taken part in the negotiations and I have no doubt I speak on behalf of the Minister when I add my own words to the tribute he has already paid in that regard.  There was reference to structures for discussion of principles of transfers, promotions and discipline.  These are matters which are involved in ongoing discussions.</P>
      <P>Concerning the loyalty of the force, I do not think anybody in this House has ever questioned the loyalty of the Garda Síochána.  Their loyalty to the State has never been in question and it never will be in question.  This is a matter of ascertainable fact.  The question of a police authority has been raised.  The Bill under discussion will effectively take care of that aspect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty is that the Minister had to go out and take <Col N="227" /> a very urgent call.  I was here in &ldquo;a wait and-see&rdquo; role and in the circumstances the Senator will recognise my predicament.</P>
      <P>Senator Murphy raised the question of clerical posts in the force.  This will fall to be discussed in the consultants' report.  The consultants are recommending substantial civilianisation but this will be a matter for discussion with the Commissioner and the representative body.</P>
      <P>I understand Senator Cranitch addressed the House as Gaeilge and he raised the question of Garda training. This is a matter which the committee representing Garda management, district justices and the representative bodies are looking at.</P>
      <P>Regarding Senator Howard's question, this is a matter of equipment and staff.</P>
      <P>On the question of supression of crime the Government are completely committed.  The indication by me, on the Minister's behalf that we are inducting 1,000 men into the force will make a significant contribution to the reduction in crime.</P>
      <P>Concerning banks and organised crime, from my personal experience I understand the banks are pouring quite a lot of money into the whole question of protecting their own institutions.  On behalf of the Minister I would encourage them to do their best in that respect.  The banks cannot expect to have a garda standing outside each individual branch or sub-office.  They do not expect that and the taxpayer would not expect it either.  I would recommend the banks to do as much as they can to provide protection for their staffs and buildings.  I consider their efforts to suppress the criminal element in our society to be an aid to the Garda Síochána.  There have been quite a number of bank raids in the recent past and one can only deplore them.  Once more I ask the banking institutions concerned to adopt as many protection measures as they possibly can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda Band and Choir were mentioned.  I was not present but I am sure the general tenor of the contributions was to pay tribute to them. <Col N="228" /> Apart from the musical merit of the Garda Band and Choir, they are doing a first-class job in public relations on behalf of the Garda.  I have seen them and other Senators have also seen them at various public functions.  They are deeply appreciated by the general public.  I cannot pay any higher tribute to them than the type of appreciation they receive when they appear in public.</P>
    <P>Senator Martin made the point that in recognition of the fact that the gardaí cannot go on strike we should be generous in our approach to their pay and conditions.  Senator Martin can rest assured.  I believe the gardaí do not want to go on strike.  They are not strike-orientated; they recognise their duty to the State and to protect the people.  The Garda Síochána are a professional group of people whose duty is uppermost and their personal viewpoint comes second.  This is as it should be.  They have always regarded service to the State as being their priority and subjugated their personal views as to whether they should strike. They simply do not want the right to strike.</P>

    <P>Regarding Senator McGowan's suggestion that gardaí in Border areas are under strong pressure from the authorities to bring summonses for minor offences, thus diverting their attention from important duties and bringing them into conflict with local people on whose co-operation they depend, I understand the Minister is not aware of this problem.  I give the Senator my undertaking that I will bring this matter to the attention of the Minister.  I am sure the Minister will then have a discussion with the Commissioner.  I should not like it to be imagined that there is any conflict of views between the gardaí on Border area duty and <Col N="230" /> the local people.

    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask a question in regard to section 1 (5). The Minister retains for himself the power of veto over the forms of association which the new body may make with outside bodies.  I am disturbed over the word &ldquo;association&rdquo;. Perhaps the Minister would explain whether he would prohibit the Garda association seeking advice from a trade union affiliated to the Congress of Trade Unions or other such labour associations?</P>

      <P>I apologise to the House for my absence.  I also apologise to the Parliamentary Secretary, who had to stand in at the last minute, for being prepared to do so.  I thank the Members of the House for not teasing him more than they did.  In an effort to keep everything in order, I suggest to Senator Cooney that at some stage he <Col N="232" /> might ask me the question which Deputy Andrews tried to answer.  Perhaps I could answer it better.</P>
      <P>With regard to Senator Markey I had hoped to reply to the point made by him in the course of the Second Stage.  I understand that he considers the wording of subsection (5) of that section to be too restrictive and would like an assurance that it would not be applied in a restrictive way.  I understand there is common ground between the Department and the representative bodies about the intentions of this section.  It certainly will not be used in any arbitrial discriminatory fashion and this is accepted by the representative bodies.  On the question of affiliation of any individual association, that is something which will be judged on its merits at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears therefore to me that each particular occasion on which the Garda representative association were submitting a claim, whatever it might be, if they wished to obtain outside assistance or help or consultation with an outside body, they would have to go to the Minister on each occasion to seek his approval, or is it the Minister's intention to give blanket approval in advance to the various bodies which they could consult with?  It seems to me a bit restrictive that the negotiating members of the Garda association must on each occasion seek the Minister's approval to consult with outside bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>As it stands, with regard to having liaison with any outside organisations, they would have to come to the Minister of the day, but again the bodies involved are quite satisfied that this is not any restriction whatsoever on them and they are quite satisfied that this is workable as far as they are concerned.  I think it will lead to a certain amount of friction. Might I assure the Senator that in line with what was said by a Senator earlier, this Bill has to do with the Garda Síochána and that the Government of the day, and indeed the Oireachtas of the day, would want to bend over backwards to help the Garda Síochána at all times to cooperate <Col N="233" /> with them and help them in every way rather than put obstacles in their way.  We all hope that the goodwill already there will continue to be there.  We will do everything we can to keep it there.</P>

      <P>In particular, on subsection (3), which expressly prohibits the Garda Síochána from becoming members of a trade union, there was a certain amount of confusion when the Parliamentary Secretary was replying to the Second Reading.  He seemed to be unaware that there had been an original application for trade union status, and my attempts to draw his attention to this lead to a certain exchange.  I had sympathy for the Parliamentary Secretary, who was thrown in at the deep end, but I would welcome some further comment from the Minister himself on the question of whether in the long term it might be possible to give full freedom of association to the Garda.  I should be obliged if he would respond to some of the comments that have been made by other Senators on this point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only apologise to the Senator and to the Parliamentary Secretary for any misunderstanding that might have arisen between them.  The position with regard to section 3 about having trade union status is that the Government are agreed that this is something that is not on.  The previous Government, of which the Senator's party were part, agreed that that was not on.  The Garda representative bodies themselves agreed that they were not pushing for this.  They are quite happy, and as long as everybody is happy we have a contented force and we can let them get on with the job that they want to do and that we want them to do.</P>

I asked whether the associations could affiliate with a trade union. Subsection (3) deals with the individual <Col N="234" /> rather than the association and I am wondering does that debar the association, or is there anything contained in that section that debars the association from becoming affiliated to a trade union?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn) Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The <Col N="235" /> purpose of this Bill is to enable The Stock Exchange to introduce a computerised and more efficient stock settlement system.</P>
      <P>Before dealing with the Bill, I should like to say something about The Stock Exchange and its operations.  This, I trust, will help Senators to see the Bill in its proper setting.  Senators will be aware that in 1973 stock exchanges in this country and the United Kingdom were amalgamated to form a single stock exchange to improve standards and to give a better service to investors. The single stock exchange serving both territories is called The Stock Exchange. The separate stock exchanges which existed before the amalgamation are now local administrative units of The Stock Exchange.  For example, what used to be the Irish Stock Exchange, and now called The Stock Exchange&mdash;Irish, is the administrative unit in Ireland of The Stock Exchange. Of course, The Stock Exchange&mdash;Irish holds a special position in a number of respects under the amalgamation arrangement.  For example, that Irish brokers continue as before to deal in Irish securities, on a broker to broker basis without the intervention of a jobber, on the floor of The Stock Exchange&mdash;Irish in Anglesea Street.</P>
      <P>The Stock Exchange usually operates a two-week dealing period during which deals or bargains to sell and buy securities are made but not settled. Settlement is effected during the settlement period which follows.  I do not intend to delve into the intricacies of the settlement system in practice.  It is sufficient to say that, although this period runs for seven working days, most of the work is done towards the end of the period.  Thus, paper work such as splitting bought shares into bundles of sold shares, instructions for delivery, preparation of transfers and payments, are crammed into two or three days at the end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In most cases sellers of securities are obliged to sign open transfers because the ultimate buyers of those securities at the end of the dealing period are not yet known.  This has the disadvantage that sellers are reluctant to release their stock under an open transfer until the <Col N="236" /> very last moment because of risk of fraud or misappropriation.  This adds to the concentration of paper work at the end of the settlement period.  Taking The Stock Exchange as a whole, it is understood that during the settlement period more than half a million pieces of paper in the form of tickets&mdash;that is to say instructions for delivery&mdash;and transfer forms can pass around the stock market every fortnight in the paper chase necessary to link buyers and sellers.</P>
    <P>A system of such extent and complexity must obviously be costly and open to error, and the advantages which could accrue from computerising it are obvious.  However, it did not prove possible to devise a fully satisfactory computerised system which would handle the transactions involved in accordance with company law as it stands today, and the purpose of this Bill is to make some changes in the intermediate steps, without of course altering in any way the ultimate realities of transfer, so as to permit computerisation.</P>
    <P>Two points should be emphasised. The first is that the operation of Talisman, which is the name given to the new system of settlement is a matter for The Stock Exchange itself.  The main purpose of the Bill is merely to make technical adaptations of the law to enable the system to operate.</P>
    <P>The second thing which I wish to emphasise is that the new system which this Bill will authorise is not concerned with the procedure for dealing or making bargains on The Stock Exchange but with the system of settlement which takes place afterwards; that is to say, the paper work by which sales and purchases of securities are matched up, payments made and transfers completed.</P>
    <P>Central to the new settlement system is a nominee company of The Stock Exchange called SEPON Ltd.  Under the new system, bargains to buy and sell will continue to be made in the usual way, but instead of the seller legally transferring title in the securities to the buyer he will transfer it to SEPON.  The seller will, however, retain beneficial rights attaching to the securities until he is paid.  SEPON will <Col N="237" /> hold the securities transferred to them in a central &ldquo;pool&rdquo; of stock on behalf of sellers until the settlement period when securities will normally be transferred out of the pool to the various purchasers to satisfy purchase bargains.</P>
    <P>The Stock Exchange will also maintain computerised records of all holdings by SEPON of the securities of companies participating in the system. Talisman will eliminate much of the paper work already described and will level out the present peaks in workloads.</P>
    <P>The transfer of securities to SEPON as opposed to the present system of a seller executing an open transfer will reduce the scope for mistakes or fraud and will thus encourage the early execution of transfers.  In this way transfer work will be spread out rather than being concentrated in the few days at the end of the settlement period.  I should add that the new system is not expected to have any effect on the volume of employment in The Stock Exchange&mdash;Irish or in stock-brokers' offices in this country.</P>
    <P>For investors, Talisman should mean less delay in obtaining certificates and also result in fewer mistakes in other areas such as the allocation of dividends in respect of shares in the process of transfer.</P>
    <P>There should also be benefits for professional company registrars, that is to say, those people whose profession it is to keep the records of other companies up-to-date and to prepare new certificates when existing holders of securities in the company sell them to someone else.  Under the present system a registrar can receive notification of transfers from a variety of brokers who have purchased on behalf of clients.</P>
    <P>Under the new system all communication will be through The Stock Exchange and most of the documentation relating to transfers will be computer produced in a standard format. Notifications to company registrars of transfers will be reduced to notifications from the Stock Exchange about transfers into SEPON and transfers out of SEPON.  In this way the work of registrars will be simplified.</P>
    <P>At this stage I would like to refer <Col N="238" /> to the question of confidentiality which can pose a problem for any computerised system.  Senators will wish to know that the Stock Exchange have taken care to build into Talisman safeguards to prevent unauthorised access to, or tampering with, confidential information. For obvious reasons the nature of these safeguards is not being disclosed.</P>
    <P>Before leaving the subject of Talisman, I should mention that gilts such as Government and local authority stocks will not be affected by Talisman. These types of security are paid for by cash immediately and do not fall within the delayed and complicated machinery of the settlement system which I have already described.  I should like now to pass on to the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>SEPON will merely act as a depository for shares in process of transfer and the size of their holdings in companies participating in the system will be constantly changing. Section 2 of the Bill will exempt companies from having to issue certificates in the name of SEPON in respect of transfers of securities into SEPON, as required by the Companies Act, 1963. Obviously it would be a mere waste of time to issue certificates in a transient situation of this kind.  Indeed it would be adding to rather than reducing the amount of paper work. Of course, once securities are transferred from SEPON to the buyer certificates in the name of the buyer will be prepared as usual.</P>
    <P>It is common for the articles of association of a company to require that share certificates must have the common seal of the company affixed in order for them to be valid.  Large companies frequently entrust registration work to an outside firm of professional registrars which, having prepared share certificates, for example, must return them to company headquarters to have them signed and sealed with the common seal.  This procedure can cause delays.</P>
    <P>In keeping with the objectives of speeding up the processing of documents relating to securities, section 3 will allow a company to have a special &ldquo;official&rdquo; seal which can be <Col N="239" /> entrusted to the company registrar for sealing certificates and transfer documents. The consequential amendments of the Companies Act are dealt with in section 5.  I feel that the use of the official seal could be a useful improvement generally.  For this reason sections 3 and 5 have general application and are not confined to the Talisman system.</P>
    <P>The new system will involve computerisation of some company records.  In particular it is envisaged that records, such as the register of members, will be kept on computer by some of the larger companies.  This will further simplify the work of registrars and speed up transfers.</P>
    <P>There is uncertainty as to whether company law permits the keeping of company records in non-legible form. Section 4 will remove any doubt that computerised records are acceptable, provided that they can be reproduced in legible form.  Although it was framed with Talisman particularly in mind, section 4 has a wider application so that modern methods of strong information, such as on computers, can be applied to the keeping of company records generally.</P>
    <P>Section 6 applies these amendments of company law, allowing for any necessary adaptations or modifications, to unregistered companies, that is, companies not formed or registered under the Companies Act but to which certain provisions of that Act apply.</P>
    <P>Under Talisman, sellers of securities will be encouraged to transfer title to SEPON in advance of payment and buyers to pay in advance of receiving title.  Strictly speaking, trustees and personal representatives dealing in this manner with securities held in trust could be chargeable with breach of trust.  Section 7 will remove this danger for trustees participating in Talisman.</P>
    <P>Talisman will involve the use of two new transfer forms: one for transferring securities to SEPON and another for transferring securities from SEPON.  The Stock Transfer Act, 1963, which is administered by the Minister for Finance, includes provisions which deal with stock transfer forms.  It will be necessary to <Col N="240" /> amend that Act to allow the use of the types of transfer forms which Talisman requires.  Section 8 provides for this.</P>
    <P>A considerable amount of capital has been raised on the stock market by the larger Irish companies.  Anything which can improve the service provided by The Stock Exchange can only be beneficial for Irish companies and investors.  Talisman is expected to achieve a considerable improvement over the present settlement system which has remained largely unchanged for about 100 years.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I first of all welcome the Parliamentary Secretary to this House.  I congratulate her on her appointment and on the introduction of that which, I believe, is her first Bill to the Oireachtas.  She has done very well if I, as an ancient and in a non-patronising way, may say so.  Having said that, I should now like to deal with the Bill.</P>
      <P>Nobody more than I can welcome the provisions of the Bill in so far as they improve the procedures of the Stock Exchange.  It is in that spirit that I approach this and if I have criticisms to make of the form of the Bill I would hope that they can be met in such a way as will delay as little as possible the achievement of something well worth while.  This is an exact copy of a similarly named Bill in the British Parliament, the only difference being the type of English that an English parliamentary draftsman uses and an Irish parliamentary draftsman uses, slight turns which in no way affect the points I have to make.  This Bill was enacted in the British Parliament on the 12th October, 1976.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must make my points on this by taking the sections as I find them. Although we have not been given the Companies Act as the Principal Act, in effect this is achieved to a considerable degree by subsection (3) of section 1 where any word or expression in the Bill is given the meaning assigned to it by the Act of 1963.  We then find in the first section&mdash;not a very important point&mdash;something referred to which is not given any meaning in the Companies <Col N="241" /> Act of 1963, that is to say, the Stock Exchange.  If it was the only point I had to make I would certainly sit down very quickly having made it, but the only reference that there is to the Stock Exchange in the Act of 1963 is to a recognised stock exchange, that is, one recognised by the Minister.</P>
    <P>This Bill is not one of a series which links it in such a way to the Act of 1963 that a step taken under the 1963 Act immediately identifies what is recognised under the 1963 Act by the ministerial regulation as being the Stock Exchange to which reference is made in this Bill, but we can look at the 1963 Companies Act for the purposes of determining what is a company, which is referred to throughout this Bill.  In the definition section of the 1963 Companies Act, any company means:</P>
    <P>a company formed and registered under this Act, or an existing company.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I would ask Senators to bear in mind when reading this Bill that every section in this Bill which refers to a company refers to every company existing before the Act of 1963, or registered under that Act.  That includes public companies as well as private companies.  I do not think that the phrase in section 1 (2), &ldquo;except where the context requires otherwise&rdquo; can be relied on to lift out of the category to which the Bill will apply public companies without quotations&mdash; and there are a number of them&mdash;public companies, some of which are quoted and others which are not&mdash;and there are a number of them&mdash;and the large number of companies which are not public at all and for which, it would seem to me, this Bill will have application and considerable consequences.</P>
    <P>I can make this point with regard to the fact that the words &ldquo;except where the context requires otherwise&rdquo; does not save the situation, by drawing attention to section 5 of the Bill.  Section 5 (2) substitutes a new regulation for Regulation 8 of Part I of Table A. That provision in Part I of Table A is the part which applies to public companies. Part II applies to private companies. <Col N="242" /> But if you look at Part II, you will find that certain regulations in Part I do not apply to private companies. One of the regulations which applies, which is not excluded from application, is Regulation 8.  Regulation 8 provides that if somebody, after we enact this Bill, does so, if he forms a company without putting in any articles, then the regulations of Part II as amended will apply to that company. That includes the provisions with regard to, for example, a seal which does not require to be signed or witnessed by the persons concerned.</P>
    <P>There is a large number of private companies in this country, unlike the UK&mdash;I do not know what the proportions are but, taking a rough guess it is nine to one, rather a reversal of the situation&mdash;for which it seems to me, this Bill has consequences that cannot have been intended by the Stock Exchange when it looked for this improvement which is involved in our designing a mechanism which I welcome.</P>
    <P>There are one or two questions I should like to ask with regard to SEDON Ltd.  It cannot have been necessary so to extend our company law that because certain quoted companies as well as The Stock Exchange will be facilitated in the registration of their quoted security, all the provisions of the Companies Act with regard to the various records that have to be kept should be abrogated and left over until this Bill is enacted and be dealt with by ministerial regulation, which should be the subject of a lengthy debate in this House as the provisions which it will be amending were sent to a Special Committee when the Companies Act, 1963, was enacted.</P>
    <P>The side note to section 4 refers to the use of computers for certain company records.  There is also a reference to section 378 of the 1963 Act.  The side note to section 378 reads: &ldquo;Former registers, minute book and books of account&rdquo;.  It is unthinkable that, even in the case of large public companies with outside registrars handling their affairs, it is intended that the minute books of general meetings should be computerised, to make available more information about the company to the <Col N="243" /> members of the company, and in certain cases to persons who are not members of the company.  That does not follow as a necessary consequence of our passing a short Bill which will facilitate the rapid computerisation of the Stock Exchange performance, giving them what they want and taking our time to deal with any of those cases &mdash;how many of them there may be I do not know&mdash;where the dealings are so large the computerisation ought to be provided.  Where computerisation is being provided, we ought to have exact provisions before us to see what needs to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>It is the question of who is on the register that is important.  The question of the register being kept up to date with directors dealings in shares is important.  The fact that the register should be available at the annual general meeting for inspection by shareholders is important.  How that is all going to be done I do not know.  This Bill ought not to apply either to the securities of a public company which are not quoted&mdash;and there are many such companies&mdash;or to a public company whose securities are not quoted or to a private company where there is no question of quotation involved at all.</P>
    <P>Quite apart from this question of Parliament dealing with the adaptation of our statutory law to deal with the effects of computerisation of records, the provisions of this Bill ought to be looked at to see whether they can stand up at all.  To take one example, I direct the House's attention to section 4 (1) (2).  Subsection (1) provides for the power conferred on a company by section 378 (1) of the 1963 Act to keep a register or other record.  This is the language of the UK draftsmen. It is not such a power because it is a power to keep in bound books or record in any other manner certain things that the Act obliges them to keep.  We are not talking about a power.  We are talking about a facility for the performance of duties which are cast on directors and secretaries for excellent reasons.</P>
    <P>I attach little importance to this matter of registration because I had a <Col N="244" /> client many years ago who was a joint owner of a company here when war broke out and he went off home to Germany.  He came back in 1948 and found he was no longer joint owner of the company, that something remarkable had happened in the intervening ten years.  The shares had been transferred to his partner's wife.  So the question of the state of the register which recorded this transaction raised interesting legal questions because the register was <i>prima facie</i> evidence that the transfer was correct and we had the serious responsibility of trying to prove that he had not done something which gave rise to the entry in the register, the transfer being conveniently lost in the intervening ten years. These matters do happen, in private companies in particular.  People can get defrauded in a manner other than the frauds to which the Parliamentary Secretary referred to in her opening speech address and we must see that they are duly protected.</P>
    <P>Section 4 (1) includes the power to keep the register or other record by recording the matters in question otherwise than in a legible form so long as the recording is capable of being reproduced in a legible form. Fair enough, where we are dealing with the appropriate type of company with the appropriate type of security.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2), which contains no reference to subsection (1) reads:</P>
    <P>Any provision of an instrument made by a company before the commencement of this Act which requires a register of holders of debentures of the company to be kept in a legible form&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>This is a requirement of the Companies Act, 1963.</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;shall be construed as requiring the register to be kept in a legible or non-legible form.</P>
    <P>It does not say, as it might surely have done, so long as the recording is capable of being produced in a legible form. If it is going to discharge the duty of keeping a register to make illegible entries under subsection (2), this is going to make nonsense of the provision of the Act which requires that the register be kept properly and be <Col N="245" /> capable of being construed by the attending the annual general meeting when he wants to find out what were the directors doing it in the last 12 months, or whatever he may want to find out.</P>
    <P>I refer in particular again to subsection (1) which proposes to give the Minister power to make regulations modifying the provisions of the Act of 1963 relating to such registers or other records mentioned in subsection (3).  That power ought not be given to the Minister: the power to modify under this Bill the provisions of another Act by a regulation.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, I would have thought that some provision ought to have been in this Bill, from a stock exchange point of view, which would entitle a company which kept a seal abroad under section 41 to have a security seal as well.  There are many provisions in the Companies Act which apply, such as transfers of personal representatives, registration of transfer, requested transfer or notice of refusal to register transfer, certificates of transfers, various duties about transferring, including the fiscal duty on the secretary and on the Board of Directors to see that the proper stamp duty is paid, rights of inspections of registered debenture holders; registered members and rights of inspection, lists of shareholders, of directors and their spouses and children and so on.  If all these matters are to be modified they ought to be modified by us in debate in this House and not be left to the Minister for determination by regulation. It is like this because it is a rather intimidating task to undertake to do it.  To make provision for the computerisation of the records of public companies we should do what the title of the Bill says, provide for the simplification of certain activities connected with the periodic completion of bargains made on the Stock Exchange.  For that purpose, and for no other, we should amend and extend the Companies Act, not to provide for any other connected matters.  The improvement of stock exchange transactions and the provision for the computerisation of company records <Col N="246" /> in six to 12 companies that may be affected are entirely different matters. We ought not to be making a widespread amendment of our company law for the sake of a half dozen to a dozen companies.  If there is need, as there was in 1963 after a gap of 55 years, for looseleaf minute books, public companies that want to computerise their records ought to stagger on for a few more months until we have appropriate provisions before us to deal with them.</P>
    <P>This Bill should only deal with the mechanisation of the stock exchange and the improvement of the transactions. I do not think there ought to be, without full consideration, any relaxation of the obligations on companies other than those which are absolutely necessary to make that possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome and congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary.  I welcome this Bill which is a necessary and timely measure.  As the Parliamentary Secretary has indicated, we do not now have a separate Irish stock exchange. We have the Stock Exchange&mdash;Irish, which is part of the general stock exchange covering these islands.  But it is in many ways an independent unit but one which must, if its value is to be maintained, have a close relationship with London and other parts of the Stock Exchange.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Admittedly, the number of transactions which take place in Dublin are relatively few compared with London. Nonetheless, they are extremely important. It is a key section of our business and financial institutions.  It is one which has played a very important role in the origin and development of many of our companies.  It is highly necessary that we maintain this stock exchange in an active manner.  One of the busiest parts of the stock exchange in recent years has been the gilt edge market, and it does not come within this Bill.  The general sections of the stock exchange must come within it. It is necessary that stock exchange records and transactions be speeded up.  It is necessary in present circum-most terrified member of the public <Col N="247" /> stances that they should be computerised. We should bear in mind the very definite disadvantages of computers and I am sure this has been considered. It is possible for frauds to occur, and for there to be a certain lack of accountability once information is fed into a computer as compared with handwritten or typewritten records.  We must keep a wary eye on the situation.</P>
    <P>Many of the companies which the Stock Exchange&mdash;Irish has helped to develop and continues to support are very important in the Irish economy. They are, by their nature publicly quoted companies.  Many other companies, public companies and private, are not quoted on the stock exchange even though in many ways they may be modelled on the regulations pertaining to publicly quoted companies. We must be very careful to ensure that company records&mdash;the records of shareholders and of transactions&mdash;are available. The computerisation of company records may be very convenient in London, but if that is going to take place in Dublin, it should still be possible for ordinary shareholders and other interested parties to obtain this information readily without great expenses or inconvenience.</P>
    <P>In a Bill like this, which relates to happenings in Dublin and elsewhere it is difficult to co-ordinate all the features of it and, at the same time, co-ordinate the changes and implications of this Bill in relation to company law, which is a very complicated portion of the law.  I am sure that the interesting comments we have heard are worth close consideration.  I am sure they will be given great consideration by the Parliamentary Secretary and her advisers.</P>
    <P>The Stock Exchange&mdash;Irish plays a key role in our economy and I am glad to see the Minister taking this measure in relation to it.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary will assure me that the Government will continue to facilitate and support the continuance of an Irish stock exchange unit.  It is tremendously important from the point of view of our economic and political development that we have some degree of economic independence, that we <Col N="248" /> have our own financial institutions.  I welcome this necessary Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to extend a particularly warm welcome to the Parliamentary Secretary on her first occasion in both visiting the Seanad and introducing this Bill.  I do not claim to have expertise in the operation of the Stock Exchange, I am particularly indebted to Senator Alexis FitzGerald for his thoughtful and helpful analysis of the Bill.  I agree in large measure with the points he was making.  My contribution is very much as a lawyer looking at the way in which the Bill is framed.  It has been mentioned that it is an identical copy of a Bill introduced in the Westminster Parliament, but I understand that it was a Private Members' Bill introduced in the House of Lords rather than in the Commons.  It is interesting that we now have a Government Bill following a private initiative in Britain. Would that we could have more Private Members' Bills successfully going through this House as part of the inherited tradition from the Westminster Parliament.</P>
      <P>The Bill is strangely cast in achieving its objectives.  First of all, the Title is slightly difficult.  I wonder why &mdash;and I would welcome the view of the Parliamentary Secretary on this&mdash;it was not entitled a Company Law Stock Exchange (Completion of Bargains) Bill or some indication that, basically, what the Bill purports to do is to amend the Companies Act of 1963 and also make a minor amendment of the Stocks Transfer Act, 1963.</P>
      <P>As Senator Alexis FitzGerald has already pointed out, the Companies Act of 1963 is referred to and identified as the Act of 1963 in the interpretation section, section 1.  Then subsection (2) provides for a general interpretative link between this Bill and the Companies Act of 1963.  This could give rise to confusion and difficulty in interpreting these two measures together. This would be helped if the words &ldquo;company law&rdquo; were in the Title and if those dealing with it were alerted to the fact that they should examine the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill expressly amends several <Col N="249" /> sections of the Companies Act, 1963, as has already been outlined, and also empowers the Minister by regulation to make further adaptations.  I would go along with Senator Alexis FitzGerald is urging that the Bill be confined to the narrow purpose of improving and mechanising the inner working of the process of settlements within the Stock Exchange, and that the question of what amounts to a change in the whole area of company law be left to a Bill dealing with company law more expressly than this Bill does.  I understand that it will be necessary to introduce a measure of a form of company law to implement directives at European Community level and that, in a very short time we can expect a general Bill on several areas of reform of company law.  It would be appropriate to await that particular measure rather than to include a general provision of that sort in a technical Bill, the primary purpose of which is to improve the inner workings of the Stock Exchange with regard to the process of settlements after deals have been concluded.</P>
    <P>As I said, I speak very much as a lawyer who does not like the way in which this Bill is structured and who does not like the difficulties that might arise from a series of amendments to the Companies Act of 1963 and the giving of considerable powers to the Minister to make regulations in this area.  It is possible that, in all good faith, people might be unaware of the amendments.  I would have preferred if the title had been clearer and if the Bill were more confined in achieving its objectives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like the Bill.  I do not object to what it is trying to do, but I object to the way in which the changes are coming about.  I am very happy to welcome the Parliamentary Secretary.  It is somewhat intimidating for a bachelor to see a woman as Parliamentary Secretary, but it is very pleasant at the same time.  My main objection to the Bill, as referred to by the Parliamentary Secretary, is that there is now a single Stock Exchange and no independent Irish stock exchange. This is what has brought this Bill about.  There are some consequences which have been alluded to by <Col N="250" /> Senator Alexis FitzGerald.  We made a serious mistake, and it is going to affect our operations in this House. As far as I can see, there is no hope of any amendments to the Bill being accepted now that a similar Bill has been passed in the House of Commons. The difficulty is that the Stock Exchange is now completely under the control of the Council of the Stock Exchange operating in London.  So when they pass a measure in Britain we have got to follow suit, whether we like it or not.</P>
      <P>Senators FitzGerald and Robinson have both pointed out that there are problems, particularly in section 4 (3) and (4).  It might be much better for us if we did not interfere with our company law where it did not strictly refer to the completion of bargains, which is what this Bill sets out to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amalgamation of the Irish Stock Exchange with the British Stock Exchange took place in the general euphoria that accompanied the last boom.  Everybody except stockbrokers knows that after a boom there is a slump.  Whereas it may be of great benefit to us to row in and completely give up our autonomy when the boom is on with the British Stock Exchange, it could be very disadvantageous to us to have this situation when the slump is on.  Who is going to say that the British economy is going to keep booming?  Most economists that I know of do not have a very optimistic outlook on Britain's economic future. This is one reason why we should be very careful to guard the autonomy we have.  We spent the best part of 700 years trying to prove this point, then some years later we give away one important part of our financial autonomy by amalgamating our Stock Exchange with the British Stock Exchange. This has consequences.  I do not think the Parliamentary Secretary can accept any amendments to this Bill.  It is a ridiculous situation we are in.  If she can, where does that leave her if her job, as she sees it, is to produce a Bill which is a direct copy of what has gone through the House of Commons?  This will cause problems. I hope she will not take this attitude, but my fear is that she has <Col N="251" /> got to, that she has no option but to pass a Bill which is exactly the same as the Bill passed through the Westminster Parliament because we do not have our own stock exchange.  The Stock Exchange here must operate by the regulations which are made by the Council of the Stock Exchange.  I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary how many Irish members are on that council?  Do we have any say in this?</P>
    <P>Our Stock Exchange is a very small operation compared with the total British Stock Exchange.  Senator Conroy has referred to the Dublin Stock Exchange, but people tend to forget that there is one in Cork, and it has got to be highly regarded.  There is also a Stock Exchange in Belfast. Since these three Stock Exchanges are of the same scale and size and totally different in scale and size from the British Stock Exchange, it would be my hope that some day these three will get together and get out from under the great umbrella, particularly if and when problems occur in the British economy, as I think they are going to, maybe not in the short term because of North Sea oil but in the long term, and this will get us into a lot of trouble.</P>
    <P>On principle, I dislike seeing British legislation repeated verbatim.  I am not only anti-British but I am pro-Irish and I do not think that in these situations we should slavishly copy British legislation.  We are forced into this by the fact that our Stock Exchange is amalgamated.  This is my first point.</P>
    <P>I am against amalgamation as such. That has caused the situation.  It is a bad thing and a pity we have to have this legislation.  I am not all that sanguine about computerisation.  It is necessary, it is going to happen and we are going to have to produce legislation for it but my experience of computerisation has not been entirely happy.  My university colleague Senator Martin, will agree with me. We have just had a pretty rough experience of a major computerisation piece of our administration in the central admissions office which Senator <Col N="252" /> Martin can get up and curse roundly. Their great computerised system has been operating university entrance in the Republic just for this year and there has been utter chaos and confusion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator has just matriculated and they have turned him down.  We read about it in the newspaper today.  One hears the standard comment that once the computer comes all the problems will be solved. Let us get that out of our system. The computer is as good as the people who run it.  If one does not have a properly run system one can have absolute chaos and confusion.  It is right for the Stock Exchange to take this step but the idea that it is going to solve all the problems is a bit over optimistic.  It can introduce new problems as well as solve old ones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to another computerisation.  Senator Conroy, and the Parliamentary Secretary, have referred to the possibility of fraud. Computerisation lends to the possibility of even bigger frauds if one happens to get the right code.  I will illustrate this by a non-fraudulent but true story which occurred in one of the two universities in Dublin &mdash; it would be invidious to say which one. I have a great affection for both but only one pays me.  This university was handling the computer work for one of our five-year economic plans.  There was a lot of material to be put through the machine and an intrepid undergraduate student who worked in the computer laboratory late at night happened to pick up from the wastepaper basket the code into the computer core or the key to the whole machine.  He found he was able to print his way happily into every single programme being run on the machine.  When the Department of Finance got back the five-year plan every second or third page was headed with slogans such as: &ldquo;Long live Chairman Mao, capitalism is dead&rdquo; and so on.  Very amusing but it gives an illustration of <Col N="253" /> the fact that anybody who can get at the core or key to a computer system has pretty well unlimited power to do whatever he likes to the programmes being run by the computer at any time.  Let us be wary of that.  I can summarise that computers will lead to bigger and better frauds in the future. The fact the Parliamentary Secretary says that there are safeguards is reassuring but only partly so.  One can always get around any of these safeguards if one is sufficiently ingenious. This can easily happen.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the points made by Senator FitzGerald and Robinson.  As I understood it, Senator FitzGerald was worried about subsections (3) and (4) of section 4 which amend the Companies Act, 1963.  They are concerned with the way company records are kept but really have nothing to do with the Stock Exchange.  The Senators are right in the point they make and these two subsections should be deleted.  They should be left to an amending Companies Act which is to deal with company law and has nothing to do with the Stock Exchange.  Subsections (3) and (4) of section 4, have nothing to do with the Stock Exchange. We should not have to make an amendment of this nature at this time.  It should be left to a separate amending Bill because computerisation will lead to other necessary amendments of the Companies Act, 1963.</P>
    <P>We are involved in legislation here which really is not of our own making. It comes about because our Stock Exchange has given up its autonomy and given up its freedom.  It was a bad decision which the Stock Exchange made in the great boom time when everybody was euphoric about stock prices continually going up and never coming down.  We will reach a situation where we will have to try and get that autonomy back because our conditions are so different from those in Britain and they are likely to diverge even more.  We will regret the day when this amalgamation took place.  Because of this amalgamation we are faced with legislation which is an exact copy of the British legislation and I am not happy about that situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>Firstly, I should like to thank the many Senators who took part in the debate for their warm welcome to the House and to hope that on my frequent visits to the Upper House of the Oireachtas each visit will be as pleasant as this one has been so far.  Senator Alexis FitzGerald pointed out that there was a tremendous similarity between this Bill and one which was passed last year in the British Parliament.  I acknowledge that that is fair to say because that is the situation.  This Bill is similar to that passed by the British Parliament last year.  That is deliberately so because it is the same Stock Exchange, the same computer and the same holding company with which all of us are dealing.  Therefore, it is important that, in so far as possible, the law both in its legislative form and subsequent interpretation be as close as possible in both countries.</P>
      <P>The Senator made the point that the Bill refers to every company which is registered under the Act.  It does but Talisman will be used by quoted companies and sections 3, 4 and 5 of the Bill may be used by private companies if they so wish.  Section 4 is not mandatory, it is enabling and if companies do not want to computerise records they do not have to.  The Senator also said he found in section 1 the term &ldquo;Stock Exchange&rdquo; used instead of &ldquo;recognised Stock Exchange&rdquo;, as in the Companies Act.  It amounts to the same thing because the Stock Exchange was described for the purposes of the Companies Act but this Bill takes a more direct approach and names the Stock Exchange itself.</P>
      <P>Senator Conroy urged that the Government encourage continuance of the Stock Exchange &mdash; Irish, this being an administrative unit of the Stock Exchange. I hasten to assure him, that it is, and will continue to be, Government policy to encourage the continuance of the Stock Exchange&mdash; Irish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Robinson spoke about the Title of the Bill and wondered why it should not have been entitled a Companies Bill.  The reason is because the <Col N="255" /> Bill also deals with the Stock Transfer Act and the law on trustees.  It does not solely deal with the Companies Act.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson also made the point that the Bill should, perhaps, be more confined in its application.  It is not possible.  The Senator mentioned that a comprehensive Companies Bill would be coming before both Houses of the Oireachtas and that is so, but it is not possible at this stage to say how soon the Bill will be presented. In the circumstances it was felt that the opportunity should now be taken to allow companies generally to avail of computerisation if they find it useful.</P>
    <P>Senator West regretted the amalgamation of the Stock Exchanges.  While that may be a valid point for the Senator I must deal with the situation as I find it.  The position at present is that the Stock Exchanges have amalgamated and I propose to deal with that situation in this Bill.</P>

      <P>Senator West also asked about the membership of the Stock Exchange and of the council.  The membership of the Stock Exchange is 3,907 overall, of which 88 are Irish.  The governing body, called the council, has 46 members of which one is Irish.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has replied in a very fair way to my contribution but has left me with net point for consideration, that is, whether or not there should be an option given to private companies to use this type of recording or whether that option should be there for public companies without quotation.  At the moment I am disposed to be against that because we leave too wide a field open for treatment by ministerial regulation in the context of Irish companies.  For that reason I should like time to consider it, while not wishing to delay the Bill in any way and without assuring the House that I would put down amendments. One simple amendment would deal with the matter and there could be a discussion on it.  The text of the Bill would be largely unchanged except where the language of one or two points is capable of improvement.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>This legislation deals with an area of some significance for the future progress of the country, namely the role which science and technology can play in future economic and social developments. More specifically, the legislation is designed to facilitate the co-ordination and the promotion of science and technology both in the public sector and throughout the economy as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The origins of these proposals go back to the early 1960's when a conjoint exercise was undertaken by a research and technology survey team appointed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and working in association with OECD experts.  The aims of the exercise were to examine the existing state of research and technological development in the Irish economy, to <Col N="257" /> forecast the likely growth of these activities and to propose means by which science and technology could be applied to Irish economic and social development.  The report which emerged, now commonly referred to as the Lynch Report, recommended, <i>inter alia</i>, the establishment of a National Science Council.</P>
    <P>I digress to say that I was pleased to see that development because I happened to have been a member of the team which prepared the Lynch Report and I have a certain personal interest in its subsequent progress.  This council was set up in 1968 to advise the Government on science and technology and to promote co-ordination in scientific and technological activities in the country.  Since that time the council has carried out important and valuable work under a number of headings.  As a result, however, of its observation and experience during the course of its work the council became increasingly concerned that the national effort generally was not satisfactory; that there was a need for greatly improving the means whereby the contribution of science and technology to economic and social advances might more effectively be integrated into the totality of Government policy.  Arising from these conclusions the council undertook an examination of existing organisational structures for the performance, dissemination and use of science and technology in the public sector of the economy.</P>
    <P>Following the council's examination, a survey of science policy for Ireland was undertaken by OECD between 1971 and 1973.  In its report, the OECD recommended new mechanisms for the formulation and implementation of science policy and these were adopted by the council and subsequently submitted to and approved by the Government.  The main features of these new arrangements which are provided for in the legislation which I am presenting to the House are: a new National Board for Science and Technology, and a science budget.</P>
    <P>In adopting these proposals the Government has taken account of the clear correlation between science and <Col N="258" /> technology and economic and social development.  It is no coincidence that the countries which are the furthest forward in the development of science and technology are also those which are the most prosperous and have the highest living standards.  In order to emulate their achievements, the reduction, and the ultimate elimination of the science and technology gap between us and other developed countries has to be tackled.  This will require the proper organisation and rationalisation of our own national effort in science and technology.  It will necessitate the formulation of an appropriate policy at national level and the creation of mechanisms for the implementation of a policy which is effective and has a real cutting edge.  Such a policy must cover all areas of science, covering the most disparate elements such as nuclear research on the one hand and food technology on the other, and must also take account of the importance of fundamental research, which deserves attention not only for its own sake but also as the foundation on which applied science is built.</P>
    <P>Science and technology are dynamic and in a constant state of evolution. In the same way the related institutional mechanisms must be adapted and continually readapted to the changing needs of society.  The resources available to us for scientific and technological endeavour are of necessity limited.  It will be part of my function to improve this situation as far as possible.  Nevertheless it is inevitable that there will always be some limitation on funds and this situation will make it essential that our resources are so deployed that the community receives the best value from their use.</P>
    <P>Science and technology, as indeed all public activity in Ireland, was originally organised on a sectoral basis for good historic reasons.  It is beyond question that the contribution of the main institutes, notwithstanding limited availability of resources, has been immense.  These institutes were nevertheless founded, for the best of reasons at the time of founding, on a sectoral basis.  It is a fact, however, that sectoral divisions, arising from the development <Col N="259" /> and diversification of the economy, tend to inhibit the emergence of an overall fully integrated policy for science and technology.</P>
    <P>It is now time for a coordinated approach across sectoral boundaries. Such an approach can only produce increased benefits through rationalisation and concentration of resources and the interdisciplinary and inter-institutional build-up of expertise.</P>
    <P>It is also a fact that some of the areas of greatest economic promise fall largely between existing institutions and their development requires expertise and facilities which are largely scattered.  As an instance, I would refer to the marine area.  We need a means for ensuring that major gaps in our national coverage of science and technology, many of which overlap traditional economic sectors, are effectively filled.  This brings in the promotional aspect.  Allied to these needs for co-ordination and promotion is that of persuading the public and national policy makers and decision makers of the importance of the economic and social role of science and technology, so ensuring that their potential for contributing to national development is taken fully into account.</P>
    <P>It is the purpose of this legislation, to produce results by establishing more stable and permanent institutional arrangements for the formulation and implementation of a comprehensive national policy for science and technology and for harmonising and integrating the various strands which make it up.</P>
    <P>I now come to the first of the two main features of the new arrangements, namely the National Board for Science and Technology.  The main responsibility of the board will be to secure from the national effort in pure and applied science and in technology the most effective contribution towards economic and social development.  This end will be achieved by <i>inter alia</i>, providing, or promoting the provision of, the necessary mechanisms to achieve the various objectives of the national policy for science and technology.  I can hardly do better in this regard than quote from the recommendations of the <Col N="260" /> OECD in their review of national science policy for Ireland, who, I am happy to record, were in turn quoting from a document of our own National Science Council.  A national policy for science and technology should:</P>
    <P>...draw together all the various threads of scientific and technological activity in the community into a composite and integrated whole which would then be directed towards securing the optimum contribution towards economic and social development and the attainment of national goals.  It would, in particular, attempt to secure the most worthwhile contribution from scientific and technological activities in the public sector; it would seek to identify priority areas for such activities; it would indicate where there are gaps to be filled in such activities; it would suggest how to secure an advance across the whole spectrum of activities in the public sector; and it would recommend where incentives and other stimuli might be applied so that the private sector would also make the most effective contribution possible.</P>
    <P>To come down to the particular, the functions of the board are set out in, section 4 of the Bill.  This section begins with a composite statement of the board's functions, that is, to act under the Minister as a body having responsibility for the furtherance of science and technology.  It makes provision for continuance, obviously in a more expanded and comprehensive way, of the old National Science Council function of advising the Government on policy for science and technology.  It authorises the board to promote the co-ordination of investment in science and technology, taking due account of the position in the private sector.  It enables the board to provide and administer grants and other financial facilities.  This provision is a very important and indeed an essential part of the promotional activity of the board in relation to the filling of gaps not hitherto covered.</P>
    <P>Section 4 also provides for the general function of promoting research, covering the whole gamut from the <Col N="261" /> purest level to the most applied.  It highlights in an explicit way the relevance of the work of the board to economic and social development by authorising it to promote the application of science and technology to these objectives.  It again refers explicitly to the very important question of the development of natural resources and authorises the promotion of this objective through the application of science and technology.  The board is also authorised under this section to promote the appreciation of the value of science and technology in our society.  This is seen as a very important function designed to enable science and technology to flourish and to make their maximum contribution to the public good in a climate of acceptability and of appreciation of their importance.</P>
    <P>The particular functions of the board are also set out in section 4.  The most fundamental of these will be the preparation of a national programme for science and technology.  I must emphasise that it is not intended that this programme would be a static blueprint which would rapidly become obsolete.  It is intended that it will be a continually revised and updated agenda for all activity relating to science and technology in the public sector.  It will, in this way, serve a number of uses.  The board itself will require a basic point of reference for its own activities.  This will be provided by the national programme.  It will serve as a master plan which can be used to determine the direction of Government activity in the area of science and technology; it will act as a guide to individual institutions in the public sector, assisting them to formulate their own policies and to accommodate their own courses of action with overall national objectives; it can be an information source for institutions and firms in the private sector and assist them in making their own activities complementary to and compatible with programmes in the public sector; and it can be instrumental in helping to create an informed public awareness of science and technology in our national life.</P>
    <P>Section 4 also provides for a number of other functions of the board.  It <Col N="262" /> includes the all-important function of the coordination of activities related to science and technology by the various institutions and also the promotion of participation by them in such activities.  There is provision for the board itself to engage in activities but this is subject to approval by the Minister.  One of my own principal concerns in this regard will be that the board should not undertake activities which could more appropriately be carried out by another institution.  This section also contains the proviso that, the board shall not engage in or promote any activity of a primarily military relevance without the prior approval of the Government.</P>
    <P>A very important aspect of work in science and technology is the dissemination of its results, whether conducted here or elsewhere.  It is vitally important that this aspect should receive continual attention and the board is therefore enabled under this section to disseminate literature and information of relevance or to promote its dissemination by others.  A related provision to this is the one giving the board the function of organising seminars, conferences and so on.  Since science and technology do not recognise frontiers, provision for collaboration with bodies abroad is also included.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer specifically to the saver which appears in paragraph (b) of subsection (4) of section 4.  This provides that the teaching functions of any educational institute, college or school shall be deemed not to be restricted by any provisions of the Statute.  It is important to say in this connection that the board will, of course, be interacting with such institutions to the maximum extent possible. This will arise in a number of ways. for example, in relation to research activities from the fundamental level upwards; by way of the involvement of academics as members of the board, as members of the various committees which will assist the board or in carrying out tasks for the board in relation to international activities and related matters; by the participation by eductional institutions in collaborative work both with the board and with industry under programmes organised by <Col N="263" /> the board; by collaboration between the board and educational institutions in the matter of training and research, for example, under the oil scholarship arrangements.  In sum, it is envisaged that there will be the maximum inter-action between the board and educational institutions to the advantage of both.</P>
    <P>The concept of a science budget is new to this country but is quite well known on the Continent of Europe. Part of the board's responsibility will be to evolve a policy covering all aspects of scientific and technological activities and to present the Government with an overall and coherent basis for decisions influencing, <i>inter alia</i>, investment in scientific research and its extension into technological development.  I think it would be in order to again quote the OECD on this aspect:</P>
    <P>Choices should properly be made at national level.  Priorities should be established and respected by all sectors of scientific and technological activities funded with public money. Coordination should be improved and strengthened.  All this requires that quite specific recommendations, e.g. recommendations accompanied by figures, should be presented by the board to the Government.</P>
    <P>These are the considerations which have led the Government to decide that there should be a science budget.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill deals with this matter and directs the board to prepare a statement based as far as possible on the national programme for science and technology which the board is to devise and keep constantly under review under paragraph (b) of subsection (3) of Section 4, and including, in particular, the requirements and proposals of all institutions in receipt of money from the State and giving in addition the board's observations and recommendations on such requirements. This statement will be submitted to the Minister for Finance and will, of course, be available to other Ministers, and will be submitted to the Government. The final details of the financial allocations approved by the Government in respect of each institution will <Col N="264" /> be published together with a commentary by the board on the general position of national policy for science and technology, both from the points of view of conception and of implementation. These together will constitute the science budget for each financial year or such other period as may be found desirable from time to time.</P>
    <P>Among other advantages anticipated from the preparation and submission of the science budget will be the enabling of the requirements for science and technology to be presented for the first time as an entity, rather than as items scattered across various departmental Votes.  It is expected that more informed and effective decision-making by Government will result.  Worthwhile debates will also be facilitated in both Houses of the Oireachtas by the presentation to them of the science budget and I look forward to the contributions of the members of this House in this respect.</P>
    <P>I should emphasise that the system of voting money for activities in science and technology will not be changed. Funds will continue to be voted under the relevant Departmental Votes as at present.  The Dáil will, however, as a result of its consideration of the science budget from year to year, be in a much better position to offer informed comment on the provisions for science and technology within these Votes.  Equally, this House, on the basis of the information put before it in the science budget will be enabled to make a more meaningful contribution to the development of a national policy for science and technology.</P>
    <P>The science budget will, of course, also be a useful and valuable reference source, not only for the board itself in its work but for all other organisations and for the public generally.  An important function of the board is covered by section 6 which provides for a continuing review of the effectiveness of public investment in science and technology and also for the publication of the results of this review.</P>
    <P>Another important function is provided for in section 7.  Information will be the life blood of the activities of the board.  For the purposes of carrying <Col N="265" /> out its work, particularly under sections 4, 5, 6 and 8, the board will require ready and adequate access to information. There is provision, therefore, in section 7 for the obtaining by the board of such information as to enable it to carry out with full effect its function of advising the Government and individual Ministers, or co-ordinating and of making recommendations on financial allocations.  It will also facilitate the board in the exercise of its planning function in relation to preparing a national programme and the promotion of, or participation in, pilot activities.</P>
    <P>Section 8 gives the board general authority to institute and conduct research into, and studies on, problems relating to science and technology and to publish or disseminate these results.</P>
    <P>Section 9 provides for the appointment of the chairman and members of the board.  Views vary as to the ideal number of board members.  The OECD have recommended that the number should be less than the original membership of the National Science Council, which was 16.  If we endeavoured to cover all possible interests, a much larger number than this would very likely be required.  The best course would seem to be to strike a compromise between comprehensiveness and effectiveness and with this in mind ten members plus a chairman have been decided on.</P>
    <P>It should be emphasised, incidentally, that the board will be assisted by a number of committees. Provision for these is contained in section 23.  This section, in fact, empowers the board to delegate some of its functions to these committees but all acts of committees will be subject to the approval of the board itself.</P>
    <P>Sections 10 and 15 are standard provisions in relation to membership of the board, qualifications for membership and meetings and procedures of the board.  Special mention should perhaps be made of the spelling out in section 14 of the kind of interest which is obliged to be disclosed to the board by members.</P>
    <P>The main financial provisions are contained in sections 16 and 18 which provide respectively for the provision <Col N="266" /> of funds for the board out of Oireachtas grants and the use of these funds by the board in the course of their work.</P>
    <P>The remaining functions are standard in relation to most State-sponsored bodies and it is hardly necessary for me to go into detail at this stage so far as they are concerned. Special mention might perhaps be made of section 25 dealing with the prohibition on the disclosure of confidential information and also of section 27 dealing with staff.  This section authorises the board to appoint their own officers and servants.  Their remuneration and allowances will, however, be subject to the consent of the Minister for the Public Service.</P>
    <P>As Minister responsible for national policy for science and technology and for co-ordination, all science and technology and all scientific and technological activities will be my concern.  Equally they will be the concern of the new board at its own level.  The work of the board can be categorised into four main aspects. These will be advising the Government, co-ordinating, making recommendations on financial allocations, and promotional activities.</P>
    <P>I cannot emphasise strongly enough the positive nature of the approach which the board are intended to adopt. Their purpose will not be to invigilate or to inhibit but rather to encourage and to assist in the most positive way.  This positive approach will involve consultation, the formation of links, co-operation, joint action, inter-institutional and interdisciplinary activity and the smoothing out sectoral and demarcation problems, either by acting as arbiter or the bridging of demarcation lines and the organising of team efforts. Above all, the National Board for Science and Technology is intended to prepare the way for new activity seen to be important for economic and social development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>Fine Gael support this Bill introduced by the Minister.  I should like to speak very briefly about the history over the last year or two of this Bill, originally introduced by the previous Minister for Industry <Col N="267" /> and Commerce, Mr. Keating.  During the tenure of the last Dáil a committee was established to consider the details of the Bill.  We had a number of meetings which were of a very sensible and vocational nature, rather than political.  I am pleased to say that through those meetings there was a consensus in broad terms and I hope that the deliberations of the committee helped somewhat in the final production of the Bill which the Minister has now introduced.</P>
      <P>I should like to preface any further remarks by congratulating the Minister, as is customary, on his appointment by the Taoiseach to the Cabinet and to wish him very well in what is obviously a very important and fundamental area of national activity. I mean that quite sincerely.</P>
      <P>The issue on which we are speaking is a very vital one in this technological age, especially in a country such as ours which historically, has not been blessed in this area.</P>
      <P>We have had a great tradition of learning and of university education. To a great extent this has been in the arts.  In this age we are dependent on future economic well-being if we want progress in the social area.  An emphasis on science and technology is vital because it is self-evident that success lies in that area.  It is even more vital in the sense that in recent years we have been much more successful economically than we have ever been.  During the past 18 months or so we have had a huge increase in the level of exports of manufactured goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, there has been an overwhelming preponderance of activity by multi-national companies.  I do not want that remark to be interpreted as an inference that it is not welcome. Of course, it is extremely welcome and we are delighted that these companies with a scientific background have chosen this country as a location. But of greater interest still to this country is the type of indigenous native development based on Irish skills and know-how and on true fundamental science and technology within our own land.  We have not been blessed with that type of development, <Col N="268" /> and the co-ordinative approach of this board to cover the multitude of areas in which there is a degree of activity at present is very welcome.</P>
    <P>It is welcome as well in an educational sense because there are undesirable aspects to recent attitudes where education is concerned.  We have made great strides in education but one of the side effects of this has been an apparent desire among a great many people, parents in particular, to have their children educated in the arts and to see them graduate as doctors and teachers and get into this area rather than into the scientific field.  This attitude has been manifested in the various debates about third-level institutes and whether they should have the entitlement of calling themselves universities or national institutes or technological institutes.  In Norway and Sweden their institutes of technology rank as third-level institutes on a par with other third-level institutes.  We will have to graduate to this stage if we are to be sensible about development here.  Where education is concerned we will probably turn full circle on the wheel fairly soon and reach a very sad awakening when we see that there are so many people graduating in arts through universities who, despite qualifications on paper, are finding that there are far more graduates than there are jobs available in the traditional area of activities, such as in teaching, medicine and other fields. There will be a rude awakening when people discover that education in the scientific and technological field is where our future lies.  For that reason, on a personal level, I welcome the introduction of this Bill.  I speak for Fine Gael when I say that our party is pleased with the introduction of the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is important that the board, when established, should be practical in approach.  When considering areas of research and development and advising the Government on areas which should be funded to a greater extent there should be a very positive effort to relate the scientific work to the market place. The use of public funds will demand that this should happen.  Too often, for the layman &mdash; and I speak as a layman &mdash; science is baffling.  By definition <Col N="269" /> it has to be baffling to a layman and there tends to be an uneasy feeling among lay people that possibly the work is so esoteric that it is in the clouds and does not relate in any sense to the future well-being of the country. This feeling is especially strong when we are talking about public funds and taxation.  It should be a concern of the board to have an abiding interest in relating whatever work is done, regardless of how obscure it is &mdash; and there is a need for obscure work at times &mdash; to the economic well-being.  I have no doubt that has been said before, but it is no harm that it is on record in the Oireachitas regarding the establishment of the board.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that section 6 refers to this to an extent in that it allows for the review of the effectiveness of public investment in science and technology.  I trust that this will be taken as a very serious section of the Bill and will lead to satisfactory debates in the Oireachtas from time to time when the science budget is debated.</P>
    <P>From the Minister's speech it seems that the private sector may not be getting the recognition that I would like to see it getting in terms of attitude.  In the Minister's speech, he quotes from the OECD recommendations which, in turn, are quoted from a National Science Council definition:</P>
    <P>It would, in particular, attempt to secure the most worthwhile contribution for scientific and technological activities in the public sector.</P>
    <P>Later on in the same quotation it is stated:</P>
    <P>It would recommend where incentives and other stimuli might be applied so that the private sector would also make the most effective contribution possible.</P>
    <P>The use of words like &ldquo;also&rdquo; here is a denigration to a degree of the private sector.  In talking about a mixed economy which is balanced between a contribution from both the public and private sector I would hope that the board will be established against a background where, certainly, there is scope for major activity in the public sector, but there is equal rather than inferior scope for <Col N="270" /> the private sector.  I referred to the quotation by the Minister from a previous publication but the fact that he quoted it would imply his endorsement. I should like to see the public and private sectors as twin allies in this development.  It is a fundamental point.  In the State sector when boards such as this are established, there is a danger, if they feel that they have a mandate from the Minister or from Government to deploy their resources and to address their main consideration to a particular sector of the economy, that this could be damaging for the future activity of the board. To those interested in the well-being of the private sector it might not be entirely desirable.  It is worth clearing the air on that particular point. Perhaps in this debate the Minister would be good enough to refer to it.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that the Minister in his speech is very keen that this board should guard against the assuming of functions already performed in other areas.  I am certain that the Minister, by the definition of his function in Cabinet, will be very aware of the extent of duplication, that he will be working through the next few years to co-ordinate, in so far as it is possible, and doing a lot of necessary work in a very vital field.  In another capacity I would be very glad to debate with the Minister certain aspects of western development which do not relate in any sense to the topic which we are discussing here.  But that is for another day.</P>
    <P>We agree in principle with the establishment of a small board of ten people.  The woolliness and the clouded thinking that can result from the larger type of committee is very undesirable and this is a very acceptable number of people.  The Minister, in his speech, refers to the question of native resources, indigenous areas.  If we are establishing a priority for the use of funds, either directly by the board or by the various scientific semi-State bodies when they apply to the board and the Government, obviously these are the areas on which to concentrate. He is clearly aware of the main scope. In talking about indigenous areas we can have regard to human factors such as the extent of the labour pool and <Col N="271" /> considerations in relation to the type of development we should attract here.</P>
    <P>There is no reference whatever in the Minister's speech nor, indeed, in the previous Minister's speech, or the deliberations of the Committee, to the administrative structure of the board itself.</P>
    <P>There are generalisations about the extent to which the board are empowered to establish administrative structure.  It would be interesting to hear the Minister dwell briefly on what he feels, now that we are on the point of establishing such a board, what he sees as the initial administrative detail, and where we might go from there or where Government thinking lies at present in the sense that under the Bill the board have the function of engaging in certain areas of activity which require finance.  It would be interesting to hear to what extent the Government see this as an initial option which would be implemented by the board.</P>
    <P>A small point of detail in section 25 relates to a matter of considerable significance. We are talking about the question of prohibition of disclosure of confidential information.  In the normal area of activity, if we are talking about the Departments of Local Government or Social Welfare, this is not a major issue, but in relation to science and technology deliberations in thinking and fundamental research can lead to astonishing development in certain areas.  I am glad to see that there is a section dealing with this point but section 25 (2) is entirely inadequate and I do not remember in our committees deliberations having got this far.  I think we were unseated in Government before we got to section 25, but subsection (2) provides that a person who contravenes subsection (1) of the section shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £500.  I do not know what is the relevance of £500 in this age, having regard to the type of confidential information which we are talking about, the Minister might give some consideration to raising that amount, possibly quadrupling it.  Having regard to the value of confidential information in this important area, the sum of £500 is entirely inadequate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="272" /> I wish this board, on behalf of the Fine Gael Party, a useful contribution to Irish economic and social life in future and wish the Minister well in his own function.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelMulcahy" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome the Minister and to say how pleased I was to see the comprehensive lead in that he gave to the discussion. I think that this Bill will have far-reaching effects on our country as a whole and the National Science Council, which has worked on it over a decade and interacted with the OECD group, must be congratulated on giving us the outline which has now emerged in the form of this Bill.</P>
      <P>The first aspect that I would like to address is the notion of the science budget.  Some of the commentators who remarked about the condition of the fiaclóirí of the Minister might recognise now that the science budget incorporated in this Bill give him the teeth that, amongst other things, he will need in carrying out his portfolio as Minister for Economic Planning and Development.  As he said in his introduction, the science budget is a feature of the way things are run in other countries.  It is going to give us a chance to look at total expenditure across the scene without necessarily interfering with the autonomy of the various groups who will be carrying out the related work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very important principle of organisation.  I might draw attention to the fact that it is the same principle that the emerging industrial development consortium is based upon.  In other words, you do not necessarily have to set up a new body corporate at all times to get things done.  Sometimes you can, through proper and intelligent organisation of existing units, make better use of their power by providing co-ordinating mechanisms.  In the case of science and technology there is so much of the unknown in it, because you are dealing with research.  There is room in this case for a new body corporate containing the specialists that are required and therefore we have this new board.  It might be useful for the House to recall some of the points <Col N="273" /> made by the National Science Council in their January, 1973, report where they indicated the nature of the problem which this body is now being set up to deal with.  They said:</P>
    <P>In essence the problem is that Ireland has in large degree an industrial structure which is not conducive to the profitable assimilation of science and technology and the development of an Irish research and development capacity.  To deal with the coherent weaknesses of this situation and to offset the potential constraining effects on future industrial development, it is ait this stage possible to recommend that future policy should as far as possible embody action in relation to the following:</P>
    <P>The development of more specialised industrial sectors within Ireland which would have a genuine deep-seated comparative advantage&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>I will be coming back to this point of comparative advantage in a moment.</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;over foreign competitors in domestic and overseas markets.</P>
    <P>Have a high value added content from Ireland's point of view.</P>
    <P>Be organically connected to Ireland's resources, natural, human and material.</P>
    <P>Be based to the greatest extent possible on science and technology intensive operations.</P>
    <P>The strengthening of our resources of scientific and technical manpower and their location to the best advantage in industry.</P>
    <P>The strengthening of scientific information services on a national basis.</P>
    <P>Encouragement of mergers and deeper integration of Irish owned firms in areas where scale is important in exploiting science and technology.</P>
    <P>I do not make any real excuse for reading that into the record because it does indicate the extent of the problem and all we can do is wish the board well in dealing with those various issues raised by the NSC. Now the science budget, as I said at the opening of this part of my <Col N="274" /> address, will give the co-ordinating mechanism and will provide the instrument which will allow us in this House and the Dáil to address the extent to which we as a nation are dealing with those problems that have been outlined for us by the National Science Council.  You can see that in those statements the industrial aspect is highlighted and in agreement with my colleague, Senator Staunton, I would hope that the emphasis of the work of this board will be towards the application of knowledge already known rather than pure research.  But I am not excluding the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake in terms of pure research.</P>
    <P>I think that the Industrial Development Consortium idea, which I am sure we will have a chance to debate later, will contain people who are paid by the State on a full-time basis to pursue these policies, to develop them and to take the action required.  They will come together periodically under the person who has the ultimate power to energise that system, that is the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy, and clearly the Minister who is present here tonight will be working side by side with him.  The NBST will fill a big gap that exists at the moment in our ability to address the problems of co-ordination and will provide the analytical work required to be carried out in relation to the overall view of what is required in the economy.</P>
    <P>We have the IDA working in the industrial sector and we have the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards looking at other aspects of the application of technology in particular sectors.  I have always felt that to some extent the work of these bodies did not appear in a coherent plan, and we now look forward to this coming from the Minister and his instrument &mdash; the Board of Science and Technology.</P>
    <P>A question of co-ordination of course always raises some hares because bodies do not like to be coordinated &mdash; they like to be as free as possible and anybody looking over their shoulders tends to be looked at with some suspicion &mdash; but I think it <Col N="275" /> was Herman Kahn who said that &ldquo;people work better when they are watched&rdquo;.  This body might be able to do that with some sensitivity, as the Minister indicated in his introduction. Let us take the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards.  Let me say at the outset, this body do excellent work and require a great deal of resources to provide the type of experimental work that is required &mdash; the hands-on machinery type of work that we need and have been lacking here for some time &mdash; they have been doing excellent work in this area, but nevertheless recently it has come to our knowledge that in a special report, an analysis carried out by two eminent professors of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Alien <i>et alia</i> found that although the strategy of the IIRS was very clear and acceptable, they could find very little evidence in fact that it was being put into action. It would seem to me that the work of the IIRS, who would be still operating under the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy &mdash; this was discussed in the Dáil &mdash; could be looked at by this new board and in their over-view see if the right strategies are being followed by the IIRS and some of these other bodies in relation to our national aims.  In this case, &ldquo;national aims&rdquo; for me, as you will hear from me at various times, means 15,000 new jobs in manufacturing every year for the next ten years.</P>
    <P>The next point I wanted to develop in that regard was the question of research.  The point was already made, but I should like to add to it, that the emphasis in the work of the National Science Council should be an applied research rather than pure.  I think most people agree with that.  We are so far behind in the application of existing knowledge as far as technology particularly is concerned, that it is not funny. Where we have something to boast about is in the area of agriculture, where Foras Talúntais have made the necessary impact on the scene.  I must say that I get tremendous pleasure when I hear young farmers on the radio or on telvision discussing, in sophisticated and knowledgeable terms, horticultural <Col N="276" /> principles and how they are working in particular instances.  I do not know what the hell they are talking about, but they do, and that is the important thing.  They seem to be putting knowledge to work.  Our agricultural productivity might not be what we should like it to be, but I somehow or another have confidence in what is going on.  However when it comes to the area of technology I am not so sure.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the whole question of technology.  Economists have been debating for some time how comparative economic advantage works.  There seems to be a number of schools of thought.  There is the old Ricardo school following the idea that we are subject to nature, and that people in the north of Europe have certain advantages and people in the south have certain advantages.  So England produces clothes and Portugal produces wine.  We accepted that situation.  Then we had a development from people like Samuelson who held that capital investment takes place and accumulates in the right way eventually produces growth in economic wealth and provides the solution in developing nations.  Both of these seem to have excluded &mdash; not completely, not giving sufficient emphasis &mdash; the role of technology and technology if I can quote Professor Jackson the Chicago economist:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Technology&rdquo; as a source of comparative advantage is not as some writers and commentators on trade and trade policy seem to believe a free good capriciously and invidiously distributed by nature among the nations of the world.  Technology is a capital good, or investment good, produced by the investment over time of material resources that yield their returns over further time.</P>
    <P>Technology can be translated from one country to another.  Technology, unlike the natural climatic conditions of the Ricardo model, can be both moved from one location to another and accumulated or decumulated.  Again Jackson states that:</P>
    <P>Technology by its nature is capable of being taught to and learned by large numbers of young adult <Col N="277" /> human being of various levels of intelligence, almost regardless of their native culture.</P>
    <P>We can do something about it but it takes time.  If technology is transferable we have got to do something special about it.  It cannot just happen due to multi-national companies arriving here.  We are so keen to get jobs that technology will develop in a somewhat higgledy-piggledy way depending on the particular approach of these firms.  These companies can do a lot to help develop technology know-how. I am speaking here from a basis of fact because as a person who worked for one of these companies I had the joy of watching young chaps coming in with nothing other than farming experience, a good education to leaving certificate, learning how to run machines and at that time nobody dreamt that these boys would reach the point where they would make a fundamental contribution to the technology of the tooling that the Americans gave us when they came originally.  But this in fact only took about six or seven years. But it did take that amount of time.  I think we can plan for such fine periods. I remember one chap arriving outside the door of the factory and he was too shy to come in for interview.  His mother pushed him in the door.  He is now the plant manager of one of those operations.  This is just to show that there is hope there for quick development but not within one or two years. We have to think within the five to ten years planning cycle.  This board again I see having a tremendous amount to contribute to this.</P>
    <P>I would hope that the board would not confine themselves too much to new knowledge and not enough to the applied knowledge.  An example of that that I would have in mind would be that they would be willing to encourage the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy to set up seed bed industrial estates.  Maybe one or two or one for a start, which would be if you like a seed bed of small firm entrepreneural activity.  At the centre of this estate there would be full-time people paid for by the IDA say for the first five years or ten years. They would be capable of being <Col N="278" /> seconded out to new small industries getting under way and using different or novel technologies.  I think that I have brought this up once or twice with colleagues and with people in both the present and the last Government and all I hear is the difficulties.  I think it is about time that we give up being a difficulty stating nation and more of an opportunity taking nation.  Again I would hope that this board would provide us with some leadership in that regard under of course the leadership of the Minister.  This brings me to manpower development.  We were rather slow as a nation in moving towards the development, nuturing and encouragement of younger people to work at technology.  The regional technical college system, thankfully, due to the foresight of the Government in the late sixties, are there now to contribute to this.  So also is Limerick NIHE, the National Institute of Higher Education and the evolving Dublin NIHE.  I would hope that the manpower requirements, which would be the back-up to the development of any technology, will be looked at as part of the function of the board, and that they will not be worried about treading on the toes of the educational system, although that is one way of waking them up at times.</P>
    <P>What might be a less well emphasised aspect of the work in relation to manpower development and in relation to the research aspect of the work of the board would be their role in the social sciences.  When we talk about science and technology there is a tendency to think about the physical sciences, or technology, as a processing technique in production operation.  The social sciences are just as important, if not more so, because eventually any economic unit is made up of people at work trying to achieve satisfaction in the psychological sense and economic satisfaction in terms of the rewards to bring up their families.  We are dealing with the socio-technical system.  We are dealing with the interaction of the social and the technological systems.  This will have to be studied in the same way.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I would hope to see some pilot studies coming from the board which will analyse the underlying <Col N="279" /> causes of some of the industrial relations malaise that we have seen developing in the last few years.  Also, they might use the findings of the social sciences to look at why it is that our entrepreneurial attitudes in this country are not sufficiently tuned to have people enthusiastic about getting into industry and starting up the small industries which will contribute to those 15,000 jobs.</P>
    <P>The penultimate point is the whole question of the staffing of this body. I am concerned that the staffing of some of the new bodies being set up by the State is caught up with the Department of the Public Service.  I notice that the board have the right in the Bill to appoint their own staff, subject of course to the approval of the Department of the Public Service. I hope that this does not mean we will have to go through the Civil Service Appointments Commission and that it does not mean that they get wrapped up with this notion of State servants unified into one common category.  A body that I have been recently concerned with in this regard have had great difficulty trying to deal with that concept.  Hopefully, the Minister has foreseen that obstacle.  Obviously he has provided for ways of doing it because I see that built into the Bill is the provision that the board can hire consultants to help out.  I agree with this as an excellent way of bringing in expertise that does not reside in the indigenous staff of a particular body, but I would hope that it would not get to the point where, for instance, the National Economic and Social Council would appear to be only producing material that comes from consultants and, at that, mostly consultants operating from outside the country.</P>
    <P>Finally, I wish the Minister well with his new board which will be one of the main prongs, obviously, of his power system in relation to planning. By definition the power of this board is the power of planning.  Senator Keating stated last week that he hoped I would make the odd point about this and here is an opportunity to do so. What is even more satisfying is that we have a Minister who understands the <Col N="280" /> concept of planning and will, hopefully be able to pull the strings and encourage the various elements of the system in the right order, as only he knows how.  I congratulate the National Science Council for having brought it to this point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and echo Senator Mulcahy's telling arguments on the exploitation of applied science and technology.  Some central body is required to co-ordinate this effort, a body more powerful and bigger than the National Science Council.  I should also like to welcome the Minister as a former colleague.  I am never quite clear about university men who become T.D.s, whether they remain colleagues of mine or whether they are former colleagues. The Minister will know it is a rather grey area.  I am delighted to see him here and I wish him well.  He is one in a long line of university people coming from all the Irish universities who are making an important contribution in political life, that is, besides the important contribution made by the Independent University Senators.  He has a long and distinguished tradition which I am sure he will follow.</P>
      <P>I should like to make three points in connection with the Bill.  The first one concerns the industrial liaison scheme funded by the National Science Council which was taken up by at least two of the universities, TCD and UCG.  The idea was to set up research and development, a consultancy service with the support of the IDA, some of the funds for the salary of an industrial liaison officer being supplied by the National Science Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister knows, during the period of the last administration this funding was cut off by the Department of Finance and not by the National Science Council.  In the TCD college accounts at the moment there is an entry for December, 1976, of salary owing by the National Science Council which was never paid.  It was the agreed proportion of the industrial liaison officer's salary which was to come from the National Science <Col N="281" /> Council.  I hope that this can be unblocked retrospectively in any of the cases in which it has been done, as well as the case of TCD.  This whole idea is important because, as the Minister and his predecessor know, the universities of their nature are rather slow in taking up the problem of applying the findings of pure science to industry and in enabling the country to reap the benefits of the pure scientific discoveries by applying them in actual physical situations on the ground.</P>
    <P>An industrial liaison officer can do a very important job.  It is an appointment in the spirit in which this Bill is being promoted.  The colleges of technology were unable to appoint industrial liaison officers because the Department of Education, in that case. would pay only half the salary and they were unable to find the other half from their own resources.  They do not have great resources of their own.  I would urge the Minister to ensure that the colleges of technology will be in a position to develop R and E services, and start this by financing the salary of somebody equivalent to an industrial liaison officer.</P>
    <P>The National Science Council played a very positive role in this respect and they are to be congratulated.  However, in the natural course of evolution, they should be replaced by a board with wider powers, more finance and a general overview of our science and technology.  That is a good thing, but let us remember that the National Science Council did some excellent work.  They were impeded by lack of resources and we hope that the resources available to this board will be considerably greater.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the position of one body which has played a vital role in scientific development and of which I am proud to be a member, that is, the Royal Irish Academy.  In many senses the Academy is a private institution which receives some of its funds from Government sources.  It has played the sort of role which could overlap somewhat the functions of the board as outlined in section 4, particularly <Col N="282" /> in subsection (3) (g) where it is stated that they are</P>
    <P>to engage, where appropriate, after consultation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in international activities, in science and technology, including, where appropriate, representation of the State at conferences, meetings and seminars.</P>
    <P>Thirty or forty years ago the Government asked the Royal Irish Academy to form national committees in various sciences, and then they were formed in the art subjects precisely to liaise with the international bodies in particular fields.  One of the first, if not the first, to be set up at the request of the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, was the National Committee for Mathematics which is an academic body drawing representatives from the various educational institutions, the Department of Education and the Central Statistics Office.  The purpose was to be the Irish committee liaising with the International Mathematical Union, the body controlling mathematics worldwide.  It was very important that we had such a committee. The committee has appointed representatives to attend international Mathematical Union meetings.  I am the current representative and I was at the last International Mathematical Union meeting.</P>
    <P>Right across the board there are national committees of the academy and they fulfil an important function. They do a lot more now than just appoint delegates to attend international meetings.  They have had a very important influence on the development of the specific subjects in which they deal.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the academy's work helped and not impeded by this board.  Again, as the Minister probably knows the academy's funding from the Government is extremely meagre.  There is another important function which the academy plays, that is, the publication of the proceedings in sections (a), (b) and (c) and, as far as mathematics is concerned, theirs is our only Irish mathematical journal.  Why is it so important that <Col N="283" /> we should publish an Irish Mathematical Journal?  It is simple.  No institution in Ireland could afford to get the proceedings of the academies throughout the world from their income.  The Royal Irish Academy get them by exchange for their journal. So it is a considerable investment.  We can get the proceedings of academies and institutions around the world by exchange.  There is a big net gain to the country by continuing to publish the academy's proceedings.  Section (a) deals with mathematics and physics, (b) with experimental sciences and (c) with literature and antiquities.</P>
    <P>The Government could be more generous in recognising this important function.  They do not recognise this sufficiently in terms of financial support to the academy.  The situation is such that the academy is now dependent to a large extent on the exhibition being mounted in the Metropolitan Museum in New York jointly by the academy, Trinity College and the National Museum. The academy is dependent on the revenue which will accrue from this exhibition.  Otherwise its operations would be severely hampered.  The academy has a considerable overdraft in the bank.  I hope the Minister and this board will support it in its important scientific and technological endeavours.  It has always been open to change.  Professor Dooge, the former Cathaoirleach, is a distinguished academy member and he had considerable influence on development in the technological field and in promoting technological advances and their study by the academy.</P>
    <P>Finally there is a point on behalf of the fair sex, and who better to remind me than my distinguished and glamorous colleague, Senator Hussey. The teaching of science in girls' schools, as the Minister knows, still leaves a lot to be desired.  What this means when we translate it into wider terms is that half of our population are not in a position often to take part in the advances that are going on because of educational deficiency.  I do not wish to label the problems here because there have been great <Col N="284" /> advances in scientific education in girls' schools in recent years, but they still have a long way to go, as they would be the first to recognise.  The board can help to rectify this situation by encouraging lady scientists, partiularly by appointing women members to this board and by following the recommendation of the Commission on the Status of Women, which said that women should be appointed to boards right across the board in every situation.  This is one of the ways to encourage scientific development, particularly in the girls' schools.  In case the Minister has difficulty in finding sufficiently glamorous and intelligent ladies to appoint, I might remind him that there is in existence a national women's talent bank, established as a result of this commission's report, which can advise on suitable candidates for the positions such as positions on the board and the various sub-committees the board will appoint.</P>
    <P>With those substantive but perhaps rather narrow points I welcome the Bill and look forward on the Committee Stage to the discussion of the board's operations, particularly the functions set out in section 4.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the welcome to the Minister and congratulate him on his appointment.  I also welcome the Bill.  In the past the wealth of society in a country has depended very much on the development of science and technology in that community or country. This position is perhaps even more marked today. We have the so-called developing or underdeveloped countries attempting desperately to keep up with advances in science and technology.  Despite all efforts on their part and aid by various world agencies and so on, they are slipping further and further behind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are in the position of a country which, if threatened, fits into the developed category.  But we are in a very precarious position, we could very easily slip back.  If we once slipped back we would find it very difficult to catch up again.  It is a matter of vital importance to us that we develop and take full advantage of advances <Col N="285" /> in science and technology.  This is particularly important because we are a relatively small country, though I would not entirely agree with Senator Staunton who suggested that we had not done as much as we might have in science and technology.  The contributions of Irish scientists and other people to science and technology have been remarkable and impressive in view of our small size and population. I would agree with him that we have put the emphasis too much on the art aspect of matters.  We tended to look upon universities as institutions, related primarily to their arts faculties. Our young people, even today, tend to over-emphasise careers based on an art background.  In this regard our schools must take some responsibility, more especially in the past because there is now greater emphasis in our schools on science.  It could be vastly improved.</P>
    <P>There is the danger here, a danger we have seen materialise in certain other countries, that people have been encouraged to go into the field of science or the technological aspects of life.  Everything has been fine for a while and places have been provided for them at the university and technological institutes, but when a slump comes many highly qualified people are left without jobs.  We must be careful to match the development of science and technology education and the numbers entering it with the real prospects in society.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise in the House the Government's decision of last month, as announced by the Attorney General, to refer the White Paper on nullity to the Law Reform Commission. I believe that this is a retrograde step becaue it will result in further delay in getting a Bill introduced to <Col N="286" /> reform and update the law on nullity. What is required is not further academic study but political will and leadership.  Senator Justin Keating has indicated that he would like to support me in this motion and I will stop in sufficient time to allow him to intervene in the debate and to give the Minister ample time to reply.</P>
      <P>In order to make my point clearly I must refer briefly to the recent steps to bring about legislative reform of the procedure for bringing nullity proceedings before our courts.  The previous Government were committed in principle to introducing legislative reform. This was clearly stated in the foreword to the White Paper on Nullity published by the former Attorney General in August, 1976.  So in August, 1976 there was a decision in principle by the then Government to introduce a reform in the law relating to nullity.</P>
      <P>The White Paper consists of a discussion paper which summarises the history of and the current position relating to nullity proceedings and it also contains the draft Nullity of Marriages Bill, 1976.  I should like to quote briefly from paragraph 3 of the White Paper, which reads:</P>
      <P>An examination of the law relating to nullity matters in this country leads to the conclusion that there is a real and pressing need for reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The then Attorney General, Mr. Declan Costello, invited submissions on this discussion paper and asked that these be sent to the Attorney General's Office before January, 1977.  A considerable number of submissions were made by interested groups, voluntary bodies and others who had a particular knowledge of the urgency of the need for reform.  The Attorney General consulted very widely on the matter.  Indeed, I participated in drafting two submissions, one on behalf of the Labour Women's National Council, which was critical of certain aspects. particularly of viewing nullity as the major way to cope with the incidence of marital breakdown in Ireland, and the other on behalf of CHERISH, which drew attention to the fact that the Nullity of Marriages Bill, as set out in the back of the White Paper, <Col N="287" /> did not protect the status of the child of an annulled marriage and that this could result in the bastardising of that child.  CHERISH recommended that any such child should retain its legitimacy in order to prevent the extension of the stigma of illegitimacy to the child.</P>
    <P>There were a number of submissions from organisations, individuals, the law schools, private bodies and so on.</P>
    <P>Now that there has been a discussion paper, a draft Bill and widespread public discussion, it is regrettable that the Government have not seen fit to take a political decision as a matter of urgency and introduce a Bill before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Instead, they decided to refer the matter, in a general way, to the Law Reform Commission. The problem in that is that the Law Reform Commission already have a very extensive programme for law reform.  This programme was published last January.  It is a very wide-ranging programme; it is the first programme for examination of certain branches of the law with a view to their reform.  Under the heading of &ldquo;family law&rdquo;, the Law Reform Commission, at page 9 of their report, refer expressly to the fact that certain proposals by the Government for the amendment of the law of nullity have recently been put forward by the Attorney General for discussion.  Therefore, they will not get involved in the area of nullity; that is being dealt with in another way.</P>
    <P>Apart from the fact that the Law Reform Commission are committed to a considerable programme of work which they decided in consultation with the former Government and published last January, they also have limited staffing potential.  At the moment there is a director of research and two full-time research counsellors. One of the research counsellors will be leaving at the end of the year to take up a position as professor of law in University College Cork.  Presumably he will be replaced, but still there are only these two full-time researchers. The five members of the Commission do not become involved in detailed research of this kind.  It would seem <Col N="288" /> that the Law Reform Commission lack the capacity to enlarge further their already heavy workload to take on this new field of study referred to them by the Government.</P>
    <P>The question might be asked whether there is real urgency in bringing about reform of the law of nullity. I believe that, without doubt, it is an urgent matter.  I should like to begin by referring briefly to some figures of the number of suits for nullity brought in the civil courts.  The figures of the number of proceedings instituted in the years from 1966 to 1975, which have been made available by the High Court office, show a total of 31 proceedings instituted for civil nullity.  In other words, the number of proceedings instituted ran at an average of two or three a year.  Also, these are figures of proceedings instituted; they need not necessarily show the number of proceedings brought to final conclusion. In contrast I should like to draw the attention of Senators to the figures for Catholic marriage annulments for 1976.  I quote from an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 15th February last under the heading, &ldquo;Marriage tribunals gave 77 decrees of nullity&rdquo;. The report states:</P>
    <P>Seventy-seven decrees of nullity were granted by the four Catholic Regional Marriage Tribunals in Ireland last year.  Thirty-five nullity applications were rejected after full investigation.  The tribunals in Armagh, Dublin, Cork and Galway receive about 800 letters of application. Many of those involved did not pursue their applications beyond this initial step.</P>
    <P>The article goes on to look at past figures that show significantly higher numbers of people getting Catholic Church annulments but still having their marriages regarded as valid existing marriages under the civil law of the State.</P>
    <P>As a practising barrister I know the harrowing personal circumstances that this can bring about for the individuals involved.  The problems are immensely complex, problems relating to the position of children, if there are children, to the legal rights of spouses under the Succession Act, to the inability <Col N="289" /> of people to regularise in decency with some degree of speed and efficiency their marital relations and their marital status.  It is very bad indeed that, having had a momentum to bring about a change in the law, this seems now to be sidetracked and referred yet again to a more academicly oriented body for further discussion.</P>
    <P>What further discussion should there be?  It is now up to the Government as a matter of urgency to take a political decision on the scope of the measure and to introduce legislation. The greatest deterrent to bringing nullity proceedings in our civil courts is the high cost involved.  This is aggravated by the absence of a State scheme of civil legal aid and advice in this area of family law.  It tends to be a very costly proceeding because the petition for nullity is cumbersome and difficult.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into the merits of the matter.  We are not enabled in the limited time scale on the adjournment to examine the actual procedure for nullity and the substantive issues involved.  I should like to emphasise the point that there was a momentum to reform the law relating to nullity. It is an important and specific part of family law reform.  There had been a discussion paper, a draft Bill and very wide consultation.  Why, now, do the new Government have to refer the matter to the Law Reform Commission who already have a significant programme of work, who have very limited research resources and who cannot in fairness be asked to produce proposals within any reasonable time?  The danger is that the Law Reform Commission may become the whipping boy, the excuse for further delay in the matter.  This would be a highly regrettable step so I would draw the attention of the Houses to the apparent policy decision of the Government in the matter.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider it, to take the relevant documents &mdash; the White Paper, the draft paper and the public response to the Bill &mdash; and put them back to the hands of the Government and to have a Bill introduced <Col N="290" /> in the current year before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I add my voice, not as an expert in law but as a lay person concerned with this matter, to that of Senator Robinson.  I recollect the discussions on this matter in Government.  I originally took the view that the giving of priority to the matter of nullity was not the appropriate response because the whole area of family law is in such chaos that one ought to do the pressing things first. My view was that the most pressing matter was divorce and that this was a way of getting round that without facing it.  I expressed that point of view in conversation to the previous Attorney General, Declan Costello, and he convinced me, both in conversation and as a result of urging me, which I did, to peruse the White Paper which was subsequently published and which was then available in draft.  He convinced me that, quite regardless of the divorce issue, which must not be used to avoid real action, there was an anomalous and needless situation developing on the matter of nullity which bore in an unavoidably cruel way on many people.</P>
      <P>Senator Robinson has given the figures which indicate the difference between the number of Catholic nullities and the number of nullity proceedings concluded in the civil courts. The difference between them is something that is producing needless pain and difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not possess the expertise to do so nor do I wish to go into the matter in detail.  I want to add my voice to this protest because it is indicative of a strategy that is deplorable.  We surely agree, regardless of our views on this issue, that the Law Reform Commission are a necessary organisation. Their staffing should be greater because it seems that aspect after aspect, section after section of the law, not considering the drafting of particular Bills but looking at whole sections, is in need of being pursued continuously because the law in a rapidly changing society needs continuous alteration, continuous up-dating.  That is an endless process and it becomes more <Col N="291" /> necessary as social change becomes more rapid.</P>
    <P>In regard to nullity, we have had as Senator Robinson said, a much fuller process of examination than we have had in regard to other legislation.  We have had a White Paper, we have had the ensuing submissions, which were extensively done, from all the interested organisations, so we have no excuse in a technical or examination or consultation sense not to proceed to draft the legislation.  Neither have we an excuse to waste the time of the Law Reform Commission who are already overworked and understaffed, with lots of obvious things that they ought to be doing and which in their projected programme, which is published, they expressed the desire to do.  They have a need to proceed which presumably we accept.  There is a need for legislation on nullity for which all the preparatory work has been done and we not only foul up the question of some decent law on nullity but the creative work in other areas which the Law Reform Commission ought to be doing and want to do.  Then there is the possibility that they will be made the scapegoat for the failure to act.  It is very difficult in a politically sensitive area, which this is, to pass the buck to any organisation other than the Government. The more sensitive the area the more it is the Government's duty to have the guts either to legislate or to say that they will not.</P>
    <P>To coin two thundering cliches, it is not the time to stand idly by and it is a time to grasp the nettle.  The need is obvious.  The research has been done. There can be no objective reason for delaying drafting.  Therefore, all we can do, if this course is persisted in, is conclude regretfully that a Government with such a large majority that ought to have the courage to do things that may be slightly unpopular have not the courage to do them.  All Governments say there are things they would love to do, but this Government ought to have more courage.  If the new Government proceed in this way we can only assume that it is from a failure of political courage and from a desire to put off something which, in equity, is clearly overdue.</P>

      <P>Yes.  The situation is that a Law Reform Commission Act passed in 1975 was fully subscribed to by the Senator.  Section 4 (1) of that Act reads:</P>
      <P>The Commission shall keep the law under review ...</P>
      <P>Senator Keating has referred to this.</P>
      <P>... and in accordance with the provisions of this Act shall undertake examinations and conduct research with a view to reforming the law and formulate proposals for law reform.</P>
      <P>Section 4 (2) reads:</P>
      <P>Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1) of this section the Commission shall&mdash;</P>
      <P>... (c) at the request of the Attorney General, undertake an examination of and conduct research in relation to any particular branch or matter of law whether or not such branch or matter is included in a programme approved of under the said section 5 and, if so requested, formulate and submit to the Attorney General proposals for its reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was under that section, which was publicised by the Attorney General, that he wrote to the President of the Law Reform Commission asking him to undertake an examination of and <Col N="293" /> conduct research into law relating to the nullity of marriage and, if thought fit, to formulate proposals for its reform and submit them to him.  He also indicated that he was sending on the submissions which had been made and to which Senator Robinson referred and to which she subscribes.</P>
    <P>This was a right given to the Attorney General under the Law Reform Commission Act, 1975.  At that time the Attorney General was a member of the Dáil and was in a position to initiate his own legislation. Following tradition within the Fianna Fáil Party, the present Government have selected an Attorney General who is not a Member of the Dáil.  In his independent position, a right given to him under the Law Reform Commission Act, 1975, he chose to send the White Paper, together with the observations, to the Law Reform Commission asking them, as indicated in section 4 (2) (c) to make proposals to him following their examination.  Senator Robinson gave the impression that she was amazed <Col N="294" /> that the Attorney General should do this without consulting the Government. It is a right which he exercised properly.  I can say to both Senators, and particularly to Senator Keating, that he need have no fears but that the Government will carry out their responsibilities and will use their majority properly in the introduction of necessary and unpopular legislation. Fianna Fáil have not been backward in introducing unpopular legislation.</P>

      <P>It is a remarkable way to start a new Government's life with a procedure like this.</P>

      <P>On the other hand, the Government starting in a remarkable way which does not fall in with Senator Keating's views does not mean that it is not the proper way to conduct the affairs of the country.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 10th November, 1977.</P>
