      <P>I have considered a request from Senator Mary Robinson to raise, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House this evening, the following matter:</P>
      <P>Intervention by the Minister for Education to ensure as a matter of urgency that full-time tuition be given to students in the prosthetics department in the Dental Hospital, Dublin.</P>
      <P>I rule that this matter is not admissible for discussion on the Adjournment on the ground that there is no ministerial responsibility involved.</P>

      <P>I am very disappointed it is not possible to raise the very serious situation of dental students on the Adjournment.  I accept that, perhaps technically, it is not a direct responsibility of the Minister for Education, but clearly if the Minister were prepared to intervene he could resolve the dispute and since dental students risk losing six months of their course, it is an extremely urgent matter for them.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 1, 3, 2, 4 and 5 in that order. Although we are taking No. 3 before No. 2, it will be necessary to pass No. 2 first so, assuming we are willing to take all Stages of No. 2, I will be asking the Seanad not to take the Fifth Stage until No. 2 has been passed.  This for technical reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Seanad this is not for publicity purposes.  I have raised on the Order of Business for the past three weeks the question of the urgency of the need to establish a Joint Committee on European Community Secondary Legislation.  The Leader of the House appeared sympathetic as a former member of the Joint Committee to the need to establish the committee and undertook to look into it.  However, I see the Government have not tabled the necessary expediency motion to establish this committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Labour Party have discussed the matter and it has been decided that the Labour group will table the necessary motion and it will be tabled this afternoon.  Could I ask the Leader of the House if time could be given as a matter of priority to discuss this motion so that the Seanad can do all that is required of it to establish this joint committee?  It is not a discretionary committee.  The joint committee have a statutory obligation under the European Communities (Amendment) Act, 1973, to examine and report to both Houses on Irish ministerial regulations implementing <Col N="353" /> EEC legislation.  They have 12 months in which to recommend the possible annulment of any of these regulations and then a motion can be passed by both Houses annulling it.  Six months of that possible 12 months have gone without any joint committee in operation.  There is no scrutiny of Irish ministerial regulations as required by the European Communities (Amendment) Act, 1973, and there is no scrutiny of draft directives, draft regulations, or programmes for legislation at the European Community level which vitally affect us.  I have tried, by raising it in successive weeks, to encourage the Government to get around to tabling the required expediency motion and I am afraid that, if we do not take an initiative now in the Seanad to discuss this and pass the necessary motion, and have a similar motion introduced in the Dáil, this committee will not be in a position to meet before Christmas.  I would ask the Leader of the House if he would undertake to have time given for debating this motion either tomorrow or at the first opportunity next week.</P>

      <P>Could I ask the Leader of the House if any agreement has been reached by the Whips concerning the taking of motions which are now accumulating on the Order Paper?  This is a matter we have raised on a number of occasions.  It is obviously a matter which has to be agreed between the Whips and the sort of agreement one would hope would emerge would be that the Government and Opposition parties and the Independents would, in rotation, get an opportunity to have one of the motions tabled in their names taken.  It is a matter for agreement and it needs an initiative from the Leader of the House to get the Whips to meet and agree on this.  Perhaps he could say something about it.</P>

      <P>In regard to Senator Robinson's request, until I see the motion I am not in a position to give any undertaking but, on the other hand, I should like to tell the House that I have expressed the concern of this House in regard to this committee to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and <Col N="354" /> he has assured me that he will have completed his consideration of the terms of reference by next week.  So I am hopeful that the committee will be set up in a matter of the next week or two at the outside.  In regard to the question of motions, it was intended to take Motion No. 12 today or tomorrow, but Senator Keating asked that it not be taken because I understand he is not available.  That will be taken next week if the mover wishes it to be taken.</P>
      <P>In regard to motions generally, I said earlier that it would be appropriate to ask the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to consider this question and to agree on the times when they should be taken, the length of time which should be given to them, and so on.  The Committee of Selection are sitting this evening and I hope it will be possible to have a meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges next week.  That certainly should be one of their first considerations. As soon as they have considered it, I will have a formula which will enable us to take motions regularly.</P>

  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Control of Exports (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1956" RHead="(Continuance) Bill, 1977: Second Stage and Subsequent Stages">
    <Title>Control of Exports (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1956 (Continuance) Bill, 1977: Second Stage and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn) Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Control of Exports (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1956, which was enacted originally for a period of three years and has since been renewed in normal course, at the end of each three-year period, will expire on 31st December, 1977.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to continue the 1956 Act in force for a five-year period, that is, until 31st December, 1982 and to provide that the penalty prescribed in section 3 (4) of the Act in respect of the offence of making a false or misleading statement or representation to the Minister for the purpose of obtaining an export licence, shall be increased from £100 to £500.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="355" /> The Act empowers the Minister to prohibit by order, the export of industrial goods save under a licence issued by him.  Such orders have a life of 12 months only and may be annulled at any time during this period by resolution of either House of the Oireachtas. Control is at present in force on a range of goods under the Control of Exports Order, 1977, and the Control of Exports (Southern Rhodesia) Order, 1977.</P>
    <P>Goods the export of which is controlled for reasons of supply are listed in Parts I and II of the Schedule to the Control of Exports Order, 1977. Those controlled for strategic reasons are shown in Part III of that Schedule.</P>
    <P>As a member state of the European Economic Community, Ireland is obliged to comply with the requirements of Community law relating to the export to third countries of ferrous and non-ferrous wastes and scraps.  The supplies of iron and steel scrap and of waste and scrap of aluminium and lead arising in this country are essential to the needs of home users.  It is in our interest, therefore, to apply in this country the restriction imposed by the Community on the shipment of these scrap materials to third countries.  The home supply of copper and copper alloy waste and scrap is not fully utilised by home processors.  Accordingly, Ireland obtains each year a share of the export quota appointed for these scraps by the Community permitting limited quantities to be exported to third countries.</P>
    <P>Export control on goods classified as &ldquo;strategic&rdquo; is not operated at Community level.  Each member state of the European Economic Community and eight other countries control the export of such goods under national legislation and the proposed Bill enables this country to continue to do likewise.  Ireland's participation in the international strategic export control arrangements derives essentially from this country's need to import supplies of certain high technology industrial materials and components required by the more sophisticated industries established here in recent years and which <Col N="356" /> cater mainly for export markets.  Since the movement of these goods to Ireland is controlled, in most cases, by precisely those countries which participate in the strategic control arrangements, it is considered essential that the Minister should continue to control the export of goods of a strategic character in order to ensure:</P>
    <P>(1)  continued access for Irish firms to the strategic goods referred to; and</P>
    <P>(2)  that employment will be fully maintained in the plants where they are utilised and in any similar plants that may be established here in the future.</P>
    <P>Ireland's membership of the United Nations Organisation carries a commitment to apply here mandatory resolutions of the UN Security Council imposing restrictions on the export of goods to Southern Rhodesia and of arms and military supplies to South Africa.</P>
    <P>For the following reasons, therefore, I consider it necessary for the Minister to have continuing powers to maintain the existing export controls and to enact the appropriate legislation for the purpose:</P>
    <P>(a)  to comply with our obligations under Community law as expressed in EEC Regulation No. 2603/69 to restrict, for the benefit of Irish and other Community processors, shipment of scrap metals to third countries and to ensure conditions of comparative price stability for these scraps in the home and Community markets.</P>
    <P>(b)  to ensure that strategic materials, for example, arms, ammunition, military and naval stores, certain military aircraft, computers, and so on, are not exported from or through this country to undesirable destinations abroad in accordance with the requirements of the international export control to which Ireland subscribes.</P>
    <P>(c)  to enable the Government to realise a general foreign policy aim of preventing the export of strategic or potentially strategic goods to areas where they could contribute <Col N="357" /> to an increase in international tension or provide support for the apartheid policies of the Government of South Africa or other similar repressive regimes.</P>
    <P>(d)  to comply with the mandatory resolutions adopted by the United Nations Security Council requiring member states to prevent the exportation of goods to Southern Rhodesia, and of arms and military supplies to South Africa.</P>
    <P>(e)  to have immediately available a means of dealing quickly with any emergency which might denude the country of essential materials before corrective legislation could be enacted.</P>
    <P>When the 1956 Act was last renewed in 1974, its validity was extended for a period of three years and nine months terminating on 31st December, 1977.  Since the commitments mentioned will continue for the foreseeable future, it is considered that the Act should be extended on this occasion for a period of five years. This would not alter an essential feature of the 1956 Act, that is that the need for the powers which it confers should be reviewed by the Oireachtas from time to time.</P>
    <P>Orders made by the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy under the Act provide that goods, the export of which is so controlled, may not be exported except under the authority of a licence granted by the Minister.  Section 3 (4) of the Act states:</P>
    <P>Every person who, for the purpose of obtaining for himself or any other person a licence, makes any statement or representation which is to his knowledge false or misleading in any material respect shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding one hundred pounds.</P>
    <P>It is considered that £100 is not now an adequate penalty for offences of this kind, having regard to the fall in the value of money since 1956 and because a more effective deterrent is needed to discourage misrepresentation <Col N="358" /> particularly in the realm of strategic goods where money values are often substantial.  In these circumstances, a fine not exceeding £500 for the offence described at section 3 (4) of the Act is not considered an excessive penalty and section 2 of the Bill provides for such a penalty.</P>
    <P>For the reasons mentioned I commend this Bill to the favourable consideration of Seanad Éireann.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not detain the House by repeating the reasons advanced by the Parliamentary Secretary for the continuance of this Bill in operation, reasons which we accept.  I should like to make a couple of casual comments.  With regard to the level of penalty being raised from £100 to £500, while it is a substantial increase, I wonder is it really any sanction or deterrent to people who might be tempted to engage in the illegal export of prohibited goods.  I doubt if it would be because, having regard to the possible volume of goods, £500 might be only a trifle to them.</P>
      <P>I read, with some puzzlement and amusement, Part IV of the order which the Parliamentary Secretary circulated with her speech, containing a list of articles excepted from the articles prohibited in Parts I, II and III.  I wondered how a comprehensive list of exceptions could be drawn up.  Great effort has been made to draw up a comprehensive list of exceptions when I see it goes so far as to specify that powder puffs may be exported without a licence.  I am sure there is an excellent bureaucratic reason for doing it in this way, but it seems to me to be manifestly impossible to draw up a list of exceptions which would be exdusive and complete.  That is the only comment I have to make.  We recognise the need for the continuance of the control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>This Act has been in existence since 1956.  In effect, it speaks for itself.  We are being asked merely to confirm the continuation of the measure with one notable change, that is, the increase of the amount of penalty, to which Senator Cooney has referred, from £100 to £500.  If one were to take the effect of inflation <Col N="359" /> over the past four years, the increase would be justifiable, not to mention going back to 1956.  If a fine is to be a serious deterrent &mdash; the real difference between £100 20 years ago and £500&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Senator expect to find it reduced at the end of the next four years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;it should be at least double what the Parliamentary Secretary is proposing.  There is no need to argue the justification for the necessity to be able to control exports of different materials from time to time. The purpose is that the Executive should have the power from time to time to prohibit the export of any additional materials it might be felt ought to be retained here for our own use, for our own community.  In addition, as the Parliamentary Secretary said, it is necessary to have an enactment of this kind in existence to enable the Government to fulfil any regulations the European Community might require us as a member state to fulfil in regard to the export of any materials, scrap metals, and so on.</P>
      <P>The other significant item mentioned was the range of items coming under the description of strategic materials, armaments, military aircraft, and other such items.  We are not, of course, in this league.  Except for one recent item we are not manufacturing anything of that nature for export.  However, I am sure Members of the House will appreciate that it could be quite possible to export articles which were imported. In other words, it is possible that the State could be used as a means for reexporting materials coming under the heading of strategic materials and, thereby contravening first our own good intentions in regard to different areas in the world and, secondly, regulations we would be expected to consider as a member of the European Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another aspect which is also relevant is the need to be in a position to comply with any special resolutions passed by the Security Council of the United Nations such as has been done in the case of Rhodesia in order to prevent <Col N="360" /> the export of goods to that area. Such circumstances could arise in other cases where it might suit us to comply with resolutions passed by the Security Council.</P>
    <P>There is another reason which justifies the retention and continuation of a measure of this kind, that is, so that the Government of the day can be in a position, in the event of an emergency developing, to prohibit the export of goods of any kind which might be essential to our survival during such an emergency.  There is no need to belabour the necessity for a measure of this kind from the point of view of our own survival as a community, and from the point of view of fulfilling our international commitments.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to give us an idea what is the range of goods at present prohibited by ministerial order under this legislation.  I have only a vague idea what it is.  It may cover a wide range but I suspect it is not very wide.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome this Bill and I can very well see the necessity for the introduction of a Bill of this type.  Nevertheless, in this era of economic expansion and the creation of new jobs and, in particular, providing jobs for our young, we have to be very careful that Bills such as this do not inhibit in any way the progress and advancement of our industrial arm.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer especially to the statement made in the Dáil by Deputy Barry Desmond.  He objected to the fact that the Timoney armoured personnel carriers were coming up for export.  In his opinion they should also come under an order such as this.  Of course, we must recognise that these carriers are specifically for peaceful purposes and in no way can it be construed that they are for anything other than peaceful purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must ask our Parliamentary Secretary and, indeed, our Minister and the civil servants of those Departments, to ensure that our industrialists are not inhibited or impeded in any way by a Bill such as this.  We all welcome the development of the Timoney armoured personnel carrier and we hope it will be a tremendous source of revenue, <Col N="361" /> and badly needed for foreign revenue at that, and that on the home front it will create more and more employment in what could I suppose be described as heavy industry.  In the future, and please God in the near future, it will give a great impetus wherever it is established.</P>
    <P>We must be careful about how we administer this Bill.  I am rather amused at our selectivity in whom we export to and whom we do not export to.  I see Rhodesia is one of those countries to which the export of all goods is banned.  I see the reason for that, and there is a very strong and good reason for it.  However, I wonder are there not other countries as well who could very well come into this category? Would not the Russians, for instance, have committed exactly the same atrocities as have been committed in Rhodesia?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Senator for trading with them?  I am entitled to my opinion about them.  I notice the Senator is appropriately dressed today to support the Russians.  However, we all know Senator Robinson's idealistic beliefs and her undoubted support for them.  I am sure she does not agree with me &mdash; or maybe she does &mdash; about the rape of Hungary and Czechoslovakia. The crimes committed in Rhodesia are no greater than the crimes committed by the Warsaw Pact countries.  I would urge this House to consider carefully our future trading position with the Eastern bloc.  After all, if we accept that we should not trade with Rhodesia or South Africa &mdash; and I fully endorse that point of view &mdash; we must also consider very carefully, now that we have a nonCommunist Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I am trying to do but I am finding it very difficult to continue in view of the interruptions from Senator Cooney and I hope that you will do your best to control him.  I think it is important that we have our priorities right and that we do not make fish of one and flesh of another and that when we are furthering the export of goods, for very good reasons, to certain designated countries we should also, on the other hand, examine the credentials of some of the countries that we are exporting to.  I think the Bill that we have before us is technical from the point of view that we have to pass an addendum to it with all the goods that are exempted.  I wonder is there any simpler or easier way of presenting to the people who will be involved in the export of goods such as we envisage in the Bill by which they could interpret what they could export and what they could not because to me it is complicated and very technical and I can imagine that it can cause some exporters a good deal of trouble and concern trying to unravel the position in relation to their exports. I see the problem of samples, for instance, but what are the procedures necessary to bring in samples and to re-export them?  What kind of a licence system is needed and how long does it take before one can get a licence <Col N="363" /> for the sending abroad of samples?  I think these are important questions in relation to the efficiency of our industries because if exporters find that they are going to be stultified in their approach to open up new markets then very often they can discard the whole idea, resulting in loss of exports.</P>
      <P>It is my opinion generally that we should have a far more reasonable, understandable list of what can be done and what cannot be done because in this era of the instant communication system very often samples are asked for by return of post and if some of our manufacturers cannot comply with this request they may be losing business to other countries.  I would like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to ensure that in no way are there any brakes put on our export drive and that all possible co-operation is given to those industries that may apply for a licence under the various headings in this Bill. It is a good opportunity, also, when we are talking about exports to show that we are in a developing country, that we have become a very sophisticated industrial country and that our standards and requirements are up to the highest in the EEC regulations.  We can prove that in the most positive possible way by dealing with all our orders and all requests for samples in the most expeditious manner possible.</P>
      <P>Without going any further into the matter I welcome the Bill but I would like to have certain assurances in relation to the implementation of the contents of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather an extraordinary turn of events.  There did not seem to be anybody offering on this side and therefore Senator Crowley got the benefit of getting in.  The reason why there was nobody offering from the Labour Party side was that we wanted to facilitate the business and we had confidence in what the Parliamentary Secretary was bringing in.  It is a little extraordinary to see Senator Crowley taking issue, to some extent, with his own Parliamentary Secretary and at the same time introducing a note that could lead to disharmony when we are trying to facilitate Bills being put through.  I am sorry that it <Col N="364" /> happened, it is sad.  If there is somebody about whom you want to make a remark I think you should wait until he is present to make that remark so that he can defend himself.  The other thing I want to say is that there are no objections whatever to this Bill.  We are delighted to see it.  We wish the Government every success with it.</P>

      <P>Leanann an Bille seo Acht 1956 agus Acht 1974.  Tugann na hAchta sin cumhacht don Aire maidir le h-onnmhuiriú earraí atá riachtanach i gcóir tionscail na tíre seo agus is ceart agus is cóir go mbeadh a leithéid de chumhacht ag an Aire. Deireann Acht 1956 dhá rud anseo go soiléir:</P>
      <P>The Minister may, whenever and so often as he thinks fit, by order prohibit, subject to such exceptions, if any, as he may think proper, the exportation of goods of any specified description, save under and in accordance with a licence.</P>
      <P>Agus, uimhir a 2 &mdash;</P>
      <P>The Minister may, after consultation with the Minister for External Affairs, by order prohibit, subject to certain exceptions, if any, as he may think proper the exportation of goods of any specified description to a specified destination, save under and in accordance with a licence.</P>
      <P>Tá sé thar a bheith tábhachtach go mbeadh an dá chumhacht sin ag an Aire maidir le na hearraí féin ar an gcéad dul síos agus ansan ba cheart go mbeadh sé de chumhacht aige tíortha áirithe a ainmniú nár cheart na hearraí sin a onnmhuiriú chuca.  I am sure everybody in the House is anxious that the powers of this Act, that will expire on the 31st of next month should be continued, and it is only proper especially, in present circumstances that the Minister would continue to have those powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I commend very highly the excellent speech made by the Parliamentary Secretary here to day and I note in particular her reference to the fact that the supplies of iron and steel scrap and of waste and scrap aluminium and lead arising in this country are essential to the needs of home users.  This has been a hobby <Col N="365" /> horse of mine for a long time&mdash;the amount of waste that takes place in this country.  We waste food, quite a lot of the time, possibly a fair amount of energy, with the various meanings that energy has, and, let me expressly say, we waste useful materials.  The time has come when we will have to take this matter of waste very seriously and make sure that in every possible instance anything regarded as waste will be recycled so as to produce something that will be of benefit to our manufacturing industries.  I am glad that this Bill has come before us and as everybody is anxious to give it a speedy passage through the House.  I am happy to commend it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the wish of this side of the House to facilitate the passage of the Bill.  One can say that it is a sad reflection on the current of events in the world over the past 21 years that while the original Act indicated that the Bill then going through the Houses of the Oireachtas would expire at the end of three years, it has been found necessary on a number of occasions to extend the validity of the 1956 Act.  I note that the period of extension has increased this time from three-and-a-half years to five years, bringing us up to the end of 1982.  It appears that this legislation is almost becoming permanent.  It is necessary and desirable from this country's point of view, now that we are part of a broader sphere, that we should coordinate with the EEC Communities and other countries in western democracies to safeguard exports and to ensure that nothing is exported, particularly to third countries, which can prove injurious to peace in these parts of the world.</P>
      <P>The increase of the fine from £100 to £500 would appear to be adequate but I wonder if, in four years' time in 1981-82 when this extension will expire, £500 will not seem inadequate at that time as a deterrent.  I certainly would not baulk at the fine being increased to something in the region of £1,000.  As I said, we have no wish to hesitate in passing this Bill; we think it is necessary legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jago</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we all welcome this Bill.  The continuance of the control already there is still necessary. It appears to govern or control two things, the export of scrap metal and the export of strategic material. Naturally, coming from the Cork area I am very concerned about the export of scrap metal and to make sure of the continuance of Irish Steel. Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would be able to tell us if, during the period of strike, any licences were granted for the export of scrap.</P>
      <P>On the point of the export of strategic materials or goods the most popular one at the moment is our troop carrier which may be exported and I presume that the Minister will not bring in an order to control its export to every country on an overall basis.  As Senator Crowley said, we are interested in exports and I think we can congratulate ourselves that we have something now which is worthy of export.</P>
      <P>It appears that the main control is by ministerial order and that, therefore, it is dependent on the Minister as to what is controlled and under licence. Perhaps I could ask the Parliamentary Secretary does the order come before the Houses of the Oireachtas before it is finally made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just a few comments which I would like to make on the Bill.  It is a Bill that we all welcome.  One of the comments I would like to make is that it appears that little use is made of copper which has been recycled here and some of which is exported by licence.  This would appear to be an area into which the IDA and the Department could look possibly with a view to establishing an industry based on the use of this copper material which is at present being exported. There are very few people in the country who can use recycled materials.  Irish Steel has been mentioned. In particular, when Irish Steel were on strike there was a build-up of scrap materials all over the country. If you walked down the docks in Dublin, the stuff was piled up and there did not seem to be any outlet other than Irish Steel.  There could be an investigation into means whereby this material <Col N="367" /> could be used by people other than Irish Steel.</P>
      <P>Of some concern to me is that amongst the items not controlled are antiques.  It is essential that we should have some control over the export of antiques.  Antiques form a major form of our heritage.  To many people antiques are things which are very expensive and bear very little relationship to the normal like of the people.  Arte-facts, whether they be farm implements or items which were used in houses 100 years ago, are being exported without control.  These things are going to America in alarming numbers. If we are not careful we will not have a 100-year old plough in the country. We will not have a 100-year old scythe.  That is due to the proliferation of people with titles, working for Sothebys and such concerns coming here from England and overseas and exporting the best of our heritage from all over the country.  There should be some control over this area.</P>
      <P>Going down thorugh the items which are exempted, there is an item in the second statement in Part IV, accessories and requisitions including gaming machines, which are not controlled. The control here should be that every gaming machine made in this country should be exported.  If we allow gaming machines to be made in this country we should control them in the sense that every one of them should be exported, because they are causing havoc.  They are in every place of amusement.  They are geared towards the owner; they are geared to make money.  There is no way in which anyone can win on these gaming machines.  They have to be legalised in some US states such as Nevada. They are not allowed in some states, but there seems to be no control of them here.  I suggest that they should be exported in total rather than that there should be an order made that they may be exported.  I suggest they should not be imported.  Those are just a couple of comments that I have to make on the Bill.  I welcome the Bill and I hope it gets through in a speedy manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just a <Col N="368" /> few brief points I would like to make. Any Bill that concerns itself with exports must be of tremendous importance and particularly of importance to this country.  As an island nation we are very dependent upon exports. I am delighted that our colleagues on the opposite side of the House are accepting this Bill.  Nonetheless, it is important that we look at a few of the principles which are involved in this.</P>
      <P>It is necessary that we have control over exports, particularly exports of strategic goods.  Nonetheless, one is just a little concerned about anything which might interfere with trade.  By and large we have much more to gain probably from free trading with countries than any limitation of trade. There are other aspects, particularly in regard to strategic goods.  There is a necessity in this country that we have control over our supplies and ensure as the Parliamentary Secretary has indicated that we could quickly and readily impose such control in an emergency.  We had the experience of the last world war when for a time we found ourselves in a very desperate situation, and in any similar circumstances today we would probably be in a far more critical situation.  Then, thanks to the magnificent work of Seán Lemass and, indeed, to the public generally, we were able to weather what was a very difficult storm.  We are in many ways far more dependent today on strategic imports, so much so that I wonder if in certain ways we should not have in the case of certain very key substances at least some possibility or some consideration of strategic stock-piling.  It is highly expensive, but suppose there were an emergency, how much support would we get elsewhere?  All the other countries would naturally be looking to their own interests.  This is something which we really should consider for ourselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us be realistic about this: in any future conflict it is very evident that control of the seas is unlikely to be really under the aegis of the countries which are our neighbours.  More likely, there would be far greater interference with the free flow of goods than even in the second World War.  So, it is important that we have this sort of <Col N="369" /> power to use in the sort of emergency which we all hope and pray will never occur but it is far better to be prepared for it than &ldquo;<i>ad hoc</i>-ing&rdquo; if the time should ever come.</P>
    <P>The Bill also incorporates certain very important policies or alludes to them.  These are in relation to the EEC.  We have taken on in our membership of the Community a number of very onerous responsibilities and some of these are incorporated in this Bill.  There is one curious omission I must say, not from the Bill itself but from the EEC in that, as it is stated here, there is no specific list of strategic goods on an EEC basis.  I wonder if this is not something which our representatives at the EEC should not suggest, that there be an agreed list of strategic goods.  It is not much good passing resolutions that strategic goods be not exported and then not agreeing in fact on what are strategic and what are not strategic goods. There is rather a gap here in EEC policy.  Very major and totally disparate from the EEC are the United Nations obligations.  I, personally, have great reservations about embargoes on any country.  This does not mean that one does anything other than condemn totally the lack of human rights in Southern Rhodesia and in South Africa.  It is so easy to get carried away by the particular <i>bête noire</i> of the moment and to condemn some particular country because it is communist or because it does this or because it does that.  We must be very careful about these sort of embargoes. I also think, particularly as regards Southern Rhodesia and Southern Africa generally, that we have a role to play other than just tagging along behind resolutions of the EEC or the United Nations.  We have clean hands in Africa.  Any of our dealings in Africa have been on the basis of friendship and co-operation with the people of Africa.  Let us not forget too, the fact that we have clean hands also as regards the people who are now in control of white South Africa, the Boers.  They had their own anti-colonial struggle too and rather than outright condemnation of these people I think we, without a colonial record, with a record of struggling for our own <Col N="370" /> independence should, I think, be able to take a positive attitude in bringing peace to South Africa, to that very troubled part of the world.  We can do so in good faith which is more, I think, than most of the countries that are meddling in Southern Africa for one reason or another, can say.</P>
    <P>I note that over and beyond that we are suggesting that our control will be part of our general foreign policy aim as regards any repressive regime. Again, I suggest we should be very careful before leaping into condemnation or joining in embargoes but I am glad to see that we have the power if or when we decide that it is necessary.</P>
    <P>There are a few other points which Senator Lanigan raised on the specific use of our supplies of copper and copper alloys and I notice also that we have a certain given share of the export quota here.  I just wonder how large that share is.  I would like to join in welcoming this very necessary and very important Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelMulcahy" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and the opportunity to speak on it.  As I see it, we are dealing with the role of Government under a number of headings in regard to the control of products which are seen to be strategic, the control of products at times of emergency, our role in going along with international agreements to which we are in some way allied by our international commitments in the United Nations or the EEC and the other role, and the one with which I want to deal more specifically is our role in terms of competitiveness and reputation.  As far as the strategic aspect is concerned.  I am interpreting it that products which seem to be strategic are outside the EEC listing and therefore it is convenient for us to be able to have the freedom to operate within that category of strategic products so that we can put controls on if we have to, where we might come under pressure in relation to products, let us say, that some of the new multi-nationals are producing with unusual kinds of raw materials or semi-processed materials.  The emergency role should be fairly obvious and hardly needs elaboration. The international agreements role has <Col N="371" /> been covered by other speakers: I do not need to add to it other than to say that once we enter into arrangements with bodies like the United Nations I suppose we have to go along with them.</P>
      <P>The other area, of course, on the international side, lies in the regulations which are being introduced periodically by the EEC, seeing that we keep a weather eye open there, that we do not find ourselves being spancelled in an area where we have advantage.  On the competitiveness aspect, which is the area of this Bill in which I would have most interest, I have been advocating for some years through articles in journals or otherwise, going back to 1964, that this country should take a more positive role in relation to the function in management that we call quality control. I think the best way to illustrate my viewpoint on this is to mention the case of Japan.  Those Senators who are in or around my age, and others by reputation, will know it and the older Members, of course, will remember that Japan at a particular time had a reputation for copying products and for producing products which were not really seen as quality goods.  After the World War the Japanese Government took the step of having a crash programme for the training of engineers and scientists, particularly those involved in manufacturing in Japan, in methods of quality control.  By a programme, I mean that 15,000 scientists and engineers were induced to go through a training programme carried out by leading American experts.  As a result the quality of Japanese goods increased to the point where now we do not associate them with being low quality goods.  They are way ahead of the competition in many product areas, such as optics, electronics, shipping, steel and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main teeth that went with this policy was that the Government passed legislation which ruled that no products carrying the Japanese sign should be exported from Japan without having been tested by approved test laboratories. In making this point I am not trying to introduce restrictions on <Col N="372" /> our export drive.  As Senators will have heard me saying before, it is the 15,000 new jobs that must be created in manufacturing each year that are my prime interest.  It is essential that we export high quality products of which we can be proud, which will not let us down in market places and will maintain our competitiveness.  This Bill does not cover that area but I commend this idea to the Parliamentary Secretary.  As far as the penalty of £500 is concerned, I would go along with it. If the Parliamentary Secretary comes before us again to introduce quality control legislation, I hope that the punishment will fit the crime.  I commend the Bill.</P>

      <P>I thank the many Senators who took part in the Second Stage debate for their remarks and for assisting me to get the Bill through as quickly as possible. It is an urgent Bill.  It must be passed and become law before 31st December this year.  Senator Cooney and Senator Markey referred to the increase in the penalty which we are revising under this Bill.  There is no record of any prosecutions having been made under the Act and, therefore, we feel that it is not necessary to have a stiffer penalty.  We have been advised by the Attorney General's office that a penalty of £500 is the maximum penalty on a summary conviction in the District Court at the moment.  However, the matter of an increase from £500 can be considered when this Bill comes before the House again in five years' time.</P>
      <P>Senator Brugha spoke about the list of controlled exports, the strategic goods which are manufactured here. The Senator obviously was not here when my speech was circulated with the attached list.  The list is as follows: computers, memory stacks and systems, telecommunications equipment, process control systems, semiconductors, military vehicles and dynamite. A copy of the Control of Exports Order was also circulated with the speech and we can arrange to get a copy of that to Senator Brugha.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Crowley spoke about the <Col N="373" /> problems with Rhodesia, South Africa and Russia.  All exports to Rhodesia are prohibited under a United Nations resolution which is mandatory on this country.  Exports of arms and military supplies to South Africa are prohibited also by a United Nations resolution which is mandatory on us.  Senator Robinson took issue with Senator Crowley over his remarks about trade with Russia.  All of us are entitled to our own opinion.  However, it is a fact that the Minister has been complaining that communist countries are not taking enough of our exports. There is a severe imbalance against us in our trade.  The Minister has expressed his anxiety to have this imbalance be corrected.</P>
    <P>In speaking of ordinary exports, Senator Crowley asked whether it was intended to put brakes on ordinary industrialists throughout the country. There is no intention whatever of doing that.  The only controlled exports are the ones which came under this Bill.  Senator Jago joined Senator Crowley on the problem of the Timoney carrier and the exports of this to other countries.  Only two prototypes of the Timoney carrier have been exported. This was done on the authority of a Cabinet decision.  There is a principle embedded in Community law that exports shall be free except for the limited range of goods which are specified under regulation 260369 which I referred to in my opening remarks. Naturally my Department would be advised at all times by the Department of Foreign Affairs regarding undesirable destinations where strategic goods would be shipped.</P>
    <P>Senator Crowley also spoke about the problem of samples.  There are standard customs procedures for importing samples of consumer goods, even machinery.  Samples would not be controlled under this Bill unless they were samples of strategic goods, for example, a single computer or typical samples of scrap materials which are subject to control.  The Senator made a suggestion that the list of goods subject to export control might be simplified or shortened.  Parts I, II and III have already been pared down to quite short lists.  The other part deals <Col N="374" /> with a highly technical range of goods and it could not be expressed in simpler terms.</P>
    <P>Senator Cranitch referred to waste metals.  The Community considers that 75 to 80 per cent of waste metals arising here and in other countries is wasted by being thrown out in rubbish dumps.  They have recently appointed a Waste and Scrap Committee to look into this whole area and into recovery techniques which may be used with a view to preserving essential materials which are needed for energy.</P>
    <P>Part IV is a long list of exceptions. This was referred to by Senator Cooney when he said that perhaps it was ridiculous.  The customs service found in practice that these exceptions were necessary for proper administration. It is necessary for them to have such a list so that they do not have to hold up certain goods for export licence.</P>
    <P>Senator Jago inquired whether the order controlling exports comes before the Oireachtas for approval.  It does not, but the order, when made, can be annulled by either House of the Oireachtas.  He also mentioned the recent strike at Haulbowline steel mills and asked whether licences permitting the export of steel scrap were granted. No licences were granted during the strike except for stainless steel scrap and scrap derived from the breaking up of ships.  Stainless steel scrap cannot be used by the Cork steel men.  There is a Community law which requires that ship breaking scrap must be allowed free export.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan referred to whether or not antiques should be included under the Bill.  He mentioned antiques which I would consider to be archaeological objects.  Such archaeological objects, documents, paintings and so on can be controlled by the Minister for Education under existing legislation operated by his Department. Senator Lanigan and Senator Conroy referred to the copper scrap and copper alloy.  Due to adverse conditions in the copper scrap market here the processing of copper has largely ceased.  That is why we are asking for a share of the Community quota, which is appointed for export to third <Col N="375" /> countries each year.  Senator Conroy asked what our share of the quota was.  The share of the present quota is 337 metric tonnes.</P>
    <P>The EEC does not exercise control over strategic goods.  The strategic control derives from our need to adhere to NATO regulations on strategic controls in the interests of certain Irish manufacturers who have to import components on the strategics list.</P>
    <P>Quality control, which was mentioned by Senator Mulcahy, is a matter which is under considerable discussion within the Department.  At present the situation is that the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards formulate standards for certain home-produced products which, of course, would apply to exports as well as to goods sold on the home market.  The whole subject of quality control is, as I have said, being discussed and if we feel legislation is necessary, and obviously Senator Mulcahy feels that there is a need for such legislation, the Government will not be found wanting in introducing it.</P>
    <P>I again thank all those who took part in the debate and who assisted in getting this Stage of it through as quickly as possible.  I hope, if possible, to get through all Stages this evening.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <P>The Bill is required to give effect to the announcement by the Taoiseach in the Dáil on 5th July last that Ministers would be appointed who would not be members of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From time to time reference is made to ours being a young State.  Such an <Col N="376" /> observation carries with it a danger that we might underestimate the age of our political and administrative institutions and, therefore, fail to adapt them to the issues and circumstances which face us today.  Furthermore, the accelerating pace of change in the post-war years makes it essential that we should, on occasion, look closely at the suitability of our institutions in a changing world.  In the area of Government, this is an appropriate time for such a review.</P>
    <P>The danger to which I referred has, for quite a period now, been appreciated where the public service is concerned.  A general consciousness that segments of the civil service and many of its procedures antedated the foundation of the State prompted the initiation of the inquiry which culminated in the Report of the Public Services Organisation Review Group and the subsequent public debate on the necessity for keeping the machinery of Government under constant review.  There has, until recently, been less awareness of the necessity for adapting the arrangements for ministerial direction of Government Departments and public agencies.  This is not surprising.  I think it was only those holding ministerial office who were fully aware of the burdens placed upon them by a combination of political, administrative and representational duties and even Ministers were inclined, perhaps, to regard these burdens as either an inevitable concomitant of office or the ephemeral product of exceptional times.</P>
    <P>Up to 1937, the maximum number of Ministers permitted by the Constitution was 12; in addition the Ministers and Secretaries Acts provided for up to seven Parliamentary Secretaries. Under Bunreacht na hÉireann the maximum number of Ministers was increased to 15; the maximum number of Parliamentary Secretaries permitted by law remained at seven.  In the 40 years since then no change has occurred in the limits on the number of members of the Government or of Parliamentary Secretaries.</P>
    <P>Given the changes which our society has undergone in the same period, it <Col N="377" /> would, to say the very least, be surprising if some modification in those arrangements were not now required. In so far as the assignment of tasks between members of the Government and other Ministers is concerned this Bill proposes the necessary reforms.</P>
    <P>It might be appropriate for me, at this stage, to outline some of the changes in the business of Government which have come about since 1924 and to indicate their relevance to the present measure.  The range of Government activity in 1924 was not, by present standards, extensive.  Government activity in the social and economic fields was limited and international matters did not occupy a significant part of the time of Ministers generally.  All in all, the size of the Government was by any standards adequate to deal with the work assigned to their members.  Since then, and particularly in recent years, the volume of Government business has increased several fold.  For practical purposes, no attempt has been made to lighten the load on Ministers and there is now widespread recognition that the burden is becoming unbearable.</P>
    <P>The expansion of Government business and involvement in the daily life of the citizens is reflected in the growth of the administrative machine for which Ministers are directly or indirectly responsible.  The civil service itself has expanded from some 20,000 to almost 50,000 members.  A range of State-sponsored bodies employing 60,000 people has emerged in the same period and there has been a parallel growth in the numbers employed by local and health authorities.  I need scarcely point out that the supervision, control and direction of the activities of these services has been reflected in the workloads of Ministers.</P>
    <P>Development of the mass media and the emergence of a more vocal public opinion have also added to ministerial workloads.  Ministers are frequently called upon to explain their policies on radio, television and, indeed, at social gatherings.  The evolution of organised interest groups in almost every sector of national life combines with this trend towards more open Government <Col N="378" /> to require that politically responsible figures be available for consultation on proposed or desired legislative and administrative changes.  Ministers have, in recent years, accommodated themselves to these trends by extra effort so that, but for developments outside our domestic scene, we might have been tempted to perpetuate the 1924 arrangements.  It is, however, the transformation of our position in international affairs which makes such an approach unacceptable.</P>
    <P>International regulation or agreed action by several states on matters of mutual concern has been intensified in recent decades and proliferation of international conferences on topics as diverse as economics and aviation law frequently require representation at the highest level.  While such conferences arise intermittently, it is generally accepted that the heaviest and most constant burden has been imposed by our membership of the European Communities.  I think that everyone accepted at the time that Ireland's entry to the European Communities in 1973 was bound to impose new burdens on the machinery of government.  Few, however, foresaw the extent to which those burdens would increase in a short span of years or predicted how heavy would be the load imposed on individual members of the Government. Apart from the constant demands of travel abroad.  Ministers must also have time to reflect on, and to evaluate, Community policies and to consult with their colleagues at home.  If they have not got the time to do so, our position in the Community will be prejudiced; if time has to be made at the expense of domestic affairs, the quality of government will suffer.</P>
    <P>All sides of the House now recognise that these developments have produced a situation which threatens the effective functioning of government.</P>
    <P>The constitutional limitation on the number of members of the Government precludes, without a referendum, an increase in ministerial strength.  This Bill, therefore, seeks to remedy the problem by the creation of a new office of Minister who will not be a member of the Government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="379" /> As I have already mentioned, the Constitution states that the Government shall consist of not more than 15 members.  It also provides that the executive power shall, subject to the provisions of the Constitution, be exercised by or on the authority of the Government; the Government shall be responsible to Dáil Éireann and shall meet and act as a collective authority and shall be collectively responsible for the Departments of State administered by the members of the Government. The Ministers and Secretaries Acts provide for not more than seven Parliamentary Secretaries to Ministers. The Parliamentary Secretaries are, in effect, junior Ministers.</P>
    <P>The Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1939, provides for the delegation by Government order of the statutory powers of a Minister to his Parliamentary Secretary subject to certain conditions which are necessary to comply with the provisions of the Constitution. The main features of these conditions are that the Minister remains responsible to Dáil Éireann for the delegated powers; the powers delegated remain concurrently vested in the Minister and they are exercisable by the Parliamentary Secretary under the general superintendence and control of the Minister. Parliamentary Secretaries can undertake many of the statutory duties of a Minister but their main contribution has been in the lightening of his Parliamentary task and in the discharge of the many duties which, though not statutory, are integral elements of ministerial office.  The time has now come when the support to Ministers needs to be significantly strengthened.</P>
    <P>To begin at the domestic level, it is a fact of life that it is difficult to secure full acceptance for the discharge of ministerial functions in a representative or executive capacity by a man who not only lacks the title of Minister but is designated as the Parliamentary Secretary to a Minister. Abroad, the term Minister of State is fairly commonly recognised as meaning a junior Minister occupying an office immediately below Cabinet rank and carries more prestige and, therefore, more weight than the title of <Col N="380" /> Parliamentary Secretary.  The assignment of the title Minister for State to these Ministers, therefore, provides an opportunity by which a much greater delegation of functions to them will be acceptable at home and abroad.  This Bill, therefore, proposes to create ten posts of Minister of State and to repeal the provisions of the Ministers and Secretaries Acts dealing with Parliamentary Secretaries, thereby abolishing that office.  It is intended on the appointment of the Ministers of State to assign to them wider and heavier responsibilities than have hitherto been assigned to Parliamentary Secretaries.</P>
    <P>Provision is, therefore, made for the appointment of Ministers of State and the delegation to them, subject to such reservation of ministerial powers and responsibility as the Constitution requires, of statutory powers and duties of Ministers.  The Bill also provides for the abolition of the office of Parliamentary Secretary through the repeal of the relevant sections of the Ministers and Secretaries Acts.  A number of consequential amendments to existing legislation arising from these provisions are also included.  For instance, the title &ldquo;Minister of State&rdquo; is defined in the Interpretation Act, 1937 as a &ldquo;member of the Government in charge of a Department of State&rdquo; and is used in this sense in a number of subsequential enactments. It is, therefore, necessary, to make two legislative amendments.  The first is that, in legislation enacted after the passing of this Act, the expression &ldquo;Minister of State&rdquo; will no longer mean a member of the Government having charge of a Department of State and that in previous legislation the old meaning will continue to apply. The second is that there should be a new expression to describe, in future, legislation, a member of the Government having charge of a Department of State.  The most unsuitable expression is, I think, Minister of the Government.</P>
    <P>Our <i>corpus</i> of statute law includes one reference to a Parliamentary Secretary outside the Ministers and Secretaries Acts.  This occurs in section 11 (2) of the Defence Act, 1954, where the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence is included in the <Col N="381" /> membership of the Council of Defence. Section 5 of the Bill alters this reference.</P>
    <P>Apart from these consequential amendments, the Bill contains three further changes.  One of these, in section 3, is a technical section designed to remove a doubt about proof of orders made by a Parliamentary Secretary or, in future, a Minister of State.  The other two changes embody departures in the case of Ministers of State from the arrangements governing the tenure of Parliamentary Secretaries and their assignment to Ministers.</P>
    <P>A Parliamentary Secretary at present ceases to hold office on the dissolution of the House of the Oireachtas to which he belonged. Parliamentary Secretaries who were not Members of this House therefore ceased to hold office on the dissolution of the Dáil but could, if re-elected, be re-appointed by an outgoing Government pending the reconvening of the Dáil.  This procedure was based on an assumption that the duties of Parliamentary Secretaries were related to parliamentary duties and took no account of their evolution into political directors of large blocks of Government work.  This Bill provides that Ministers of State shall continue in office notwithstanding a dissolution of the House to which they belong.</P>
    <P>As they stand, the Ministers and Secretaries Acts preclude the appointment of more than one Parliamentary Secretary to each Minister.  Recent experience has shown that imbalances between the responsibilities of various Ministers could become so great that the assignment of more than one Parliamentary Secretary to a single Minister might be required to offset them. This Bill accordingly imposes no similar restriction on the assignment of Ministers of State.</P>
    <P>Finally, I might mention that provision as in section 8 of the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1939, which provides for the right of audience of a Parliamentary Secretary in that House of the Oireachtas of which he is not a Member, is not being made in this Bill.  Doubts have been expressed as to whether this provision was in conflict with Article 15.10 of the Constitution <Col N="382" /> which provides that each House shall make its own Rules and Standing Orders.  In fact, the Standing Orders of each House provide that a Parliamentary Secretary who is a Member of the other House may be heard.  I would, if I may, a Chathaoirligh, draw your attention to the amendment of Standing Order No. 45 of this House which will be required if Ministers of State are to be heard in this House.</P>
    <P>This Bill then, is a recognition that the limits on the number of Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries which have existed for the past 40 years are in need of review.  The Government's proposals are modest; indeed it may be argued that we are not going far enough and that we might well have retained the office of Parliamentary Secretary in addition to the new office of Minister of State.  I believe, however, that they are the most suitable to our needs and conditions.  They have the merit that they are simple in that there is to be a single tier below the level of Minister of the Government and at the same time, although the net increase in the number of offices is three, the increased allocation of responsibilities which is intended will be of substantial assistance to Ministers.</P>
    <P>This Government are committed to substantial reforms in the structure of our administration.  The actions proposed in this Bill are part of that process, and will have the effect of relieving Ministers of some of their growing workload in such areas as parliamentary and representational duties.  Other proposals under consideration should help to lessen the involvement of Ministers in matters of administrative detail.  I believe that Ministers are in need of such adjustments in the range of their activities, which will make for greater effectiveness in the conduct of the nation's affairs.  I, therefore, recommend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on his appointment.  I say that without prejudice to things we may have to say to him as an embryonic corporation sole when we discuss Item No. 2 on the Order Paper later on.  It is common case between all sides that <Col N="383" /> the burdens which have been falling on Ministers in recent years have been such as to make it imperative that they be relieved of those burdens.  The Minister has indicated that this can adversely affect Ministers in two ways. Many Ministers have obligations abroad to the country as well as departmental obligations at home.  In trying to discharge both of these functions correctly and adequately many fall between two stools and may end up discharging neither duty as comprehensively as it deserves.  Sometimes they try to discharge these duties at the expense of their health.  We have unfortunate examples of Ministers' lives being jeopardized by the burden and pressures of their office.  It is only right that they should get some relief.</P>
      <P>The office I had the honour to fill did not involve much business abroad. Nonetheless, it was interesting to note that whenever I had to go abroad I had to attend two types of gatherings, namely, meetings of Ministers for Justice and meetings of Ministers for the Interior.  I was the only Minister to attend both.  Every other European country had a separate Minister for Justice and Minister for the Interior. I understand that a similar need now exists here.  Our new Leader has recognised this and in his allocation of spokesmen in the Dáil he has divided what was the portfolio of Justice into law reform and security.  That is a proper division and is a reform which will be needed.  As a Minister with no external responsibility, I can see how great that burden was on my colleagues and the members of the present Government who have to discharge obligations as well as at home.  There is no doubt that the situation requires reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was interested to hear the Minister say that segments of the civil service and many of its procedures ante-dated the foundantion of the State.  I read recently an interesting biography of Samuel Pepys who can be described as the first professional, full-time civil servant.  It was very interesting for me, having just completed four years in office on close contact with the members of the civil service, <Col N="384" /> to read extracts from memoranda written by Pepys in the late 1600s and to see how in phrasing, in intent and in form the same spirit still pervades much of what takes place in the public service.  I do not say that in any spirit of criticism because what inspired those memoranda was a desire to be careful, conscientious and thorough; to keep the file right, as is often said rather pejoratively, but that is unfair. The integrity of the public service&mdash; I do not mean that in a material sense &mdash;in approach and conscientiousness is a very valuable element.  Happily, that has not changed.  I hope the civil service will always have that element as a dominating feature of its cooperative personality.  Nevertheless, the world is changing and expanding and the processes of bureaucracy are much more complex than heretofore in the history of the western world and Governments must keep pace with these changes.</P>
    <P>What is proposed in this Bill, welcome as it is as an indication of recognition of the problem and as a tentative step towards solving it, is not at all adequate to meet the needs.  In essence, what is proposed here is a change of name for Parliamentary Secretaries and the provision of three extra Parliamentary Secretaries.  The reasons for the proposals are, first, it will give them greater status abroad because people abroad do not know what a Parliamentary Secretary is; secondly it will give them greater status at home when representing their Minister.  This is a rather weak argument and is perhaps a bow towards the modern cult of the status-giving euphemism and nothing more than that.  Parliamentary Secretaries, as presently designated, could be given greater powers without any need to change their name or pretending to people abroad or at home that they are anything other than what they are, that is, a lower tier of Government Minister.  To present such a change as a reform is slightly misleading.  What would be more important would be the creation of extra personnel, over and above the three provided for here.  Then, there would be three tiers.  Ministers of the Government, junior Ministers or Ministers <Col N="385" /> of State, or whatever name they may have, and Parliamentary Secretaries. The number and extent of duties which must be discharged could fall into three categories in most Government Departments, especially in the economic Departments and in those Departments which have to do much business abroad.  So, until we see if there will be any increase in the powers and functions given to these new Ministers we will not know whether the reform is worthwhile or whether it is no more than elegant window-dressing, so that when our representatives go abroad they will not feel self-conscious or anything less than their colleagues with whom they sit.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that it is intended, when these Ministers are appointed, to assign them wider and heavier responsibilities than have hitherto been assigned to Parliamentary Secretaries. I am puzzled as to why it is not possible at this stage to tell the House what those wider and heavier responsibilities are.  If we were informed about them we could then cast a different eye on this legislation and the debate would be more meaningful.  As the Bill stands &mdash; the Minister will correct me if I am wrong &mdash; all it is doing, is calling Parliamentary Secretaries Ministers of State.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it was impossible administratively or because the exact functions had not been thought out and decided that the matter was not put into the Bill.  If they have not been thought out, I would prefer if the Government had waited longer to introduce this Bill.  Their creditability, in terms of discharging their manifesto, would not have been damaged in any way by waiting a few months more in order to make this a real Bill so that we would know precisely what reforms are intended in this important area of Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke of the fact that the Government are committed to substantial reforms in the structure of our administration.  Again, it would have been interesting and helpful for the House to understand how the Government's mind is working in this regard. Will we have more Ministers than the ten proposed here?  Will there be more <Col N="386" /> juggling around with Departments? What will happen to the Devlin Report? There are numerous questions which could be asked as to what reforms are proposed.  It is a disappointment that in this Bill, which is presented as a radical reform in Government structure, there is merely a reference to commitment to further reform. If the matter had not been thought out, analysed and finally decided upon, I would prefer if it had been left in abeyance until it had, and then we could have a comprehensive debate on the whole business.  When matters are thought out this Bill could be totally unnecessary and might be superceded or changed significantly.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that other proposals under consideration should help to lessen the involvement of Ministers in matters of administrative detail. Again that is a commendable objective, but what precisely does it mean? What is it going to mean in terms of day-to-day operations for a Minister? The thought behind the Bill is acceptable to us but I am greatly disappointed that the Bill does not do anything other than change the name of Parliamentary Secretary into Minister for State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has dealt in a pretty broad speech with all aspects of the need for this Bill which is the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 1977.  I expect all of us will agree, looking back to over 50 years ago, about the increase in the need for public administration, for Departments of State, and about the need which arose for the creation of semi-State bodies on such a broad scale as we have.  Such bodies as Bord na Móna, Bord Bainne, and so on are engaging industrially in almost all aspects of life including the rural area.  Where 50 years ago nobody was involved on behalf of the State in this area, there are now something over 60,000 engaged in those bodies alone.  As the Minister pointed out, in direct State involvement, that is of State administration, Departments of State and so on, there is a very large increase in the number of personnel necessary to maintain the machinery of State.  If one looks at that area and then at the number of political <Col N="387" /> executives working to those Departments, with their assistants in the form of Parliamentary Secretaries, as permitted under the existing Acts and under the Oireachtas, one must admit immediately that there is a need to expand the number of those available from the Government side of the House to carry out the work of the various Departments.</P>
      <P>Even though this Bill merely enables Parliamentary Secretaries to be described as Ministers of State and their numbers to be increased by three, it still does give some degree of delegation to Ministers who, we all agree, must be hard pressed.  The increasing complexity of modem life with the undoubtedly late hours that members of our Government have to endure within our State alone, apart from what may be required abroad, does make necessary some changes as set out in this Bill.  It is important also, to point out that the measures do permit that any Member of either House may be appointed as one of the new Ministers of State.  There are seven Parliamentary Secretaries and there will now be ten Ministers of State, which is merely an increase of three.  Senator Cooney was suggesting that we might need more but that is all that is being proposed at present by the Government</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Cooney took exception to the argument that the change of title would give additional status to those who were hitherto Parliamentary Secretaries.  I do not think the Senator is right.  Status is important You would be very much more impressed by a chief superintendent of the Garda if he were to call to your House than you would if he were just an ordinary garda.  The opinion was expressed quite widely recently that Parliamentary Secretaries travelling to Europe do not have the prestige of people who would be described as Ministers.  That is a fact of life that must exist in every country.  One needs only, for example, illustrate the difference between what is understood by the title of Senator in this country and in the United States.  One need only travel in the United States to find <Col N="388" /> this extraordinary difference in attitude.  I am not suggesting for a moment, a Leas-Chathaoirleach, that Members of our Seanad do not qualify for the same status as US Senators. Nevertheless it comes down to the attitude of people towards titles in office and it seems that the title of Minister is the more appropriate, particularly abroad.  It is a good argument in itself.</P>
    <P>On the question of the additional labours and burdens on Ministers of Government and Parliamentary Secretaries I can do no better than quote from the Minister present in the House who said that, apart from constant demands of travel abroad, Ministers must also have time to reflect on and to evaluate community policies and to consult with their colleagues at home. If they have not the time to do so our position in the Community will be prejudiced.  If this time has to be made at the expense of domestic affairs the quality of Government will suffer.</P>
    <P>Everybody would agree that over the last 25 years&mdash;and that covers several administrations &mdash; from time to time one has been conscious that Ministers have been under too great a stress and perhaps have not been able to devote the amount of mental leisure time &mdash; if I might so describe it &mdash; to the responsibilities of fulfilling their office.  In this sense I totally agree with the Minister in what he has said.  Another aspect that has been touched on by, I think, members of the Opposition in the other House in discussion on this Bill, is the extraordinarily late hours which, the Council of Ministers or any section of Ministers seem to keep when they have to decide on anything. Reading the debate reminded me of the old allegation that we Irish never knew when to go to bed, that we insisted on staying up late every night.</P>
    <P>It seems that the Council of Ministers when they get into something tough cannot decide anything before 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning.  We should not be expecting a Minister&mdash; that is a member of the Government&mdash; to continue to operate in that fashion if at the same time that same individual has to be back here for a Dáil meeting at 10.30 the following morning. <Col N="389" /> It may be an advantage to some Ministers to be able to ring and say, &ldquo;Get the Minister of State to stand in for me tomorrow morning in Dáil Éireann.&rdquo;  That is another added reason, apart from those given, that we should be supporting a measure of this kind and perhaps even going a bit further in order to assist any Government in office, and in particular this Government, to do a better job of government.  I support this measure and welcome what the Minister has said about the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, support this Bill and I join with the Senators who feel that, if anything it has not gone far enough in constituting a measure restructuring the Government and expanding the personnel of the Government. As the Minister said, there is a constitutional restraint.  The Government cannot be greater than the number of 15 provided in the 1937 Constitution unless there is an amendment which would involve a referendum. This measure attempts to expand the personnel involved without having to go through the difficult process of a constitutional amendment and referendum. The purpose of the Bill is to change the number of people involved from a total of 22 to a total of 25. This seems to be inadequate, given the shared view from all sides of the House that the functions and responsibilities of Government have increased very substantially over the last few years internally and have been further aggravated by the obligations of membership of the European Community and other international organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was disappointed that the Minister when introducing the Bill did not give any insight into possible Government thinking on the relationship between Ministers and Departments and on the approach by Ministers to the workload of the Government.  His speech seemed to dwell on the factual reasons for the increase in workload, and then to provide that the post of Parliamentary Secretary would be abolished and would be replaced by a Minister of State with the number increased to ten.  He made the point, with which I agree, that Ministers of State would have greater standing externally <Col N="390" /> where the post of Parliamentary Secretary is not well understood and where a person going as a Parliamentary Secretary might be thought not to be able to take major decisions and not to be able to bind the Government or the Minister at home to a decision.</P>
    <P>However that is a very superficial approach to the real problem.  The real problem is to ensure that the whole administration of Government responds to the challenges and difficulties of modern Government administration. We have had much more evidence of thinking about possible reform of the public service than we have had of reform of political decision-making and Government responsibility.  I would have welcomed more elaboration from the Minister or any Government thinking in this area.</P>
    <P>The question of membership of the European Community has already been referred to as both increasing and extending the responsibilities of Ministers of the Government, and of Ministers of State when created.  I notice from recent reports on developments in the European Communities that there has been a tendency from time to time to have representation at a meeting of Council of Ministers by a head of Department rather than by a political figure such as the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary.  It is essential that at those meetings, which are political meetings where political decisions are taken, it is the political figure who is there.  I have noticed in particular regard to the Department of Agriculture that at the meetings of the Council of Ministers for Agriculture the Secretary of the Department is sometimes the representative of Ireland.  The Secretary of the Department is not accountable politically.  He is a civil servant and although he obviously would have a great knowledge of his field he is not politically responsible.  Even though the burden of membership of the European Community put strains on Ministers, even though there is a very substantial travel component involved and it may be difficult to decide whether to give priority to an important meeting or responsibility at home or a meeting of the Council of Ministers, it is important that an Irish politician be at <Col N="391" /> every meeting of the Council of Ministers.</P>
    <P>Ministers must be prepared to be accountable for draft proposals and policy discussions at the European level by participating at meetings of the Joint Committee on European Community Secondary Legislation, if we ever manage to get that joint committee re-established.  Previous experience of the joint committee, which was established in 1973 and carried on until last May, was that there was a failure to have a political dialogue between members of the committee scrutinising draft regulations, directives and other Community proposals and the responsible Minister.  The committee had improved very substantially in their relationship with the officials from the relevant Departments and there were useful and constructive meetings between officials and members of that joint committee in sub-committee in private, but obviously the civil servants could speak only on the facts and they could not be expected to comment on policy matters.  Very often in those sub-committee sessions it was precisely the policy content, the attitude of the Government and the attitude of the relevant Minister which the committee wanted to know and in a sense needed to know.  The failure&mdash;a very significant failure&mdash;was not to be able to achieve a dialogue with the responsible Ministers and achieve an accountability for attitudes taken by Irish Ministers at the European Community level.</P>
    <P>There are a very significant number of matters in the pipeline at the moment where Irish Ministers at the European Community level are having to take very difficult and serious decisions in areas which will have an enormous effect on the lives, job prospects and general environment of people living in this country, but there is no real parliamentary accountability. There may occasionally be a possibility of asking a question, putting down a motion or raising something on the Adjournment but there is no accountability to Members of both Houses in an informed way by the Ministers involved.  I would hope that <Col N="392" /> the Government, whether through Ministers of Government or Ministers of State, will be prepared to establish political dialogue with the Parliamentary Joint Committee on important policy areas at the European Community level.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to respond usefully on Second Stage of this Bill because we do not have a real indication of how the Government are going to use the power to create three new posts and to have ten Ministers of State.  There have been rumours, it is difficult to assert how reliable, of what appointments may be made.  Rather than just a statement about the increase in the responsibilities and the workload of the present Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries I would have preferred an assessment of the areas where there is a need for a Minister for State because of the substantial need to expand in a particular area.  I can think of areas of concern to myself.  I would very much welcome a Minister for State with responsibility for family law reform, and I would get up and cheer if I heard of that as one of the areas of responsibility.  The House should be entitled to know more about Government thinking in the area, and there should not be a kind of speculation as to which of the boys are going to get the jobs.  There should be a more considered approach than this to the problem, and there is a very substantial need for expansion of political responsibility at ministerial level in law reform particularly family law reform and in the law relating to children.</P>
    <P>There are other areas where there are Parliamentary Secretaries without the key responsibilities that one would imagine necessary for their creation. For example, I cannot understand why there should be a need for a parliamentary Secretary in the Department of Defence.  There are some other areas too, where it does not seem to be quite appropriate.  I would have welcomed some idea of what the Government thinking was.</P>
    <P>One persistent rumour&mdash;and it appears more than a rumour; the Taoiseach has made known his intention&mdash; is the creation of a Minister of State <Col N="393" /> for Northern Ireland.  That would be a very important policy decision.  I should like to support the arguments put forward about the way in which, if there is a Minister of State for Northern Ireland, he should discharge his responsibilities. I should like to refer to and support the reasoning of Deputy Garret FitzGerald in the other House on the point.  I refer to the debate of 2nd November, at column 80 of the Official Report, where he opposed the idea of establishing a separate Northern Ireland section in the office of the Taoiseach and said this would be undesirable. His reasoning was very strong. If I may quote briefly from it he said:</P>
    <P>The reason for this is quite simple. The whole relationship between Ireland and the United Kingdom, including the relationship with Northern Ireland, is so complex and the different elements interact so closely that you cannot divide off Northern Ireland relations with other Irish relations.  In fact, in the Department itself you will find that right down to the lowest diplomatic level each officer is engaged simultaneously in work related to Northern Ireland and Anglo-Irish relations generally.  To try to take out the Northern Ireland aspect and bring it over to the Taoiseach's office would be a grave mistake and, therefore, if it is in the Taoiseach's mind to appoint a Minister of State for Northern Ireland I would hope that that Minister of State would continue to work with the existing staff in the Department of Foreign Affairs and be Minister for State to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Taoiseach.  This is important for many reasons including the fact that there is a danger of our being divided in dealing with the United Kingdom Government, a Government which could at times have its own reasons for finding it useful to deal with different Departments on aspects of the same problem which are closely interlocked.</P>
    <P>That is very sound reasoning.  We must be wary of weakening our approach in relation to negotiations for Northern Ireland by having a sort of sectoral divide between what would be <Col N="394" /> regarded as Northern Ireland relations and general Anglo-Irish relations. There is a great deal to be said for ensuring that there is a concerted approach and that the officials who have built up very commendable expertise in the area are those who will be involved in assisting the Minister of State for Northern Ireland, if there is a decision to appoint such a person.</P>
    <P>I would have welcomed more evidence of Government thinking on the reform of the structures of Government. There is an oblique hint of it at the end of the Minister's speech, but he does not give an indication how Ministers will be able to devote more time to the more creative aspects of their ministerial responsibility.  I would welcome some elaboration on this.</P>
    <P>In a sense, it would involve thinking about how Ministers can establish better priority in parcelling out their time.  This might involve certain policy decisions in relation to the amount of time that will be spent on constituency work and the amount of time that will be spent on meeting delegations, or how steps could be taken to ensure that Ministers had adequate time, and indeed, protection in order to be able to address themselves to the very serious responsibilities of initiating legislation, of taking policy decisions in important areas and of having enough time, not just to attend meetings of the Council of Ministers, but also to have time to prepare with their colleagues in the other capitals, and to prepare before the meeting itself in order that the Irish position is well understood, in order to have a very good grasp of what the actual priorities and pre-occupations of the other Ministers who are debating in the Council of Ministers might be.</P>
    <P>This is particularly important for Ireland because we have tended in a European Community context to be regarded as having a begging bowl approach, that that is the beginning and end of our membership of the European Community.  There is a very real need for us to ensure that Ireland's contribution at the European Community level is seen to be a constructive and thoughtful contribution on <Col N="395" /> the whole development of the European Community and that we are not just simply trying to milk the various types of aids that there may be, that we can put our case very strongly as an underdeveloped or less developed region with problems of being on the periphery of the European Community. We can also play a full part in the ongoing policies at that level and we can ensure that our problems and preoccupations are understood by allowing Ministers time and, indeed, insisting upon them taking time to make the case.  If they are to do this more effectively, part of that is to establish more accountability, particularly to Members of both Houses on their return from meetings of the Council of Ministers and of the Committee of Political Co-operation.</P>
    <P>Members of the House would acknowledge the increase in volume and responsibility which the Minister referred to when talking about the duties of Ministers.  We would welcome greater insights into Government thinking about the precise relationship between Ministers and their Departments, about how the responsibilities of Government will be discharged and, in particular, I would welcome specific responses to the question of the creation of a political dialogue between Ministers who go to meetings at the European level and the Joint Committee on European Community Legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join very briefly in welcoming this very necessary and workmanlike Bill. The Minister, in his excellent introduction to it, indicated very clearly the need for this measure, but I do not think we realise to what an enormous extent the growth of ministerial duties has occurred over the past 50 years.  We have changed from a society in which by and large ministerial duties were of a <i>laissez-faire</i> nature to a society in which it is expected that Government and Ministers take an active interest in a far wider range of matters than was customary a generation ago.  Quite apart from that, this country itself has changed enormously internally.  The burden of <Col N="396" /> duties on the Minister for Industry and Commerce, or the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy as he is now, is far, far greater than it was in the early days of the State when we were basically an agricultural country.</P>
      <P>There has been an enormous growth in departmental demands upon Ministers.  Yet, at the same time, we have accompanying this, and very noticeable, particularly over the past few years I understand, a growth in the volume of constituency work.  Ministers in this State are generally elected Members of the Dáil or of our House here.  They are also, therefore, practising constituency workers.  They are TDs in a given area.  They have to attend to this volume of constituency work as well as attend to their ministerial duties.  Even without ministerial duties, the amount of work and the demands upon a TD's time in this day and age are very severe, indeed.  At times I wonder how it is possible for a Minister to discharge effectively and fully constituency work and, at the same time, give the time and thought necessary to his departmental duties. It must be extremely difficult at times.</P>
      <P>Remember also that, having multi-member constituencies, we do not have the situation which pertains in the UK where the number of constituencies in which there is likely to be a serious contest is relatively limited.  There is a contest obviously in all our constituencies.  In the UK, whether of the Labour Government or the previous Conservative Government, the majority of Ministers are Ministers in safe seats, as they are called.  This puts them in a very different light as compared with the situation pertaining over here.  At the same time&mdash;admittedly it is a far larger country&mdash;the type of duties at ministerial level is not so very different in respect of the size of the country. The type and nature of the duties and the demands of such duties are very similar in a large or a small country, and in this sense, our endeavour to exist with such a very small number of Ministers is putting quite an intolerable burden upon these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As well as that, we have now, of course, joined the European Economic <Col N="397" /> Community and it is, indeed, very necessary that we be represented in the EEC at ministerial level whenever possible.  Once again, we find ourselves with a relatively small number of Ministers competing&mdash;and let us face it, a lot of work in the EEC is competing&mdash;to see that we get our fair share of the various matters discussed at the EEC, that we make our full contribution, that our point of view is clearly heard and understood.  It is a very different point of view from that of the other member states for a variety of reasons.  Therefore, it is necessary that our Ministers be there. Yet, again, they find that they have to turn up to perhaps five or six different meetings as compared with their opposite numbers in the United Kingdom, in France, Italy or West Germany or, indeed, Holland or Belgium.  The number of Ministers is far greater and the relative strain on any one Minister is, therefore, very much reduced.</P>
    <P>Many of their Ministers complain of the effort and strain their EEC duties necessitate.  I do not know how it is possible for our Ministers to commute backwards and forwards to Brussels with all the very heavy strain which this constant tiredness of travel, plane connections, and all the rest of it, involves. Certainly, there must be quite a definite health hazard for a Minister who, week in week out, month in month out, year in year out, are trying to combine the strain of going backwards and forwards to Brussels with their departmental work here in Dublin and also perform their constituency duties.  There is very little we can do about this.  The appointment of these extra Ministers is a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>We will probably have to appoint a large number of other Ministers.  One possible step might be the appointment, as has been done in certain wartime circumstances, of a resident Minister in Brussels, someone who would be permanently there.  It might, perhaps, to some extent, but only to some extent, alleviate the burden on Ministers travelling backwards and forwards.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="398" /> Incidentally, there has been some mention of Ireland being represented by heads of the Departments.  I do not think it is fully realised just what an enoromus burden has been placed on the Irish civil service by our accession to Brussels.  There is a vast mass of documentation, an enormous number of committees and sub-committees, and so on, which our civil servants are endeavouring to deal with.  Again it is a relatively small civil service compared with the vast bureaucracies of the United Kingdom, of France of West Germany.  I must say our civil servants have acquitted themselves admirably in all these circumstances.</P>
    <P>Many civil services elsewhere have as their head civil servant someone called a vice-Minister.  This again is a great aid in some ways to such countries although it can produce some confusion. Our title of Parliamentary Secretary was a totally inappropriate title. Nobody outside these islands really understood what on earth a Parliamentary Secretary was.  It was very much overdue that he should be called what in fact he is, certainly travelling overseas, and that is a Minister.  The increase in number up to ten is a very sensible initial step, an extra three Ministers.  For a start this is excellent but it will be necessary in time, certainly, to increase the number of Ministers.</P>
    <P>This Bill is very necessary at this early stage in Government.  We have a Government who will govern, a Government who are getting their guidelines right and setting the scene.  One of the steps is the initiation of the Department which the Minister represents. It is a very necessary step if we have a Government who will not only react to events but endeavour to anticipate them and have a strategic policy. Towards this end, this measure of appointing Ministers of State, and having ten of them, is a further very useful and necessary measure.  Over and beyond that, there will have to be at some early stage&mdash;and perhaps the Minister and the Government have it in mind&mdash;a general review of ministerial duties and to what extent Cabinet duties can be separated from departmental duties, which are duties of another and very different nature.  I <Col N="399" /> very much welcome this Bill.  It is a very necessary and workmanlike measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with those who addressed themselves to this Bill introduced by the Minister and to welcome it in so far as it goes. I should like to join with the chorus which subscribes to the view that it simply does not go far enough and really tackle our fundamental problems in so far as the Executive are concerned.  I agree with Senator Conroy who spoke before me about the burden on members of the Executive, on Ministers in the Cabinet, in particular, especially since our entry to the EEC.  The burden of work is great having regard to the constituency setup, having regard to the multi-seat position, and having regard to the constituency situation in particular where Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries in a constituency sense are competing with colleagues in their own party as much as they are with the Opposition.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the extraordinary extent to which people at the highest level in Government are expected to become involved in constituency affairs, and not merely affairs of major significance but those of the greatest detail, having regard to the extent to which Ministers are expected to attend functions, dinner dances, seminars, public meetings of various bodies, institutions, and so on, having regard to the work within the environs of this establishment in which we are speaking and the necessary attendance at Cabinet and parliamentary meetings, the involvement with delegations from various parts of the country and inter-parliamentary work with their colleagues, the burden is frightening and fairly intolerable and leads to very undesirable effects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At one level, at a political level, the most undesirable effect of all is that if the Minister in question is not prepared to work at a level which is medically entirely inadvisable then you get weak direction in his Department.  Unless he is prepared to attempt to do the work of three or four people, he cannot possibly begin to establish the necessary <Col N="400" /> political control in the Department. If the Minister opts for a more civilised form of life, then, by definition, there is an opting out of political control and you have government within that Department by the civil service.</P>
    <P>Alternatively, if the Minister works to the inordinate extent which might be demanded if he is to attempt to run his Department having regard to his other responsibilities, you get effective government within that Department but it is at an appalling price. We have seen the price which has been paid by Members of the Oireachtas, individual Members and at ministerial level.  We have seen deaths resulting from people attempting to work at the pace I have described and attempting to drive cars at the pace I have described.</P>
    <P>The addition of three Parliamentary Secretaries and the upgrading of the title of Parliamentary Secretary to that of Minister of State is welcome.  Any lessening of the burden, particularly on the senior Ministers in the economic Ministries, and in the Department of Justice, for example, is very welcome. This only goes a small part of the way. It is piecemeal and it does not smack of the reform which is necessary.  There is a weakness in the extension of the Parliamentary Secretary idea in the adding of three to the list.  This does not necessarily mean that government will be all that much more effective.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson referred to an interesting speech made by Deputy FitzGerald in the Dáil on this subject. He attempted to describe a Minister's working week.  His summary of the position&mdash;without having regard to the EEC involvement, the necessity for travel and the preparation for meetings in Brussels, and the summary of such meetings afterwards&mdash;was that a Minister had Monday afternoon&mdash; about four or five hours in the week &mdash;in which to consider the fundamentals of the running of his Department both in terms of long-term planning, thinking and policies.  If we accept Deputy FitzGerald's remarks, with his experience in this area, as having some validity what are we doing by adding three Parliamentary Secretaries to the <Col N="401" /> Executive?  If what he says is correct, we are adding three people who, in turn, will give four hours of work to the fundamentals with which we must be concerned.  We will still have the same enormous involvement at functions in constituencies and in other areas.</P>
    <P>Some will tell you that we must move in this manner because it is in the Irish parliamentary tradition, and that we must build on our traditions. I reject that view completely.  One of the paradoxes in our country since Independence is that, since we achieved independence from Britain, having been dominated by them for 700 years, we immediately adopted the British parliamentary model.  It has much merit.  It is one of the oldest parliaments in the world.  It is an indication of our ineffective politics that we have slavishly copied the British model and that there has been so little original thinking.  Fortunately, through membership of the EEC, we have mentally, economically and psychologically reduced the dominance of our neighbouring island.  We are now in the mainstream of Europe to a much greater extent than ever before.</P>
    <P>There is much to be learned from what is happening in some of the countries in continental Europe and in the North America continent when we look at systems of government.  I am not averse to a cabinet system of government. There is much merit in it. There is much merit in the system under which the Government are elected by the people and that Government presumably have the authority to arrange their affairs in the manner in which they believe those affairs should be arranged.  A cabinet system under which a Minister can bring into his Department one, two or three people who are politically sympathetic to his Government and who have competence in a particular field, and who can work full-time, independent of the burdens of political and constituency work, has much to recommend it.</P>
    <P>There are other systems in other countries.</P>
    <P>The weakness of proportional representation as it is operated here is not very helpful to Ministers attempting to run their Departments.  We might learn <Col N="402" /> a lesson from Holland in the list system under which the Minister in Government is put at the head of the list as far as his political party are concerned, so that if at least one member from that political party is returned in an election, it is not a question of whether or not the Minister got more or fewer votes than somebody else in his party.  There are all kinds of areas which we could look to.  There is complete inflexibility here.  In France, there is the cabinet system.  In America, there is a system under which the President, on assuming office, has very wide powers of appointing people he believes can do a good job in the Executive.  In many instances, these people have not been elected by the popular vote, and can do a very good job because they are free of the burden of having to respond to the popular vote in a specific constituency, while the President takes the ultimate political responsibility for the actions carried out by his subordinates.</P>
    <P>We welcome this Bill.  It is possible, due to the extreme pressure of work, that it is <i>pro tem.</i>  It will have the support of those of us on this side of the House.  I can only speak for myself and not for my party, but I would welcome an approach by the Government which would take a much more in-depth look at our problems and make a fundamental assessment of the needs of the Government.  One of our essential weaknesses is that not as many people are involved in politics in an elective sense as there might be. There is an enormous involvement in constituency work which, of course, is desirable within the context of the individual constituency, but if a Deputy from Kerry is a Minister in this Government, the problems of the constituents of Kerry are very important to that Minister as a Deputy from Kerry. As an Irishman, I am more concerned about the possibility of that Minister running his Department and playing his role in the Cabinet as he should do as a Minister in an Irish Government. This is at the root of the disease in this country.  We have had too much experience of cases, where due to political pressure, health problems, lack of capacity, and so on, Ministers have had to opt out of ultimate political <Col N="403" /> control of their Ministries.  This has led to the rubber-stamping of Bills and to a very weak political base, which has been very detrimental to us.</P>
    <P>Certainly, the appointment of three Parliamentary Secretaries is welcome but, if it is to mean three more people who effectively, in an executive sense, spend four or five hours each week assisting the Minister in running a Department, it will go a very small part of the way towards the type of reform we need.  Senator Robinson alluded to the fact that within the public service there has been an attempt through the Devlin Report to think through the necessity for reform.  There have been thoughts about it which have not been implemented. At a political level there has been very little development.  I would welcome a fundamental appraisal of the needs.  I feel there will be goodwill in the Oireachtas, in general, if it is fundamental, fair and broad, and meets the designs for Ireland in the eighties.</P>
    <P>As a matter of detail, I do not know if the upgrading of Parliamentary Secretaries is sufficient in itself.  I would have welcomed the third tier which was referred to.  For example, there will be certain areas where these people, who were called Parliamentary Secretaries and who are now called Ministers of States, will have varying levels of responsibility.  If, as has been rumoured, the Taoiseach is to appoint somebody with some responsibility within the Executive for Northern Ireland, that person will have a heavier burden and he should have a title above the level of some of the people who will be appointed in lesser areas.  For that reason, I would have welcomed the third tier where we might have had a different level between the Parliamentary Secretary level and the ministerial level.</P>
    <P>There is an interesting system in Sweden under which, within their Government, they have what they call Ministers without portfolio with extensive powers.  In general they have not been elected by the popular vote. There is immense scope for reform in so far as political structures are concerned <Col N="404" /> and it is necessary as a matter of urgency and I would urge the Minister to go past the <i>pro tem</i> nature of this Bill and seek to support his colleagues in the introduction of more fundamental measures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelMulcahy" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say how pleased I am that the Government and the Taoiseach moved so quickly to introduce this Bill and therefore. clearly, I welcome it.  It is with some surprise that I note that Opposition Senators, who had been in Government, are also happy with it One wonders why they did not do something about it long ago.  Our Taoiseach promised that action would take place in this matter as soon as he came to power and it is now happening and it is very satisfying to see that speed of action.</P>
      <P>Because the Government's hand is in this, and the Taoiseach's hand, we would all be somewhat careful about commenting.  We might misunderstand possibly some of the appointments that might be made.  Given that anything that we may say will be taken in the spirit in which it is offered, I, with some trepidation, will go forward just a little.  If there is any principle in administration or management that seems to have been accepted it is that form follows function or as in a management area we say, structure follows strategy.  There is no doubt that the functions of Government have become more complex over the years and the strategies that the Government have to evolve to deal with the situations in which they find themselves have become, of necessity, more complex. This means that the individuals who have responsibilities for evolving them must, in themselves, be the right people and there must be enough of them.  It is a good thing to see that the Government are willing to expand to some degree the functions and numbers of individuals who have to carry out those functions.  I do not have to go into detail about that as it has been covered by earlier speakers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To make the point there is a principle involved and we should not be ashamed of it; there is a tendency in Ireland to have this problem about <Col N="405" /> the backside-out-through-the-trousers complex.  We are a little worried that it is going to cost £x extra but we are not worried about the fact, as people have said earlier, that we might be killing a few Ministers in the process and be worried about the extra few quid it is going to cost to finance the existence of the new posts and the expenses which will naturally occur as a result of their existence.</P>
    <P>It was with some interest recently that I re-read the first part of the Crossman diary and in re-reading that publication and thinking about some of the issues he raised, and noting the vast number of meetings and issues he had to deal with from morning to evening, I cannot but wonder that eventually he broke down under it and he is no longer with us. We do not want that kind of thing to happen to our Ministers.  One aspect of what he said which came through to me loud and clear was this interaction between the civil service and the political people who fillled the ministerial positions.  I would not like it to be taken that I am attacking the civil service but I am attacking the system within which the civil service operates.  I am not attacking individuals; I think they are victims of their own system.  As a result of that they inhibit very often the creativity of Ministers and tie them down too much.  The Crossman diary is an excellent illustration of how that happened across the water.  Whether or not it happens here, we have no diaries to tell us; perhaps in time we might; I suspect that it is much the same situation here.  It leads me to point out that there is a danger that we will be too slow to adapt and too slow to react.  Talks about these extra Ministers or extra positions or about the Cabinet system has been going on for some years and in particular it received some attention following our entry to the EEC.  It is only now&mdash;and I am glad it is a Fianna Fáil Government who are doing it&mdash;that action is taking place and legislation is being brought forward.</P>
    <P>I would put it to the Government, and this is where I tread with some <Col N="406" /> caution, that we should not have to wait another period of years for another change.  That may be the important thing: it is not that we now have three extra positions and the Parliamentary Secretaries are going to be titled in a more suitable way but that the Government would always be willing to move quickly and adapt if they find that the form of the governmental system must adjust to the function required. I would have some sympathy, therefore, with some of the comments that have been made in the debate so far but if this is the first step well, then it is fine.</P>
    <P>One aspect of it which needs a little fleshing out, and we have not heard much about it, is how these Ministers of State are going to operate.  Where are they going to fit into the organisation structure?  Will they have their own staff?  Is the Minister of State going to be seen as another line function between the Minister and the rest of the civil service, the secretary and his assistant secretaries, or will one assistant secretary be assigned with his staff to the Minister of State involved? All of this will need to be thought cut, otherwise there could be a fair amount of tension in the relationship as the various problems arise, as they inevitably will.</P>
    <P>Earlier speakers raised the question about which areas the new Ministers will be appointed to.  That seems a more ticklish situation to get involved in.  At the risk of getting a side swipe on that one, I must go back to my old point about these 15,000 jobs.  We have many problems to deal with.  Senator Robinson said she would cheer if she saw somebody being appointed as a Minister of State to look after family law.  I certainly will cheer if a Minister of State is appointed to look after selling us abroad, a Minister who will be a political animal spending has time abroad, encouraging our exports and bringing in more industry, that is how I see such a Department.  I see that individual spearheading our presence abroad to ensure that we do expand in those areas, as a man who could make on-the-spot decisions available to supplement all the excellent work that is being done by the IDA and <Col N="407" /> CTT.  There is need for some sort of a political presence to lead that drive and I would hope that it is along those lines that it will go.  If it does not go that way, perhaps future adaptation may bring it about.</P>
    <P>The whole question of the working of the Ministers obviously would need consideration As well as adapting in the sense of having new appointments or a larger number of Ministers, there is also the question of the way they work.  Hopefully, we will have another opportunity to talk about that when the Industrial Development Bill comes before us and we will be talking about the industrial development consortium. There again is an example of an attempt to find a mean's of integrating what is going on in various Departments. If we do not have integrating mechanisms, we will not have a well organised system.  I will keep on repeating that as we go through our debate.</P>
    <P>The question of travelling to and from Brussels has been raised already. Following my theme about not having the backside-out-through-the-trousers complex, it is about time we provided for Ministers the aircraft everybody is talking about.  I have seen, on recent trips to Brussels, Ministers piling in, caught up in all directions, stuck in corners trying to do some work on the way over and waiting when aircraft were delayed.  This only adds to the strain that has already been mentioned.  Again, we should avoid getting caught up in that complex which is one of the destructive factors of this nation.  I would be glad to see our Ministers having reasonable transport to get them to their work. I commend the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not really my business to defend the political parties on this side of the House from the gentle chiding Senator Mulcahy gave them.  But it is fairly obvious that it was in the term of office of the last Government that the inadequate size of the Government team became evident, particularly in the context of their work in the EEC.  This is indeed the right time to introduce this measure at the point where the experiences of the last four years have <Col N="408" /> taught us that the team is simply not big enough.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to go over the same ground that has been exhaustively covered in the other House and, indeed, in this House up to date, or to repeat all the reasons why a numerical increase in the Government is necessary.  It seems to me that is fairly obvious.  Therefore, as an Independent, I certainly accept the necessity for a Bill of this kind and I welcome it.  Underlying this whole business of the burdens of Government and of political office is the nature of the politician's activity. Even before I became a part-time politician I always admired the dedication of public men at the level of local government and, a <i>fortiori</i>, at parliamentary and Government level. As a teacher I have always done my best to counteract the cynicism about policians which is too common in Ireland, the kind of cynicism that sees &ldquo;politicians&rdquo; as a pejorative word, though perhaps we are not quite so cynical as they are in America in our attitude to politicians.</P>
      <P>Perhaps governments or politicians should undertake some kind of public relations exercise in this regard.  When the public considers this measure to create ten Ministers of State, it will react cynically and say: &ldquo;More jobs for the boys&rdquo;.  What the man in the street sees is the privilege and the power and the trappings of Government. What he does not see is the appalling and exhausting and sometimes murderous burden of responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The net increase proposed, as I read it, is three and this seems to me to be very modest indeed.  I should not be surprised if another numerical increase is looked for in the near future.  I share Deputy Garret FitzGerald's regret, expressed in the other House, that the title of Parliamentary Secretary is not being retained as well as the creation of the new title of Minister of State.  &ldquo;Parliamentary Secretary&rdquo; is a title which is well recognised and respected in this country.  The status of a Parliamentary Secretary is beyond doubt and, for domestic affairs, I think it is a mistake <Col N="409" /> to jettison that rank.  The wider consideration is that too indiscriminate a creation of Ministers may devalue the title.  Or, is there some political consideration behind the creation of ten extra ministerial posts?  Is this an attempt to supplement the dispensation of patronage which will be forthcoming in other areas very shortly?</P>
    <P>I share also the reservations of other Members who felt that we have not been informed as to the purpose of these posts individually.  We have been given the minimum of information.  We have been told again and again why extra staffing is necessary, but no indication has been given as to where the extra members are to slot in.</P>
    <P>Senator Brugha repeated the point that in the context of the EEC at least, the grade of Parliamentary Secretary is incomprehensible to most Europeans and, for the better standing of our Government in their international dealings in general we should make a new title of &ldquo;Minister of State&rdquo;.  If that is so, the corollary is that calibre must follow title; if we are to have people with increased rank, the people we appoint to these positions must be a cut above the kind of person who stands in line for party promotion for services rendered.</P>
    <P>I would expect that our new Ministers for State will be of ministerial timber and that this is particularly so with respect to the, as yet, rather hypothetical Minister for State for Northern Ireland.  That post has been mentioned more than once in the course of these debates.  If there is to be such a person then he must be a cut above even his fellow Ministers for State.</P>
    <P>The whole measure points up to the need for a reappraisal of Government structures from time to time.  The astonishing thing is that over 50 years of self-government and during the 40 years since the enactment of Bunreacht na hÉireann we have had so little of this kind of reappraisal.  It may well be that a more fundamental reappraisal is called for.  One of the defects of this measure in fact is its very limited approach in this regard.  More <Col N="410" /> generally, the need to have recourse to this present device points out the inadequacy of the fundamental law of this State.  What may be in question here is not only the creation of extra Ministers of State; it may be necessary to consider whether the Cabinet itself should be increased in view of the developments of the last 40 years.  The Constitution prohibits us from doing that.  This measure in my view, is one more indication that the Constitution needs to be re-written if not replaced. While deploring the scantiness of detail in this measure and the lack of information as to the allocation of Ministries, I welcome this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAMartin" hpid="Dr. Martin Dr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not delay the House.  I welcome the Bill, for a number of reasons which I shall briefly outline.  One of the problems which must have faced the Taoiseach when he thought of introducing this Bill was the fact that, very often, the front bench of any party does not always represent its real talent.  With regard to the present situation in the Oireachtas I would argue that the Parliamentary Secretaries, man for man, would put up a very good show against the senior Ministers in terms of talent and enterprise.  Of course, I exempt the Minister present from that particular remark.  It must have been annoying in the past for that body of men to have to bear that extremely cumbrous title. I disagree totally with Senator Murphy on that point.  The term &ldquo;Parliamentary Secretary&rdquo; should be abolished; it is utterly meaningless.  It is appropriate perhaps in the &ldquo;parliamentary&rdquo; sense but in the &ldquo;secretarial&rdquo; sense their functions have been minimal down the years.  The word &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; is far better; it means servant of the people.  I would prefer to think of junior or senior Ministers as my servants rather than my secretaries.  So, we are well done with that title.  As for quotidian slang and abbreviation, &ldquo;Parly Sec&rdquo; more than any other term in our vocabulary suggests connivance, back-door intrigue and whatever is deplorable in parliamentary life. The phrase: &ldquo;Ah well, they'll make him a Parly Sec&rdquo; is one which I shall be very happy to see expunged from our vocabulary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="411" /> The notion of junior Ministers is a very good one except for one distinction, that a great number of people who will become junior Ministers, particularly in the present situation, will be at least as able as, if not more able than, the present Pantheon of Ministers recently deified by the Taoiseach and put on the front bench.  Again, I do not share Senator Murphy's fears but I agree with him that they should be above the ordinary kind of political patronage which is sometimes associated with appointments of that kind.</P>
    <P>The great defect which this Bill will remedy is that a great number of extremely able, energetic and dedicated people who have been either on the back benches or just a little ahead of them in the past will be accorded a status commensurate with their dignity and their worth.  That seems to be the chief merit of the Bill; so that when these people go ahead and meet their colleagues from other countries they will carry with them a title commensurate with their ability and performance. I welcome the Bill most of all because that title &ldquo;Parly Sec&rdquo; which had certain unfortunate connotations, will be finally extinguished from our political vocabulary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill, as far as it goes.  In common with a number of other Senators I feel that it does not go far enough to lighten the burden that members of our Cabinet Ministers and non-Cabinet Ministers bear.  The point has been made that Ministers are under pressure from a number of quarters.  First, there is the pressure of the portfolio which is considerable; then there is the pressure from Europe which is now considerable for most of our Cabinet Ministers and, thirdly &mdash; and not least &mdash; the pressure on a Minister exerted by the system of proportional representation, which is advantageous for the voter but it is not so good for the politician, particularly the sitting Minister.  As the last election showed, no Minister is safe if he disregards his constituency work.  That is a salutary lesson which has been learned by a number of Members of this House.  It will continue to <Col N="412" /> be learned in future because of the way in which proportional representation operates.  We are working in a situation which is different from that in countries which operate the straight vote system; therefore, our Ministers are under a great deal of pressure if they wish to be re-elected.  I am sure the Minister knows this better than anyone else.</P>
      <P>I have sympathy for anybody who assumes a Cabinet portfolio unless he is somebody of the stature of the Taoiseach or the Tánaiste whose election is assured by his standing as a public figure.  Most Ministers must spend a great amount of time dealing with their constituency affairs.  They have to spend more time than their colleagues in countries operating the straight vote system.  I should like the Oireachtas to think further along the line of assisting Cabinet Ministers in the discharge of their duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe we should move more towards the American idea of a Minister being in a mini-cabinet to assist him in dealing with his duties and portfolio. The new Minister is often unaware, or perhaps has only a vague idea, of what the needs of his Department are.  In the Irish system, a new Minister is faced with the wisdom of civil servants who, except in special cases, have been working in the Department for the best part of their lives.  The Minister is trying to implement new policies and introduce his own ideas in a situation in which he is really competing against a pyramid; at the top of the pyramid is the secretary of the Department and below him are other civil servants.  In a sense, it is the excellence of our civil servants which makes it such a difficult job for a Minister to implement changes and redirect departmental policy.  The civil servants say that their duty is merely to carry out the wishes of the Minister, but it is never as simple as that. The lines of communication have been drawn for many years; the policy lines are well laid out in many of our Departments, except perhaps in the one the Minister is now in charge of. This is a new Department just established and it gives him a chance to implement new policy.  In other Departments a Minister, unless he is a <Col N="413" /> person of superhuman energy and has tremendous courage, will in all likelihood give in to the civil servants and accept their advice and take the easy way out.  This is a fact of life; most Ministers in most Governments do this. They do not really push policy from the top: they take the policy as it comes up through the pyramid.  They sign the letters, they take the whispers into the ear but they do not essentially initiate policy.  They are people who accept the direction of the civil service as it comes up through the civil service pyramid.  That is dangerous because if this is what happens, and I believe in most Governments this is a fact of life, that is a failure in our bureaucratic system.  It is allowing control to move away from the elected representatives into the hands of the parliamentary executive and that is not what the system has been earmarked to do.</P>
    <P>The Government and the Minister should think along the lines of introducing with each Minister, particularly with Ministers in the bigger Departments, small groups of people, of senior civil servant rank, who would come in with a new Government when a Cabinet Minister is appointed.  In other words, there should be a mini-Cabinet of two or three people with each Minister who would automatically leave their posts when the Government was evicted.  When there was a change of Minister they could be transferred around.  They would not have permanent positions.  This is the situation in the United States, for example, where the senior executive officers in each Department change with a change of Government.  They change after each election.  There are disadvantages in this but there are considerable advantages.</P>
    <P>We have a situation now, particularly when we look at a Minister's responsibilities in terms of his portfolio and in terms of his duties in Europe, in which we need to institute more far-reaching changes if we want a Minister to fulfil the duties that he was appointed to fulfil and if we want to keep the Legislature in its primary position.  If we continue giving Ministers increasing workloads the danger <Col N="414" /> is that we will be handing more and more of the government of the country to the civil service.  This is not to be interpreted as an attack on the civil service.  It is the excellence of the civil service that gives rise to the necessity to protect ourselves against this increasing control by bureaucracy.  The Minister should say something about this in his reply.  In a sense the Minister is in a unique position to do so as someone who was appointed to Cabinet rank on his first election to the Dáil.  This has happened before but is is very unusual.</P>
    <P>The second unique point is that the Minister is dealing with an essentially new Department which is starting from the ground up, in which he has been able to build in a lot of policy and has been able really to affect the thinking of his team of civil servants from the very start.  I would like the Minister to say something about his colleagues who come to face their civil servants whose policy lines have been clearly worked out and who in a sense hem in their Ministers, as they have to.  It is up to individual Ministers to break out of this.  I can, as an Independent Member of this House, pick out a good Minister from a bad one.  A good Minister is a man who will answer a question off the cuff, the not so good Minister is the man who acts as a sort of gramophone record&mdash;&ldquo;his master's voice&rdquo;&mdash;he turns to the men behind him for answers.</P>
    <P>The increase in bureaucratic civil servant control of our everyday life is a very serious problem which our democracy must face.  Our job should be to see that we give our Ministers the opportunity to create and implement policy and that we give the civil servants the function of carrying out that policy.  Anybody who thinks that that is happening in a straightforward way at the moment does not know how the system works.  The Minister should think more along these lines. We will be forced to change in the way which I have suggested.  I know, for example, that in the period of the previous Government one or two Ministers tried this sort of thing and met considerable resistance from their Departments.  We have to change our <Col N="415" /> thinking.  We need officials of senior civil service rank, who have not permanent appointments and whose posts will change with the Government. This would be advantageous in that one would be able to introduce talented people from the private sector along with a Minister to help implement policy, pushing ideas down through the pyramid of a Department as well as just accepting the ideas that are constantly coming up.  We must think more along these lines.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson said that there has been a considerable discussion and a lengthy White Paper on reform of the public service.  We should look at reform along the lines I have suggested, which are that the political wings of our democracy be strengthened so that it can play its part.  Obviously Ministers and civil servants will not agree all the time.  At the moment the odds are weighted far too heavily in favour of the civil service.  I would like to see them weighted more heavily in favour of the elected representatives.  The Minister should refer to this when replying.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and in doing so I recognise that the rate and pace of society in general has drastically changed.  This manifests itself in all walks of life and particularly in Government.  It was commendable of the Government to introduce the Bill.  I am sure it has not been easy.  Looking back through some of the debates in both Houses I note that there was a lot of cynicism about the absence of Ministers.  Now there is full realisation that the situation was unrealistic in the sense that a Minister could not be everywhere at one time, and could not attend to his national and international duties.  Therefore, we had problems, and it was only natural that some development would have to take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been arguments as to whether sufficient posts are being created.  I have reservations about this. I would like to see how the three posts work before anything else happens.  I am not happy with the idea that experts should be brought in in the way Senator West suggested.  My own experience as a trade union official down <Col N="416" /> through the years was that I did not mind the experts so long as I was not bound by their advice.  Whatever way one looks at it, if the argument is being made now &mdash; I am not making that argument &mdash; that they are jobs for the boys Governments will certainly be more exposed to that type of an argument if people are brought in from outside.  That certainly would look like jobs for the boys.  Because of this I do not agree with the approach suggested by Senator West.  I am in favour of these appointments but I would like to see them working on a trial basis to see how they go and then we should have another look at it to see what can be developed.</P>
    <P>We should look at this from the point of view of the worker.  A person who functions as an operative finds it very difficult to understand why it is always necessary to create more consultants, more specialists and more clerical workers while at the same time it is considered necessary to cut down on operative workers.  If more Ministers are being created here they will have to be justified.  The system has created the situation whereby the numbers in the areas where mental capacity is used, must be built up, but we must be very careful to let the people who are manually functioning know that there is a good reason for it, and that there is something coming out of it.  Where a service is needed it is up to the State to provide it, and pay for it, whether it be buses.  Ministers or anything else.  For that reason I have no reservations about supporting the Bill.</P>
    <P>What way will the responsibility be delegated?  To delegate is to give a person some work, a bit at a time, not to hand over total responsibility by finding reasons to go to an irrelevant conference that would be of no benefit to the Ministry or to the Government. I oppose that type of thing and I hope that this type of development will be kept under observation. Because of the rate of development it might be necessary to think in terms of creating more ministerial posts. Such posts should be introduced on a trial basis to see how they work.  I welcome the Bill.  I hope the Government <Col N="417" /> will consider the question of justification of these appointments to the people who have to pay for these services.  I do not know if anyone from this side of the House wishes to put down any amendments but at the moment I have none.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJOTooke" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Bill and wish the new Minister every success in his new portfolio.  The Minister coming before the Seanad today has not been long in his new appointment. Had the Minister been over the fences in any period of office he would no doubt realise the importance of the additional posts that are being created under this Bill.  Because the formation of legislation will take place in Brussels now rather than in Leinster House it is important that we have in Brussels at all times the maximum capacity of Ministers whether they be Cabinet Ministers or Ministers of State.  We must pick the best we have in this nation against the best being pitted against us by other nations.  We should not prevent our Ministers from being in Brussels in every possible advantageous position.  It is from Brussels that the lifeline of this State will come in future years.  I welcome the additional ministerial posts and I am delighted to hear that the other side of the House welcome them and believe that we have not gone far enough to meet their requirements.  I welcome the additional back-up support for our Ministers.  From my own experience I know that a Minister living in a rural area is at breaking point in order to meet the requirements of his constituency, his Department and the requirements of his portfolio in Brussels and Strasbourg and elsewhere.  If we are to get men of the required calibre to ensure that we get the best out of Brussels, the remuneration that we are giving our Ministers now will have to be at least updated to compare favourably with that of Ministers of State from other nations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not go along with Senator West's suggestion that some of the Ministers from this side of the House could be regarded as &ldquo;their master's voice.&rdquo;  I would much rather regard <Col N="418" /> them as their party's voice.  We are very proud to have no fewer than 115 Members in these Houses.  From those numbers we will get the best selection of people to represent us.  We have the best material with which to represent Ireland in the European Parliament. I have no doubt that we require the best brains in this nation to pit against the best brains against us in Brussels and in Strasbourg.  I am sure we will be able to match them for many years to come.  All our 115 representatives were elected under the democratic election system.  That cannot be said about other Members in this House.  That is a credit to our party and a credit to the people.  The Minister's targets are large and they are targets that we look forward to achieving.  I have no doubt that the Minister has the ability, the energy, and the drive to make this new Department a success, and I wish him well.</P>
    <P>Ministers very often on returning to Ireland from the European Parliament, having done a good job there, are faced with constituents' problems which they did not have time to deal with before going abroad.  Because of our democratic system Ministers must deal with these problems if they wish to be re-elected at the next general election.  Ministers are under constant pressure to meet the demands of their constituents and the demands of the European Parliament.  I wish each one of them well.  We can spare at least 25 of our top class people to go to look after the affairs of the State.  With such a large party, we have plenty left to do the old chores that require to be done here.  In the not-too-distant future I can foresee some back-up support being provided for a Minister of State.  In order that every member of the European Parliament would regard our members in the same light as they regard their own it is necessary to get rid of the term &ldquo;Parliamentary Secretary&rdquo; and substitute the term &ldquo;Minister of State&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I wish the Cabinet and the additional members many years of success. I hope they will get the best out of Europe for our people.  It is only by giving the best to Europe that we will get the best return.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Economic Planning and Development (Professor O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Members for the constructive way they received the Bill.  I was interested in the various viewpoints expressed.  Essentially there are two points on which I ought to touch by way of reply.</P>
      <P>The first is the question of the number of additional posts being created under the Bill.  The bulk of the speakers, especially from the Opposition side, seemed to feel that three were too few.  There is always the difficulty about trying to determine in advance the precise number that is appropriate on any occasion.  The essential point in tackling this issue is to draw very clearly the distinction between laying down a structure of Government where there was no existing structure of Government, and where one is going to draw up a blueprint, and between the question of what I might call the &ldquo;business-as-usual-during-alterations&rdquo; approach, which is essentially the approach which we have before us today. We have a structure of Government. We have an ongoing system and an ongoing workload so we cannot close down the shop and say &ldquo;Come back in three or six months when we have rebuilt and installed the new system we have in mind.&rdquo;  We have no option but to tackle the problem on the basis of what changes can be accommodated without impairing the day to day activities of Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Essentially we are trying to answer the question of what is the tolerable or sustainable rate of change which the system can accommodate.  There is no perfect answer to this question.  There is no ideal formula which one can consult, I tend to favour a smaller number, Three is about as many as one can accommodate at any one bite of the cherry.  I was interested to note that Senator Harte adopted a similar viewpoint. As a person who in a very different context has been through a period of substantial structural change in major industry, it is interesting that he in effect echoed the same viewpoint. The Senator said that we should see what changes can be put through, what changes will be understood and accepted and we must explain them as we go along, and that if we find at <Col N="420" /> a later date that we want more change, we should be able to come back and get it.  That is the appropriate approach in this context also.</P>
    <P>I must emphasise that if we are going to change, it is not only a question of winning acceptance among the political parties and among the practising politicians, whether inside or outside the House, it is also a question of accommodating the changes in the political structure to the structure of administration.  Here we are dealing with a very large number of people and with very complex existing structures for the administration of business.  I am not suggesting for a moment that anyone consciously or wilfully obstructs progress &mdash; I do not think they do &mdash; but if we are going to bring people along with us in enthusiastically making the changes work, then we must embark on a fairly time-consuming process of consultation and explanation.  Even if one has a blueprint locked away in the desk, it is not appropriate to come in here and say &ldquo;Here is the total system of restructuring which we have in mind and we are going to try to implement it in one fell swoop.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The approach which the Government have adopted is the correct one. There have already been some reallocations of ministerial responsibilities and duties.  It is appropriate that they should now be supplemented by the addition of more members to the administration.</P>
    <P>The next point to be considered is whether we should have two tiers of ministerial rank or three tiers as some speakers on the opposite side of the House suggest.  Frankly I would not welcome at all the task of any Taoiseach who found himself faced with the necessity to classify members of his administration into three ranks. Even classifying them into two ranks in a sense, or two categories, members of the Government and other Ministers of State, is itself quite a complex and delicate operation but at least one can justify the need for that distinction into two categories.  On the basis of the existing constitutional limitation of 15 members, you might well say that that is no long-run impediment and you <Col N="421" /> can always bring in a constitutional amendment.  So you can, but there is a second reason why there is some merit in a number, be it 15 or any other number, and that is that if you are going to retain the effectiveness of the Government as a collective decision-making unit the total membership of that unit has to be relatively small. If you are trying to deal with many, varied and difficult questions from large numbers of people, if they are all to make effective contributions you are going to have incredibly long meetings. Therefore, if you had a Government made up of, say, 25 Ministers I could envisage the Cabinet in virtually permanent session and I hope nobody wants to inflict that upon us in the interest of an alleged form of Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Absenteeism would become a virtue indeed.  Therefore, you must keep the number of members of the Government down to a reasonable level, and since the Constitution already specifies the number 15, which has worked and which still does work, I see no reason from departing from that.  That gives a basic logical reason for one category of Minister, Minister of the Government.  After that if we find that for purposes of administration we require more than that, let us have more.  How many more?  We are saying ten more at the moment but we should not attempt to draw distinctions between those Ministers. Apart from anything else if we did it would further complicate the process of redistributing work as between members of the Government and other Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we are seeking with this Bill is the greatest degree of flexibility.  We are saying: &ldquo;Give us ten other Ministers in addition to the 15 who are members of the Government and let us assign those additional ten Ministers as the Government of the day think appropriate.&rdquo;  Therefore, would it really help if we were to say: &ldquo;We really think there is a need for one additional member in Department X <Col N="422" /> or Department Y?&rdquo;  Surely not.  The actual workloads, while they have been building up in every Department, tend to build up at faster rates in some Departments than in others but also the actual burden of work in areas tends to vary a bit from time to time as the circumstances of the period warrant.  It is entirely appropriate that the Taoiseach and Government of the day should have the flexibility to assign their Ministers, be they members of the Government or the other ten Ministers proposed here, in whatever manner is felt appropriate to the circumstances of the day.  That is why one of the welcome provisions in this Bill is the abolition of the existing restriction which says that you can have only one Parliamentary Secretary to one Minister.  I can see the possibility of one area of administration requiring the attention of perhaps three Ministers at one time, that is one member of the Government and two other Ministers.  For that reason, while I understand the reasoning which led to the comments about the possible inadequacy of three as a number and also to the suggestion of retaining the existing title of office of Parliamentary Secretary, on balance the arguments against those viewpoints must prevail.  It is my firm conviction that we are right in setting about this process of reform in a systematic way, not attempting to bite off more than can be chewed at any one stage, and that there is an overwhelming argument for having not more than two categories of Minister.</P>
    <P>Those are the essential points.  I was asked if I would comment in my reply on this question of the role of advisers, and I may also link that to a request from one or two other speakers about the other ways in which it was envisaged the workload of Ministers might be lightened.</P>
    <P>On the latter of those other methods it is no secret that the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and myself, speaking at various times this month, have made clear that we want to press ahead with the whole question of public service reform and that part of that reform and restructuring would be to introduce something akin to the Aireacht concept <Col N="423" /> as put forward in the Devlin Report. I leave aside today the precise manner which we might set about introducing those proposals because it is not appropriate to this debate, but certainly any restructuring along those lines would permit a greater delegation of detailed administrative functions to members of the Executive, to members of the civil service Departments.  We would get rid of the position, which in a sense has to be largely fictional, that the Minister is personally responsible for every action of his Department. While that may sound nice as a legal position it is in practice a sheer impossibility.  While no-one is suggesting relieving Ministers of the ultimate responsibility for the direction and functioning of the Departments it is perfectly permissible to think in terms of the approach which would favour a greater degree of delegation to the permanent staff members of Government Departments.  That is one area in which, while not debating it today, I can indicate the possibility of some lightening of the workload.</P>
    <P>With regard to bringing in people as advisers who would not be permanent civil servants someone implied that almost by definition they had to be people with political affiliations. That is not necessarily so.  Yes, there is a valid case for bringing in people for various periods to form a type of cabinet.  This again is a way in which you could ease the workload on Ministers while at the same time making sure that they have the best possible information and advice available to them.  A number of Ministers in the Government, including myself, have already made such appointments and I would expect that further appointments would follow.  That is an area in which we are again willing to experiment and to proceed at what we would regard as a tolerable pace of change.</P>
    <P>I realise that in discussing these matters of the possible role or involvement of advisers and the other administrative reforms that might take place I am straying somewhat from the specific content of the Bill before the <Col N="424" /> House, but I felt it appropriate to touch on them since a number of speakers asked that I refer to them. I hope that what I have said, therefore, is sufficient, taken in conjunction with the statements that have already been made with specific reference to this Bill.  I hope that they are sufficient to indicate the seriousness of purpose which the Government have in mind in bringing this Bill before the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Public Service (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to give effect to the Taoiseach's statement in Dáil Éireann on 5th July last that a new Department of Economic Planning and Development would be established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I go on to deal with the circumstances leading to the proposed establishment of the new Department, I think it might be helpful if I dealt briefly with the technicalities of what is being done in order to avoid possible confusion in the debate.  Quite simply, the Bill will amend the Ministers and Secretaries Acts, 1924 to 1973, to provide for the establishment of a new Department of State which will be in charge of a member of the Government known as the Minister for Economic Planning and Development.  The Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924, was described in its long title as an Act for constituting and defining the Ministers and Departments of State. It established 11 Departments of State, administered by Ministers, amongst which the administration and business of the public service were distributed. The powers, duties and functions of <Col N="425" /> each Department were set out in general but comprehensive terms.  The reallocation of functions and the creation of new Departments to meet changing needs since 1924 have been effected by amendments to the 1924 Act.  The Ministers and Secretaries Acts now provide the statutory basis for the Departments of State and define the distribution of the public business between these Departments. The descriptions of the functions of Departments are necessarily set out in rather general terms, leaving scope for development to meet changing circumstances. No effort is made in the Acts to provide for the detailed operations or the processes to be employed by the Departments.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances of 1924, the concept of the role of the Government in the management of the national economy was, to say the least, undeveloped. Over the intervening years, however, a series of developments have revolutionised the position.  The tentative first steps towards State involvement in the economic process through the creation of State-sponsored bodies accelerated through the thirties and the post-war years.  The growing importance of Government action in the management of the economy was finally recognised institutionally with the publication of the first programme for economic development in 1958 and the subsequent establishment of the Economic Development Branch and later the Development Division of the Department of Finance.  Looking back, it is now clear that the institutional developments from 1958 onwards brought about a radically new approach to the development of economic planning by Government; it has, however, become increasingly clear in recent years that the time has come for another fundamental institutional development.</P>
    <P>The Report of the Public Services Organisation Review Group in 1969 stressed the need for the strengthening of the planning function throughout the public service.  The Public Service Advisory Council, in their last report, urged that urgent attention be given to the provision of appropriate planing institutions in the public service <Col N="426" /> and that the plans of individual Departments should not only be consistent with, but form an integral part of, a national plan.  Above all, however, it was the absence in recent years of any overall national economic plan or programme that indicated that it was time to take stock once again and ask if the existing institutions for planning are equal to the needs of the economy.</P>
    <P>The Government have been convinced for some time that the first essential reform is to provide separate institutions for planning not only within Departments but by assigning central responsibility for planning within the Government to a Minister in charge of a separate Department. Looking at the response to the difficulties which faced this country over the past four years, it became evident that the Government need an institutional capacity to co-ordinate their approach to economic and social development.  Because of the importance which the Government attach to this major institutional reform, the Taoiseach announced, in his first statement on his appointment, that legislation would be introduced to establish a new Department of Economic Planning and Development to be headed by a separate Minister.</P>
    <P>We are fully aware of the difficulties which will face this Department. Planning is an activity which is difficult and which often receives little recognition for its achievements.  If, and when, all the targets of a plan are achieved, the planner can expect little thanks.  When we achieve our aims we are already looking forward to other objectives.  On the other hand, the few failures of the planner will attract more attention than all his successes. It it no wonder, then, that both people and institutions often prefer to devote themselves to other tasks and to neglect this difficult and unrewarding activity.  However, unless we are to place our trust in luck alone, the success of our endeavours depends on the competence and diligence with which our plans are laid and pursued. For this reason, it is now a common practice in large institutions to assign to a specialised part of the organisation <Col N="427" /> the responsibility for developing and tracking the implementation of plans for the future.  In establishing the new Department we will, we are convinced, therefore, be bringing the organisation of government into line with the best modern practice.</P>
    <P>The general responsibility of the new Department will be to promote and co-ordinate economic and social planning for the development of the economy both generally and as respects different sectors thereof and as respects different regions of the country.</P>
    <P>These functions have in the past been discharged by the Department of Finance, not under specific statutory authority but as complementary to their responsibility for the business generally of the public finance.  In this Bill it is necessary, in constituting and defining the Minister for Economic Planning and his Department, to set out his functions, which is done in Section 2 (2).  The functions as set out in the subsection contain a wide definition of the area of responsibility of the new Department but they do not and should not lay down the details of the processes and operations of the new Department.  Because they are both concerned with the central co-ordination of Government business, the Ministers for Finance and Economic Planning and Development, and their Departments, will necessarily have a very close working relationship.  Although the functions of economic and social planning and of budgetary and financial control will in future be organisationally separate, they will both form part of the central co-ordinating systems of Government with the main areas of contact in the preparation of the budget and the development of national plans.</P>
    <P>Although the finer details of the planning process will be worked out and developed when the Department become fully operative, the general design is now complete.  The new Department will be required to promote and co-ordinate economic and social planning.  The Department will, therefore, be the centre of the planning system for the whole public service and for developing the overall view of the <Col N="428" /> economy and reconciling sectoral and regional plans with national goals and criteria.  Other Departments will have particular sectoral responsibilities in such areas as industry, agriculture, health and social welfare.  As part of the development of the planning system the planning capacities of the responsible Departments will also be strengthened to form part of a total public service planning function and to provide a support service to the management of these Departments.</P>
    <P>Apart from their remit to promote and co-ordinate economic and social planning and development, the Department of Economic Planning and Development will be assigned certain more specific functions to enable them to act in the appropriate areas of Government. In accordance with what I have said about the definition of functions rather than processes for the new Department, it is important to ensure that this definition of functions is wide enough to allow the Department the freedom to develop the method and techniques of planning without being tied in advance into a set of processes which may prove unsuited to the needs of a developing economy.  The more detailed functions set out in section 2 (2) have been drafted with great care and after much consideration, to achieve these ends.</P>
    <P>After the general mandate set out at (a) of subsection (2), the first more particular function of the Department, as set out at (b) of the subsection, is designed to make the Department the central source of advice to the Government on economic and social policies.  The Department will be required to report to the Government on the policies they consider necessary for economic and social development. To do this, they must have the capability to ascertain and analyse the evolving state of the economy.  They must be in a position to identify the possibilities, offered by availing of external and internal opportunities and by policy changes, to operate at maximum capacity.  The output of the analytical process will be a report to the Government by the Minister for Economic Planning and Development on the desirable direction of Government <Col N="429" /> policy towards economic and social development.  I would stress, however, that the final decision will be for the Government who may, as they see fit, publish draft plans as discussion and consultation documents.</P>
    <P>The translation of policy into plans and activities is a critical stage in the planning process and (c) of subsection (2) assigns to the new Department the function of consulting with Departments on their plans to give effect to Government policies for economic and social development and of reviewing and appraising these plans.  The end product of such consultation is set out at (d) of the subsection &mdash; to make proposals to the Government for the co-ordination of these plans and activities and for their integration with national economic and social plans.</P>
    <P>In this process, two things are not rigidly laid down.  First, it is the intention of the Government that there will be consultation with the main interest groups in the economy on the preparation of economic and social plans. Employer and employee representatives, industrial and agricultural groups and other important representative bodies will be consulted but it would not be wise to specify once and for all in legislation who exactly are the groups to be consulted. Groupings will change in the future as they have in the past; bodies will coalesce and disintegrate and the Minister for Economic Planning and Development will have to take account of such developments in deciding on the bodies with whom he will consult from time to time. Secondly, no attempt is made to lay down the time perspective for national plans nor to specify the frequency at which plans will be prepared. Planning is concerned with an uncertain future and it is essential that the Department should be left with the flexibility to structure their plans to the changing needs of the times.</P>
    <P>In this connection, I might also mention that the need to consult the Oireachtas on national plans is fully appreciated by the Government.  I can assure the House that there will be an <Col N="430" /> opportunity for debate on such plans; I am convinced, however, that to require the presentation of plans at regular intervals would be counterproductive; it is preferable to have the production of plans geared to the requirements of economic and social conditions than to have the production of plans made a mechanical exercise to be completed at set intervals.</P>
    <P>Finally, the functions laid down for the Department require them to review the implementation of national economic and social plans and to report thereon to the Government.  The greatest danger facing a planning system is that, with the devotion of a major effort to the preparation of plans, those concerned may believe that the job of planning has been done. However, to will a desired outcome is not to ensure its achievement.  Progress with the implementation of plans must be kept under review; where targets are not being achieved, the reason must be ascertained and corrective action must be taken or targets must be revised.  It is only by such an iterative process that the plan can be maintained as a continuing overall guide to development.</P>
    <P>Given the functions of the Minister and his Department, the details of the planning process will, as I have said, be developed as the Department put the new planning system into operation. The task will require certain structural arrangements.  I have pointed out that the planning capacities of the main economic and social Departments will need to be strengthened to form part of the total public service planning function and that the Department themselves must have an economic and social analytical capacity equal to their task.  Outside the Department proper there are other institutions concerned generally with the planning process for which the Department will assume general responsibility.  The first of these is the National Economic and Social Council whose main task laid down in their constitution and terms of reference is:</P>
    <P>to provide a forum for discussion of the principles relating to the efficient development of the national <Col N="431" /> economy and the achievement of social justice, and to advise the Government through the Minister for Finance on their application.</P>
    <P>The NESC, who are not a statutory body, will in future relate to the Minister for Economic Planning and Development whose Department will deal with their finances and other relevant matters.  The new Department will also deal with the Economic and Social Research Institute whose finances are at present largely provided by means of a grant-in-aid from the Vote for the Office of the Minister for Finance. Under legislation at present under consideration, the Minister for Economic Planning and Development will also have responsibility for the new National Board for Science and Technology.</P>
    <P>The new Department will have responsibility for the promotion and co-ordination of economic and social planning as respects different regions of the country.  While the reconciliation of the regional and sectoral elements of the planning matrix will require development, the immediate structural effect will be the transfer of responsibility for the county development teams and the special regional development fund to the new Department.</P>
    <P>Finally on the institutional arrangements, I might say a few words on the informational and statistical bases of the Department of Economic Planning and Devolpment.  Much of the statistical material on which the Department will depend is already produced by such institutions as the Central Statistics Office and the Department of Finance.  In other areas and, particularly in the area of social statistics, there are gaps not only in the statistical material available but, more importantly, in the development of meaningful indicators.  The improvement of the statistical base for economic and social planning will be a task for the new Department in consultation and co-operation with the Central Statistics Office and the various Departments concerned.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with the purpose of this Bill and with the functions and broad <Col N="432" /> structural arrangements for the new Department of Economic Planning and Development.  Recognising the deficiencies which have existed in the function of planning, we are, in this Bill, proposing the institutonal means for strengthening this function to meet the increased demands imposed by the acceptance by the State, in this country as in all western democracies, of a central role in economic and social development.  The perfection of systems and the introduction of the necessary skills and techniques will require hard work and effort but, in the final analysis, it is a technical problem capable of a technical solution.  No matter how well the new Department work, and, indeed, the better they work, the wider will be the range of alternative courses of action for final choice and implementation. The National Economic and Social Council have come to the central issue in Report No. 32 dealing with the question of choice between different policies in the light of the conflicting views of different interest groups.  I quote:</P>
    <P>However in the last resort such differences may be resolved, or the action that is appropriate to the circumstances taken despite them, only by a political process or procedure. This is a responsibility which in a democracy must properly be borne by the Government alone.</P>
    <P>This Government are firmly committed to making the necessary choices and implementing the consequential policies and programmes.  This Bill provides for the necessary framework for planning and I confidently recommend it to the House.  The consequent responsibility for the development of the economy will, in the final analysis, rest with the Government, but I can give a firm assurace that, before making final choices, the Government will engage in the maximum possible consultation with all the relevant interests in the State and will afford the opportunity to have national economic and social plans fully debated in the Oireachtas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill as an opportunity to express my views on the idea of planning our <Col N="433" /> economy and to make some observations on the scene as I see it.  I am afraid I detect some euphoric sense that the creation of the Department, or the presentation of a plan, is in some way the inauguration of an age of plenty.  If, in fact, the planning is successful and the Department and the Minister achieve the very best they can, their best success will be to bring home to the people who operate the political processes, cited by the Minister in the document of the National Economic and Social Council, the fact of scarcity which will endure for this economy as it continues for all the economies of the world however rich they may become. That fact, from time to time, may tend to get obscured in the operation of these political processes and concealed from the people that, if they are adopting a particular set of policies, they are foregoing the cost of these policies, they are foregoing the alternative policies which could have been purchased if the costs of the policies chosen had not to be borne. The fact of scarcity will not disappear with the establishment of the Department, however well timed, however well manned.  The fact of scarcity will not disappear with a plan however well chosen or pursued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the matter of structure I have little enough to say because I feel that I can give essentially only a sort of a nominal assent to the value of the arguments offered by various people. It seems to be a judgment worth expressing on whether this should be located, as so many people think it should have been, in the Department of the Taoiseach, whose office would enable him to bring its support to the support of the plan within the Government who must decide upon it, or whether it should be located in the Department of Industry and Commerce as, in Irish circumstances, some have suggested might be right, as that Department have the largely freely-operating Industrial Development Authority designed to promote the growth of exports which must lead to the growth in manufacturing without which the necessary growth cannot be achieved, or whether it should be located in the Department <Col N="434" /> of Finance where the skills, such as they are, must exist to achieve the controls on public expenditure without which any plan will fail, or whether there should be a new Department. I cannot make a judgment of great value on that question to this assembly.  It seems that you have to be a Minister, or an ex-Minister, or a public servant of considerable experience or to have been&mdash;in the way I have never been &mdash; on the inside of the decision-making processes of the Government.</P>
    <P>We have, at any rate, the decision of this Government.  It seems to me that, as the Department is separated from the Department of Finance, which will remain the body which will control public expenditure, as the Minister indicated in his speech, success or failure will depend finally on the degree of collaboration and co-operation between these two Departments.  One cost of the decision to have a new Department is that 10 per cent roughly of the lifetime of the Government is gone by without the process of planning having started.  Practically five months have gone and that is roughly 10 per cent of the average lifetime of an Irish Government. If the Department of Finance had been chosen at the start, we could have spent that 10 per cent elaborating on the plan which we might now have.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister will allow me to carry on in my own lumbering way.  One of the tasks the Department will have to discharge clearly will be the business of explaining to the community the implications of scarce resources.  The desirability of planning is now generally accepted.  It was not always so.  I remember when there was a debate, not so very long ago, when there was an argument &mdash; it seemed to me of a most vague and theoretical nature&mdash; about the difference between programming and planning.  The programmes have now come to be described as plans.  I remember, not so long ago, when planning was a socialist policy, recommended by socialists, and feared by the promotors <Col N="435" /> of private industry, feared by entrepreneurs.</P>
      <P>I made a quick check the other day and I noticed that in 1974 the entire conference of Irish industry took place without one of the speakers referring at any stage to planning.  Planning first came to loom in, or zoom in, or whatever the word is, on the managerial side towards the end of 1975.  We have now something which, if I understand it correctly, will tend to lead to a collaboration of clauses.  Historically, such has happened from time to time. Let us hope one of the desirable consequences of the existence of a plan, about which hopefully a consensus will be obtained, will be this very collaboration, collaboration not merely between classes but also between sectors.  In part the Minister's role, or the planner's role, would be to teach the farmers the need for manufacturing success for the future of their families, to teach the identity of interests between the two sectors, to bring them together and reconcile them and make them realise that they have a common problem whose common solution will benefit both.</P>
      <P>The bringing together of agriculture and industry should lead to a realisation of linkages which may not be observable by industrialists without the aid of farmers, and likewise on the farming side.  Properly presented and properly shaped, while the problems will not disappear because of a plan, they should come into better focus.  The inter-relations which a plan will expose could lead to investment, to the realisation of potentials not previously realised, just as on the discovery that one company is making a great profit out of a particular enterprise, its group may be discerned as presenting opportunities for others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the objectives of this Department should be the stimulation in other Departments of policy units.  This has been said in the other House and is a most desirable objective and a justification of the whole planning exercise if that stimulation takes place. With that stimulation, we will begin to face into one of the first hurdles which any real planner will have to <Col N="436" /> overcome.  That has been referred to in another debate, the reform of bureaucracy. It is necessary to say this because, with all its merits and its merits are frequently referred to and I do not have to repeat them and sometimes because of politics with lip service only, bureaucracy is now a political factor.  Many civil servants have many votes and they may not like the necessary adjustments involved in the reform of bureaucracy.</P>
    <P>It also is a very important factor in the formulation and the maintenance of any incomes policy.  It is a very important factor in determining the level of Government expenditure.  Therefore, it is a very important factor in determining the level of taxation whether in this year or in succeeding years, and through taxation tending to affect our competitiveness, our unit wage costs, the availability of stimuli for the innovator, the degree of release that can be provided, anything that can make bureaucracy more confident in itself and in the usefulness of the work it is doing, more efficient as a work force, better value for the money it costs.  The more good planning achieves this, the more and the greater the contribution to growth and to the improvement of the economy.</P>
    <P>I grew to the age of reason when, through a whole series of factors, level of education, excessive strength of Treasury control, deep dissention in the community, the Official Secrets Act operation, insufficient number of voluntary bodies, inadequate understanding by the academic institutions of the operations of the economy, insufficient commitment by experts to their society, the delusion, for delusion it was, was rampant that the civil service knew best.  In some cases they knew most, because they knew some of the factors alone which enabled a final decision to be made, but they did not necessarily know, or make a proper judgment about, all sorts of other factors other people knew, or which are now known at any rate.</P>
    <P>A little reminder of what I am speaking of, something perhaps nobody in the House will remember, is that it was part of the law of this land right up into the fifties, that you could not fish <Col N="437" /> from a boat longer than a particular size.  Through a policy of protecting the inshore fishermen, we rejected all the developments of modern technology, resisted advice which came into that Department from outside, because I presented it not knowing a damn thing about it but representing somebody else, and we were left behind in the race for the development of our fisheries.  This is one single example.</P>
    <P>I believe the Industrial Development Authority, or shall we put it this way, the idea of its establishment, was not enthusiastically received by the Department of Industry and Commerce. Now, and this is one good thing about that development of the sectoral interest, there is a great deal more enlightenment about public matters through the development of the representation of these sectional interests, and this enlightenment is of value to the Government and capable of making the Government self-improving, capable of making the bureaucracy self-improving.</P>
    <P>I was interested in the Minister's reference to one of his own Departments. He has so many different descriptions that if I do not use the most honourable of them all of the time it is just because I am focusing on another.  I refer to the Department of Finance.  There is a feeling, and I throw it out for enlightenment as much as anything else, that there is a danger, which I gather from the Minister's statement over the years has got less, of the Department of Finance duplicating the work of other Departments. In planning our economy &mdash; the beginning of the planning is in the public sectors &mdash; the beginning of the useful work is to be done where it can be most directly done.</P>
    <P>It is obvious to me that the Department of Finance must be as flintlike as ever the Treasury was on the matter of approving new services because, if you allot £1,000 in the first year, God only knows what it will become in year ten and, if you look back on the original estimates of the costs of free health, for example, and find out what in then current terms these services came to cost, you realise the <Col N="438" /> importance of a tremendous check on the constitution of new services.</P>
    <P>Another function of a successfully operating Department of Finance would seem to be reviewing old services, particularly very old services, as you would a list of old debtors. Those of ten years and upward would get a more anxious consideration than those of five months and upwards, to see if they are longer justified in the new circumstances which exist and how much can be saved for better purposes by their elimination.  These two functions seem to be all important for the Department of Finance to perform.</P>
    <P>I do not know what difficulties there are, but subject to that, I should like to see&mdash;and I should like to be told the difficulties &mdash; as much as possible the resources allocated to particular Departments left to the Ministers of these Departments to allocate themselves within services, each of which has been approved by the Department of Finance and if you were dealing with one Department as I might do on a particular occasion, you would not have to feel you would have to go on to Finance yet again. Once it was within an overall provision you dealt with the people who really knew about it, who really knew the difference between two aeroplanes, for example, being the experts in that matter, and you did not have to await a decision, provided the overall allocation was under the final checking process.</P>
    <P>In the matter of planning I do not notice anywhere &mdash; I may have missed it &mdash; reference to the importance of the actual texture of taxation, the fiscal system itself.  I would be prepared to bore the House at another time with an exposition of the mutually contradictory operations of various tax reliefs contained in the fiscal system, one encouraging the attainment of one target, and the other discouraging the attainment of the same target, or one encouraging one kind of activity, and the other discouraging the very same activity or, perhaps, not so positively doing that necessarily, but where neither quite reconciles with the other.</P>
    <P>I would have thought that if the <Col N="439" /> planner is going to be successful he will have to be aware that expenditure decisions on the one hand and taxation decisions on the other, will have their effect not merely on this year's budget &mdash; and I presume this is a movement away from Gladstonian budgeting &mdash; but on the attainment of targets through a period of years and will have long term consequnces. There are a variety of tax features in our codes which have had long term consequences, some of them good and some of them bad, but most of them unintended; certainly a lot of them were unintended and it is the unintended consequences of changes of expenditure and changes in taxation that seem to me to provide the planner with his greatest problem.</P>
    <P>Target setting or forecasting seems to me to be a reasonably easy kind of technical process.  Making judgments about the effects of changes over time &mdash; I do not know how any machine does that thing &mdash; involves all sorts of judgments and inter-relations that are not merely macroeconomic but inter-relations between human beings who are themselves changing under the change in the economy.</P>
    <P>I have some sympathy with the critics in the other House who were disappointed that the word &ldquo;social&rdquo; was not somewhere in the Minister's title but I shall not waste the time of this House on what we are not going to get even if we were gifted with the gift of Demosthenes at this stage.  But there are many references to social policy in the Bill.  I think up until very shortly, it was my view with regard to this that I am against the sort of diluted Rousseau-ism which has been operative in our social policy, shall we say in a phrase which I never normally use but is useful for this purpose, &ldquo;pursued by successive Governments&rdquo;.  I do not believe in the equality of the horse that is last in the Grand National and the horse that wins the Derby.  I do not believe that a policy designed to pretend that they are equal is good, particularly if it is costly and particularly if it wounds the animal that might have won the Derby and can no longer run <Col N="440" /> in it, through his brightness of intellect having being held back to keep in tune with the chap that could have run faster than him.  I would like to suggest that the social policy of the planner ought to be directed towards the business of eliminating poverty, concentrating on the matter of the people in real need, and less concerned with removing inequality, particularly the removal of the inequality that reduces the ability to create wealth with the social dimension.</P>
    <P>I would like to think that the planner who is to have this overall view of our economic and social scene bore more compassionately in his mind than I see signs of in any public document, the social cost of inflation; those whose monetary savings are eroded who have no hidden treasures by which they can be supplemented, the handicapped, whether by youth because of widowhood or orphanage, or the aged, those who are out of participation in the inflationary stakes through retirement.  A quick example of the sort of thing I have in mind: there is a limitation &mdash; I think it is 5 per cent&mdash;on the extent to which a private patient scheme can proof itself against inflation.  In the kind of depression, this very curious crisis that we have lived through, which I think uniquely combined the business slump with the price inflation, what happened to the pensioners?  I know that many of them, remembering happier days, are in very poor conditions and live on incomes very much below the average industrial earnings, having spent their lives working as hard as any of those who receive these average earnings, and live lives of quiet desperation behind lace curtains. I think society is very foolish in ignoring the effects of inflation in many of these cases.  Subversion can be bred in curious crannies; alienation can be found arising from different sources.  The annual budget is, I suppose, a kind of a plan, is it?</P>

      <P>Short term and varying according to the Government <Col N="441" /> in question.  I would like to know more precisely than I have understood &mdash; no doubt I have been precisely told &mdash; what is going to happen now.  I am all for flexibility but not so much flexibility that we have nothing positive and solid.  Are we going to be given a four-year plan with a rollover and when?  Is it going to roll over into the next Government?  Can we be told now or, if not, when, what the objectives are?  Above all, what policies will be used to achieve these objectives and how are they to be costed?  I think that the Government will be doing itself and the nation a disservice if it does not accept the responsibility of budgeting firmly for a term of years which should at least be four.  If it does not state the assumptions it is making and accept the obligations of adjusting the plan, these assumptions are incorrect.</P>
      <P>I believe the Government have an opportunity of recognising that there is potential here for a consensus.  There will always remain sufficient for the parties in this country to disagree about for it to be unnecessary for them to disagree about a matter so vital as this.  If democracies are going to survive they must be capable of producing the goods.  If their political processes have to be adjusted to that, the political parties operating them are those to make the adjustment.  If cynicism which is corrosive of democracy is to be overcome, it can only be overcome by an honest statement of the truth by everybody involved in political life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The invisible hand that Adam Smith talked about a couple of centuries ago has visibly disappeared, or at least is not visibly operative in this economy at the moment.  I should have thought it an important State purpose, an important planning purpose to demonstrate to the people the connection between progress and employment.  I think all dishonesty should be dropped about this.  In so far as it is remuneration on capital it should be seen to be such; in so far as it is another word for some other class or some other category of person to get a higher income there should be a policy about that.  I, personally, do not hesitate to express my conviction that whether or not the economy or the policy is ripe <Col N="442" /> for it now there will not be success here until there really is participation. I do not mean participation in management which seems to me rather a nonsense &mdash; people have to make decisions; people have to govern; people have to exercise discipline &mdash; but participation in the fruits of reward.  There is an obvious time lag between the generation of profit and the creation of additional employment but if private gain is accepted by the Government as the engine of growth its social dimension must be exposed.  The linkages between all the different components operative in the economy must be demonstrated.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer, if I may, to this matter of scarcity again and make one general point about it: it is always relative to expectations.  These expectations are sometimes greedy and sectional and to the extent that the economy here has grown, taking a secular view of the matter, not a few years but a 25- or 30-year period, the economic circumstances and conditions of the vast majority of people in this country have been totally transformed. People are infinitely better off in the generality than they were.  That has had a spoiling effect, just as new money always has a spoiling effect on people. We have a kind of a plutocracy concerned with sectional interest and without social commitment and, as this plutocracy gets better off and as economic growth increases, that will get worse, unless corrected by some means of moral education through political parties, education by example as well as by precept and other forms of education. These resources which are scarce will be in even greater demand.</P>
    <P>The social pattern changes with growth.  It has a dialectical element, but these expectations that are demanding are rarely as demanding, once you get to a certain stage of development, as the expectations of the good, the philanthropic, those whose hearts are moved by feelings for others, once they have got to the point of actually noticing the existence of the others they become clamped to the desirability of satisfying these needs which they have just observed.  The satisfaction of these expectations will be a very great task, one <Col N="443" /> I would have thought beyond the power of the planner and finally one which can be solved only through community leadership.</P>
    <P>I am not, to use the phrase, &ldquo;a Brits out&rdquo; man but in this matter of attitude to our situation I am a &ldquo;Brits out&rdquo; man.  I am a &ldquo;Brits out&rdquo; man on attitudes of people engaged in business and in agriculture.  I am a &ldquo;Brits out&rdquo; man in the matter of Governmental machinery.  I am a &ldquo;Brits out&rdquo; man, above all, in the matter of leadership. This country has, relatively speaking, wonderful opportunities presented to it &mdash; the new markets of the Community, 260 million, the new quality of our industry, our mineral discoveries and the potentially greater discoveries in that field, our new forestry and above all the demographic pattern of our work force.  If only our people can be got to understand that they are damaging their own interest, their children's, their grandchildren's interest, their neighbours' and their neighbours' children's interest by looking for more than can be given to them, if they can only be made to grasp that this is not hypocritical&mdash;talk that is absolutely true&mdash; and if they are encouraged to be as innovative and as risk-taking at home as they have been abroad and if all the institutions of Government are as good as they ought to be, then I would have the greatest confidence in the future of this country.  I am not at all too sure how long a life I give this new Department because I think it turns on many matters.  I hope, at any rate, that the life of the Minister who will head it will not be, as someone said recently, of &ldquo;the lives of all political animals&rdquo;, &ldquo;nasty, brutish and short&rdquo;.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this Bill setting up the new Department of Economic Planning and Development.  The functions of the new Department as envisaged in the Bill will ensure that its work will <Col N="444" /> not be concerned with abstractions and generalisations but will be linked specifically with the development of the economy and with hard reality. The functions of the new Department which are clearly set out in the Bill underline the important and demanding work with which the new Minister is charged.  I would like to refer briefly to these functions and to comment on them.  Section 2 (2) (a) refers to the promotion and co-ordination of economic and social planning.  In practice, these plans will relate to such concrete matters as energy and agribusiness. Furthermore, the reference to planning and development of regions of the country in this subsection is both welcome and appropriate and underlines the importance of the grass roots.  While the word &ldquo;social&rdquo;, as has already been pointed out, is not mentioned in the actual title of the Department, it is specifically mentioned in this subsection and in three further subsections.  In any event, in economic analysis and policy formulation the word &ldquo;development&rdquo; includes social as well as economic elements.  Therefore, it is clearly intended that the new Department will be concerned with the social as well as the economic aspects of planning and development for the economy.</P>
    <P>Section 2 (2) (b) indicates that the Department will be concerned with identifying the policies they consider necessary for general economic and social development and will report thereon to the Government.  The Minister referred to the new Department as providing central advice to the Government on economic and social policies.  Policies, of course, and policy-making are the very heartland of Government activity.  It is the deliberate intention as I understand it, that this new Department will have limited executive functions that they will be removed from most of the day-to-day pressures associated with other Departments of State and therefore the Minister will have the time and the opportunity and the necessary objectivity and detachment to identify policy options and to place these options before the Government for decision.  The overriding objective, of course, in <Col N="445" /> pursuing these policies will at all times be the achievement of the development of the economy as a whole.</P>
    <P>Some years ago the Department of Finance was the only Government Department engaged in the identification of policy options and in the placing of these options before the Government for decision.  Indeed, I suggest if previous efforts at economic planning were less than fully successful it may have been because the Department of Finance was unable fully to impose the discipline of their planning on other Government Departments. The creation of the proposed new Department creates a framework in which such an occurrence can be prevented.</P>
    <P>This new Department will have a central staff function.  One hears much about the pre-eminence of the Department of Finance.  It should be remembered, however, that the role of the Department of Finance has undergone very significant changes over the years, not least through the establishment of the Department of the Public Service in 1973, which had the effect of hiving off a large section of the functions of the Department of Finance.  The establishment of this new Department will give further impetus to the changing role of the Department of Finance and indeed will change the structure of Government itself.</P>
    <P>Section 2 (2) (c) envisages that the new Department will review and appraise the plans and activities of individual Departments of State.  The new Department, therefore, will play, as I see it, a lead role in going to other Departments to review and appraise the plans already set at individual Department level.  In so doing, the new Department will be following through, at programme level, the progress of departmental plans.  With regard to subsection 2 (2) (d), the key word here I think is &ldquo;integration&rdquo;. Having reviewed and appraised the plans of individual Departments and their part in implementing already agreed Government policy, it will be the task of the new Department to ensure that individual departmental plans form an integrated whole, again with the overriding objective of meeting national economic and social plans.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="446" /> Finally, Section 2 (2) <i>(e)</i> as specified in the Bill completes the planning process or cycle with the new Department reviewing the implementation of the national economic and social plans already approved by the Government in Cabinet.  The new Minister will report on progress thereon to the Government.</P>
    <P>The functions of the new Department as outlined in the Bill follow a very logical sequence indeed.  From this brief review of the functions of the Bill it is quite clear to me at any rate that the new Department will possess solid, tangible functions in the areas of economic planning and development.  The success of the new Department, like any Government Department, depends rather heavily on the co-operation and support the new Minister will receive from his Cabinet colleagues and, in particular, from the Taoiseach.  There is every reason to believe that such co-operation and support will be readily forthcoming.</P>
    <P>I would like to return to the question of the relationship between the Department of Finance and the proposed Department of Economic Planning and Development.  The establishment of any new Department of State, but in particular one which will be concerned with planning, naturally raises the question of the relationship of the new Department with the Department of Finance.  One of the primary functions of the Department of Finance, as already indicated by a previous speaker, is the budget.  The budget is a first step in the planning process and consequently the new Department will of necessity be involved in a constant dialogue in a two-way process of communication with the Department of Finance.  With due modesty I share the belief that economic planning and finance can be separated successfully.  I consider the establishment of the new separate Department timely and appropriate to Irish circumstances.</P>
    <P>As already indicated, the new Department will have a central function, having full departmental status at Cabinet level.  The Department of Finance, while obviously an important Department of State, produces its annual budget <Col N="447" /> only after several months of preparation following consultation and discussion among all Ministers in the Cabinet.  When the Minister for Finance presents his budget in January next he will have functional responsibility for it, but the budget will be the product of a Government decision and not solely a decision of the Minister for Finance.  In common with all major decisions made by the Government, the budget will be the product of Government decision-making at Cabinet level with the Cabinet acting as a team.  I do not share the view, therefore, that the Minister for Economic Planning and Development will suffer from a lack of power because of lack of control over finance.  Such a claim would exaggerate the present role of the Department of Finance and would ignore the present decision-making processes of Government. Moreover, since the new Department will be responsible for policy as well as planning, its role will be one of collaboration with the Department of Finance functioning in a new environment, and will not be in conflict with it.</P>

We would be prepared to welcome any effort by the Government to co-ordinate and streamline their plans and to inject more social and economic planning into coping with the very serious problems which face the country.  I tried by reading carefully through the debate on this measure in the ether House, to get a more definite sense of what the Government thinking behind it is.  As was pointed out, this was not a proposal which was contained expressly in the Fianna Fáil election manifesto.  There may be some truth in the observation that the Department is being created to fit the man rather than to fit a very explicit outline of the Government's approach. I do not want, in any way, to denigrate the approach unfairly.  I would like to be clear on what precisely is <Col N="448" /> meant.  The new Minister himself gave useful insights into what is intended to form at least part of the role of the new Department in his contribution to the debate in the other House on 19th October.  I quote from column 824 of the Official Report of that day:</P>
      <P>I think the reason why this new Department should have very limited executive responsibilities is to avoid the danger of it being sucked into day-to-day executive matters which would ultimately impair its ability to carry out the more detached, longer-run assessment which is necessary under modern conditions.</P>
      <P>The Minister then went on to say that he was not going to elaborate on that point because it had not really been raised in the debate so far.  I would be grateful if the Minister for the Public Service replying would elaborate on that aspect of the functions of the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can see a problem for any democratic Government in trying to plan for the longer term and in so doing to avoid the pressures to provide short-term but not necessarily wise solutions to particularly acute problems.  We have a massive unemployment problem and, in particular, we have the acute social problem of providing a sufficient number of jobs for younger people whilst also ensuring job opportunities for the less young, job opportunities for women coming back into the work force and the adequate training for these jobs.  The problems and the short-term pressures are there.  I would welcome more specific elaboration of how the new Department, in an effective sense, could provide that degree of detachment which would allow them to influence Government planning.  The Department could indeed become a very high-powered think-tank, but surely the structure of creating a whole Department under a Minister who is one of the 15 Ministers in the Cabinet is much too elaborate a structure just to formalise the think-tank approach?  Clearly much more than that must be intended.  I have referred to the first insight that the new Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, gave during the debate. <Col N="449" /> The second one, further down in the same column, was where he said:</P>
    <P>... it is the intention of the Government and the Minister for the Public Service to ensure that all Government Departments have an adequate planning capability, an adequate capacity for policy analysis and so forth, so that they can work in harmony with this new central Department of Economic Planning and Development.</P>
    <P>Again, I would welcome further elaboration by the Minister for the Public Service because there the new Minister appears to be conceding that it is the Minister for the Public Service who will have a major role to play in building up the adequate planning capabilities in the various Departments.  I would like to know what the precise relationship will be between the Tánaiste, as Minister for the Public Service, and the new Minister.</P>
    <P>I listened to Senator Hillery give his assessment of the functions of the new Department, examining them as set out under section 2 (2) of the Bill. He made a very constructive contribution in trying to assess how this would work out.  Nevertheless it is all still very hazy and it is difficult to see how this can be an effective method or technique for ensuring that the Government do address themselves to the necessity for serious economic and social planning.  I would contrast the approach to the very specific planning proposal of the Labour Party: the proposal for the establishment of a national development corporation and the accompanying planning to harness the resources of the State to provide for the economic and social needs and welfare of people.  That is specific.  It is something that can be comprehended. What I find very difficult about the wording of the various paragraphs of subsection (2) is that the words mean almost anything or nothing.  Section 2 (2) (a) reads:</P>
    <P>to promote and co-ordinate economic and social planning for the development of the economy both generally and as it affects <Col N="450" /> different sectors thereof and different regions of the country.</P>
    <P>It could be said that the National Economic and Social Council are doing that at the moment or that they could be briefed to do it.  Paragraph (b) states:</P>
    <P>to identify the policies it considers necessary for general economic and social development and report thereon to the Government.</P>
    <P>Again, it is a think-tank approach. What significance will be placed on it?  What power does the new Minister have to ensure that priority will be given to these reports?  What power do his officials have to ensure that they will stand up to the conflicting priorities in the Department of Finance or the Department of Agriculture with regard to the needs of those particular Departments?  It is difficult to see how the new Minister can deliver results on the general planning function which he has been given in this bill, namely:</P>
    <P>(c) to identify in consultation with Departments of State and to review and appraise the plans and activities of such Departments giving effect to the policies for general economic and social development adopted by the Government.</P>
    <P>That seems to be the type of function which the central policy review staff has which was first established by the conservative Government.  That type of review body is a possible instrument to advise the executive arm of the Government.  When the new Minister emphasised that the Department would not have executive functions, a fact which he welcomed, I wonder whether he realised that the fact that it would not have executive functions means that it may inevitably fall into the mould of a think-tank which will put forward proposals of a co-ordinating nature but will have no actual power of an executive nature and no power to implement the particular plans.</P>
    <P>It is very regrettable that the Minister has been given the narrow title of Minister for Economic Planning and Development, and that the Department have been called in the Bill the Department of Economic Planning and Development.  The Department should be set up to be a Department of economic <Col N="451" /> and social planning and development. The emphasis must, from the beginning&mdash;both in the title of the Minister and in the Bill establishing it&mdash;emphasise the importance of social planning.  Otherwise, the approach would appear to concede that one can somehow plan in economic terms and then afterwards start thinking about social considerations.  I admit that in the text of the Bill there is emphasis on the need to promote and co-ordinate both economic and social planning. This should be reflected in the title both of the new Minister and of the new Department.  Otherwise, it may tend to get downgraded in the approach of the Department and it may tend to get neglected.</P>
    <P>Last week I participated in a seminar organised by the Council for the Status of Women and the title of the seminar I was speaking at was called &ldquo;Economic and Social Planning&mdash; Where Do Women Fit In?&rdquo;.  Indeed, the new Minister also spoke at that meeting.  Far too little attention has been paid to the economic and social consequences of the achievement of equality and the need to plan for full participation by women as citizens and in the workforce of the State.  There is a tendency still to regard certain issues and topics as somehow falling within an artificial concept of &ldquo;women's issues&rdquo;.  The necessity to integrate women fully into the life of the nation is a very important part of economic and social planning, and must form a very significant part of the Government's approach.  It must even take priority in certain areas, because of the need for training and re-training women in order to redress the present intolerable imbalance in the contribution which women workers make in the life of the nation; the fact that they are cluttered at the bottom of the scale, either in secretarial jobs or unskilled jobs, in many cases beyond the reach of equality legislation providing for equal pay for equal or like work, because their work is not comparable with their male counterparts.  They are in &ldquo;women only&rdquo; jobs, as they are called.</P>
    <P>Therefore, apart from the magnitude <Col N="452" /> of the unemployment problem, there is also the need in Ireland to restructure our society totally, and to think much more radically than we have done about making a reality of equal participation by women.  This does not mean to encourage a few or substantially more women to participate in employment in precisely the way that the male work force has participated in jobs.  What is needed is a much more radical evaluation of work itself and of the human contributions, of the time involved and of the other aspects of the human dimension.  In other words, we need to understand the degree of social planning involved, and this we have not seen as yet in the approach to these problems especially at Government level.</P>
    <P>The responsibility resting on the new Minister and the expectations which the creation of this Department have raised risk being disappointed.  The Minister may be at risk, in some sense, of becoming a whipping-boy if there is not a greater sense of the practical implementation of a broad-based social and economic plan.  Of this there seems to be very little evidence in the contributions on the Government side. Some of the initial euphoria seems to have passed and the problems are still there.</P>
    <P>I do not want to under-estimate or to play down the seriousness of the problems, or to suggest that they can be coped with in a simplistic or easy manner.  The type of planning that we will require in this country if we are to have place for our young people, and opportunity for them to participate in jobs, is going to be very tough indeed. For that reason I would particularly welcome some elaboration of the notion that you can have a Department of State sufficiently detached from the executive day to day implementation or short term implementation, or even perhaps detached from pressure group activity, which will have sufficient strength and courage to put forward very tough decisions about planning. the creation of jobs, who will have jobs and possibly about job sharing and the way in which we must use the resources of the State.  For example, a Department who are prepared to assume this <Col N="453" /> responsibility might have some very tough proposals to put to the Department of Agriculture.  How would these be received by the Department, and how is the implementation going to work if the priorities are different between this particular planning Department and the executive Departments which are going to implement in the the various areas?</P>
    <P>I share the view&mdash;which must have been basic to this legislation for the creation of the new Department&mdash;that there is a need for a new dimension of economic and social planning in this country because we can no longer solve our major problem as we have solved it down the years&mdash;not solved it but eased the strain of it&mdash;through the terrible blight of emigration.  We have always had unacceptably high unemployment. During the forties and fifties and even during the comparative boom of the sixties, we allowed emigration to resolve it m some measure.  That particular alternative is not there, certainly to anything like the significant degree that it was before, though I am sorry to see that there is once again a rise in the emigration figures, particularly of young people going to the Continent of Europe, to Holland and to Germany, looking for work.</P>
    <P>We have to face these problems in the knowledge that our population is increasing dramatically each year, and that this increased population is going to come on the labour market each year, successively aggravating the problem unless we have managed to cope in a much more radical way.  Plans on paper are not going to be sufficient. What will be required will be the approach which the Labour Party had put forward.  It will require the establishment of a national development corporation or an equivalent type of body which can actually create and provide the jobs on the scale that is going to be needed, and can use the resources of the State to do this.  The setting up of a sophisticated think-tank or long term planning department will not really face the other Departments with the necessity to take the concrete steps which will be required.  I am still at a loss to see how this new Department will really face the Government with <Col N="454" /> its responsibilities and will create the type of enforcement mechanisms needed.  It will streamline a certain part of planning, and I accept that is important, but I do not think it will realise the expectations that have been created and the rather optimistic assessments by the Government supporters of its potential.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWhitaker" hpid="Dr. Whitaker Dr. Whitaker">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Whitaker</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to change the structure of Government. It will change it in a way which is of course more significant than the appointment of new Ministers of State, necessary and urgent as that reform undoubtedly is.</P>
      <P>In the Dáil on the Second Reading the Minister for Economic Planning and Development expressed disappointment at the extent of the consideration which had been given in the Dáil to the Bill &ldquo;as a measure, to change, by the introduction of a new Department, the structure of Government as we know it&rdquo;.  I am quoting him.  I would like to address my remarks to the principle of the Bill, that is, I would like to offer some comments on whether the introduction of this new Department is a good change in the structure of Government, whether it will contribute to the smooth and efficient discharge of Government functions in relation to economic planning and development or whether there was perhaps a better way which has been set aside without sufficient consideration.</P>
      <P>I hope to discuss this question entirely without reference to personalities. I will be making, perhaps, an unpopular argument, namely that the Department of Finance should have been confirmed and strengthened in its planning responsibilities.  I want to make it clear that nothing I say implies any view as to the relative status or competence of the Ministers concerned. They are obviously both persons who would strengthen any Cabinet and I have the greatest respect for their qualities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The function for which the most appropriate Government agency is being considered is that of economic planning in a broad sense.  So the first question is what is a plan and the <Col N="455" /> second is, what part does Government play in bringing it about.  As I conceive it, a plan is a coherent and comprehensive set of policies for economic and social development over a period of four or five years ahead. The plan must be consistent with the availability of resources and its various parts must be well integrated. Since, in my view, a plan is the supreme policy document of the Government, it should be settled early in the life of a Government.  Several projections should be made of economic prospects based on different but not implausible assumptions.  These projections, the assumptions underlying them, and the conditions for realising them, should be published and used as a basis for consultation with the major economic and social interests.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Minister say tonight that that sort of consultation is intended.  This would mean that, in advance of the final settlement of a plan and its presentation to the Dáil, objectives of social and economic policy would be considered under the compulsion of necessary choice between alternatives.  I agree with Senator FitzGerald that, since scarcity still obtains, this choice between alternatives is imperative.  Not only should the objectives be considered against that imperative, but also with an understanding of the conditions to be observed in order to achieve the chosen objectives.  The hope would be that aspirations could thus be brought more into line with the total availability of resources, that conflicts about priorities would be at least lessened, if not resolved, and that at the end of the consultative process a definite plan, which was both realistic and had a wide measure of public support, could be adopted.  Otherwise a plan might merely express wishful thinking and irreconcilable desires and the lack of consensus would in any event tear it apart.</P>
    <P>Since a plan may have to be modified because of new developments which falsify the original assumptions, or because of failure to realise certain basic conditions of success, a process of review and adjustment is obviously <Col N="456" /> essential.  It is my argument that the annual budget is the appropriate occasion for that review and adjustment. This would make its own contribution to the more mature working of democracy by placing the budget in its proper perspective&mdash;bringing the shorter term into convergence with the longer term&mdash;and so divesting the budget in part at least, of its traditional Santa Claus connotation.  It would also ensure regular accountability of the Planning Minister to the Dáil, a point on which concern was expressed by Members of that House.</P>
    <P>The preliminaries of a plan, to my mind, are no less important that the end results aimed at.  I see great merit in involving the various social and economic interests in considering development potentialities, the conditions on which they can be realised, and the uses to which the gains made should be put.  This method of educating and persuading the various interests towards an understanding of the trade-offs involved&mdash;the trade-off, for example, as between higher incomes and higher employment&mdash;of persuading them towards some form of consensus about policies would, I believe, make Government easier and better directed and do something to rescue democracy from disorder and the economy from the rather grim prospect of permanent heavy unemployment.</P>
    <P>What I am saying is that politics may be the art of the possible, but we should always try hard to extend the range of the possible, that is, the area of consensus for action, so that the democratic system will not degenerate into intolerable ineffectiveness.</P>
    <P>It will be clear from what I have just said that I see a significant difference between a plan and a pre-election manifesto.  I consider it is the degree to which the plan's objectives are achieved, subject, of course, to any unavoidable or desirable modifications, which should be the foremost measure of the success or failure of the Government's economic and social policies.</P>
    <P>If this is what a plan should be, <Col N="457" /> how it should be produced and adjusted and how it can make a contribution to the better working of the democratic system, I come to the second question I asked a while ago, namely, what part does Government play in making a plan effective? Discussion of this question should help to decide which is the most appropriate agency of Government for that purpose.  There are limitations to Government action in the economic and social fields.  Indeed, it could be said that Governments tend at times to assume management responsibilities beyond their capacity.  I should like, however, to focus on the positive side. So far as Governments can influence the achievement of social and economic objectives they do so mainly through their fiscal prerogative, that is, the right&mdash;indeed, I would think it a duty&mdash;to settle the scale, purposes and method of financing public expenditure; &ldquo;method of financing&rdquo; covers the question of how much by taxation and how much by borrowing.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, other policies through which a Government can try to influence the course of the economy, monetary policy and incomes policy in particular.  As we all know, these are not so readily available. They may be of limited or doubtful efficacy in particular circumstances. The scope for monetary policy in an open economy with free outward and largely free inward movement of funds is restricted, though not insignificant.  The development of incomes in a way helpful to competitiveness and progress is, as we all know, of great importance but, unfortunately, not as easily influenced by Government action as are expenditure, taxation or borrowing.</P>
    <P>The point I want to make, however, is that the execution of all these policies has rested, and even after this Bill has been enacted will continue to rest, with the Department of Finance. The Department of Finance are quite competent to draft a plan and conduct the necessary consultations.  They could do the whole preparatory job as the Government's central agency; they could do the co-ordinating at <Col N="458" /> Government level, and, as I have just said, they will always have the vitally important executive role.  One could see it in this way, that the Minister for Finance will be the performer on the field of play while the Minister for Economic Planning and Development gives advice and encouragement from the sidelines and tries to keep play within the &ldquo;development&rdquo; rules.</P>
    <P>As I know from my Central Bank experience, there can be a wide gulf, perhaps a wall of silence would describe it better, between advice and action.  The influence that may be exercised through advice and persuasion is a second-best, I believe, to the power of the purse.  The role of an adviser or co-ordinator who has no direct power, no money allocating function, is not an enviable one.  The Minister for Economic Planning and Development was careful to spare the new National Science and Technology Board this particular frustration; yet, surprisingly, he accepts it for himself.</P>
    <P>This is the basic weakness of the proposed separation of functions, a weakness that could have been avoided had the Department of Finance been confirmed in their development responsibilities and had that Department's conscience, as it were, been made more sensitive to this overriding obligation by having it clearly assigned to them.</P>
    <P>To my regret, this has not been done. The Department of Finance, through this lowering of its sights, this lessening of its responsibilites, is being allowed, perhaps, to slip back into that negative, restrictive role, that preoccupation with candle-ends to the possible neglect of long-term national development needs, for which its critics have always loved to pillory it.  They equate it, as I heard Senator Keating do, with the old-time Treasury in order the better to set it up as an Aunt Sally.  For someone who, over a long period of years, has tried to bring the exercise of the traditional functions of the Department of Finance&mdash;and they are important functions&mdash;of critical analysis and control of expenditure and equitable levying of taxation into line with the even <Col N="459" /> more important macro-economic planning functions, this new move is rather disheartening, the more so, as I still vividly recall the enthusiasm and dynamism released in my Finance colleagues of 20 years ago when we turned our minds away from purely critical preoccupations towards a constructive study of national development possibilities.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil, the Minister for the Public Service saw &ldquo;the establishment of this new Department as part of the evolutionary process first begun when the Economic Development Branch was established within the Department of Finance&rdquo;.  I am bound to say that I had a different vision of the evolutionary process.  I saw it as leading naturally to a Department of Finance and Economic Development in which the day-to-day controlling functions and the annual budgetary process would be set in the framework of a longer term development plan prepared and administered by the Department. One of the principal lessons of French economic planning is that the success of a plan largely depends upon the participants believing it to be their own plan.  I fear, therefore, that evolution has taken or been given a wrong turn; that it has, as it were, branched off from the <i>homo sapiens</i> route.  The development consciousness of Finance is being diminished but its powers are not being transferred.</P>
    <P>We have, it is true, been assured that there will be close contact, consultation, exchange of information, goodwill and co-operation between the Ministers involved and, of course, it has been pointed out that there must be Cabinet discussion and resolution of major issues.  As I see it, the situation is such as to engender doubts and render these assurances necessary.  I have no difficulty in believing that there will be the utmost co-operation and good working relations between the two Ministers immediately involved and that they will overcome the risks to which the new structures expose them.  But structures should not depend for their viability on the qualities of particular holders of ministerial office.  The new system will require <Col N="460" /> more co-ordination both between Departments and at Government level. Of its nature it opens the door to friction.  The new Department will be another cog in the administrative machine.  I state that as a fact and not with any pejorative implication. I raise the question whether the arrangement could be expected to work well if, say, a Coalition were in power and the Minister for Finance were drawn from one Party and the Minister for Economic Planning and Development from the other.  Indeed, what might happen if there were a personality clash between Ministers of the same Party in power?</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste has referred to the heavy strain already imposed on the Minister for Finance who is also Minister for the Public Service.  I appreciate this.  But could not one have tried to ease that strain in other ways, for example, by using the proposed Ministers of State to assist the Minister for Finance, on the one hand, with the function of controlling public expenditure and raising money and, on the other, with his public service functions, leaving the Minister himself more time for the all-important development responsibility?</P>
    <P>I would concede that, for one reason or another, the Department of Finance has in recent years tended to let slip its planning function.  I think, however, that the Tánaiste was less than fair to himself and his predecessors when he said in the Dáil that no Minister for Finance had ever effectively exercised it.  Disenchantment with the more detailed kind of planning had become pretty general in Western Europe even before the destructive impact of the oil crisis.  Then the difficulties of the time were given as a reason for not attempting to take a longer view and the Minister for Finance largely concentrated on short-term problems and devoted much of his time and energy to tax legislation rather than development planning. The growing unruliness of our society &mdash;the evident lack of solidarity, of a sense of community inter-dependence &mdash;were also inhibiting factors.  As I have already explained, I entertain, optimistically maybe, the hope that <Col N="461" /> these difficulties might at least be somewhat eased by the educative and persuasive process of consultation that should precede the final settlement of a plan.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that experience, here or elsewhere, establishes the need for a drastic change in planning responsibilities. The Department of Finance is competent, and the Minister for Finance is well placed within Government, to discharge these responsibilities. Confirming that they rest with the Minister for Finance, and equipping that Minister with the aid and resources to discharge them, would, I submit, be preferable from the point of view of logic, order, unity and strength to the creation of a new Ministry.</P>
    <P>I realise I shall probably not make any converts to this view and I hope that what I have said will not be taken amiss.  I feel it my duty to speak here according to my judgment and experience. While I do regard the new structure as a second best, I certainly do not wish it to fail.  I am sure that the Ministers concerned and the civil service will do their best to make it work. In the interests of national progress I hope the new Ministry will successfully overcome the disabilities and strains to which I have been referring and that time will disprove my misgivings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the Second Bill we have had before us today which for me indicates a certain rush about drafting the legislation and the motivation behind the legislation and a certain lack of conviction in the arguments being put forward by the Government as to both the reasons for the legislation and the chances of success at the end of the road of our passing both Bills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill sets up the Department of Economic Planning and Development and it also outlines the functions which will be appropriate to that Department. The setting up of this Department invites the question, first of all, as to whether a separate Ministry is needed at all for the task.  One could be, perhaps, a little bit mischievous and be a <Col N="462" /> little bit political if one were to start speculating on the compromises which no doubt had to ensue as a result of negotiations between the new Minister and the Department of Finance when it came to the drafting of this legislation, and also as regards the seeds of friction which even at this early stage can be seen to exist between the Departments as regards the successful implementation of such a Department.</P>
    <P>One wonders whether the Department of Finance could not carry out this function which is being entrusted to a new Department and a new Minister. It is no harm to go back to the history of previous plans.  The first plan, which was from 1959 to 1963, worked to an extent.  The second economic plan, of 1964 to 1970, collapsed somewhat half-way through its duration and the third plan, which was projected to commence and run for a period of four or five years from 1971, never really got off the ground and disappeared at a very early stage.  If the Department of Economic Planning and Development had existed for the duration of those three plans would their efforts, have been any more successful than was the case?  The first economic plan worked to an extent but it has always to be remembered that it was starting off from a very low basis indeed as regards social and economic improvement in this country; that it should succeed to an extent was beyond doubt from the outset.  But the experience of the second and third plans was that they came up against the inter-play of forces, both within our society and from outside our society, which affect any democratic state and a free economy such as ours.  Therefore, I wonder whether the Department of Finance could not be depended upon to do as good a job as they did in the first economic plan, bearing in mind that no matter who devises a plan and tries to pursue its implementation we will always have to run the risks of the pressures within and without our society.</P>
    <P>The functions outlined in this legislation foresee that the procedures for compilation of a plan will have to be simple but yet concise.  I wonder if enough thought has been given to the <Col N="463" /> possibility of the bottlenecks which will no doubt arise in this compilation of plans.  Will this extra Department create an extra layer of bureaucracy in the drafting of the plan?  Will the existence of another Department in our overall executive structure delay Government action in the end? Whether Departments will co-ordinate and co-operate with the new Department is something which remains to be seen, but one is inclined to doubt whether these other Departments are geared structurally and even psychologically to co-operate with a new Department which, when all is said and done, will be there merely in an advisory and a persuasive capacity rather than in a really executive capacity.</P>
    <P>The purse in the final resort is all-powerful and I have no doubt that if a plan for the future economy of our country were to emanate from a Department which held the purse strings it would be all the more accepted by the other Departments.  It would be wrong of me not to wish the new Minister every success in the task he has ahead of him, but he has been less than fairly treated in receiving what I would regard as inadequate powers to carry out his ministerial functions in this most important task.  I wish the new Department the best of luck in their task but I must admit that if politics is an ephemeral business, while I do not extend that to the new Minister, I hope he will be with us for a very long time.  I cannot hold out much hope that this Department will be with us for a long time because I am afraid they will fall between pressures of lack of co-operation from other Departments and the over-riding consideration that they have no teeth and no effective powers in which to ensure that the policies and the plans which they adumbrate can be carried out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelMulcahy" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to contribute under a number of headings and what I have prepared beforehand has been influenced obviously by what Senator Whitaker has said and therefore in speaking to the points which I had prepared before I would like to advert <Col N="464" /> to the line he took.  I see Senator Whitaker as being influenced by the economic imperatives in following a particular policy line and in developing his views.  I, on the other hand, would be inclined to follow what I would call the planning imperatives and my proposition is that to the extent that planning has failed in the latter years it has failed because the planning imperatives were not recognised and were not followed.</P>
      <P>At the risk of losing my logic in an analogy I see that the Department of Finance and the Department of Economic Planning and Development are somewhat analogous to the financial comptroller in a large corporation on the one hand and the corporate planner on the other.  The large corporations over the years found that the narrow approach to planning taken by people who are trained mostly in the field of finance or accounting was not sufficient and a new function emerged because there was a need and that is the function of corporate planning. If one asks in what way is the corporate planner of a company short on power and therefore not able to come forward with plans that are acceptable, have teeth, make an impact, have a chance of being implemented and so on, the reason is that usually he has the chief executive on his side.  In this case over and above the collective operational stance that a Government take and responsibilities that they have, I would see that the Taoiseach would have that type of influence, and in fact some of it we can see is working in practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the main planning imperatives is that planning is a process.  It is not so much that you are going to come up with a five-year plan that is bound up in a yellow, green, red or any other colour document which might be filed away ultimately in the Minister's safe and perhaps never implemented.  It means that you instiute a process of planning which is much richer than just a process of consultation.  It is a process of real involvement in the evolution of options and in the evolution of ideas that will tend to optimise existing resources and maybe find ways of getting new ones. <Col N="465" /> There is a danger with placing planning in a financial function, whether it is a macro-financial function in the sense of macro-economics or micro in the sense of accounting.  Those people who know about lack of resources can very often inhibit the very development of the ideas that should evolve in a planning process.  So far from taking the view that planning can come only from that financially oriented area I would take the opposite view and say that it must come from another area.  In saying that I am influenced for instance by what President Eisenhower is stated to have said, that &ldquo;plans never work but planning is everything&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Planning for me comes from a study of a number of works in this area and has three levels.  It has the normative level, the strategic and the operational levels.  I will translate that.</P>
