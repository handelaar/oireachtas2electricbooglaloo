      <P>That Seanad Éireann approves the following Order in draft:</P>
      <P>Housing Act, 1969 (Continuance) Order, 1977,</P>
      <P>a copy of which Order in draft form was laid before Seanad Éireann on the 25th day of October, 1977.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett) Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Housing Act, 1969, was brought into force in July, 1969, in order to provide statutory controls over the demolition or change of use of habitable houses.  It does this by requiring that a habitable house may not be demolished or its use changed except with the permission of the <Col N="296" /> appropriate housing authority.  The Act is a temporary measure and is due to expire on the 31st December, 1977, unless continued in force by an order made by me, after it has been approved by resolution by each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>When determining an application for permission under the Act the housing authority is obliged to consider the state of repair of the house to which the application relates and the adequacy of the supply of housing in its functional area.  A housing authority may refuse a permission or can grant it without conditions or may attach conditions requiring the provision or replacement residential accommodation or a contribution towards the cost of providing it.  In the event that a planning permission under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts, 1963 and 1976, is also required for the proposed works, the planning application must not be decided until such time as the application under the 1969 Act has been determined.</P>
      <P>The Dublin and Cork areas have accounted for most of the activity under the Act since it came into force. To the end of September this year, Dublin Corporation received 1,710 applications for permission, granted permission with conditions in 979 cases and refused it in the remaining 731 cases.  Out of a total of 214 applications received by Cork Corporation in the same period, permission was granted in 137 cases and refused in 55. Apart from cases that reached the application stage, the existence of the Act and its controls and the penalties for breaches of its requirements have. I am satisfied, ensured that habitable houses are still functioning which would otherwise have been lost to the stock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Act contains a provision for the right of appeal to me against the decision of a local authority.  Of the total 595 appeals received up to the end of September last, 30 were invalid because they were not received within the statutory period, 79 were withdrawn, 425 were determined and the remaining 61 were under consideration. Of the appeals determined, 94 <Col N="297" /> were allowed, 159 were allowed subject to conditions and 172 were refused.</P>
    <P>Though a considerable number of houses have been provided in recent years I am advised that a number of local authorities foresee a continuing need for controls of the type provided by the Act and consider that permanent legislation for this purpose should be provided.  The necessary drafting is well advanced and I hope to include appropriate sections in a forthcoming Housing Bill.</P>
    <P>The Draft Order now before the House proposes to continue the 1969 Act in its present form for a further two years to 31st December, 1979, by which time I am satisfied the permanent legislation will have been enacted.</P>
    <P>I commend the motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJMcCartin" hpid="Mr. McCartin Mr. McCartin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>Firstly, as is customary, I should like to extend a welcome to the new Minister for the Environment and to wish him every success in his efforts in that Department in the years ahead.  I hope his efforts will have the success they deserve. We, on this side of the House, have no objection to the motion before us.  Naturally, it is the sort of order that must be renewed and we appreciate the reason why.  For no economic considerations should it be possible for anybody to lessen the number of habitable dwellings when there is so much pressure and suffering at present by couples bringing up families who urgently need the shelter and comfort of a habitable home adequate for their requirements.  No economic considerations should override the necessity to ensure that the maximum number of these homes are available at all times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I realise that this is a measure which is most applicable to the industrialised urban areas &mdash; the Minister referred particularly to Dublin and Cork &mdash; I can see the importance of having the maximum number of homes available in every part of the country.  Successive Governments have done their best in this field, but I have <Col N="298" /> always felt that no Government in recent years made sufficient effort to make it possible for more people to provide their own homes.  I have always felt very strongly about this. Orders or stop gap measures such as this will be necessary as long as we fail to provide the right conditions in which everybody can be the owner or occupier of his own home.  In areas like Dublin and Cork we have to fall back on the high rise flats, people renting homes temporarily and all the other methods used in the absence of a sufficient number of houses being available and the ability of people to pay for them.</P>
    <P>The provision of a home has become more difficult for the ordinary young married couple than it ought to be.  Of course, one of the greatest obstacles at the moment is the cost of a site.  It is terrible to hear, even in rural areas, of people having to pay £5,000 or £6,000 to get a site in a reasonably good location.  I have heard of cases where this amount of money was paid in less densely populated rural areas.  In the cities the problem is worse.  Local authorities should concern themselves more with the availability of sites for housing than with the building of houses.  No house can be built as economically as the house where the job is undertaken by the person who needs the house.  Far too many young people see this as an impossibility to achieve.  Not enough people realise that at present the building material for an adequate new home can be bought for a figure of less than £5,000.  That can be done at a time when many people consider themselves fortunate to be able to buy a four-bedroomed house for £12,000 to £14,000, depending on the location. This sort of money should not have to be spent by young people on a home.  When we convert this into annual repayments over a period of 20 years we see that a very high proportion of the ordinary working person's total earnings must be spent on the provision of a home.  I do not think people should have to invest this sort of money in a home.</P>
    <P>If this whole business was taken in isolation, taken away from what we <Col N="299" /> normally regard as the building industry, and looked at from the point of view of the necessity for this for people and try to seek the cheapest and most efficient means by which this amenity, a most important amenity, can be provided for everyone we would find that local authorities would feel it their duty to make available sites at the right price.  This could be done.  In some cases, the smaller towns, particularly in rural areas, instead of looking for sites in advantageous positions large farms should be bought, land that can be bought even at £2,000 an acre or less.  A complete development scheme could be organised, a supply of water and electricity laid on and sites provided for people who need them.  One would find that in those circumstances people would avail themselves of the site and provide their own home.  This could be done at a fraction of the cost housing is costing people at present.  The more local authority housing we have, the more expensive and the less efficient it will be.  The more people housed in local authority houses, the less independent these people will be and the more careless they will be about the manner in which the houses are maintained and the more it will cost to keep them in good repair.  This and measures of this sort should lead to consideration of the whole problem of housing.  It is only fair that in the context of the measure before us we should point out the necessity for such measures.  The Minister should think about the points I have raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to speak purely on the business before the House.  It would be easy to launch into a full scale debate on housing and Senators, like myself, would be tempted to do that because it is a wide subject. The statutory control this measure proposes to continue in the 1969 Act is very wise.  Some local authorities are acting contrary to the controls imposed in the 1969 Act.  There is large scale clearance of buildings taking place and much of this work is done without due consideration for road widening and realignment and traffic control or the easement of traffic problems around <Col N="300" /> towns and villages.  It is very easy for a local authority to wipe out buildings without taking into account the need for the replacement of houses.  I have a first-hand knowledge of the benefit of the retention of this Act and its provisions in my area.  I see daily advertised on television, channels that may not be received as far south as Dublin, an advertisement offering more than £2,000 for the reconstruction of old buildings.  That makes sense because the State is involved on expenditure of almost £8,000 to £10,000 in the provision of a new house for anybody. There is no magic or miracle in promising the money.  The taxpayer, the local ratepayer or somebody provides that money and, in a lot of cases, subsidises the rent on the house thereafter This is a serious matter and one that everybody in the State should be interested in.  They are involved in n whether they realise it or not.  I strongly support the retention of the provisions in the 1969 Act and I support the Minister in reminding local authorities of their obligation as contained in this Act.  There is a serious consequence if local authorities are allowed to embark on the demolition of houses without replacing them.  While the new houses might replace those being demolished local authorities are not making progress in the provision of houses.  All they are doing is standing still.  This matter has to be highlighted.  There is no point in claiming we have built so many houses in a county if, in fact, we are only taking people out of houses that we were demolishing.  There is a greater need for housing.</P>
      <P>Senator McCartin would be inclined to say that no Government has done enough.  Certainly, this is not the forum for having political crossfire but we are very conscious that the Minister, and the Government, have done a lot more than their predecessors.  They have sowed new seeds of confidence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was the lack of will rather than the lack of cash.  The new seeds of confidence have been <Col N="301" /> sown and, in fact, there is now private building of houses on a large scale.  I am certain the Minister will confirm this.  Many people are now prepared to build their own homes and provide a home for themselves.  They were reluctant to get involved or committed under the previous administration.  I hope this is only a start because I would like the Minister, when the new Housing Act is introduced &mdash; he stated it will be approximately two years &mdash; that every public representative will have an opportunity of contributing to that and influencing to some measure the provisions of the Act.  Many of the proposals I could think of might not be acceptable but it is necessary for the State, the Government, to have a consistent policy regarding housing.  It should not be a stop-go affair.  On the change of a Minister or change of a Government, it is important to have a constructive policy regarding housing. I suggest that we should have an in-built grant increase support.  It should automatically increase every year.  It should not be left until political pressure builds up from the public, or the demand builds up, or until inflation outswamps the present grant system.  It is necessary for any house support grants to have safeguards and that they will improve yearly on a sliding scale.</P>

      <P>May I say that this motion has very restricted terms and it cannot be extended to cover a general debate on housing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only referring to the provisions of a new Act which the Minister hopes to introduce inside two years.  I hope the Minister will consider some of my proposals.  I will keep to the Cathaoirleach's ruling as far as possible.  I am very glad to have an opportunity to speak on housing and I am sure we will have this opportunity in the future.  At the same time as this measure is being extended, could we ask the Minister to consider updating and upscaling grants for the reconstruction of houses?  It is a very welcome measure and for the economy of the nation it is well worth while.  There is a great need for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="302" /> There was no up-scaling of grants for reconstruction during the term of the last Government and we know what happens to money values in four-and-a-half years.  I am expecting the Minister to announce an improved reconstruction grant.  It would be the best measure he could introduce, because many people who are now allowing buildings to be demolished would have second thoughts if there was an improved grant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>First, let me add my voice to the usual congratulations and welcome to the new Minister for the Environment on this occasion in the Seanad.  In parenthesis let me say to him that while I think the change in title to Minister for the Environment is a welcome one, if it is no more than window dressing it will not be satisfactory.  Nothing happens in a moment and I hope that in time he will be able to pull together the different environmental concerns into a single Department.  I do not think that the old Department of Local Government currently is yet a Department for the Environment.  I hope he will be able to make it one.  In so far as he tries to unify the different environmental concerns in a single place he can expect support, certainly from the Labour Party in this House.  I want briefly to address myself to the motion. We have, first, a need for improved housing.  We have had for decades and it will continue.  Secondly, this is an inescapable heavy social charge, however it is paid for.  I am not entering the question of how it is financed at this moment.  Thirdly, we possess a stock of old houses which can be brought to or maintained in suitable condition for good dwelling houses at much lower cost than building new houses.  Therefore, in general economic terms it is sensible to see that our old stock is maintained and improved. We have forces working against that tendency, some psychological and some economic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The building industry which is dominated in its council by large builders would obviously like to knock down the old and build the new.  They would like to build the new in a semi-machine way of uniform houses of the <Col N="303" /> sort of feelingless and rather ugly suburbs we have seen springing up all over Ireland.  The interests of the small builder of course who is much less powerful in the council of the building industry is the opposite.  He is often a man without the big financial or big technological back-up.  He is interested in the question of improvement, of maintenance, renovation and the maintaining of the old housing stock.  We have a cultural objection to old houses too which is very funny.  It is strikingly evident in parts of the country where a great deal of thought is given to the maintenance of musical culture, of verbal culture, of traditional culture as expressed in language, in dance, in music and so on.  Yet we seem to hate the old houses and knock them down.  Our cities and towns have varied architecture, some of it of great beauty and of great value.  We make our environment much the poorer by permitting the old to disappear by having things that are uniform in age and uniform in design.  Both economically and culturally it is desirable that we maintain the old along with the new that is also essential.  It is for that reason that this seems to me something that certainly we can support.  I urge on the Minister, as Senator McGowan did, that when he produces his Housing Bill &mdash; we will have our larger debate on that occasion, not now &mdash; he will have regard to the incentive for the maintenance and the improvement of older dwellings.  In the UK &mdash; I am not suggesting that we copy the UK &mdash; what exists there is interesting.  It is something from which both the physical environment of people requiring houses and the whole, what one might call, the aesthetic environment of Britain, the maintenance of old buildings, has benefited.  There is a more generous regime of aid to those who wish to maintain and improve old houses than exists here.  I hope the Minister will see some of the solution of a continuing housing shortage in the encouragement of the maintenance and, indeed, the reconditioning and improving of old houses and that there might be an improvement in the financial incentive environment, possibly by direct plan, possibly also in <Col N="304" /> the taxation area for doing that when the time comes.  That is a thought for the future and for the Bill which he made mention of in his introduction. In regard to the continuation order itself we are happy to support it and we look forward to the definitive legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMcGlinchey" hpid="Mr. McGlinchey Mr. McGlinchey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGlinchey</NameTxt>
      <P>This order is very important because of the grave housing situation here.  We cannot afford to demolish houses that are capable of remaining.  Because of the serious housing situation local authorities should be given the opportunity of deciding whether a house is capable of occupation, should be used for that purpose or for otherwise.  I was somewhat amused when Senator McGowan made a statement a short time ago that this Government, this Minister, had done more for housing than his predecessor, by Senator Keating's reaction. He called across, &ldquo;Ballymagash Urban Council.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGlinchey</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Keating should know all about the Ballymagash Urban Council because he was a member of it for the last four years. It was in this field of housing that Senator Keating's colleague failed, and that his Government failed, more than in anything else.  One of the reasons why it is important that this order be passed is that the claims of the last Government, particularly of Senator Keating's colleague, the then Minister for Local Government, that they were building &mdash; Senator Keating says this is disgraceful and I realise that he&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGlinchey</NameTxt>
      <P>There would be no call for this order if we had sufficient houses.  The figures given to us in the last four years, as I said earlier, included the demountable dwellings provided at a cost of £1,000 or £1,500. <Col N="306" /> The figures also included the sale of council houses to tenants, houses that were built under a Fianna Fáil Government. These figures were used to provide a statistic in the Department of Local Government which would now suggest that the National Coalition built 25,000 houses in the last four years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGlinchey</NameTxt>
      <P>If we get down to actual new houses provided, the number falls far short of that figure. Senator McGowan was perfectly right when he said that this Minister has done more for housing in his short period in office than his predecessor.  He has done more for housing by one simple act in providing a reasonable incentive for people to building their own homes without a means test.  The &ldquo;Ballymagash Urban Council&rdquo; abolished these grants and left a situation where a person would only get a grant to build a house if he was earning under £47 per week.  It was the opinion of the National Coalition Government and the socialist members of it that any person earning over £47 per week did not need a grant to build his own home.  With the change of Government the people who were denied these grants by the National Coalition may now be in a position to receive a grant of £1,000.  That act alone has done more to stimulate the housing industry than anything else.</P>
      <P>On the preservation of houses, I would agree that the financial incentive should be provided by the Government. For years the reconstruction grants in the Six Counties were much higher than new house grants.  In this way people were encouraged to preserve these houses who otherwise might have let them deteriorate.  I would like to see a situation on this side of the Border where grants larger than new housing grants would be paid to the owners of such property. This would be an incentive to have these houses repaired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not often that we get an opportunity in this House of speaking on housing.  The lack of housing frustrates <Col N="307" /> us all.  As a member of the urban council in Letterkenny, I personally saw plans for a new housing scheme on the second Monday of November, 1974.  I am aware that those plans were delayed and never sanctioned by that Government who built so many houses.</P>

      <P>Pending the introduction of more comprehensive legislation suited to the late seventies, I, in common with all the speakers here today, am prepared to agree to the passing of the resolution to continue the Temporary Provisions Act.  I am in total agreement with the idea behind it.  It is applicable to the rural areas as well as to the conurban areas like Dublin and Cork.  There is a large stock of strongly-built oldtime farm houses that could be reconstructed and which would add to the existing housing stock without imposing on central and local authorities the financial burdens necessary to build new houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For some extraordinary reason various Governments &mdash; I am not condemning this one or the last one&mdash; have refused to give to people wishing to reconstruct their houses sufficient grant money to enable them to embark upon it.  They have also restricted loans for this purpose.  They have stymied the efforts of many people who would have embarked upon the reconstruction and repair of their houses.  In all sincerity I would say to the Minister that this is something that has to be looked into quickly by the Government because a lot of these old houses are deteriorating at an alarming rate.  In many cases people in their latter years, and indeed people who have young families, are not able to embark upon the reconstruction with the meagre minimal grants available <Col N="308" /> at the moment.  This is something that all of us here should support to the limit.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons the Bill was introduced in the first instance was that it was found that cities such as Dublin and Cork were rotting at the centre; houses were being demolished left, right and centre and the people were being sent out to the perimeter of the cities with consequent transport problems. Everybody knows the problems of coming into Dublin from any direction with traffic jams all over the place. This has been occasioned by the fact that people were pushed out into the suburbs by a policy that allowed the city centre to deteriorate and rot.</P>
    <P>It may be a bit late in the day to talk about the centre of Dublin city.  I would not know so much about this but I spoke to some people at local authority and Government level and they have a feeling that it will not be too easy in the future.  The fact that legislation exists to prevent the demolition of houses still capable of being reconstructed will be some brake on the rot that has been taking place in this and in other areas.  It is too big a question and the mass of irrelevancies introduced this morning might lead me to go down that kind of by-way, but I will not strain your patience in this regard. Sir.</P>
    <P>I wish to say again that the Minister should take heed of what I say about the examination at local authority level of the housing stock which exists, with a view to finding out how many houses can be reconstructed, and at the same time designate a proper financial structure of loans and grants so that the people concerned can avail of them.  It will be a worthwhile exercise and one which should be pursued.  Most of the people here, including yourself, Sir, come from the country and would like to see the thatched house preserved.  The people who have thatched houses have never got sufficient grants.  They should be entitled to extra grants from the central and local authorities to preserve the wonderful old thatched houses that are getting so scarce throughout the country.  Many of them are still there and can be preserved.  It is only a matter <Col N="309" /> of providing a certain extra amount of money.  The old traditional Irish house is worth preserving.  All of us who look around today and see many of the things we valued in our youth disappearing would love to ensure that the thatched house will live on.  I would like the Minister to take heed of my remarks in that regard.</P>

      <P>Housing is something I have lived with for about 26 years because of my husband, Derry.  I would take a poor view of somebody who would be critical of the Department of Local Government. Usually at a meeting I am corrected and brought back to what it is all about because I stray away.  I will stick exactly to the point.  The planning of a housing Bill is only as good as the planner.  I have lived in an area where there was a very good county manager.  Even in times when there was no money, he seemed to plan for housing.  Therefore, I am not as critical of what I see around me in Clare as previous speakers.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to up-date grants for old houses because this has not been dealt with in the way it should.  I have seen houses disappear when they could have been saved if the Department or the local authority could have at the time given the family a little more money.  I welcome the motion and again welcome the Minister to the House.  I would also ask the Minister not to let it go for two years.  Who knows this morning how many of us will be here in two years?  I never think whether I will be here tomorrow.  I started the Seanad campaign and I did not know whether I would finish it, but I did, thank God.</P>

      <P>With regard to the local government role, I would be wrong not to pay tribute before I sit down this morning because it was my <Col N="310" /> field and my husband's field.  I pay tribute to the men in the Department of Local Government, now the Department of the Environment.  I am not putting anybody down because it is something I do not do.</P>
      <P>Some Senators are worried about this being a Dublin, Cork or Ennis motion.  The Minister is a countryman and I am a countrywoman so it will be an all-Ireland motion.  The Government have removed rates from private houses and this makes it much more attractive, though it has not been mentioned by any previous speaker, to reconstruct a house.  I should like to thank the House and I am sorry I left Senator Cooney out when I was welcoming the other top brass.  I welcome him and am delighted to see him here.  I am sure he will go back to the other House.</P>

I have seen a town and county built up &mdash; I am speaking from experience of what I have seen done. We should plan in times when we have no money, as well as when we have it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome the Minister.  It is a difficult Ministry he has.  The problems he will be faced with will not all be solved but I hope his dedication and application will make them less acute.  In this respect I offer my co-operation with any measure which comes before the House which tends in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even though I am supporting the motion wholeheartedly without reservation, the problem is that a continuance order in the long run is a stopgap measure.  One of the problems is that if it is decided somebody cannot build because the law has not changed in another area, he can appeal and it can go on for years and so on.  The machinery gets clogged up.  There is a problem in co-ordinating one Department with another in respect of the <Col N="311" /> law.  By the time a case gets into court the whole housing problem in this particular area is choked up a bit and some thought should be given to see if there is any way to expedite procedures for dealing with these problems.</P>
    <P>I will not enter into the argument as to who built what.  No matter what Government are in power, there is one fundamental point which nobody has grasped.  It is this.  There are two types of private ownership.  One is the private ownership of the means of production, the second is private ownership of consumer goods.  Until housing is accepted as a consumer product the &ldquo;nettle&rdquo; of housing problems will not be grasped.  A house with all its contents is a consumer product.  Therefore, laws should be introduced whereby the consumers would be the beneficiaries and not the private owners of the means of production. I do not say this in respect of everything but particularly in the housing area.  Unless we ensure that the Government, through the various local authorities, purchase land and allow speculators to develop it, the problem of housing will be unsolved.  I want to put that point on the record.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to subject the House to the ordeal of my maiden speech at such an early date but I am encouraged by the example of my distinguished colleague who, describing himself as a new boy equally shy in both official languages, went on in his maiden speech to make what I can only describe as a devastating contribution to the business of the House.  Therefore, I am emboldened, as one of the shy new girls, to make one brief general comment on this motion.  I would wish above all in my first address to be brief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a very good motion, if for no other reason than that it concerns families in the building and reconstruction of their homes.  It concerns an ordinary matter, something which bedevils us in our everyday lives. Surely, that is what good government is, or should be, all about.  For a State which enshrines in its Constitution the <Col N="312" /> notion that the family is the natural primary unit of society, we have done remarkably little to ensure that the family, either as a unit or the individual members of it, are adequately protected by our laws or adequately represented in Government.  The family is one of the institutions to which we have become accustomed to paying lip service.</P>
    <P>While conceding that the prime function of the House is to consider the implications of all legislation laid before it so that we, including the general public, can understand them, I would hope that within the limit of our jurisdiction we might be able to bring some pressure to bear on those institutions to which we pay lip service; that we might, as Senator Murphy said the other day, begin to realise our potential.  I should not like to consider this House as an upper-class debating society or, indeed, as a forum where Senators could ride their individual hobby horses to death but, to quote Senator Murphy again, it is time we realised the full potential of the House.  From what I have seen, there is here the ability and the courage to do just that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Lady Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and offer him my congratulations.  I should like to make one brief point.  When we consider reconstructing old houses it is not necessarily so that the old is always beautiful but there are those houses which add considerably to Ireland's culture.  They should be looked after and money provided for their maintenance.  However, there are old houses which are not beautiful and in order to make them habitable one would have to spend very much more money upon them than would be needed to build new houses.  This may not be a very popular point of view but one must consider those people who have no houses.  Is it not better to build new houses for the homeless than to invest a lot of money in reconstructing old and not very good-looking houses?</P>

      <P>I should like to thank the Senators for the manner in which they <Col N="313" /> have received this motion.  I wish to express my appreciation for the kind words and good wishes extended to me by the Senators.</P>
      <P>With regard to Senator Keating's point about the re-naming of my Department, he, more so than anyone else, will appreciate that it takes time to get Departments organised as one would wish, especially when additional responsibilities are involved, but it is my intention to do so.  Senator McCartin made the point about providing adequate aid for young people to own their own homes.  He felt that we should make it as attractive and easy as possible for young people to do this and he mentioned the problem of sites.  As everybody is aware, in an endeavour to do this we increased the new house grants quite considerably in recent months.  We also increased the income limits for the SDA loans. Already it is quite evident that these measures have given great impetus to the housing drive.  The importance which people place on owning their own homes has been shown very clearly to us.  Although it may be too soon to decide, these measures seem to have taken the pressure off local authorities to provide more houses.  All the signs are that the measures I have referred to are having the desired effect, as expressed by Senator McCartin and other Senators, with regard to the building of more houses and increasing interest in home ownership.</P>
      <P>Senator McGowan mentioned the demolition of buildings by local authorities for road widening and other purposes, I presume in his own county.  This is not in contravention of the 1969 Act.  In all these cases, people are either adequately compensated or other acceptable accommodation is made available to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that quite a number of local authorities have availed of the provisions of this Act.  I referred in my opening speech to Dublin and Cork in particular but it is not correct to assume that these were the only local authorities who used this Act.  Senator Lyons made the point that the Act <Col N="314" /> should apply to rural communities and areas.  The Act does apply to them but the Senator's local authority, for some reason, have not used the Act whereas neighbouring counties, such as Roscommon, have been doing so.  It is a matter for the individual local authority as to whether they think it necessary to use this Act.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators have mentioned reconstruction or improvement grants.  I appreciate that the grants available up to now were inadequate and made very little impression on works that were necessary on some of these old houses.  But before we are many more days older I will be in a position to announce a new scheme of reconstruction and improvement grants which will be much more attractive and beneficial to the people who will be availing of them.</P>
    <P>I trust that these improvement grants will have the desired effect in city and town centres for renewal &mdash; urban renewal, or call it what you like &mdash; for the reconstruction of older houses.  I can foresee that in some instances, by recontructing some of the older houses in towns and cities, it will be possible to create two residences where formerly there may have been only one. By converting one floor into a flat, which would be suitable for married couples or very small family, you would be increasing the number of residences or the amount of house accommodation available.</P>
    <P>One Senator spoke about the availability of loans for reconstructing old houses.  These loans are available and this scheme is operated by each local authority.  With regard to very old houses where you may have maybe an old couple or one old person, there is the scheme known as the essential repair scheme under which, in many instances, the total cost of making that house more habitable and maintaining it in a habitable condition for some further years is provided.  These schemes are already in operation and are being generally availed of.  With regard to grants I have said a new scheme will be announced in the near future and loans are already available through the local authority for the <Col N="315" /> purposes of reconstruction, as well as SDA loans for new houses.</P>
    <P>I said in my opening contribution that I was looking for an extension of two further years under the 1969 Act.  I also said that legislation is under way, a new Housing Bill, which will give Members of both Houses a chance to debate the housing situation in a broader sense.  This legislation is at a very advanced stage.  It may well be that we may not require the extension provided for in this motion for the two years.  Indeed, I would say it is pretty definite that we will not, but in order to be sure of where we were going, and to renew the 1969 Act, we decided to look for two years. Hopefully we will have introduced the Housing Bill referred to far in advance of that and we will have a further debate when it is introduced.  I should like to thank the Senators for the manner in which they have received this motion and for their good wishes. They are fully appreciated.</P>

      <P>That Seanad Éireann approves the following Order in draft:</P>
      <P>Trustee (Authorised Investments) (No. 2) Order, 1977,</P>
      <P>a copy of which Order in draft was laid before the House on 4th October, 1977.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Wyse) Pearse Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Wyse)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Trustee (Authorised Investments) Act, 1958, defines the investments in which trustees may invest trust funds unless expressly forbidden by the instrument, if any, creating the trust.  Equally, the trust deed may confer wider powers of investment but many trusts and analogous funds are restricted to the investments authorised under the Act. The Minister for Finance may vary the authorised investments by order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The draft order now before the House for approval would add five <Col N="316" /> building societies, 19 non-associated banks, the Bank of Ireland gilt edged unit trust, and securities of the European Investment Bank to the authorised list.</P>
    <P>It has been generally regarded as desirable for some time now that trustee status should be accorded to building societies.  The social importance of building societies in Ireland as providers of finance to meet the community's housing needs is beyond doubt.  The five societies named in the draft order together account for over 90 per cent of the resources of the building society movement.  They are well established and have a proven operational record over a long period.  Furthermore, the improved regulatory provisions in regard to societies affected by the Building Societies Act, 1976, provides an additional assurance that high standards of financial management will be observed in this area.  Appropriate financial criteria have been settled by the Minister for Finance to be observed by building societies in relation to trustee status.  Liquidity and reserve ratios are an important feature of these criteria, which also provide that a society must have total assets of at least £5 million to be considered for trustee status.  The five named societies meet the requirements and I am satisfied that they are suitable for addition to the trustee list.</P>
    <P>It is also proposed to add deposits with 19 non-associated banks to the trustee list.  This is regarded as a necessary updating of the list because, as presently constituted, it remains in the form enacted by the Trustee Act of 1958.  Since then the number of licensed banks operating in the State has increased considerably to a total of 42 and a system of licensing and supervision by the Central Bank has been established under the Central Bank Act, 1971.</P>
    <P>Inclusion of additional banks in the trustee list is now desirable in order to equalise competition in the banking field.  The inclusion of these 19 banks in the trustee list, together with the other additions proposed, will considerably improve the range of investment opportunities open to trustees.  I <Col N="317" /> have consulted the Central Bank regarding the choice of banks and the bank on due consideration has recommended that the non-associated banks named in the draft are appropriate for the purposes of trustee investment.  I am disposed to accept the recommendations of the Central Bank in this matter and have included the recommended banks in the draft order.  The addition of these banks will mean that the trustee list will include a total of 25 licensed banks comprising all the major domestic and foreign banks in the State.</P>
    <P>The Bank of Ireland gilt edged unit trust is registered under the Unit Trusts Act, 1972.  The trust's investments are confined to Irish Government securities which are themselves trustee investments. The trustee of the scheme is the Bank of Ireland whose own stock is an authorised trustee investment.  The scheme has performed well since its inception in 1973.  I am satisfied that this unit trust is appropriate for addition to the authorised list.</P>
    <P>Senators will also note that the draft order proposes to grant trustee status to securities issued in the State by the European Investment Bank.  This is in fulfilment of a commitment entered into on our accession to the European Economic Community.  The European Investment Bank which was established under the Treaty of Rome has as its primary responsibility the making of loans towards the financing of projects for developing the less developed regions of the Community, including Ireland.  We have received more than £100 million in loans from the Bank since joining the Community in 1973. The bank has not sought to issue securities in the State to date and I do not anticipate that it will do so in the immediate future.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance is obliged under the Act to consult with the following persons in regard to the terms of any order he proposes to make to vary the list of authorised investments: a judge of the High Court nominated by the Chief Justice, the Governor of the Central Bank, the Public Trustee, the Chairman of the Irish Banks Standing Committee, the President of <Col N="318" /> the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland and the President of the Stock Exchange &mdash; Irish.  All the statutory requirements in this regard have been complied with.</P>
    <P>Heretofore, the range of trustee investments has been relatively restricted. The inclusion of a large number of financial institutions, as proposed in the draft order before the House, will make it necessary to ensure that these institutions will continue to be suitable for trustee status and that additions will be made as appropriate.  It is my intention to keep the list under active review and to propose further changes as the need arises.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I wish to confirm that I am satisfied that trustees should be enabled to invest in the additions to the trustee list as proposed in the draft order.  I therefore commend the motion for the approval of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to extend the traditional welcome of the House to Deputy Wyse and to congratulate him and to wish him well on his appointment.  The achieving of trustee status by any financial institution is, of course, a sign that it is a cast-iron institution from the point of view of investment.  It is an indication that the establishment finds its financial structures and its management impeccable. Trustee status is an accolade among such institutions.  When it has that effect it is something that cannot be given lightly, and I am glad to see from the Parliamentary Secretary's speech that the amount of investigation that should be undertaken in advance and the spread of inquiries that have been made will ensure that, especially here where the financial establishments are comparatively small and intimate and everything is known about everyone else, a very full and clear picture of the institutions will emerge before they can obtain this status.  I am glad to see that the measure of consultation that has been undertaken ensures that when the status is given it is given only to institutions which merit it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Likewise, I am glad to note the strict financial criteria that have been applied.  Building societies, in a few <Col N="319" /> unfortunate instances, have had a somewhat chequered history&mdash;none, I might say, of the five major ones now proposed for trustee status.  But the fact that some of their peers had early demise renders this an area in which extra special care should be taken.  I share the view of the Parliamentary Secretary that the five major building societies are financially most orthodox, respectable and secure.  As I said, the criteria to which they have to measure up are strict and they measure up to them.  It is consoling to know that trustee status will continue to mean that the institutions which are available for trustee investment will be of the highest integrity, properly managed and financed.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary made the point that many private instruments setting up trusts do not limit the executors or trustees to investment in institutions having formal trustee status.  That tradition grew up because the number of institutions which had this status until comparatively recently was very small and the investment opportunities of the executors or trustees were thereby extremely limited.  Indeed for a long time the executors or trustees were limited to Government stock.  Inflation has been playing havoc with Government stock as investment and many trustees were apprehensive of them.  If they did not have discretionary powers under the trust they very often had no choice. The practice then grew up of giving wide powers to trustees.  Once those powers were given to trustees &mdash; they were entitled to go into the stock market &mdash; there was obviously the risk that an unfortunate investment might be made <i>bona fides.</i>  There was also the practice of incorporating in the trust document an indemnity to the trustee for any loss other than by their own wilful dishonesty.</P>
    <P>I do not know if that is a good thing.  I think that people who have the control of the trust funds for people who are under an incapacity, should be limited in their powers of investment, that there should be some control over them other than for actual dishonesty.  I agree that because <Col N="320" /> of the way there was a restriction on their right to invest by virtue of the narrow range of institutions with trustee status, they had to be given wider powers with a certain risk that that entailed.  It was a small one.  Possibly as the number of institutions acquiring trustee status increases we may see less discretionary powers in trust instruments and we may feel more reliant on the institutions with trustee status.</P>
    <P>This is something I would have no hard and fast view on.  It is something that may evolve.  The Parliamentary Secretary leads us to consider that list of trustee investments or of institutions suitable for trustee investment will be kept under review and will be widened as more and more qualify. This is a good thing.  These institutions will never make fortunes for the trust funds in the sense that speculation on the stock exchange means that if a winner is picked a very large sum can be made.  I do not think trust funds are a subject to be invested in in the hope of making a fortune.  The objective must be to preserve the trust funds as to their capital and ensure a reasonable income for the objects of the trust.  That can be done by investment in a more conservative type institution, that accorded the accolade of the trustee status or trustee investment.</P>
    <P>There is the point of the position of Government stock as trustee funds. They are secure in the sense that the Government are secure, but their value on the market is very far from secure because they can be very much affected by interest rates, inflation trends and so on.  What may have seemed like a very safe capital investment some years ago can turn out to show a considerable loss.  That is quite hostile to the whole idea of trustee investments where the objective must be to preserve the capital for the investors in a trust when eventually they come into possession of their property.</P>
    <P>The time has possibly come when a look might be taken at, or some consideration given to whether Government stocks are an ideal investment for trustee money.  Government stocks are purchased at par, because the invariable <Col N="321" /> history of the last two decades has been that the par value after a number of years disappears and that results in a substantial loss of capital. When funds in court have to be invested in these types of securities there has been substantial losses in capital as a result.  That is not desirable.  On the other hand, when there has been a considerable drop in the par value, the purchase of the diminished security can produce a very handsome interest rate, a very handsome yield. So, there may be a little gain on the roundabout for what has been lost on the swings.  I suppose these are all investment problems for a trustee and so long as he can keep within the law nothing can be said to him.  I welcome the extension of the number of institutions proposed by this order.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an Rúnaí Parlaiminte. I welcome the development, although it comes rather in bulk, of the inclusion for trustee investment purposes of this considerable number of institutions, the standing building societies and a total of 21 other institutions, including the banks which have been established here recently.</P>
      <P>This is a good development.  The effect of it will be to strengthen the economy of the country.  It is important that the criteria for admission should be strict because, in effect, these institutions are being given a special status which in itself can only be part of a corresponding reciprocal responsibility on their part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting to note that the Minister has set out the requirements which justify trustee status under the 1958 Act, which is that they must be approved by some very significant elements in the community &mdash; for example, the governor of the Central Bank, the chairman of the Irish Banks Standing Committee, judge of the High Court and so on.  It is important that the criteria should be strict before the Minister admits institutions to trustee status.  It is the first time that we are giving this right to, as one would describe, stocks other than our own Irish securities.  One could say that it is a good thing to broaden the scope for <Col N="322" /> trustee investment within our economy because, one way or another, it helps to ensure the retention of investment here and thereby helps, as I said at the outset, to strengthen our economy.  It is in that respect that I welcome and support this draft order.</P>

      <P>I also welcome the Parliamentary Secretary and wish him well in his new position.  I welcome this Bill.  I consider the second last paragraph in the Parliamentary Secretary's statement to be the most important of all.  It states that these financial institutions are State guaranteed and there is no danger that people who put money into them will lose it.  We all know that a couple of years ago a number of small investors got a very cruel shock when the Irish Trust Bank disappeared overnight.  I should like to take this opportunity to thank the Minister for Finance for re-imbursing the people who had money invested in it.  They were all small investors, people with redundancy money, people with gratuities and with rebate of taxes. Apparently that bank should never have been allowed to function here at all because the amount of guarantee they gave to the Central Bank was in the region of only £50,000.  Quite a number of people would be in great hardship today if they had not been refunded that money.</P>
      <P>This order will encourage people to invest in the financial institutions included and the more that is invested in them the better it is for the country. I welcome the motion on behalf of the Labour Party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>As I was saying last night, we are fortunate in the number and calibre of the institutions concerned with research.  Perhaps we do not appreciate fully the rich tradition we have in this matter and the many recent and excellent bodies which have been established.  We have, in the RDS, founded in 1731, one of the leading scientific and technological bodies in the world, which has contributed a great deal not only to this country but, by its example, to many countries throughout the world.  It may, perhaps, be interesting to recollect that it was founded for the purpose of the advancement of agriculture and other branches of industry, and the advancement of the fine arts.</P>
      <P>Those of us who have had any connection with agriculture will know that in many ways it is a way of life. At the same time, it is very much an industry, and agri-business is now very big business indeed, and rightly so, and rightly recognised as such.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to say that it is more than 200 years or so since the RDS coupled agriculture with other branches of industry.  We should do this today as well.  A small point regarding the RDS is that it at one time occupied this building.  Now, in 1977, the RDS is still playing a major part in the development of industry as well as other aspects of industry.  Another body mentioned earlier in the debate is the Royal Irish Academy also founded a long time ago, in 1785, by James Caulfield, Earl of Charlemont, who is perhaps better known in Irish historical works as the Volunteer Earl.  His greater longest lasting contribution to Irish life was the foundation of the Royal Irish Academy.  It was founded for the promotion of the study of science and the humanities.  It has ably carried on that study right through to the present day.  I am not a member of it but I am a member of one of its many national committees which play <Col N="324" /> a major role in the development of science in this country.  The activities of the Royal Irish Academy should continue to be supported and encouraged by the Government and this new body should not supplant or supersede the activities of the Academy.  I am sure that it will not.  There is plenty of room for both organisations.  These ancient and worthwhile bodies were set up in this country and are still active today.</P>
    <P>There was a long pause before any other worthwhile scientific body was established.  In the early forties the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies was established with its various divisions of theoretical physics and of astronomy at Dunsink.  That is another area of science and technology in which we have played a major role, perhaps an unappreciated role.  The work of Hamilton, and the elder Parsons, the various telescopes and so on developed in this country provided a fundamental basis in astronomy and this good work is still being carried on despite many difficulties.  Then there is the distinguished in cosmic rays. More recently there has been work in geophysics in which one area is of crucial importance and recognised as such, that is, the Continental Shelf structure.  This is fundamental and important research with enormous implications for this country particularly and for the world generally.</P>
    <P>Since the Second World War we have established a number of bodies, the largest of which is the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards. It now plays a major role in our industrial development and in research and has the great advantage of being mostly disciplinary.  This is particularly important in view of the small size of most of our university scientific departments.  The institute has played a particular role in the development of new industry and new products.  An Foras Forbartha and The National Institute for Physical Planning and Development deal with divisions of planning, construction, roads and water resources. They also continue to play a major role in a comprehensive range of research projects.  Two of the most important projects they are engaged <Col N="325" /> in &mdash; and there have been many important ones connected with An Foras Forbartha &mdash; are the national coastline survey and the national ports survey. Another very important body is the Agricultural Institute with their seven major research centres throughout the country.  They are concentrating on applied research, although there is a lot of basic research going on in their centres.  The institute have a major role in agriculture.  In addition to research concerned with cattle, sheep, horticulture and soil surveys, they also have centres concerned with agricultural engineering, for example, with economics and rural welfare.</P>
    <P>Another important body is the Economic and Social Research Institute. As one of the previous speakers said, we cannot separate economic and social matters.  They integrate and blend with one another.  Indeed, the Economic and Social Research Institute have carried out some very important and worthwhile surveys on manpower studies on the cattle and beef industry, our offshore potential strategy and regional studies.  We think of the IDA solely in terms of attracting industry to this country.  In fact, the IDA also play a major role in research and in deciding which industrial research projects should be supported or initiated.  The staff of the IDA either alone or in conjunction with some of the other bodies, do a great deal of very practical applied research in relation to industry.  There is a research and development committee on which the IDA are represented together with the National Science Council, Córas Tráchtála, the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy and other bodies.  We should not forget other agencies such as the Geological Survey, which was established a long time ago, in 1826.  The Meteorological Office is another important body.  I am very glad to see that the Geological Office staff are being increased.  They have done important work on mapping, on geophysical surveys, marine geology, on geochemical trace analysis, and a number of other matters which are obviously going to be of tremendous importance.  Perhaps the most important of all is their value in the assessment <Col N="326" /> of the vast mass of data which is now coming in from offshore exploration.</P>
    <P>I understand that the number of geophysicists in State employment is being increased.  This is absolutely necessary when we realise that, even in relatively small oil exploration companies, a large number of personnel with various skills are employed.  If we are really to understand the findings and results which are now coming in from totally new areas in the Irish offshore waters, it is essential that we have adequate staff and back-up facilities to analyse this information.</P>
    <P>In this country there are already many very important research bodies, many of them already directly involved in research and development of an economic or business nature or related to it.  All of these bodies will presumably be liaising with the new board.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless, it is fair to say that the amount of money and attention we have devoted to research and development has been inadequate in the past. We are now entering into an exciting new era.  Not only have we rich natural agricultural resources, which we have been aware of for years and from which we are now beginning to get the full benefit and have the potential to develop, but we now realise that we have extensive mineral resources. There are enormous prospects as regards marine resources.</P>
    <P>Several times so far I have referred to Ireland as a small country and to some extent this is to be regarded as historical rather in the past tense.  We do not fully realise the extent of the global surplus which this country now has under its jurisdiction.  It includes the Continental Shelf.  We have an extensive area and key area in Western Europe.  We are entering into the era when we will be in a very different economic position from that which has been the situation hitherto.</P>
    <P>It is, however, important that these resources be developed to our benefit and this board is absolutely essential in this respect.  All too often the benefits of our agricultural resource have been removed elsewhere.  The technologies <Col N="327" /> involved have been developed or employed elsewhere.  It is absolutely essential that we develop agricultural technology to a greater extent.  For these new resources which are becoming available we should make sure that we are in a situation to develop the technologies so that the benefits will come to us.  As this is a national matter it is very heartening that the Bill is being supported by all parties.</P>
    <P>In his introductory speech the Minister mentioned the various forms of research.  In the past when we talked about research or science we have confined thoughts to pure research and have not fully realised that applied research, as the Minister rightly said, is the dissemination of information about applied research and is really part of the one matter: science and technology.  There is no way here in which we are going to make a major contribution over a wide field in pure research.  We do not have the infrastructure, we do not have the necessary finances and we do not have the personnel. Nonetheless, in certain selected areas it is possible for us to make a contribution.  We have done so in the past and I sincerely hope that we will continue to do so in the future.  But that is no reason why we should not make far greater use of the knowledge that is obtained elsewhere, which is readily available from applied research, and why we should not to a greater extent take part in applied research. This is absolutely essential if we are to maintain ourselves as a developed country.  We have got to know what is going on and we have got to be among the first to apply the benefits of research.  We do not have many other advantages.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned our natural resources but we have a relatively small population, and have not, as yet, a large financial base.  It is important that we emphasise quality rather than quantity and that we get in early on industries which are going to develop rather than make the dreadful mistake which has been made in the UK and elsewhere of endeavouring to support declining industries at greater and greater cost to less and less effect.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="328" /> We must get in on industries which are going to be the industries of the future or which have a long-term future.  Therefore, the necessity arises for a co-ordinated approach to the dissemination of information, to the development of applied research, to the encouragement of pure research and to the co-ordination of this research between the universities and other academic institutions &mdash; the research institutions, the Government Department and industry.  In this respect I welcome the Minister's new Department.  If we are to get the benefits of applied research on any sort of long-term basis, it is essential that we have a new Department such as we now have, repesented by the Minister, so that we can plan just that little bit ahead which is absolutely essential if we are really to derive full benefits from new projects.</P>
    <P>One of the major suggestions of the OECD was the provision of a science budget and I am delighted to see that we are going to have a science budget.  We should first of all consider the figures in so far as they are available. One of the immediate advantages of having a science budget is that we will have brought together to a large extent the actual figures for expenditure on research and science.  It is essential that we have this knowledge if we are to have any serious part to play in planning our development and research on any sort of co-ordinated basis. Dermot Murphy and Michael Fitz-Gerald, under the auspices of the National Science Council, did some very interesting work on the expenditure on research and development by various industrial groups.  These figures showed that in 1971 the food and drink industry was responsible for over 20 per cent of research and development expenditure.  In other words, it was by far the major sector for R and D expenditure. Trailing a long way behind was the chemical industry at approximately 10 per cent, including chemicals, pharmaceuticals and so on, and the various electronic industries.  Between these three sectors no less than 40 per cent of our research and development budget was spent in 1971.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that this very high <Col N="329" /> percentage, which is double that of any other sector, should be spent on food and drink.  It is one of the obvious characteristics of developing rather than developed countries.  A major percentage of their R and D is spent on agriculture or agriculture-related industries. We see the same pattern here. In 1969 an even greater percentage was spent on R and D in the food and drinks industry.  It was then as high as 28 per cent of the entire research and development budget of industry, Government and the various other components of R and D expenditure.</P>
    <P>Another very interesting facet of our information regarding expenditure by Irish industries in research and development is that in 1969 four companies alone accounted for 41 per cent of our expenditure.  The first eight companies accounted for over 51 per cent of our entire industrial R and D expenditure. That pattern has improved since then by 71 per cent.  It had fallen to 31.8 per cent for the first four and 42 per cent for the first eight.  It is accounted for by an increase in research and development expenditure by smaller companies and by some of the other major groups coming into this country.</P>
    <P>However, we must put these figures in the context of expenditure by relatively small developed countries.  These figures are not easy to get on a comparative basis, but if we were to compare them with the figures for Scandinavia, Finland, Norway, Sweden and Denmark, we find that their electrical industry spend 3 to 10 per cent of added value on research and development. That compares with less than 1 per cent of added value here, despite the fact that the electrical industry was the third highest spender.  If we take the second highest spender, the chemical industry, we find that research development in Ireland was at 1.5 per cent of added value.  In Scandinavian countries it was as high as 15 per cent.</P>
    <P>The characteristic of developing countries is relatively high R and D expenditure on food-related industries or agriculture itself.  We were spending something in the region of .25 per cent of added value as compared with .5 to .7 per cent in Scandinavian <Col N="330" /> countries.  Even in the food and drink and agriculture-related industries we were spending far less on research and development than other comparable countries.  We must be careful of any suggestion that research and development expenditure on agriculture should be curtailed in any way in Ireland because it forms such a high proportion of the budgets in developing countries.  If anything, it should be greatly increased, perhaps not percentage-wise to such a great degree.</P>
    <P>In 1971 the gross expenditure on research and development in Ireland was in the region of £14.3 million, of which £1 million was on social research. This was an increase over the 1969 figure of less than £10 million spent on research and development.  As one might expect, the greatest source was 48 per cent from Government funds.  The largest spender, as one might again expect, was the Government with 45 per cent.  Sixty per cent was going on agricultural industry and only 19 per cent on all other combined industries.  This shows a severe and unwelcome imbalance.  I would hope that, with our new science budget, we will be able to have the figures to examine and then take the necessary corrective action.  I regard expenditure on research and development as expenditure of a seed corn nature.  We need to spend a great deal more but not in a casual way.  We will have to be very selective with such expenditure.</P>
    <P>The composition of the new board is going to be extremely important. The numbers on it are less than those on the National Science Council, presumably, in the interests of efficiency and so on.  It is probably a good thing, particularly since the body will be backed up by appropriate committees reporting to it.  It is important that the person appointed chairman of that board be a suitable person.  He will fulfil a key role in the economy, and in Irish life generally.  We have been fortunate to have had Professor Ó hEocha as chairman of the National Science Council.  He is an able person who took a great interest in the work of the council.  It is quite right that the board should be under the auspices of the Minister, as suggested, <Col N="331" /> rather than under the auspices of the Department of Education.  Nonetheless, there must be an extremely close liaison with the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>We want to develop our research and development and part of that must be the human factor and the education of the appropriate people. Here I differ slightly from Senator Mulcahy.  He seemed surprised that someone coming from a farming background should adapt so readily to a high-grade technological industry.  I am sure the Leas-Cheann Comhairle is aware that anyone concerned with a small farm has to deal with a wide range of technological problems at very short notice and show a great deal of initiative.  One of the advantages we have in this country is our farming background.  The people concerned are often excellent from the point of view of new technological industries.  I am not in the least surprised that someone of such a nature was able to join a major United States firm and within a few years suggest improvements in techniques which were above those being used in the U.S.  We have enormous potential here which I hope we will not lose.  Our industries are such that innovation will be rewarded. It would be dreadful if these skills, built up over so many generations, were lost in the forms of industry in which you have a monotonous line progress in which the individual worker just turns a bolt.</P>
    <P>The relationship with the Department of Education is very important. Senator Staunton referred to the emphasis on the arts in this country. It is true that many people are studying medicine, law and other traditional arts-oriented disciplines. We have a long tradition in engineering. Unfortunately, many engineers had to emigrate to gain employment. We must be very careful about any sudden untoward emphasis on scientific or technological education unless it is very closely geared to the research and development of industries.  I hope there will be close liaison with the Department of Education, with the <Col N="332" /> universities and other institutes of higher learning.</P>
    <P>I cannot finish without paying tribute to the work of the National Science Council, Professor Ó hEocha, Dr. Neilson, the Secretary General, the members of the board who give a lot of time and trouble, the staff of the council and all those who have contributed to its very excellent work. A very interesting paper on science and technology was produced under the auspices of the National Science Council by Charles Cooper and Noel Whelan.  I agree with the general trends of their review, but modifying them slightly to suggest that we should have a general encouragement of research and development with a larger budget diverted towards it; that research and development in agriculture must remain a vital part of our national effort. It should be greatly increased, at least doubled.  This does not mean that we should not emphasise other areas. There will need to be even greater emphasis on the food processing industries, and support those industries which have prospects for growth.</P>
    <P>We should be very careful that we do not encourage capital-intensive industries in which the actual benefit or knowledge of the research and technology will not become available here. Such industries are as bad if not worse than labour-intensive industries with poor prospects.  We must try to encourage foreign industries which are in growth areas, and in which research and technology will become available and will be mainly developed here.  In that context, it is necessary that we should play our part and be prepared to spend money, but we should be very selective in our encouragement of foreign industry.  It is absolutely essential but let us be very clear on what we are doing and think all the time of the quality of the technology and the prospects of the industry.</P>
    <P>This is a rather abstruse and technical sounding Bill but it is one of the most important and useful Bills to come before this House.  It is going to provide a key part in the infrastructure upon which our future economic and, indeed, social and cultural development will be based.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to extend my welcome to somebody who was an academic colleague in the same university in the past, Deputy O'Donoghue, the Minister, and to express my good wishes in a personal sense.  I put it like that because in a minute I will not be welcoming him in a ministerial sense.  Since I have to go on and say things which would appear to be against his taking the responsibility for science and technology I want to separate the personal from the ministerial.</P>
      <P>In a sense this Bill is the greatest regret of my period as Minister for Industry and Commerce for the reason that at a certain time I cashed all my green stamps in Government and succeeded in getting science and technology away from the Department of Finance and into the Department of Industry and Commerce.  I was extremely excited about the prospect of this Bill.  I did not get it through the Oireachtas in my time as Minister.  I am very sorry about that in a personal sense, not that it is important really because it has come back to us quickly and it is having a rapid passage.  It is a piece of personal vanity that my name is not associated with it.  I had been very involved with it, excited about it and wanting to see it on the Statute Book.</P>
      <P>Because a friendly reference was made to our work in the Committee of the Dáil which was set up for Committee Stage of this Bill, I consider that committee was a nit-picking waste of time.  I reread the deliberations recently and I was quite shocked at how silly and trivial they were.  This could have been known last March or April but had it been the new Minister would not have had both the pleasure and the extremely difficult task of selecting the members of the board.  From the point of view of the then Opposition, now Government such nit-picking was undoubtedly right even though it is my regret that it did not pass into law in my time.  I do not propose to talk very much about the Bill because I have said my piece about it elsewhere and I have been involved in its preparation. I am on the record about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="334" /> I want to speak about one thing on Second Stage: where should science be in Government and that, therefore, involves the whole strategy of developing the economy.  I am going to speak a little widely but at no stage will I be considering anything other than the strategy of the institutions of Government from the point of view of the place that science should play in developing the economy.  I hope the Chair will consider me in order at all times.  I subscribe to the idea that in a mixed economy such as ours and particularly mixed economies where the institutions of the State derive from a British pattern in regard to Parliament and the civil service, we are blighted by the inheritance of a Treasury tradition.  I use the British word rather than the Irish one.  There are two natural roles in a successfully functioning mixed economy Government of what I call the British pattern, the British family of structures.  One has to have a Treasury as a conserver, a gatherer and revenue puller-in. Hopefully it would design the tax structures in an economically creative way but that has not been our good fortune here or in Britain or other countries.  Tax structures simply grow bit by bit, like Topsy without any strategic objectives at all.  That is essentially a conservative function. What I call the Treasury function should be balanced by an economic Department.  I am not arguing for my own past role which I did not ever succeed in achieving anyway but I am arguing against Minister O'Donoghue with whom I have had reasonably good relations down the years, for a Minister, and Deputy O'Malley, Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy, with whom, certainly in public, I have not had good relations. It has nothing to do with personalities. It has to do with the strategy of the way we develop the economy.</P>
    <P>Counterbalancing the Treasury function there ought to be, in the sense that the Germans understand it, an economic Department.  I saw the beginnings of the assembling of that economic Department under this new Government when Industry and Commerce had Energy added because that is <Col N="335" /> logical.  One cannot have energy policy except in relation to an economic Department. Then I saw what seemed to me the totally contrary movement of taking science away from industry, commerce and energy.  Let me elaborate on that.  Again, in this case there is no matter of personalities; it is a matter of strategy.  The permeation of our economic life by science will depend on two things.  It will depend on the way the board functions, and the selection of people is extremely important. The selection of the people in ultimate authority is most important of all.  It is one of these frightful jobs when one defines what one wants one rules out the whole of mankind, one requires such wisdom and excellence. One never finds the sort of perfect people when one is looking around but we have extremely good people here.  In parenthesis in passing I could not fail to comment, following Senator Conroy, on my sense of admiration for the past members of what was the National Science Council.  Their extraordinary passion, dedication, excellence of work and, indeed, their persistence in a situation of frustration and irritation where they might well have gone public and said: &ldquo;Damn you, why are you delaying us in this way?  Why will you not let us get on with it?&rdquo; They did not, but soldiered on loyally, nobly and well.  We are all in their debt.  There was nobody with greater distinction, talent and passion than Professor Ó hEocha and I was glad to hear his name mentioned and I am glad to record my admiration for him and the work he did.</P>
    <P>To come back to this theme, the quality and excellence of the people, the way they work and the degree of funding, that is the technical part of getting science right.  It is not about fundamental research primarily but about the connection between science and technology and what people do behind the plough, in the milking parlour and on the floor of the factory.  It is that interconnection, the flow of science and technology into actual production at the coalface, if I may use that analogy.  The coalface of whatever kind of production it is in whatever centre. That seems to have to be given muscle <Col N="336" /> by being located inside an economic Department.  Again, without any personal sense of rancour, the establishment of a Planning Department without clout is retrograde.  It has not got clout.  It is net a matter of personalities or how able the Ministers for Finance. Planning or Industry, Commerce and Energy is; it is a question of the relative clouts, scales, penetration of the economy, contacts with industry and society at large of their respective Departments.</P>
    <P>I am totally pursuaded that planning for a little mixed economy of our scale is absolutely inescapable on a vastly extended scale if we are to meet any of our social targets.  That is another day's debate.  I am totally persuaded that without an economic Department, Industry, Commerce and Energy and the technique of all of them, which is science and technology, then one is not going to be able to feed the knowledge we know exists in surplus in Ireland and the world to that coalface of production.  That will be inhibited, I say this with great regret, by the transfer of this responsibility from Industry, Commerce and Energy to a planning Department.  That is a pity.  Again, in the broader context, because this involves planning, one can put a planning facility in two places.  It can be put back in Finance and guarantee their continuing hegemony, but at least they have a bit of clout expertise; or it can be put into a countervailing economic Department which already has clout because of its scale.  But to put it into neither of these, to put it into the wilderness, means that it has the power to gather, to collate, to extrapolate and to exhort.</P>
    <P>Those are all reasonable powers but they do not change what happens in the economy very much.  I would be happy if I was wrong.  I would be happy to see the Minister get his hands on this problem and make it work, because the whole country needs it. It is not a party political issue.  I offer the Minister these words, and if on a future occasion he makes me eat them it will be a difficult meal because I should like to see him succeed.  I do not think it is likely, as a result of my feel of the way our institutions of <Col N="337" /> State are, where power lies and how it is possible to get things done, or, more importantly, the way in which one is inhibited in one's efforts to do things. This is retrograde from the point of view of science and technology.</P>
    <P>I should like to make another point in passing.  It relates to the question of the science budget.  I listened with interest to what Senator Mulcahy said yesterday and to Senator Conroy's contribution today.  Senator Mulcahy said that the science budget would give the new Minister teeth.  Would that it were so.  That is a battle I lost.  The Minister, in his speech said :</P>
    <P>I should emphasise that the system of voting money for activities in science and technology will not be changed.  Funds will continue to be voted under the relevant departmental votes as at present.</P>
    <P>The science budget is a method of getting an overview, the method, hopefully, of evolving strategies, the method of persuading people that they ought to acquisce in the establishment of priorities, and that the ones in the non-priority areas should give way to the ones in the priority areas.  It has a discussion and a PR value.  As for giving the Minister power, it does not. That is a battle that was lost.  Interestingly, if Senators refer to what Deputy O'Malley said in the debate when I, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, was introducing this Bill, they would see that he indicated that as a weakness.  I agreed with him but said that I could not do any better because I could not persuade Ministers to give up their rights in these areas. There was power in the argument against me then because if the science area is cut out of each Minister's responsibility then the argument for cutting out many other areas as well is a strong one.  This would result in dismantling the normal Departments as they exist and no Minister will agree to that.  Therefore a science budget with clout for its proprietor is a no-starter.  My successors have now looked at it, accepted what I said then, even though they reasonably criticised it at the time.  In the realities of the way our public service works it was a non-starter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="338" /> That is essentially what I wanted to say.  The small print of the Bill does not matter.  I have expressed my opinion on it and I identify with it very much.  I was very proud of it and had hoped to have introduced it and see it enacted.  It has not happened that way.  It is all reasonably good, the best that can be got, reasonably workable, a step forward except for the location of the responsibility in a new ministry which does not possess, and will never possess, real power.  That location, which seems an effort to dress up something unreal to make it more real, will inhibit the most important single task in our economy, to bring existing knowledge&mdash;that may sound rather low and I say this as a scientist concerned with research, a believer in research and a believer in the more abstract.  I do not accept the distinction into pure and applied research within the more abstract ends of research, waiting to see more of those things done here, and yet the great task is to bring existing knowledge of quite a mundane kind to the point of production.  That will be damaged by this decision.  With regard to the personalities involved I regret to say that it is retrograde.  It is damaging to science, to the board and to the role that many passionate people have been waiting to play here, a role they felt they might play under a new and larger dispensation but will now be inhibited in playing.  We need to deploy the passion they possess in the greatest possible freedom and effectiveness. This has been agreed by the Government and we are participating in the formalisation of a retrograde decision.  I believe we will come to realise this and regret it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWhitaker" hpid="Dr. Whitaker Dr. Whitaker">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Whitaker</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take this opportunity of welcoming the Minister to the House and wishing him well?  I resist the temptation of being drawn into a discussion on the allocation of planning responsibilities: there will be another occasion for that. Again, as Senator Keating remarked. anything I say about that is in no way directed against the personality of the Minister.  I am afraid that if Senator Keating and I had our way&mdash;he in <Col N="339" /> regard to the location of the science and technology functions and I about the location of economic planning&mdash; the Minister might suffer the fate of the Cheshire cat.  Neither of us wants that to happen because we admire and respect his qualities and the contribution he can make to Government.</P>
      <P>I welcome the expression of firm intention in the Bill, and the creation by it of an organisation to expand our hitherto inadequate investment in research and development.</P>
      <P>Senator Conroy, in a very interesting contribution, covered a very wide ground and showed the House how extensive and varied are the institutions already engaged in scientific research.  I do not want to cover any of that general ground.  I merely wish to raise two points.  One concerns that expression &ldquo;co-ordinate&rdquo; which appears as a function of the new body. Under section 4 (3) (c) this body will co-ordinate activities related to science and technology.  There is obvious reason in a desire to co-ordinate, but at times the reasonable desire to co-ordinate can develop into a passion for control.  It was because of the reference by Senator Conroy to the value and distinguished history of the research work done by other institutions that I am raising this issue because there are perhaps two dangers connected with a co-ordinating function. One is that, if the co-ordinating body does not itself have a significant field of action, it may well be tempted to interfere and direct work already being well done by other institutions. Secondly, if it does not suffer the frustration of not having its hand on the levers, of not having access to money, which is a frustration the Minister for Economic Planning and Development may suffer in his wider responsibilities, it may be tempted towards exercising an excessive directive influence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like the Minister to assure us first that science and technology means, or is related to, the natural sciences, the physical sciences, although we all recognise its importance in relation to economic and social development.  I would like an assurance that the expression does not <Col N="340" /> cover economic and social research proper because although they are interconnected, I think it is appropriate to preserve a distinction between the physical or natural sciences and what we can do through fundamental research in them and through applied research to develop all our natural resources and, on the other hand, economic and social research.  I assume, and would like the Minister to confirm, that economic and social research as such is not within the co-ordinating or finance-allocating functions of this new body.</P>
    <P>I would also like him to assure us that every effort will be made to respect and preserve the autonomy of existing institutions that come within the field of co-ordination of this body. It is important not only to acknowledge the distinguished contributions that have been made in the past but also the special qualities and genius that some of these institutions have acquired and the great value there is in the loyalty of their staffs.  That is the first point I wanted to make.</P>
    <P>The second point is one of commendation. It relates to the terms of section 27 which make it clear that this board will have complete freedom to appoint such and so many persons to be officers and servants of the board as the board from time to time thinks proper.  That discretion has been withheld in far too many cases up to now. State bodies have been spancelled by provisions requiring that even in regard to the recruitment of staff the prior approval of not only one but sometimes two Ministers must be obtained before the board proceeds.  Nobody understanding my background in the public service would suppose that I would take an irrespomsibly liberal attitude about things of this kind, but I have always felt that, if it is thought proper for the discharge of some public functions that a board be appointed to carry them out, the first prerogative that board should have is the right to appoint whatever staff, at whatever grades, it thinks it needs to carry out its duties effectively.</P>
    <P>I have never been troubled about consultation or consent to the remuneration and terms and conditions of <Col N="341" /> appointment of members of staff.  Such a requirement is right for co-ordinating purposes, particularly in an inflationary era, when it is perhaps the only direct way the State can influence the development of incomes generally and keep some control over the tendency towards leap-frogging.</P>
    <P>In regard to the appointment of staff as to numbers and the grades, the return in this Bill to the prerogative of a board to appoint them freely is most welcome.  It will do a lot to make State boards work better in the future if this privilege or prerogative is extended more widely.  It will make reputable people, people who can make a big contribution in these areas, less frustrated much more inclined to undertake responsibilities of the kind they are being asked to assume.  If control is needed, it may well be that control should take a much less obtrusive form.  It could well do so by some arrangement whereby every three or four years the Department of the Public Service would be entitled to have a look at the whole organisation and staff and report on it.  In that way some vigilance would be exercised on the part of the public and in the public interest, without in any significant way detracting from the responsibility which should be firmly in the hands of a board.</P>

      <P>Coming after those whom I consider to have made outstanding contributions on this subject, sincere, constructive, well thought-out, I rather reluctantly speak from what I might consider the lower levels of the subject, from one having experience of the place where science and technology will contact the world of industry and commerce.  At this level it will reflect in the standards of living and the standards we enjoy in our community generally of housing and all the rest of it.  The place where I see the biggest need for science and technology is in industry rather than agriculture.  Senator Conroy has mentioned the contribution made by some bodies in the field of agriculture, particularly as is known to people working in the industry of agriculture, the contribution made by the RDS down through the years by a group of <Col N="342" /> people whose traditions and efforts we might have belittled in recent times. We should not overlook the contribution these people made in what now, looking back, were the dark ages of science and technology.  Nevertheless the agricultural industry is aware of and grateful for the contribution made by the RDS in the field of agriculture.  In recent years of course the agricultural industry has been particularly privileged to have been served by the Agricultural Institute.</P>
      <P>The example of what was achieved by the Agricultural Institute should be looked at and we should seek to have it applied over a wider field of industry generally.  The efforts in research made by the Agricultural Institute have not yet reflected an increase in production in agriculture.  The growth rate in the industry has been slower than the progress that was made in the field of research by the institute and lower than the standard and knowledge of science of the people who advise the industry generally, the university graduates in the Department of Agriculture, employed by the various committees of agriculture and in our agricultural colleges.  Nevertheless, from now on we will see the result of what has been achieved by the Agricultural Institute in the past ten or 12 years.  The Agricultural Institute spoke for a long time to people who were not converted. The land structure was bad.  The market was not the sort of market from which a reasonable return could be got.  We were starting from a base of low productivity and a low standard of education generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agricultural industry has many advantages over other industries.  Senator Conroy mentioned the sort of industries that we encourage to come to this country, industries that are capital intensive which come in and build big factories and employ people who have the potential to learn quickly, to do complicated work, to develop a technology of their own.  Yet these industries, if they closed overnight, would go away leaving almost nothing behind them, leaving no new skills, no technology, no scientific knowledge that was not there before they came.  With <Col N="343" /> the background of the rural community which the vast bulk of the people on the labour market have, we should consider more seriously the setting up of small industries with a background of scientific and technological advice available to them.</P>

      <P>I should like to see the same sort of assistance available to industrialists as is available to farmers.  We have the Agricultural Institute with their seven research stations that are known to everybody in the industry, places where information is readily available and while they <Col N="344" /> have not got all the resources that we would like, there are sufficient personnel and resources to satisfy most of the needs of the industry at present. I would like to see the same facilities provided for industry.</P>
      <P>We have a labour force who, because of the rural background, are not devoid of skills or knowledge. They are already on the road to becoming qualified people.  There are a lot of skills there and we have only to readjust them and give them a little training.  We could develop a labour force that would start from a better base than any other labour force available in the world.  I believe that around the county development teams we could build up some sort of advisory service relating back to some sort of machinery for doing research.</P>
      <P>I know we have the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards. To the average person in industry down the country, particularly in the smaller industries, this service is under-financed and under-developed. They do not have a sufficient number of personnel to deal with the everyday problems which will arise.  If we are talking about planning in the long term we should consider something along the lines I am talking about.  We should develop the county development teams, though not in the same way as the county committees of agriculture.  Looking back, perhaps the structure was not entirely right. The industries concerned should have much stronger representation.  From there we should build up some sort of team of specialist experts to go into the different industries in rural areas.  We would expect these industries to be small at first because there is not a vast pool of labour available but the quality of the available labour is good.  We should tap those pools of labour, educate them and continue to absorb the young people leaving school year after year so that industry would grow with the population, so that it would grow in the areas we would like to see developed and where we already have the structures necessary to give us a decent society. These are my thoughts on the subject and I will not delay the Minister.</P>

      <P>I should like to express my thanks for the many kind wishes given to me by the Members of the House.  I very much appreciate them and I hope I can live up to them in the months and years ahead.  I would also like to thank the House very much for the very thoughtful and constructive approach adopted towards the Bill.  A number of the points raised were very interesting and I hope we will be able to show that we are endeavouring to operate this proposed new board in the best possible manner for the well-being of the people as a whole.</P>
      <P>I will deal very quickly with some of the points that were raised.  Senator Staunton was a little unhappy at the relatively minor reference to the private sector.  Let me emphasise and assure him that there is no intention or no inference that the private sector will, in some sense, be a poor relation to the public sector.  The bulk of the remarks were couched in reference to the public sector simply because that was what we are dealing with; a board which comes under the responsibility of a Department of State, which is concerned with the allocation of public funds and so forth.  Certainly it is the intention that in promoting the better and more effective use of science and technology the private sector should be encouraged to the maximum possible extent to play its part.</P>
      <P>Senator Staunton also questioned the administrative structure of the board itself.  I will simply say that it is not usual to raise this point at this stage in a debate and perhaps it could be better left to the board or to a later time when we are announcing the membership and composition of the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was another query about the penalty for the disclosure of information and why was it so small at £500, which is the limit for the penalty.  The original Bill when published provided for a penally of £50.  In fact the Minister, Deputy O'Malley, when moving it in the Dáil moved an amendment to increase this sum to £500 and that figure was chosen on the advice of the Attorney General as being the maximum <Col N="346" /> figure appropriate for a summary conviction.  I am quite sure we would be willing to review that in the light of experience.</P>
    <P>Senator Mulcahy raised a number of interesting points.  At this stage I would simply thank him for them and take them as read but not, by any means, gone unnoticed.  I will do the same, if I might, in regard to Senator Conroy for his very interesting and constructive suggestions.  The specific question from Senator West was on whether the new board would infringe on or cut across the activities of the Royal Irish Academy.  I can only say that to the best of my knowledge I do not believe that that is so.  Specifically there is no question of curtailing or interfering in any way with the activities of the Royal Irish Academy in its contacts with other international bodies and institutes and in its representation at the proceedings of those other bodies.  All that is provided in the Bill is that any official governmental representation could take place through the new board or through any other appropriate body, which could include the Royal Irish Academy if that were so decided.</P>
    <P>Senator Whitaker posed a number of interesting questions.  As he said himself, we can debate the question of planning and so forth on another occasion so I will pass over that quickly.  Specifically he asked if this new board were to have some responsibility for the social sciences and if I could assure him that they have not. I cannot so assure him.  I must assure him that they will.  While, as always, these frontiers between physical science and social science&mdash;or any other sphere of learning and research&mdash;may not be clearcut it is the intention that social sciences will be brought within the ambit of this proposed science budget and that, therefore, the funding and activities of bodies will be taken into account.  Senator Mulcahy gave part of the reason and justification for that when he pointed out that the manner in which the results of the physical sciences are applied in the workplace and so on can have very important effects on our daily lives, on our attitudes. He even specifically suggested that work conditions and the manner in <Col N="347" /> which modem technology is applied may be responsible, perhaps unwittingly, for some of our industrial relations problems because of the effect on human behaviour.  So, it is relevant that we should link the social sciences with the natural sciences as appropriate.</P>
    <P>This brings me to Senator Keating and I regret that he is not here to hear my reply.  I very much recognise the distinction he was drawing between debating the merits and demerits of the proposals in a functional capacity and divorcing those entirely from the persons of people concerned at any one time.  I absolutely agree with him and support him in that.  We should ask what are the appropriate arrangements, not simply for the Government of the day but for all future Governments. His real concern and anxiety was about the transfer from Industry, Commerce and Energy to the proposed new Department for which I have responsibility of the National Board for Science and Technology.  He gave as his reason for this his belief that the board had to be linked to some strong economic Department.  He also gave it as his opinion that my proposed Department would not have such strength. I would have to debate that one another time.  I expect to be back before this House when we are debating the legislation for my Department.</P>
    <P>On the question of where responsibility for this National Board for Science and Technology should lie, as I pointed out yesterday, I was a member of the group which produced the Lynch Report which led to the setting up of the original National Science Council, of which this new board is the logical successor.  I have not got time to go into detail but I will just quote one paragraph from that report to which I subscribed and I have heard nothing since to change my view.  I quote from page 179:</P>
    <P>To emphasise the national importance which should be accorded to science the Team considered recommending that the Council&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>That is the National Science Council.</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;should be responsible to the Taoiseach.  After further examination <Col N="348" /> the practical problems involved, however, it is urged that the Council should be responsible directly to the Minister for Finance, because of his Department's function in economic programming.</P>
    <P>The crucial last sentence follows:</P>
    <P>The Council should always be responsible to the principal economic planning Department.</P>
    <P>The only reason why, at that stage, we recommended that it be linked to the Department of Finance was because there was no central economic planning Department at that stage.  We contemplated the Taoiseach's office as the nearest alternative but we eventually dropped that suggestion simply because the Taoiseach's Department was not of a sufficient scale to be able to supply the necessary executive day-to-day back-up services.  It was because Finance at that stage had the function, the responsibility for economic development and planning in so far as it took place that we recommended the assignment of it there. That is still my position.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that no argument was ever put forward as to why it would be better to transfer responsibility away from the centre, away from a Department which does have responsibility and functions for the overall planning of the economy into one specific executive area.  No matter how powerful or important industry may be, no matter how many coalfaces it may be hacking away at, it is not hacking away at the entire economy; it is hacking away at the centre of it.</P>
    <P>Therefore, no matter how many contacts it might have, one would always be faced with problems of co-ordination and trying to get agreement with the Minister and colleagues because they would be responsible in their respective areas for important executive functions.  Agriculture is one obvious area.  One could ask why should we not assign responsibility to the Department of Agriculture just as much as the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy because we could argue that they are equally involved in day-to-day contacts with various sections of the community and that their activities are just as <Col N="349" /> important for the overall conduct of the economy.  So I must totally reject Senator Keating's suggestion.  I have never heard the slightest argument put forward to substantiate it and I have never been convinced that it has the slightest credibility.</P>
    <P>If anyone would like a further elaboration of the reasons we had at that time for recommending that it be attached to the central planning Department they will find them in one of the earlier chapters of that Lynch Report, chapter 7.  I could deal with that point at much greater length but, in my own interests, I will not do so on this occasion but I did want to emphasise the point as clearly and as fully as I could that we want to link the use and development of science and technology and harness it for the economic and social development <Col N="350" /> of the country.  The logical way to do that is to have the board feeding into the Department who are responsible for the policy formulation of all activities and who are placing the policy recommendations before the Government of the day for the Government to decide the appropriate course of action.  For that reason, therefore, I would wish to see the Bill passed in its present form.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Agreed to take remaining Stages today.</P>
    <P>Bill put through Committee, reported without amendment, received for final consideration and passed.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 1.30 p.m. <i>sine die.</i></P>
