      <P>There is a supplementary Order Paper with an item, the Intoxicating Liquor Bill, 1977, numbered al.  It is proposed to take that first, then to take Nos. 1 and 2.  It might assist the Seanad if I were to pre-empt the queries of some Senators who apparently are not here today by saying that the intention is to take No. 4, subject to the Minister for Health being available, on the first sitting day after Easter.</P>

I understand that our amendments and some Government amendments are being typed at the moment and they may be ready before the end of the debate on the Protection of Employment Bill.  Rather than take us back next Tuesday, which would be entailed in adjourning the Committee Stage of the Unfair Dismissals Bill, if the amendments are ready before the end of the Second Stage debate on the Protection of Employment Bill I would go along with taking the Committee Stage of the Unfair Dismissals Bill.</P>

      <P>The Dáil made one amendment to the text of the Bill, as initiated.  This amendment is set out on a sheet which has been circulated to Senators.</P>
      <P>It is not possible in the time available to print a separate text of the Bill as passed by Dáil Éireann.  The necessary amendment has been made in the certified copy of the Bill received from the Dáil.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney) Patrick M. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to take up the time of the House unduly with this short Bill which has only one provision.</P>
      <P>Section 11 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1962, provides, subject to some restrictions, that an occasional licence may be granted by the District Court to the holder of an on-licence to enable him to sell drink at an unlicensed place where a special event is being held during such times and on such days, not exceeding three, as may be specified in the licence.  A number of special events, notably the Spring Show, the Horse Show, Galway Races and some others, last for more than three days and in some cases it has become established that they benefit from occasional licences over the entire period of the event. Apparently the practice in some districts has been that the court has granted two consecutive occasional licences in respect of some of those events.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently, however, a District Justice refused to grant a second consecutive occasional licence for the week of the Irish International Boat Show in the RDS Ballsbridge.  The applicants for the licence initiated <i>certiorari</i> proceedings in the High Court to have the <Col N="545" /> order of the District Court quashed. Showing cause why the order should not be quashed, the District Justice stated that on his interpretation of section 11 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1962, he has no jurisdiction to grant more than one occasional licence in respect of any event.  The High Court held that the District Justice was correct in his interpretation.</P>
    <P>The kind of events which I have mentioned have been able to operate under occasional licences in respect of the whole period of the event concerned. The only way this can now be continued is by amending the law. The Bill allows for this possibility and I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very briefly, there is no opposition from this side of the House to this measure.  Indeed, it is an example of how far behind public opinion legislation and court attitudes sometimes are.  Public opinion, in this case is obviously ahead of us.  We are trying now to amend section 11 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act to provide that these on-licences can be for periods of more than three days.  It is obvious, in particular in relation to the events specified here, that this is highly desirable and there is no reason why we should not give this Bill an expeditious passage.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Bill put through Committee, reported without amendment and received for final consideration.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite obvious that six days is much more appropriate than three days.  The Minister might take a look at the whole licensing code with a view to looking at anomalies of a similar kind.  I am not calling for a radical revision of the code which would update the whole intoxicating liquor code to present day requirements.  It is merely a suggestion.  I am sure there are other areas&mdash;I have no specific ones in mind &mdash;where similar improvements are <Col N="546" /> necessary, where court proceedings of the kind that happened here have to go through and anomalies have to be created by public demand which cause us to bring in <i>ad hoc</i> legislation.  Perhaps for a change we might pre-empt this by having a good look at the legislation with a view to bringing it up to date with present-day circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney) Patrick M. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I take Senator Lenihan's point.  Indeed, I may say that for some time past I have been considering the licensing code as a whole.  I have had discussions from time to time with parties who would have direct commercial views on how it is operated and I got a number of views on changes that might be made.  Unfortunately, the views are widely divergent.  I do not think it is going to be possible to have any ominibus amendment based on any sort of an acceptable consensus. This is something that is unavoidable because of the nature of the subject. To amend the intoxicating liquor code generally to take account of any anomalies that might be lying undiscovered or have been so far relieved will be a fairly formidable legislative task.  In addition, consolidation is badly needed in this area because there are Acts going back to the middle of the last century.  The amendment that came up from the other House was to state that, as originally printed, the Bill said the Licensing Acts, 1883 to 1962.  Of course, that should have said 1833 which is an indication of the number of Acts still on the Statute Book in relation to the licensing laws.</P>
      <P>The matter has not been overlooked. I am accumulating a lot of information and suggestions and, when time permits on the appropriate occasion, someone I hope will have the pleasure of reforming the law in this area.</P>

      <Col N="547" /> Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary) Michael O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill will apply to all persons in employment in firms normally employing more than 20 persons.</P>
      <P>It establishes new rights for employees faced with the prospect of losing their jobs because of redundancy by ensuring that they receive prior notification and are consulted beforehand by their employer.  Employers contemplating collective redundancies must inform, consult and negotiate with representatives of the employees affected at least 30 days before the proposed redundancies are to take place.  The Bill sets down that for the purpose of these consultations all relevant information must be revealed to the employees' representatives particularly in regard to:</P>
      <P>(a)  the reasons for the proposed redundancies;</P>
      <P>(b)  the number and categories of employees proposed to be made redundant;</P>
      <P>(c)  the number of employees normally employed and</P>
      <P>(d)  the period over which it is proposed to effect the redundancies.</P>
      <P>The employer who has in mind the declared redundancy of numbers of employees to the figures mentioned here must notify me beforehand of the proposed redundancies 30 days before. That interval of 30 days will be used by my Department to seek solutions to the problems posed by the redundancies including the involvement of agencies like the National Manpower Service in the placement of the redundant workers in other jobs or indeed redeployment within the undertaking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Collective redundancies occur for many reasons and may happen in times of prosperity as well as recession.  In some cases firms which have to reduce or discontinue their activities because of insufficient marketing outlets or a severe cut-back in orders are compelled to make a corresponding reduction in their workforce.  On the other hand, many dismissals are caused by <Col N="548" /> technical and economic development and by mergers or concentration of businesses all of which may bring in their train the need to reduce labour forces.</P>
    <P>Employers with good relations with their employees accept that a structural change in their enterprise which may lead to job loss for certain categories should be the subject of prior consultations with their representatives.</P>
    <P>The main bone of contention up to now has been the failure of certain employers to consult with their employees before giving them notice. Therefore, one has the case then of employees feeling threatened by insecurity in a society where all the big decisions are taken at the top, without those who are effected being able to exert any large degree of influence on the outcome.  It is normally the practice, where workers are organised, that employees' representatives are consulted by employers before dismissals. The legislation now before the House, when enacted, will make consultations compulsory, that is, between the employer and employee affected and will affect in practice only that minority of employers who fail to maintain generally accepted standards of reasonable behaviour towards their employees.</P>
    <P>I believe that the proposals in this Bill, by laying down compulsory guidelines for management, will contribute towards the spread of good practices.  Essentially the current proposals aim at reconciling the employers' freedom of management and the employees' stability of employment by respecting the interests of both parties, limiting the employers' right of dismissal and reducing the consequences to the employees.  The legislation will in no way hamper the ability of an enterprise to adapt speedily to economic, structural, technical and market change.</P>
    <P>As statute law stands, individual employees have rights under the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973, and the Redundancy Payments Acts, 1967 to 1973.  They will have further protection when the Unfair Dismissals Bill becomes law.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="549" /> Under the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973, an individual employee is entitled after 13 weeks' employment to a week's notice of impending dismissal and his entitlement rises to eight weeks after 15 years of employment.</P>
    <P>Under the Redundancy Payments Acts an employee is entitled to two weeks' notice in writing before being made redundant.  These Acts however apply only to employees between the ages of 16 and 70 who have been in continuous employment for two years with the same employer and who are insured for all benefits under the Social Welfare Acts.  As far as collective redundancies are concerned, there are at present no special legal provisions&mdash;a situation which I am most anxious to remedy by ensuring that this Bill will apply to all employees involved in collective redundancies, irrespective of length of service or of age.  Their individual entitlements under the other Acts, of course, will remain.</P>
    <P>Sections 9 and 10 provide that in future an employer who is contemplating collective redundancies must begin consultations beforehand with the representatives of the employees concerned with a view to reaching agreement. The consultations should be based on prescribed information supplied by the employer and must cover the possibility of avoiding in the first place the redundancies proposed.</P>
    <P>One effect of these requirements is to put employers in the position that a decision to dispense with employees cannot be taken lightly.  It is desirable that employers should be required to show valid reasons as to why collective redundancies are necessary.  It is also desirable that employees who are liable to become redundant are informed as promptly and completely as possible.</P>
    <P>It is provided in section 12 that an employer must also give me advance notice in writing of the proposed collective redundancies.  Collective redundancies cannot take effect earlier than 30 days after notification to my Department and during that time the employer will be expected to cooperate as far as possible with me in <Col N="550" /> trying to alleviate the adverse effects of the proposed collective redundancies.</P>
    <P>In section 6 we define &ldquo;collective redundancy&rdquo; as happening where during any period of 30 consecutive days the number of proposed redundancies is:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  at least five in establishments normally employing more than 20 but not less than 50 persons,</P>
    <P>(b)  at least ten in establishments normally employing between 50 and 100 persons,</P>
    <P>(c)  at least 10 per cent of the number of employees in establishments normally employing between 100 and 300 persons,</P>
    <P>(d)  at least 30 in establishments normally employing 300 or more persons.</P>
    <P>Under the enforcement provisions of the Act offences will be committed by an employer who fails to advise employee representatives and my Department of the impending collective redundancies, to supply all relevant information and to hold the necessary consultations.  It will also be an offence to effect the collective redundancies within the prescribed delay period of 30 days.</P>
    <P>Substantial fines can be imposed on conviction by the courts for any of these offences.  The employer will also be obliged to keep records showing that the provisions of the Act are being complied with in relation to his employees, though this requirement can in most cases be met by records kept for other purposes.  Authorised officers of my Department will have powers of inspection and investigation for the purposes of enforcement of the Act.</P>
    <P>During the passage of the Bill through the Dáil it was represented to me that its application to some groups such as building operatives, short-term employees and seasonal workers might give rise to difficulties.  While it would be impossible to invent a single formula which would meet fully the diverse wishes of different categories of employers, I am satisfied that the formula I have devised in paragraph (a) of section 7 (2) should resolve most, if not all, of the problems of employers <Col N="551" /> who provide what is generally accepted to be short-period employment.</P>
    <P>It was also represented to me that provision should be included to eliminate the possibility that an employer who, before the commencement date of the Act, gives to his employees redundancy dismissal notices which expire after the Act comes into operation, might be forced to give an additional 30 days' notice and engage in the consultation and notification procedures all over again.  I should say that this suggested problem would relate in practice only to the initial month of the operation of the Act. However, I considered that that suggestion had merit and I therefore, had section 7 (4) inserted to take care of the problem.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House conforms to views put forward on behalf of the Irish Delegation at the Council of Ministers meeting in December, 1974, which adopted the EEC directive on harmonisation of the legislation of member-states relating to collective redundancies.  I express the view then to my colleagues of the other EEC countries that the directive to be adopted should apply to five dismissals in firms employing between 20 and 50 employees.  I did not succeed in obtaining a majority agreement for that proposal and therefore the final agreed EEC directive applied only where dismissals amounted to the number of ten.  I consider that a minimum of five dismissals in a firm with between 20 and 50 employees relates more to our conditions in contrast to the terms of the directive.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill, when enacted, will be brought into operation by ministerial order.  It is my wish that the Bill should pass through the House as quickly as possible and become law very soon.  I believe that the legislation will be welcomed by all Senators and I accordingly commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill puts into legislation what has been largely the practice of responsible firms throughout the Irish community for some years.  In so far as it gives legislative <Col N="552" /> embodiment to that constructive and responsible practice the Bill is of course, welcome.</P>
      <P>As one looks at the group of Bills brought in by the Minister, this is one that we, on this side of the House, can support, as we supported the first Bill introduced yesterday on worker participation in certain specific industries as a start in that direction.  I would like to emphasise to the Minister that that is our approach in regard to those two socially desirable Bills. But we see very grave weaknesses and undesirable features in the other Bill, the Unfair Dismissals Bill, which we will have on Committee Stage very shortly.</P>
      <P>This Bill deals with the proper and civilised notification that should issue to employees faced with a collective redundancy situation.  The meat of the Bill is in sections 6, 7 and 8.  It is only proper, to put it mildly, that workers in the categories set out in section 6&mdash;ranging from five workers in an establishment normally employing more than 20 and less than 50, ten in an establishment employing at least 50 and less than 100, 10 per cent in the category employing at least 100 but less than 300 and at least 30 in an establishment normally employing 300 or more employees&mdash; cover the Irish situation.  I agree with the Minister's view that the directive does not fully cover the Irish situation.  This proposal introduces, in addition to the Commission's directive, the category of at least five in an establishment employing more than 20 and less than 50.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the Bill itself is concerned, this sort of consultation, which was always practised by responsible employers, at least 30 days before the proposed redundancy is to take place makes good sense.  There may always be ways and means whereby redundancies can be averted if such consultations take place.  Indeed, the notification to the Minister for Labour which is embodied in the Bill is also important.  There are cases where even at that late stage in the management of an enterprise, a fire brigade operation can be undertaken by the Minister for Labour, in consultation <Col N="553" /> with the Minister for Industry and Commerce through Fóir Teóranta.  I have known cases where firms have been rescued in the last 24 hours or even 12 hours and one or two have gone on to prosper after that.  If you allow the total situation to obtain where no such consultation takes place where the work is concerned or no such notice is obliged to be made to the Minister for Labour, then you are into a completely naked jungle type situation.</P>
    <P>That has not happened in 95 per cent of cases in Ireland in the past number of years.  Nevertheless, it is important that what has been the practice of all responsible employers in this matter should be embodied in legislation making it mandatory that such consultation should take place, that such notice should be made available to the appropriate Government authority&mdash;the Minister for Labour in this case&mdash;so that everybody will be informed at a reasonable time in advance of the proposed redundancies that are to take place.</P>
    <P>Sometimes redundancies, unfortunately, have to occur but there are a number of occasions when they need not occur.  They need not occur if the management and board bend their energies to try to solve the situation, and that is where the proper consultations with the people most concerned, the workers in the enterprise, can bear fruitful results.  That, in combination with the notification to the Minister for Labour, can in many cases give rise to a situation where even if the particular employer or board or management do not want to take a constructive attitude, other people might be encouraged through the aegies of Fóir Teoranta or the IDA to move in and make whatever arrangements would be necessary to salvage the operation and make it fruitful and put it into a profit making position.</P>
    <P>There is no question of there being any opposition to this Bill.  This is the sort of legislation that from the employee point of view, the company point of view and from the State and national point of view should be on <Col N="554" /> the Statute Book.  In the case of the board of management who are taking the attitude of letting people go automatically without applying themselves in any way to the problem at hand, that with this type of notice procedure, before the guillotine drops in that 30-day period, negotiations can be initiated to take them over, get rid of the particular board or management, change the situation and maybe revamp the enterprise.  A new management or a new ownership may help to reorganise the operation and secure employment and possibly enhance employment. This Bill makes sense and there will be no opposition at any stage to this Bill as far as we are concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this necessary measure.  We have the possibility in a lot of circumstances where some whiz-kid could buy into a firm, a mixed enterprise, and by adopting a whole set of measures strip a person of the security he has had for himself and his family over a long period. When somebody is in that position he is entitled to claim that there is something morally wrong with the system and that there is something cruel about the method by which a person can have the livelihood that he depends on frittered away.</P>
      <P>I recognise that redundancy is an accepted fact of life but there are situations where it is unavoidable.  I am delighted to see the Minister bringing in this Bill because the reasons are somewhat vague in the Redundancy Act as to when an employer can declare a redundancy.  This Bill is not dealing with the question, whether it is vague or otherwise.  The fact that an employer has got some definite points of reference before declaring redundancy so that there can be intervention and that a Government agency are available to him is a step in the right direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to pay credit to a lot of good employers.  I know how people feel when they are affected by a redundancy.  I am one of the fortunate people who became redundant in a good concern where it was possible to have long and extended negotiations to drive home <Col N="555" /> a decent bargain on behalf of the people who were being laid off and to alleviate a lot of the hardship that would have been imposed on the persons who were laid off.  I think I have stated the sentiments of all of us in the Labour Party.  I thank the Minister for bringing in this Bill and I hope that the employers who have not been active in what they should have been practising, that is, to treat their employees in a just and fair way, will take note and possibly not only will the development of consultation on redundancy take place but, coupled with the worker participation legislation, we can see much improvement in the social nature of employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the welcome to this Bill.  Anything that can be done to conserve employment is something that must have our wholehearted support and also must not fail for lack of funds.  At present and as far as we can see into the future, certainly the next five years, our problem will be lack of jobs.  We are not unique in that.  All other countries are experiencing the same difficulty, and consequently conservation is a top priority.  Every job lost is one addition to the unemployment register.  It does not count that that person may be into another new employment area, because obviously somebody else would get that job if he were not available.  Conservation is at the top of the list and I take the point of Senator Harte about the whiz-kid coming in; more damage is being done by whiz-kids than by any other group, especially the whiz-kid with the idea that capital can solve everything. It is cutting against everything planned for in this country to have the whiz-kid who neglects the effort to solve the problem at a human level and instead brings in the more expensive machines, thus involving large numbers of redundancies, to do the job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill can give an opportunity for intervention even at a critical stage, and it is to be welcomed.  The only thing that occurs to me in reading this is that I am not very happy with the definition of &ldquo;collective <Col N="556" /> redundancy&rdquo;.  It does not go far enough because &ldquo;collective&rdquo; only relates to any period of 30 consecutive days.  As I read it, a firm could almost reduce its work force by 50 per cent in a period of less than six or eight months while still being outside the Act.  There should be some broadening of the definition of &ldquo;collective redundancy&rdquo;.  While applying it to a period of 30 consecutive days in the first instance, there should be something that provides for twice that number in the period of a year &mdash;something that would get over somebody complying with the law and still effectively stripping down the work force.  Perhaps we will be able to have an amendment on Committee Stage to provide this necessary safeguard in the measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M.D. Higgins Mr. M.D. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.D. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill but there are a few points on it I should like to raise.  It is a very necessary piece of legislation.  In the last two years I was reminded of the necessity for such legislation when at least three factories in the area in which I live were closed, announcing to their workers that they would no longer have jobs on the basis that the company were in difficulties.  Examination revealed that the company were not in difficulties due to the workers' commitment to their work or their productivity but due to a mixture of bad decisions by management and pressure from banks who had supplied to the company short-term finance with atrocious conditions to enable them to continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would strike a note of caution and differ from the Minister's speech where he referred to workers who feel lost and threatened by insecurity in a society where all the big decisions are taken at the top without those who are affected being able to exert any large degree of influence.  I should like to feel that the Minister is not in any way substituting for the inevitable effect of investment in giving the type of society we have a corporate effect. Workers' insecurity is not brought about primarily by corporate structures but rather by the precarious nature of investment, nationally and internationally.  It is not accidental or <Col N="557" /> a symptom of a firm or an industry when workers lose their jobs but the outcome of a rational investment decision on the part of people who want to maximise profits.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the presence of banks on the boards of some companies. Sometimes when companies are in tight circumstances they enter into arrangements for funding, particularly for current expenditure, in a way which very often is not revealed beyond the board and certainly not to the workers.  It is the way banks operate.  Often a condition for getting finance to enable one to operate for a few weeks longer is that the arrangement remains secret.  It might be more difficult now for that secrecy to remain unquestioned and not subject to any scrutiny.  I would welcome the Bill in that respect, too.  It means at least that if one was to be cynical about it a bank would have to continue losing money for another 30 days or more accurately a board may be urged to behave more responsibly towards workers.</P>
    <P>I mentioned two practical examples of where this legislation is necessary, in my own experience.  I was thinking in particular of one firm which employed about 200 female employees and under the same roof there has been five changes of ownership.  Senators made reference to whiz-kids earlier. In the case I am referring to a group of people from a department of the university, indulging in that other not so academic exercise of making a fat profit, had combined their ability to borrow money, which is a very academic activity, to undertake what might be regarded as an essay on their part into venture capitalism.  They were involved in textiles and, having secured money through their ability to borrow jointly, they proceeded then to get into enormous financial difficulties and announced at just a week's notice to 200 employees that they were not longer able to employ them. That particular case involved women workers, who are often the most vulnerable to this kind of threat from an irresponsible employer and who sometimes are non-unionised.  But even where unionised, sometimes by virtue of their previous experience in our <Col N="558" /> society of being less than equal, to put it mildly, they tend to accept it as almost an authoritative decision.  Let us be perfectly clear on the authority or the basis for the type of activity I refer to.  If one had cut through all the technical jargon which we produce for conveying funds from a bank to a firm, the bank were now looking for their pound of flesh.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  To some extent it will contribute more towards workers not being regarded as mere chattels. Where textile factories were closed down, greater attention was paid to bales of cloth than to numbers of workers.  There was the general notion that somebody else would be coming in soon and they could all be interviewed again and become somebody else's employees once more.  This turnover of people, to use that dreadful phrase, allows for maximum flexibility. We should be perfectly clear that what it allowed for, of course, was the maximum exploitation of workers.</P>
    <P>I would not go to the same extent as the Minister to give assurances to those who want to claim what they refer to as structural, technical and market flexibility.  Structural, technical and market flexibility can be possible when one has economic planning.  In regard to the suggestion that perhaps some new norms will emerge and that it will encourage people to behave better than they have in the past, I have always thought, as a pessimist rather than an idealist, that in matters of this kind of industrial morality and harmony the one thing you could rely on was that a chancer who establishes an industry will keep chancing his arm for as long as he can with the minimum cost to himself.  Obviously there are people who will be hampered by this new piece of legislation.  It may exercise an effect and it may dissuade such people from entering industrial venturing altogether.</P>
    <P>There is a myth in this country which is frequently trotted around that it does not matter at the end of the day what people do, under what circumstances or for what purpose, to generate whatever profit or loss.  As long as people have been provided with jobs, pretty well any circumstance can prevail.  Of <Col N="559" /> course that is patent nonsense.  A person is either working in an atmosphere which enables him to develop confidence and dignity or he is not and is working in something which is altogether the adverse of that situation.</P>
    <P>For too long women were working in the most precarious circumstances, frequently under management systems that were probably the most irresponsible in Europe or the world.  One survey after another shows that, while the Minister may suggest that new norms of responsibility will emerge, the evidence to date is that there is room for such an improvement.  It is not only at the time when the communication has to be made to the workers that the jobs will no longer be there but in many cases the workers are already suffering because of the sheer inefficiency of management.</P>
    <P>Perhaps this Bill will serve as a spur to people either to stay out of industry altogether or if they have control over the jobs and lives of other people that they will behave responsibly.  In his speech the Minister said:</P>
    <P>One effect of these requirements is to put employers in the position that a decision to dispense with employees cannot be taken lightly.</P>
    <P>I offer this hypothesis to the Minister and my colleagues in the Seanad. At any time one could predict the amount of the rate of unemployment that will follow from a decline in profit.  If one could relate the rate of investment to the rate of decline in profit and one could refer it at an aggregated level to the rate of unemployment, within that rate the precise incidence of dismissal is a matter for individual decision and individual handling by the person in charge of the firm.  It is possible that this Bill will frighten people who have been behaving less than humanely at least to deliver their bad news in a better fashion that they have hitherto. I doubt if there is any security for employees in general that can be given outside of economic planning, but for its limited purpose I welcome the Bill.  It will be welcomed by the trade union movement in general.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="560" /> I was interested in how a sanction might be imposed for non-compliance with measures of the Bill.  I note that the Bill conforms with views put forward on behalf of the Irish delegation at the Council of Ministers meeting in December, 1974, which adopted the EEC directive on harmonisation of the legislation of member states relating to collective redundancy.  We have had legislation giving effect to the consequences of our membership of the European Community, but we have not had to pass food price increases by way of legislation.  It might be no harm if some of the good effects of European membership were felt more generally.</P>
    <P>I can think of a number of firms in the recent past, even in my own area, where the greatest irresponsibility has been shown by management.  Very often the trade union have been left picking up the pieces after a work force had been completely shattered by a decision that had been delivered to them.  I have mentioned that many academics frequently lend their talents towards putting together venture capitalism packages.  It is a great pity that the universities have not been as concerned with the responsibility of the implications of capital as for the efficient gathering together of profits for those who decide to invest capital.  As one looks at the economics and business studies department, the lesson is that they have been craven in their adherence to satisfying the need of people interested in maximising profit rather than maximising the rights of people who produced the commodities within the individual factory.  When a factory is going very well that is the time when one can carry out some research on how more productivity can be gathered from workers.  This all goes when profits fall&mdash;it is all thrown away.  The naked teeth of the person intent on making a profit are revealed.  Then the manager appears and suggests the capital of the factory has a liquidity flow problem and the great spectre of the banks' representative on the board, or the loan which was secured on the tightest possible terms, becomes obvious.  Then it is time to wind up the show and the people <Col N="561" /> retreat into the academic woodwork again only to be lured out on another possible venture making garments out of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I thank Senators for their support.  It is accepted on all sides of the House that the Bill is both in accord with our responsibilities as members of the EEC and simply provides a legal prescription to ensure that a minority of employers who do not carry out consultation at present will do so in future.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinlan referred to the possibility of an employer spreading out the timing of redundancy dismissals for the purpose of avoiding provisions of the Bill&mdash;stripping the work force, he called it.  It is possible if you take any combination of periods of time coupled with numbers of workers whom the legislation is to protect, that such action which the Senator mentioned could be tried by employers who wish to escape the obligations of this legislation.  We must choose for purposes of this legislation a specific period in time, and we must count the number of dismissals in that period. That is why we have chosen 30 days as an appropriate reference period and five dismissals to constitute a suitable number in a firm having more than 20 and fewer than 50 employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree with much of what Senator Higgins had to say.  On the interesting area of the accountability of capital to those who assist in its further development by way of investment, share debenture and so on, that discussion lies outside the scope of this legislation.  This legislation simply <Col N="562" /> seeks to ensure the protection of employees who may be working in a firm, against decisions which can work out to the detriment of employees.  If such decisions are made, for whatever reason&mdash;the Senator is right when he says that reasons may be connected with redundancies&mdash;they may have the most rational basis behind them.  Redundancy situations do not arise very often from irrational reasons.</P>
    <P>This Bill seeks to ensure that account will be taken in future of the need to consult with employees in redundancy situations.  While the general speculation of the accountability of capital lies outside the provisions of this Bill, under section 10 representatives of managements will have to explain the reasons for the redundancy and there is a possibility for representatives of employees to inquire into the background of the proposed redundancy, perhaps including whatever mysterious financial reasons may be held to be responsible.</P>
    <P>The question of putting employees in possession of some of the fundamental facts regarding their worker situation is a matter which more concerns the legislation which was enacted here yesterday, the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Bill.  The Bill we have before us gives to the numbers established here the right to be consulted beforehand.  If that right is not fulfilled, if the obligation in this Bill is not carried out by the employer, there are fines laid down for non-implementation of those provisions. I would hope that when this Bill is enacted unions and employees generally will be aware of its provisions and will ensure it is carried out to the letter.  All we seek is full consultation beforehand, allowing all of us, State agencies included, the opportunity of providing alternative employment where that can be done.  If that cannot be done in the time given, at least full information on the reasons for the redundancy should be given.  I stress that it deals with redundancy in its collective aspect.  The other pieces of legislation deal with the problems of individuals.  The Unfair Dismissals Bill, which we will come to shortly, deals with unfair dismissal as it bears on the individual and his <Col N="563" /> or her rights.  It deals with the individual outside the collective situation. We also have that other piece of legislation laying down certain rights of the individual, the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, which we passed in 1973.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the key section in this Bill giving rise to the definition of collective redundancies.  I should like to make one point of criticism and inquiry from the Minister. We have had this on other Bills that seek to initiate and put into our legislation Community directives.  The Minister stated that this Bill incorporates decisions reached at a Council of Ministers meeting in December, 1974, which adopted the EEC directive on harmonisation of the legislation of member states relating to collective redundancies.  Whatever is wrong with the administrative machine or the governmental machine, it is not good enough that we should have such a delay.  A directive adopted by the Council of Ministers in December, 1974, required what is a relatively simple legislative measure here dealing with collective redundancies as defined under section 6.  Yet we have had this delay over that period of time.  I appreciate the exigencies of the machine and how the draftsman's office has to be satisfied and so on, but there was a two-and-a-half year delay in giving legislative effect to a directive adopted and cleared by that Council of Ministers. I voice similar criticism on other matters, and I have noted it as a very dangerous aspect.  I am not making any personal criticism of the Minister, but it is a very dangerous aspect creeping into our adoption of EEC directives and Council of Ministers' decisions. Three or four other similar pieces of <Col N="564" /> legislation came before us over the past 12 months and they indicated that there was this unnecessary delay.  On a head count of these matters we tend to be last or second last of member countries in either adopting legislation or decisions, whether in legislation or regulation form or merely decision form.  We are always near the bottom of the league table in regard to the adoption of these matters.  I am not asking the Minister to go into detail in defending the Government record. Perhaps there is an explanation for this case, but I can assure him that it is fairly general in regard to our adoption of EEC decisions, and it is not good enough.  A small country should be better than bigger countries in this respect.  We have very little excuse. Wherever the reasons for the delay lie I do not know, but I would like if the Minister would elaborate on what I have stated.</P>

The Department of Labour have been extremely busy with legislation which we are now getting out of the pipe at this point.  There may be criticism of the way we prefer legislation in the State.  It is a pretty cumbersome procedure and that is a matter that will have to be looked at in the future.

It seems to me that the whole force could be made redundant, 50 per cent certainly over six months, without coming in under this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>I was making the point, in reply to that point which the Senator made on Second Stage, that whatever period one takes the fact is that it may be argued that there is a loophole because the Bill deals with periods and with numbers, because it deals with numbers of people in their collective aspect and these are the parameters under which this legislation operates.  For individuals in a redundancy situation we have other legislation to deal specifically with the problems.  No matter what period we set here, if we extended the period and changed the numbers around, it could be suggested that hypothetical examples could be cited which would fall outside the parameter set down. We must make a clear choice both in regard to the period in which the Bill operates and the numbers who will be affected.  It would not be possible to have watertight legislation to meet all possible hypothetical situations because one can always cite a case that falls just outside the period selected.  In so far as the individual employee is concerned, I am reasonably confident that, taking the complete body of legislation which we have been enacting in this House and the other House recently, he is given reasonable assurance as to his rights and consultation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have two queries to raise on section 1.  They are important and I would be glad if the Minister could give me an indication of his thinking on them.  The first relates to the definition of employer.  I am talking about line 29 of the section.  The definition of employer defines the employer as a person.  In some cases of which I am aware, particularly in the case of certain people who are members of the teaching profession, they may not be employed by an individual in the sense that they may not be employed by a single individual or, indeed, by a group of individuals which have any standing as a company. In other words, they are not employed either by a single person or by a corporate person.  Their employment may be with a group of people who, for example, are members of a religious order.  Would it not be necessary to cover this case by the word &ldquo;person&rdquo; to be completed by the addition of the words &ldquo;or persons&rdquo; because there may be employment situations in which there is collective liability by several people for hiring and firing.  This should be taken into account.</P>
      <P>The second question I have on the section relates to the definition of industrial action.  It refers to lawful action taken by employees in consequence of a trade dispute.  Here again some teachers, and particularly secondary teachers, may have a major problem, because to the best of my knowledge many of the actions which they may take in furtherance of a trade dispute are not afforded the protection of the Trade Disputes Act of 1906.  They may find themselves in a situation in which they would be taking action which would be legal for almost any other trade union having the protection of the Trade Disputes Act but which would be illegal in their case because the protection of the Trade Disputes Act has not been extended to them.  I ask the Minister to comment on those two problems.</P>

      <P>On the question of &ldquo;person&rdquo;, the Senator's problem was whether this covered teaching for a religious order, which would be a number of people, and he asked therefore, whether the definition section would mean that there was lack of application in the context of employment as referred to by the Senator. The definitions are spelled out in the Interpretation Act, 1937.  The word &ldquo;person&rdquo; under that Act is defined in the following manner:</P>
      <P>The word &ldquo;person&rdquo; shall, unless the contrary intention appears, be construed as importing a body corporate (whether a corporation aggregate or a corporation sole) and an incorporated body of persons as well as an individual;</P>
      <P>I would take it that the case is met in the definition section.  The problem the Senator is concerned with is covered.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="568" /> In subsection (1), between lines 46 and 47, to insert the following paragraph:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;() an employee employed by an employer employing less than ten employees&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to restrict the application of the Bill to a situation where there is a firm or undertaking of some size and not to a case where somebody employs one, two or three people.  When I say ten employees I do not think that is a sacred figure.  Possibly, it could be argued it might be something less than ten.  The important thing is that this should not apply to a situation where somebody employs only two or three people and where the size of the concern and the relationship between the employer and employee is more a personal than a business one.  That kind of situation should be covered by the Bill.  I am suggesting ten employees, but if the Minister is disposed to meet me half way on that figure I would be very glad to meet him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>This problem was raised in the Dáil also.  The main point of difference there was that it would be my objective to see that this Bill would apply to all employees regardless of the accident or the size of firm in which they worked.  Perhaps, a greater case can be made for its implementation in small employments rather than in large ones.  I had to reject a suggestion along these lines in the Dáil for the same reason.  It would not be possible for me to accept this suggestion here, on the principle that the matters provided for in this Bill, unfair dismissal of the individual, that those rights should be available to individuals irrespective of the size of the firm in which they work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The secondary argument, though probably a strong one, is that the main advantage of this legislation will be for those who are in employments that are not covered by the normal protection afforded up to now by union organisations.  It is mainly to ensure that the remedy which up to now has been most readily availed of, even in firms where there is union organisations, namely the strike weapon, is not resorted to and to ensure <Col N="569" /> that the law comes in instead with its criteria as set down in this Bill. This is the main motivation behind it. If one takes that into account it will be accepted that the size of the firm should not prevent its application.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all right theoretically.  In the last Bill the Minister secured an adjustment of the EEC directive in the form of that legislation for our national purposes, which was not agreed on by the Council of Ministers, to ensure that the directive should apply to five dismissals in firms between 20 and 50 employees.  This is a recognition of the fact that there is a problem of small firms here.  We are largely a country of small firms. To apply the whole panoply of protection against unfair dismissals envisaged in this Bill to the small firms Senator Eoin Ryan talked about, firms employing under ten people, and to apply the full weight of the rights commissioner, the appeal to the tribunal, the appeal to the Circuit Court and the incumbrances on the employer envisaged in later sections of the Bill is a little unreal in the Irish situation.  It is taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not see the rationality in bringing in these firms, employing a few people and excluding the whole area of local authorities, health boards and vocational educational committees. These are being excluded as are the Garda and a number of other categories under the section.  These big battalions of employers, impersonal organisations, are being excluded from the provisions of section 2.  In my view there is every reason for the remedies proposed by the Minister to apply to these impersonal organisations, because real injustice can be done down along the line to employees or officers of these excluded bodies.  We have the situation that we have included employers of a few people, particularly in the building industry where a great percentage are in business in a small way and where the work tends to be of a take-on and let-go nature.  I am not saying that that is the ideal type of employment but it is a fact of life in our situation in that type of industry.  Surely, it is unreal to impose the whole panoply of the <Col N="570" /> burdens envisaged here in regard to the right of the employee on that type of small personal firm and to encourage costly recourse to the procedures envisaged in the Bill.</P>
    <P>If not ten certainly seven, six or five would appear to bring this matter into the focus of reality as far as the genuinely small personal firm is concerned, where the boss knows the men and women and they know him.  To start introducing those procedures into that type of employment is highly unreal. It is going to lead to tiresome and unnecessary wrangles and haggles and lead to expensive recourse to the procedures, cause small employers endless trouble and hassle and leading to, I am sure, a man giving up the ghost and going back to his trade.  I am thinking in particular of the building industry where a large number of tradesmen habitually go out of the industry to become small contractors.  Rather than be faced with this burdensome procedure they will go back to their trade. This is in contrast to some of the exclusions written into section 2, where in my view, it would be more appropriate to have the full rights procedure to prevent people in impersonal organisations being buried, wronged or rendered injustice.</P>

      <P>I support the amendment proposed by Senators Ryan and Lenihan.

      <P>In the Protection of Employment Bill, while that was dealing with collective rights, we recognised the problem of the small firm and we set down figures to show that.  This Bill deals with the problems of the individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my point that we cannot deprive an individual of the protection of this legislation simply because he or she works in a small firm.  It would be manifestly unfair if such an individual were excluded from its provisions. I do not see how business would be interfered with because the employer must before dismissing a <Col N="571" /> person explain the reasons this dismissal must go ahead.  It is a myth, I believe, to think that the small employer can recruit employees more easily than other employers, that their relationship is so different that the same rules do not have to be obeyed. It is often said that the employer in a small firm has a closer relation with his employees.  That relationship cannot be good if the small employer, in common with the large employer, cannot obey certain minimum conditions laid down in this legislation, that is, that if he is to dismiss a person he must give him the reasons for his dismissal and be able to stand over those reasons.  I believe it would be very unfair to say to the employee in the small firm &ldquo;Since you work in a small firm, you are not covered under this legislation on unfair dismissals&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, where the small firm has a problem in relation to collective redundancies, we have made allowance for that situation.  We made exclusions in relation to the particular problems that can arise where close relatives are involved.  We have an exclusion in that case in section 2 (c) because we do not want to see legislation passed by the Oireachtas becoming a bone of contention especially in relation to the land ownership.  That area is excluded.  I hope that any section of employees who are excluded by this Bill can be brought within its scope as soon as possible.  Those who have been excluded up to now in this Bill are those who have been covered by existing procedures.  We should have a uniform statutory code of practice throughout the State, in private employment, in public employment, in firms large and small, covering all employees irrespective of where they work.  Regrettably, I cannot meet the Senator in his point of view that there should be exception made in the case of small firms.</P>

      <P>When the Minister talks about people excluded for whom machinery already exists, I presume he is talking about people employed by or under the State and other categories of that kind.  Of course it is <Col N="572" /> impossible to rationalise the situation in which a small firm has to subject itself to all the paraphernalia of this Bill, whereas large State bodies of various kinds are immune from it. There are procedures in some of them, but certainly not as onerous as the procedure in this Bill.  There is no procedure, as far as I am aware, applying to those who are excluded in this Bill. There is no procedure whereby the employer, which would be the State in that case, is put in the position of having to prove that the dismissal was not unlawful.  This is what the employer is obliged to do under this Bill. Whatever about a sophisticated employer who is able to get advice and so on, we must consider the very small employer in the country employing two or three men.  If someone whom he dismissed or let go invokes the protection of this Bill, the employer will certainly find it impossible to really argue his case.  He will have to face up to the situation that unless he is able to prove that everything about the dismissal&mdash;which may not have appeared as a dismissal at all at the time&mdash;was impeccable, then he is subject to the penalties of this Bill.  There is no way of rationalising it.  I am sure the Minister will not attempt to rationalise the discrimination shown against the ordinary employer, and particularly the small one, as compared with what the State is able to get away with, simply by writing in large numbers of excluded persons into this Bill.</P>
      <P>Leaving aside the basic discrimination in that regard in this Bill, certainly there should be something done for the very small employer who will be beaten from the word go.  He will never even have a chance of making a case or understanding what kind of a case he is supposed to make in the kind of situation that may develop, because, according to this Bill and contrary to all the principles that applied to situations like that in the past, he is deemed guilty unless he can prove himself to be innocent.</P>

      <P>We would not wish to create the impression that the small employer will be faced with a huge bundle of fresh obligations, an increase in the number of official <Col N="573" /> forms to be filled in and a long procession of procedures which he must comply with.  We must remember what is proposed here.  All the small employer has to do, apart from the provisions of ensuring that he must give reasons for a dismissal, is to remember that the procedures he will be dealing with are informal.  All that is required is that the employer must tell his side of the story to comply with the provisions of this Bill.  The criteria under which he may dismiss a person are set out here.  All he has got to do after that, if it is regarded as unfair by the employee, is to explain his side, his reasons for the dismissal of an employee.  It is incontestable that the employer in these situations should give his reasons for dismissal of his employee, irrespective of the size of the firm.</P>

      <P>That is precisely the trouble.  The Minister says glibly that it is just a question of the employee claiming that he was dismissed unfairly. In section 6 (1) the dismissal of itself is deemed to be unfair.  Therefore the whole onus is thrown on the employer to meet the full weight of any complaint brought within six months of the dismissal of a worker. In defending he is then not in an informal area.  I made the point on the Second Stage yesterday that there was an informal procedure envisaged under section 6 or some other section. That would be all right if it was just the question of a member of the staff of the rights commissioner trying to sort out the problem in an <i>ad hoc</i>, friendly way.  But it is not that way. We are setting up here a legal structure side by side with the existing common law structure.  The small employer is not in an informal situation where the matter can be settled before a friendly rights commissioner or representative of the rights commission. That is not what is envisaged by section 6.  According to section 6 the dismissal of itself is deemed to be unlawful.  Thereafter the employer is in the dock and he must show that the dismissal that took place within six months of this hearing can be justified by him on the criteria set out in section 6 (4).</P>

      <P>The nub of the point is that the onus is being switched.  A new legal remedy is being provided and this is not a matter that may be dismissed as something that can be settled around a table.  The employer is faced with the obligation to make his case six months afterwards, though by the time the hearing comes up it could be seven or eight months after the dismissal.  I am pleading the case for the small employer.  In a small concern employing six, seven or eight people, some words are exchanged and a fellow goes.  It happens every day of the week on every building site in the country. This man, getting some smart fellow to advise him, comes along bringing in the rights commissioner and the appeals tribunal, if the rights commissioner finds one way, and then goes into the Circuit Court.  At the end, if the employer fails, he is faced with the penalties envisaged in this Bill unless he restores this person to his employment.</P>
      <P>The Minister must recognise the onerous nature of the obligation that will be placed on thousands of small employers in this respect.  Side by side with that, the big battalions of the State are excluded.  Under section 2, which we are seeking to amend here, the civil service, local authorities, health boards, committees of agriculture, vocational education bodies are all excluded.  More wrong and more injustice is done every day inside those organisations than would ever be done by a small builder to an employee on a building site.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;involving dismissals. There are people who are not as protected as the Minister seems to think.  They are the employees of the more remote bodies, such as the vocational education bodies, subject to pressures of all kinds in the more remote counties, the employees of health boards and committees of agriculture. It is all right in the civil service where they have well-ordered procedures and complaints systems.  But what about the pressures exercised on members of vocational education committees, clerical and otherwise, in regard to particular employees of these committees?  There is a long litany of these people and they are excluded here.  The Minister is refusing to accept that the type of employer most affected will be the small guy employing six, seven or eight on a building site&mdash;the sort of person in small textile and footwear industries the Minister is trying to encourage with his incentives under the employment premium scheme.  The big battalions are let go.</P>
      <P>All we are seeking to do under Senator Ryan's amendment is to exclude firms and persons employing ten or fewer people.  In many cases they are not firms at all.  An enterprise with fewer than ten people employed should be excluded from this Bill.  If the Minister does not agree with ten, he might agree with six or seven or eight.  We all understand the situation that exists in the country.  These are small, personalised firms.  The reality of the situation is that the men with a bit of enterprise and initiative will be driven out of that sort of small employer category if they see they are faced with these onerous procedures written into this Bill.  If they cannot make a few pounds in an enterprising manner in a small building operation and if they see that they are hamstrung and impeded in this manner, they will feel that they would be better off as tradesmen or as employees in Britain or elsewhere than trying to make a go of it here in their own country.</P>

      <P>A couple of things strike me about the amendment in relation to what Senator Lenihan has said.  First of all, if the kind of small <Col N="576" /> employer he is talking about is to go about firing employees unjustifiably, he will not fall into the category of employer much longer.  Is this kind of thing happening already or likely to happen to any appreciable extent?  Are firms of this kind wont to fire employees frequently or not?  In respect of the passing of this Bill are they likely to be firing employees frequently or are they not?  If they are not, there is basically no reason for this amendment.  If they are, then it is not today or tomorrow that we should be passing this Bill, but yesterday or last year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I still feel that the Minister must take cognisance of the fact that, apart from the city, down in rural Ireland we have not this great multiplicity of very large industries. There are quite a large number of people who believe in doing things for themselves and who are not always looking for Government grants to set themselves up.  In particular, I have in mind people who have opened quarries and people who may be taking part in producing stone facings for buildings; people who have small garages or build trailers for bringing milk to the creamery for their neighbours; people who manufacture paling posts; people engaged in a souvenir industry; people making link boxes, wrought iron gates. There are various other very small industries that people have initiated and set up themselves.  They are able to put a person into employment without getting the big grant that it takes to put people into very large industries.</P>
      <P>It is very important that we should take cognisance of these people because they are certainly providing employment in rural areas where it is very much needed.  Anything that will discourage people from doing that, as Senator Lenihan has said, would be detrimental to the whole effort of providing employment for our people. In my view the real culprits who should be in the dock in this matter are not the small employers but the Government themselves who are responsible for 116,000 people unemployed. It is they who should be walking up the steps instead of the small employer.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 2 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a number of points to make on section 2.  I will make them one after another and I should like to hear the Minister's reply to them.  The first is in relation to section 2 (1) (a), and this is one of the core parts of the Bill.  It smacks to me rather too much of sudden death because there could be a situation in which one employee would have very substantially greater rights than another simply by virtue of one or two days' further service.  This problem arises in relation to all legislation which has in-built time limits.  I would argue strongly either for a shorter time limit or for a different method of procedure.  I accept that in all forms of employment there should be a reasonable getting-to-know period.  It puzzles me whether the getting-to-know period should be as long as one year.  I should imagine that most employers and employees would know each other fairly well within a period of six months or thereabouts and, in fact, unless I am mistaken, this is the period the British legislation gave effect to in the same kind of context.</P>
      <P>If we cannot change the period from a year to six months, we should have another look at employee rights, not simply in terms of dismissal but also in terms of redundancy and of notice.  It would seem to me&mdash;and I should be glad of the Minister's opinion on this&mdash;to be much fairer that an employee's rights with regard to dismissal should grow progressively over a period of employment rather than being non-existent on day 364 and in full force on day 366.  There should be a phased system of protection built into this Act, as indeed there is in other Acts&mdash;most notably in regard to the Redundancy Act&mdash; which would have the effect of giving employees different degrees of protection at different stages of their employment. Would this approach appeal to the Minister?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter raised by the Senator was a point raised during the discussion in the other House.  As the Senator may imagine, it was also raised when I met representative organisations on either side. Certain employer groups wanted two years in this area.  The unions wanted something like six months under subsection (1) (a).  Those were the figures mentioned by either side.  I thought the fairest thing was to come down somewhere in the middle.  That is the usual position for us to adopt in legislation of this kind and that is why the one year is referred to here.  The United Kingdom had one year initially and I think they have reduced it to six months.  That is the present position there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="579" /> The Senator accepts the need for a period but he talks about introducing flexibility in this matter.  We did not go to the point of considering the varying circumstances of a flexibile variation under a particular period, if that is what the Senator had in mind. At this point we were anxious to get what we thought was a fair enough period.  We believe that what some employers suggested was a bit excessive and what the unions were suggesting was impractical in legislation of this kind being introduced for the first time.  I will take note of the Senator's point for future consideration of changes in this area.</P>

      <P>I take it the working of the Bill, when it becomes law, will be kept under review in the Minister's Department.</P>
      <P>The second question I have relates to section 2 (1), paragraph (c), the familial section.  In response to an earlier amendment the Minister said that he did not wish the Oireachtas to pass legislation which would become bones of contention between members of the same family.  It is probably fair to say that we have done this.  The Succession Act is probably a classic example.</P>

      <P>I am chary of removing people's rights or of excepting people from certain categories who have rights simply because they happen to exist in familiar relationships with people.  We hear a lot about children's rights these days, sometimes also about parents' rights.  We often forget that even in educational matters these rights sometimes fall to be exercised by one of these parties against the will of the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two more specific points on which I would like the Minister's guidance.  Firstly, how the paragraph is to be read.  On one reading of the paragraph all the things in it go together&mdash;in other words, in order to be exempted from the scope of this legislation you not only have to be in a familiar relationship with the employer but you also have to be a member <Col N="580" /> of your employer's household and your place of employment is a private dwelling; house or a farm.  If that is the case that meets my objection to a very substantial extent.  It means that if a father was a managing director of a company, his son was an employee and the son wanted to take an action against him, the son could take the action in this particular set of circumstances</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, private dwelling means a farm.</P>
      <P>Having disposed of that perhaps we could go on to paragraph (h), a person employed by or under the State.  There is an ambiguity here which I should be glad if the Minister would clear up. There are some categories of people whose salaries are effectively 100 per cent paid by the State even though they may not be in some sense employed by the State.  My good friend, Senator Quinlan, would come into this category.  His university professorial salary is paid entirely by the State <i>via</i> the university in which he works. Senator Quinlan, as far as I know, is not under any immediate threat of dismissal.  But there are two university teachers in Maynooth at present who are under threat of dismissal.  They and I would be very anxious to find out whether or not they might lose the protection of this Bill simply by virtue of the fact that effectively their salaries are paid by the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to address some remarks to this section and to the Minister as well.  One of the problems in relation to this section and its effect is that there is no definition of &ldquo;probation&rdquo; unless it is defined earlier on, and I do not see that it is.  There can be situations in which the existence of something which is called &ldquo;probation&rdquo; is something quite different.  For example, in the teaching profession at present there are fairly stringent probation requirements.  The teaching profession at present is very much a seller's and employer's market.  There is no real parity of power between the employers and individual teachers who may be looking for a job especially in a situation in which, as in the secondary teaching profession&mdash;as many as 50 per cent of those who qualify as teachers every year are going to be without jobs by Christmas.  They are in a position where they have to accept basically any and all of the stipulations any employer wants to make.  One of the stipulations which is habitually being made and used against teachers, especially against very young teachers, has been the probationary period.  The situation is aggravated by the fact that there is no necessary proof that the people who are alleged to be sitting in judgment on whether or not these teachers are fit to teach are qualified to pass that sort of judgment on them.  It is called a system of probation but it can work out very substantially more as a system of intimidation.  I appeal to the Minister&mdash;I know he has already made a substantial change in this area by bringing down the period of probation involved from two years to one&mdash;to see whether or not some final adjustment could be made to give people serving probation in those kinds of circumstances more protection than is afforded them under this Bill.  As this Bill stands they will not get any protection.</P>

      <P>I should like to support Senator Horgan regarding the probation period for teachers.  It could be used against a teacher who could be kept on the probation list for quite a while, resulting in a grave loss of salary and increments in following years.  It is important that this point be considered by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>It must be clear that the probation is at the commencement of employment and could not be used in the way Senator Dolan mentions.</P>
      <P>In reply to Senator Horgan, it is made quite clear in section 3 that the contract must be in writing and the terms must be described in writing, that is, that there is an obligation of probation or training.  As the Senator knows we have had consultations on the general period of probation.  We have now reduced it from what was originally a two-year probationary period to a one-year probationary period.  That is in line with the general requirement of section 2 (1) (a).  It must be continuous service.  This change amends the situation considerably. Obviously we must have a probationary period, it must be in writing and it is reduced to one year. Those are the changes that have occurred.</P>
      <P>The Senator has discussed the provisions of this Bill with me before now.  He is being critical of certain of the features attached to the probationary period.  I understand that because I understand the feeling of many of the teaching profession, of looking askance at &ldquo;probationary period&rdquo; especially in the context of this Bill.  The teaching authorities, if that is a correct description, feel it essential that there should be a probationary period.  We have attempted to meet as far as possible the views of the representatives of the teaching profession in ensuring that the probationary period was reduced in the fashion set out in this section.</P>

      <P>I should like to urge the rather opposite viewpoint to Senator Horgan now that we are divided by an aisle.  It is very difficult in something as serious as teaching to form a judgment on a probationary period shorter than one year.  We have to balance the rights of the individual against the rights of the children.  The children deserve the best the teaching profession can give.  Therefore, the proper and responsible use of probation is central to ensuring that the children get the best the teaching body can offer.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="584" /> In page 6, to delete lines 43 to 47 and &ldquo;section&rdquo; in line 48.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to remove the situation where a review or consideration of a dispute of this kind will be prejudged.  The situation is that the dismissal shall be deemed to be an unfair dismissal unless, having regard to all the circumstances, there were substantial grounds justifying the dismissal. There seems absolutely no reason why the employer should be discriminated against in this way.  The section might be worded the other way round, that a dismissal shall be deemed to be justified unless the employee can prove that it was not justified.  Why should it be one way or the other?  It will come before a board or some kind of officer to decide whether or not it was justified.  Why prejudge the issue by suggesting that it is unfair unless it is proved to be otherwise?  This is contrary to the fundamental principle of our system of jurisprudence, which says that a person is deemed to be innocent until he is proved guilty.  It is contrary to our whole system of law where, as far as possible, the court or whatever is trying the case merely has the two points of view and decides between them.  This is quite unnecessary and will lead to a prejudiced and discriminatory view of any case that comes before an adjudicator.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) tilts the balance temporarily the other way and states:</P>
    <P>Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1) of this section, the dismissal of an employee shall be deemed, for the purposes of this Act, not to be an unfair dismissal, if it results wholly or mainly from one or more of the following:...</P>
    <P>Then, to make the situation entirely confusing, we have subsection (6) which states:</P>
    <P>In determining for the purposes of this Act whether the dismissal of an employee was an unfair dismissal or not, it shall be for the employer to show that the dismissal resulted wholly or mainly from one or more of the matters specified in subsection (4) of this section or that there were other substantial grounds justifying the dismissal.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="585" /> The onus of proof in the first part of the section is thrown on the employer. Then in a later subsection it is thrown back onto the employee, while in subsection (6) it is back on the employer. Apart from the fact that it is discriminatory and unnecessary, it will certainly end up by being thoroughly confusing.  It all arises from the compulsion on the part of the Minister to have onus of proof tilted very largely against the employer.  Why not simply have the situation where the dispute, as to whether or not it was unfair, is tried by the officer with the two points of view put before him and he adjudicates on the two?  It seems unnecessary to have this onus of proof.</P>
    <P>I am aware that if the Minister was disposed to accept this amendment he would probably have to make some consequential amendments, because just to remove these lines would not be enough.  But, of course, we have had very little time indeed to consider amendments.  I am putting down the amendment to make a point which I think needs to be made.  If it were to be accepted I agree that probably there would have to be a rewording of it or consequential amendments of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>In this kind of situation, where the Minister says he is doing no more than endeavouring to ensure that justice will be done, that there will be no unfair dismissals, it seems quite unnecessary to have an onus of proof of this kind tilted very strongly in one direction when exactly the same result could be obtained by merely seeing that the matter is adjudicated upon by the officer or body concerned.  Consequently, I see no reason why there should be any deeming that the dismissal was unfair any more than I see why there should be any deeming that it was fair or shall not be unfair as it appears in subsection (4).  Both of these could be taken out and the section rewritten with no deeming and no onus of that kind.  The section would be very much improved, the whole climate of the Bill, the whole approach to this problem would be very much better and there would be no suggestion that there was any discrimination <Col N="586" /> one way or another if these lines were taken out of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I would just make the point to the Senator that I understand the principle he refers to about the onus of proof and the common law position in relation to that before matters are tested.  But here we are dealing with the situation in which the employer has taken action and dismissed for reasons known to him.  At this point the law steps in and suggests that he must explain his actions, must give reasons for them, and he has an onus to discharge.  After all he has taken action.  Long before this is invoked a person has lost his job.  I do not think it is exactly comparable.</P>

      <P>There is not any prejudgment here.  Subsection (1) must be taken together with subsections (4) and (6).  Taking all of these together, subsection (4) lays down the matters without prejudice to which the employer can gain his case and be free of the obligations of this Bill when he proves under subsection (4) that the employee was incapable, incompetent, lacked qualification and that his conduct was lacking.  The reasons the onus is placed on the employer's shoulders are as follows.  He alone is in possession of the information; he has initiated the action; he has the documentary proof that led him to take that action.  The employee, on the other hand, is the person who has lost his job.  The employee in losing his job can only be protected where he can prove that his conduct was not in any way deficient, that it was up to the mark.  He must satisfy the tribunal that he was capable, that he was competent, that he did not lack qualification. When we see it in the context of the entire section and realise that this is an industrial relations matter we begin to understand that the provisions are perfectly fair and practical in the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with one thing the Minister said&mdash;it is precisely an industrial relations matter, no <Col N="587" /> more and no less.  This is a matter that can be settled in every area where the aggrieved employee is a member of a trade union.  It can be settled provided there are proper trade union procedures and arrangements, joint management/worker procedures and proper consultation procedures and arrangements.  All of this can be worked out in a properly organised firm between trade union and management. The two aspects that will really be involved in 90 per cent of dismissals are (a) and (b) of subsection (4) of section 6&mdash;the capability, competence or qualification of the employee for performing the work for which he was employed under (a) and (b), the question of the conduct of the employee.</P>
      <P>Why do we have to have the whole apparatus of the rights commissioner, the Employment Appeals Tribunal and the Circuit Court brought into this area that can be teased out between trade union, shop steward, works council&mdash;any of the numerous procedures we have been successfully evolving in our better firms and hopefully evolving in all our firms?  Why not have this type of matter settled through those procedures?  This is what I strongly object to&mdash;bringing in the whole panoply of the law, creating a new system of rights in regard to a matter which, as the Minister rightly said, is really part of the area of industrial relations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is what we are talking about. This is the way it has always been traditionally.  I would hope that the only possible area where there might be injustice at present would be that of non-union workers.  I grant the Minister that.  We have a very small percentage, I say thankfully, of non-union workers in this country because I am a great believer in trade union power.  I am a great believer in trade union and management provided that the procedures that are established are effective.  I am a great believer in trade unions and management working out these matters themselves, through consultation arrangements, through works councils representative of shop-floor workers and management, <Col N="588" /> in touch with the actual conditions as they exist on the shop floor.</P>
    <P>That is where these matters should be settled and teased out.  They should not be made the subject of a new scheme of legal rights side by side with the existing common law code.  I disagree fundamentally in principle with this whole question of introducing a panoply of rights in this area, which is essentially one to be teased out within the arena of industrial relations.  If one is to improve on that&mdash;and I wish for more and more improvements in this area&mdash;let us have them within the Labour Court, within the ambit of the rights commissioner already existing.  Let us have his office staffed to a greater degree.  Let us have a very effective arm of the Labour Court dealing with these rights and problems.  If it is necessary to call in a rights commissioner or his representative, let that person be available at short notice to act in a fire brigade capacity if this matter cannot be settled on the floor or between management and worker, instead of establishing a type of procedure that would take six months or possibly 18 months to work.</P>
    <P>Why not have all this matter teased out swiftly in an <i>ad hoc</i> way, as Senator Ryan is seeking to do in the amendment?  Instead of putting the onus on the employer, why not have all the matters that should be dealt with under subsection (4) dealt with in the way the amendment suggests? The net issue in the great majority of these cases involves the conduct of the employee, for or against whether he was right or wrong in a particular situation, how he behaved and how he did not behave.</P>
    <P>That is the sort of thing that will be settled and can be settled by a special rights commissioner or his representative being available on the spot if the existing consultation procedures do not work out or if the works council cannot agree.  If the thing gets bound up on the floor between management and worker then bring in this fire brigade officer from a special rights commissioner's office, a man skilled in this sort of arrangement. Let him get people to sit around <Col N="589" /> a table and settle it there and then. This is where the energy should be directed, not in creating a whole new edifice of rights that will add a new complicated area in which, I warn the Minister, narks and hooks&mdash;the people whom trade unions would not back in a million years&mdash;will flourish in taking action against employers.</P>
    <P>I have great respect for the common sense of the trade union movement, of the majority of shop stewards on the floors.  These people, with the aid of some outside fire brigade officer from a special rights commissioner's office, can settle these matters.  If the trade unions do not back a man or woman fully in that situation, in 99 cases out of 100 that person is not worth backing.  The person the trade union or shop steward will not back, the person who, in most of the cases I am talking about, the trade unions are happy to see gone, because he or she is of no more use to the trade union than they are to their employer, that person will make the greatest use and derive the greatest benefit from these procedures.</P>
    <P>That is the great danger we envisage here.  The section will impose a new legal procedure placing the onus completely on the employer and particularly on the small employer.  In this Bill we are backing people whom the trade unions, in their common sense and wisdom, would never dream of backing.</P>

      <P>The rights commissioner will not operate at all in most cases but when he does he will operate in accordance with the rules that we have set out here.  The section is necessary because all workers are not in trade unions and they particularly would require the protection of this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add a few words against this amendment because there are some fairly fundamental issues at stake.  Senator Lenihan talked about creating a whole new panoply of rights and so on in such a manner as to put the fear of God into anybody who is bedevilled enough by the degree of <Col N="590" /> bureaucracy that seems to be inseparable from civilised life today and is horrified at the thought of any further accretions to it.  But in this Bill we are talking about people who have little or no rights under existing legislation. If you are to give these people rights they have to be new rights and they have to be written in in this way.  I do not think it is in the slightest bit unfair that the onus of proof should be, as is stated in this Bill, on the employer.</P>
      <P>There is a very odd situation in relation to employment in general, not just in this country but in every country in the world, because job security is rarely taken into account in relation to wages or other matters.  One would think that natural justice alone, on the face of it, should determine that the people who get paid least in our society should have the greatest job security and the people who get most could afford to do with comparatively less.  But in fact the power play in society is precisely the opposite: it is the people who have the bargaining power in society who have the big salaries and the expenses and all the rest, who also have job security. They swallow up so much job security that there is not enough left for anybody else.  It is the small men with the low salaries, and who do not have the &ldquo;perks&rdquo;, who are also crucified by the absence of anything that might be described as reasonable job security.  In so far as this Bill goes it goes some way towards reversing that balance, although there is a long way to go before it is reversed completely.  I think that it is very much to be welcomed and that is why I oppose the amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 4:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 8, after line 28, to insert: &ldquo;(7)  Where it is shown that a dismissal of a person referred to in paragraph (a) or (b) of section 2 (1) or section 3 or 4 of this Act results wholly or mainly from one or more of the matters referred to in subsection (2) (a) of this section, then subsections (1) and (6) of this section and the said sections 2 (1), 3 <Col N="591" /> and 4 shall not apply in relation to the dismissal.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of this amendment is to give access to the Bill to employees who feel that they have been dismissed due solely to their trade union membership or activities but who are otherwise excluded under the exclusion categories mentioned in the Bill, that is, they are excluded because they have less than one year's service or they are beyond retiring age or they fall into the category of probation.  This is to ensure that, even where they are excluded from the various categories in the Bill, if their dismissal arises because of their membership of a trade union or their activities on behalf of the trade union the Act would operate.</P>
      <P>This is a matter that concerns Senator Lenihan.  On the last amendment he was concerned about the onus of proof.  In this case no onus of proof rests on the employer's shoulders.  In other words, it is an equal power position&mdash;it is for the employee to prove that his dismissal was because of his trade union activities.  But I think it is only fair that, where the cause is solely related to the activities of an employee and a trade union, there should obviously be no onus of proof to discharge on the employer's shoulders, and there is not in this case.</P>

I am a believer in equality in regard to members of trade unions and this represents the greatest credit of our system of industrial life and any hope we have for industrial democracy.  I am glad that it is also on the basis, as the Minister says, of an equal presentation of the facts and decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask a question in respect of a specific case concerning a teacher.  There is an old standing agreement between the Department and the diocesan authorities where when the average number of <Col N="592" /> pupils in a school drops below a certain figure the teacher becomes redundant. That teacher is then put on what they call a panel system.  This is an arrangement that was worked out between the INTO and the Department for 30 or 40 years.</P>
      <P>The point I am making is that since then many teachers have been allowed to come back into the services.  Many of them have large families.  This fall in average might come at a very unfair time.  It might mean that they would have to be transferred or to take the first available appointment within the diocese.  As a result a teacher might be forced to travel 60 to 80 miles away from home.  Under present legislation if he did not accept an offered job he might be dismissed.  I wonder if such a situation would be covered in this Bill.  I know that in some places there is the possibility of very grave hardship on teachers.</P>

      <P>I have a number of other points in regard to the section which I should like to make now.  First, I should like to compliment the Minister on the change he has made in the section particularly in relation to the need to identify substantial grounds for dismissal in subsections (1) and (2) and on removing a certain amount of verbiage which qualifies the political or religious opinions of the employee.</P>
      <P>There is another question in relation to paragraph (f) of subsection (2) as to whether the Minister adequately protects the rights of pregnant women in employment.  This is a very ambiguous area.  All sorts of enterprises have different rules and sets of regulations about the amount of help and encouragement given to female employees who may want to have children.  There is a certain amount of consideration but perhaps not enough.  The section does not stipulate any provisions for sick leave in employment.  It does not explicitly refer to absence of an employee for the birth of a child.  Birth is a matter connected with pregnancy and it would have been nice to have it spelled out more specifically.  Subsection (4) (b) refers to &ldquo;the conduct of the employee&rdquo;.  What is meant here is the misconduct of the employee?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>If pregnancy were the cause of dismissal the employee could cite the provisions of this Bill.  I agree with the Senator that the area of possible discrimination in relation to pregnancy in employment has still to get quite an amount of consideration in legislation. <Col N="595" /> We do not suggest that this is the last word on it.  The whole question of maternity leave is a very important area and one that we have not yet started to legislate in.  What we had to do in a Bill of this character was to outlaw pregnancy as a basis of dismissal.</P>

      <P>I have a number of questions to ask on the section.  First of all I compliment the Minister on his writing in the concept of &ldquo;reinstatement&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;re-employment&rdquo;. It is a fundamental change and I am glad it was made.  There are a couple of problems about redress which I should like to bring to his attention.  If the appropriate form of redress for the employee found to have been unfairly dismissed is reinstatement, what is to happen to employees whose rights either in respect of pensionability or promotion might have been seriously put at risk by the break in service?  On the financial side, a problem arises in relation to secondary teachers.  By far the greater part of their salaries is paid by the State, although the minor part of their salaries, which stands as a contractual relationship between them and their employers, is paid by the school.  In a situation where a teacher is found to be unfairly dismissed and is entitled to be re-employed, can the rights commissioner recommend or can the tribunal decree not only that the school in question makes good his length of service and pension rights, promotion rights and so on, but that the State should pay that part of his salary which he would have been paid if he remained in employment but had lost by virtue of being unfairly dismissed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to subsection (1) (c), would the Minister consider the possibility of putting in a minimum compensation clause?  It could happen that the compensation might be very slight, and there are provisions in other types of legislation of this kind for a basic minimum compensation in any case in which an unfair dismissal is proven.  I would think that, regardless of the material damage or loss sustained by the person who has been unfairly dismissed, there should be a basic minimum type of compensation.  It need not be large, probably a fortnight's pay or something like that, which would be a form of punitive damage designed to persuade that employer or indeed any other employer not to do the same thing, that he was not going to get away with it.  It need not be very large but it should be there, more especially in view of the rather sophisticated provisions of the Bill, because people who get any kind of award under this Bill may not proceed at common law for damages.</P>

      <P>There are two views on this minimum payment. Some people would claim that we would be setting a precedent if we provided for a minimum compensation award here.  I prefer to think that it would be better to leave this to the discretion of the rights commissioners, <Col N="597" /> who would add to the body of experience in this area and build up precedents based on the actual application of the provisions here.  In other words, leave it to their discretion.  That is a better way to operate here than simply to set a figure down.  There is a point in what the Senator says, but in practice most people who deal with problems of this kind would prefer the maximum of discretion to be left available to them.</P>

      <P>I should like to have one problem clarified, which a rereading of the section has brought up. Subsection (1) (a) refers to reinstatement by the employer of the employee. The Minister has made it quite clear that, if positive declaration is made by the rights commissioner or tribunal of the court, no great loss of service will be held to have taken place.  However, subsection (1) (b) refers to &ldquo;re-engagement&rdquo; by the employer of the employee, in the same position or in a different position.  It is really a matter of some concern here that a person's pension or promotion rights should not be in any way worsened as a result of re-engagement or reinstatement, particularly if he is to be re-engaged in the same position which he held before he was dismissed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is that if the tribunal went for &ldquo;re-engagement&rdquo; there would be an element of penalty in the decision they came to, because re-engagement is obviously not as good for the employee as reinstatement.  We allow these alternatives here to give a flexibility to the tribunal.  In other words, there would be an element of culpability in the case of the employee who simply gets re-engagement at the end of the appeal under this legislation. Of course the element of penalty would be more severe in the categories mentioned by the Senator here.  This of course would be a factor presumably weighing in the tribunal's mind in both cases, because it would appear to be a penalty out of proportion to re-engagement in other circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 9, line 30, to delete &ldquo;6 months&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;1 month&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The reason for this amendment is to cut down the period within which a claim may be made.  It seems to me inconceivable that an employee who feels he is being unfairly dismissed could not formulate at least some kind of notice or letter to say that he wants to appeal against that dismissal within a matter of a month.</P>
      <P>If two months was suggested I would not think that entirely unreasonable, but I think six months is entirely unreasonable. In this case it is the employee who is making the claim and who feels he has been unfairly dismissed. Surely he should be able to come to that conclusion and give some kind of notice or make some kind of claim within a matter of a month. This is important because if it is left for six months then the employee who will know he is going to make the claim can have his facts and figures and reasons assembled before he makes it but in many cases the employer may be unconscious of the fact that there is a question of unfair dismissal involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be realised that very often in the kind of situation where somebody leaves employment exactly what happened may be very blurred and uncertain as far as the employer is concerned. It may be a question of a man who was dissatisfied for some reason and walked away, or it may be a case of a man who does not come back some Monday morning.  The employer may not be aware that there was any question of unfair dismissal or even of dismissal. Whereas the employee, if he is going to make a claim, is conscious of the fact that he feels it was unfair and intends doing something about it.  It is unrealistic to allow a situation to develop where a person leaves employment in circumstances in which it was <Col N="599" /> not obviously an unfair dismissal or was not even a dismissal at all.  The person subsequently makes a case that there was unfair dismissal, the employer may have forgotten entirely the circumstances of the case and may find it difficult, if not impossible, to prepare his defence for such a claim.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinlan's amendment meets the situation.  It is that some notice must be given.  That is an equally good way of meeting the situation.  However, not all dismissals take place in a dramatic way where it is quite clear that there was a summary dismissal, whether it was merited or not, unfair or not.  They often take place in a very vague way and the employer would not be conscious that anything of the nature of a claim for unfair dismissal was going to take place.  He would not be in a position to remember what happened on the occasion. Six months seems to be too long in the circumstances.  There should either be a limit of one month or alternatively some kind of a notice or communication, no matter how informal, as Senator Quinlan mentioned, to put the employer on notice that there is a claim pending against him.</P>
    <P>Another important reason why the time should be curtailed is the fact that a situation may develop which would be very unfair to a third party, because the employer may employ somebody to fill a position vacated by the person who subsequently makes a claim.  If the claim is successful the person who filled the vacancy may be well established.  It may be six months or more by the time the claim is heard and by then that person may be very successful in the position and will have good reason for believing he is in a permanent job where he has good prospects for the future.  The impossible situation then develops where the unfairly dismissed employee&mdash;if the dismissal is found to be unfair&mdash; comes back and the man who was taken on to fill the vacancy will have to be let go.  In that way a perfectly innocent third party will be unfairly dismissed although he is not covered by this Bill.</P>
    <P>In all these situations where there is a dispute as to circumstances, the <Col N="600" /> sooner the claim is dealt with the better, because the recollection of the people who may be in a position to give evidence is clearer.  The sooner the claim is made the more likely it is that the necessary evidence will be available if the matter is dealt with quickly.  From everybody's point of view the minimum time, within reason, should be in this section rather than six months which is, by any test, far too long.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to either accept my amendment of one month or, alternatively, the amendment put down by Senator Quinlan.  From every point of view the section would be improved. Justice would more likely be done if the matter had to be dealt with within a short time and if the employer from a very early stage is made aware of the fact that a claim will be made against him.</P>

      <P>For my own peace of mind I should like the Minister to tell us if a person waited six months, or any period between one and six months, to take action, would he not, in fact, be embarking on a course of action that would automatically break the continuity of his own employment? Therefore, the only result he could get out of a tribunal or a rights commissioner would be a re-engagement rather than a reinstatement.  By the way the section is worded does it not put the employee at a disadvantage in that respect in that he could do himself more harm than good?</P>

      <P>I have little to add to what has been said by Senator Ryan.  Six months is obviously an absurd length of time.  If we take a parallel from the Road Traffic Act, the Garda Síochána have to serve notice of intent within 14 days and then the prosecution, if they decide to take it, follows in due course after that.  The least that should be done is that the employer should be given notice of intent of proceeding with such a case.</P>

We are talking about people who may not be organised, who may not know everything about the law.  In fact, it will take some years before it gets to every person in Ireland that they have a right under a certain Act. We know, as public representatives, how many people do not know their rights even though it is broadcast every day of the week and would not know them for years until it affects them.  I noted what Senator Ryan said in regard to a person not coming in on Monday morning and serving notice six months later.  I can assure him that little attention is given to such a person by a tribunal if he has not notified his employer either that he cannot come or why.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>This question of the period in which a claim could be advanced was discussed at length in the debate in the other House.  It is clear that we need a certain period of grace under which a claim could be processed.  The period we decided upon is one that would permit domestic grievance procedures, where these operate in firms, to operate, thus perhaps absolving those concerned of the necessity of availing of this legislation. In other words, the matter could be settled amicably without reference to these proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be pointed out that the unions wanted a longer period than the six months referred to.  The employers wanted something like three months and, to compromise, we decided on six months.  A certain period is required. It is interesting to note that in the case of the redundancy legislation, which was originally passed in 1967 and amended in 1969, one can claim for almost a year.  These periods are necessary because in many cases employees do not know certain rights they have. There is a need to permit them to catch up on the law before they can decide to move ahead on a case.  The period we have decided upon is not unrealistic.  It will not lead to immense difficulties for employers but, at the same time, it will permit employees concerned to make a case in a relevant period.  Ignorance of the law is a factor in these cases.  It would be a pity if, because someone did not know that <Col N="602" /> they had a case, they could not put it forward because the time had run out.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, we have to give a cut-off period, and six months is a realistic one.  I could not agree with the unions when they sought a longer period and I could not agree with the employers when they suggested a much shorter period than six months.  This is a discussion we had in the other House and I regret I am not in a position to meet the amendments put forward by the Senator.  If we bear in mind that this legislation will, we hope, operate successfully in the context of industrial relations, a certain period is required. The common-sense one is six months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not convinced by the Minister's reasons for leaving the section as it is.  It is unjust to have such a long time, unless there is a reason for it.  In the Act dealing with workmen's compensation a time within which claims could be made was set but there was a provision to the effect that, if a court was shown there were good reasons why the claim was not taken within a certain period, such as the fact that the man had left the country or gone looking for a job or something of that kind, the court could extend the time.  In the ordinary course a certain time limit was reasonable and, in the absence of special circumstances, that time should apply.</P>
      <P>That kind of subsection might be acceptable in this Bill and be an appropriate way of dealing with it.  For a man&mdash;and he is the only person who can say that he has been unfairly dismissed&mdash;to be in a position to wait for six months, with the consequent difficulties and injustice not only for the employer but for the man who may have taken his job, no case can be made for that.  In my view, all the arguments are for making it a shorter period.  The Minister has not made any kind of reasonable case why an employee should be allowed six months before he puts in his claim.  Apparently he is adamant about this, but he is without good reason except that is the figure he has picked and is going to accept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The unions have looked for one period and the employers have looked for another and he has picked something <Col N="603" /> in between.  The lesson there is that people who are concerned in these things should always make outrageous claims and then the Minister will pick something in between the two and feel he has done justice to both parties.  I do not know what the unions asked for. Perhaps they asked for five years and, consequently, only allowing six months seemed very reasonable in the circumstances. It all depends if it is a matter of merely compromising between two suggestions that are made&mdash;and one or perhaps both suggestions are absurd&mdash; and then picking some figure in between the two.  That is not really a sensible or just way of dealing with the situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I should point out to the Senator that it is true that the employers wanted a shorter period and the unions a much longer period, but I should explain that my original proposition to both sides was six months.  In other words, if it was a compromise, we were the originators of the compromise.  We did not come after the event and say we would split the difference.  It was our proposal at the start and it was mainly based on our feelings that the Bill should, if possible, augment existing domestic grievance procedures.  There are existing procedures up and down the country in many industries.  In a dismissal case of this kind there are steps laid down in many industries which work very successfully in many cases.</P>
      <P>It is conceivable that, in a case of this kind where there is this domestic grievance procedure existing in a firm an employee in good faith might spend something like three months attempting to resolve a problem at that level. It is conceivable that an employee, even knowing of the existence of legislation, might put all his faith in resolution at that level and in the end might be dissatisfied and feel he should have invoked the provisions of this legislation.</P>

      <P>We would have the difficulty of uniformity, the difficulty of scrutiny of the existing procedures. There is an immense variety of them up and down the country.  I should add that as soon as this legislation is through I hope to begin discussions to try to bring greater uniformity into these varying domestic procedures.  As far as we are concerned it would bring us into the whole twilight area of adjudication on the relative merits of existing domestic procedures.  The practical point we were anxious to meet was that a person should have a reasonable period in which appeals could be made.  I referred to the experience of the redundancy legislation, under which originally 30 weeks was the period of recall and now it is up to two years. That is under legislation I had nothing to do with it, but it was legislation that answered the circumstances in which people did not know their rights and in many cases did not make appeals in time.  It was necessary for Ministers of Labour before me to amend that legislation and to allow an appeal up to two years.  It would seem, therefore, that a six-months' recall is not unrealistic when the other legislation allows recall up to a period of two years.  In that case we are talking simply about amounts of money due to a person in a redundancy situation.  Here we are talking about a person losing his or her job. I am sorry Senators are unconvinced by my arguments but I believe six months is the common-sense period.</P>

      <P>Even accepting the Minister's reasoning on this, that he wants to allow domestic grievance procedures to act, the fact of availing of those would be accepted as a notice of intent.  What I am concerned with is the case where an employee who is dismissed disappears and just an hour before the six-months' period elapses he hands in a claim for unjust dismissal. That is very wrong and I cannot see why the Minister cannot prevent such an occurrence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the difficulties in getting a proper period of time.  Senators Quinlan and Ryan referred to a type of case that is certainly not covered and is going to present enormous difficulties due to the length of time.  It is the type of dismissal which is not covered by grievance procedures at all.  I am all for these matters being dealt with <i>ad hoc</i> through grievance procedures or as quickly as possible.  That sort of case is all right and is continuing as the Minister said. If the employee does not get satisfaction out of it after three or four months, then he or she can proceed under this Bill.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the case of the <i>ad hoc</i> dismissal.  Take the case of a slagging match on a building site or a factory floor between a foreman and an employee.  Words are used and the employee goes.  As far as the employer and the employee are concerned that is the end of the story but, suddenly, five months later the matter is resurrected.  Everybody concerned with it has forgotten about it and no record has been taken.  Then starts an investigation of this kind under which the onus will be on the manager, foreman or employer concerned to argue out his case as to the fairness of the dismissal.  That is an impossible situation. That type of dismissal is one that can only be dealt with when the facts of the matter are reasonably fresh in everybody's mind.  I see no advantage whatever except to give rise to all sorts of narky, frivolous and fictitious claims.  There is no merit at all in having that type of dismissal held over for five or six months in which a claim is put in under this Bill and the whole procedure starts.  There is no comparison between that and a period with regard to redundancy payments which is a straightforward matter in regard to financial compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are talking here about evidence of a human kind which would have to be adduced and the onus is on the employer to adduce this evidence, in regard to facts and circumstances surrounding a dismissal that may never have been recorded.  That type of situation is going to give rise to this sort of very heavy onus on an employer <Col N="606" /> who has subsequently re-employed a person having forgotten about the whole incident but suddenly finds a claim served on him five or six months after the incident has happened.  I do not see how that represents anything else except a tremendously unfair burden on the employer concerned.  That is not an unlikely situation having regard to what happens at a human level on a factory floor or a building site.</P>
    <P>The Minister is being a bit unreal in thinking that that set of facts will not form a very high proportion of claims under this Bill.  I can see the great majority of legitimate cases being dealt with under ordinary internal procedures of varying kinds, grievance, consultation or works council procedures.  They can be dealt with by all sorts of management-labour consultations or the ordinary muscle of the trade unions.  There are so many ways in which legitimate grievances can be settled in the ordinary course of events through the procedures I have mentioned, but what we are giving rise to here is the oddball type of action that will be taken by the fellow who was told in bad language to clear away.  Five months later he hops a claim with regard to unfair dismissal on to the employer's desk.  That is obviously a case that should be dealt with quickly, and certainly the employer should have some notice of the intention if the fellow feels strongly after the slagging match with the employer, manager, foreman or ganger.  The least he or she might do is give some fulfilment to their bad humour, disappointment or frustration by hopping in a letter or notice, within a fortnight as suggested by Senator Quinlan, so that at least the manager, owner or employer is aware of the fact that the person feels aggrieved and he or she can put down on paper the employer's, manager's or foreman's version of what happened and have that note in the event of a claim being proceeded with by the employee.</P>
    <P>I am impressed by Senator Quinlan's amendment.  Without that sort of notice within a fortnight the employer is going to promptly forget about the matter.  &ldquo;John Daly&rdquo; in his garage in <Col N="607" /> Killarney will certainly have forgotten about the mechanic he had a row with who disappeared six months earlier and he would not have any cause to take a note of the facts surrounding that matter unless he has notice of it within a fortnight.  If he gets such notice he can take a note of the facts because there might be a claim.  When the claim is proceeded with he has a basis on which he can remove the onus of unfair dismissal.  He can say he took a note at the time after getting notice from the employee and give his recollection of what happened.  He is not going to have any recollection of what happened if the first notice he gets of this matter is six months after it happened.</P>

      <P>The only point is that these jovial autocrats of Senator Lenihan's imagination, who fire people before dinner and may fire three or four more in a bit of overtime at night, whose memories of these dire events are recalled on the back of postage stamps or wherever else they may write the trivia of somebody being dismissed, these people must be brought to heel as quickly as possible. They certainly cannot be said to be assisting the climate of industrial relations. Presumably, their victims go on to other jobs at some stage and join trade unions and will add to the general bank of despair and antagonism which exists in certain quarters towards employers.  If there are such, and presumably there are a small number who might conform to the descriptions of the Senator, I hope that once this Bill becomes law such employers will drop these rather casual ways as quickly as possible.  If they do not, they are going to be in trouble under the provisions of the Bill.</P>

      <P>It is a two-way traffic, except that there is a certain onus on the shoulders of the employer who initiates an action or says to an employee &ldquo;You are no longer any good in that job which you have been in for years, you are out&rdquo;.  We believe under this Bill that that decision should impose upon the employer certain <Col N="608" /> obligations in relation to rationalising that decision.  Senator Quinlan's amendment would not have any of these provisions applying to an employee in whatever circumstances who did not fill in a form within 14 days.  By not complying with the 14-day provision none of the sections would apply.</P>
      <P>Let us take the case of an employee who does not read a great deal and who has been accustomed for many years to taking a lot of abuse.  I am sure there is not a Senator or a Deputy who has not come up against the employee who has been fired.  The Senator or Deputy, meeting that constituent in a weekly clinic, would say to that person: &ldquo;I am sorry, there is no legal remedy I can advise you of. Are you a member of a trade union?&rdquo; If it then comes out that that person is not a member of a trade union, the Senator or Deputy must say there is nothing he can do.  If we were to accept Senator Quinlan's amendment, then we would have to say to that person: &ldquo;I am sorry.  The requirement is 15 days.  It is over the 14 days; there is nothing we can do.  All the sections of this ambitious Bill do not apply to you because you should have known before now that you should have made application before 14 days.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The suggestion is that there should be a six-month period allowed in which persons would have a chance to catch up on their rights if they were ignorant of them.  Is it not also part of the virtue of the six-month period that a person might decide that he or she might not have a case?  There is the nark and the other side.  There is the person who might have felt he had a case last week and this week considers the matter with a union official and accepts that he had no case.  If a person was required to apply in a matter of days we could have the whole system choked with the ridiculous cases the Senator is worried about.  I believe that the six-month period is not unduly long.  It is not, on the other hand, too short and is the fairest compromise.</P>

      <P>There are a number of questions I should like to ask the Minister.  I note that in section 10 (1) the right to institute and carry on proceedings in the Circuit Court is confined to the Minister.  I appreciate the reasons for this.  The Minister is anxious to ensure that there will be no vexatious litigation by persons who may have been ruled against both by a rights commissioner and by a tribunal.  He is also concerned about the consequences of litigation by a person with no means which might create a situation in which judgment and costs might be given against the person making the claim and he would have no funds to meet them.</P>
      <P>Is it wise to rule out completely the right of the person concerned to appeal to the Circuit Court?  We may have little or no worries about the present Minister but this also refers to future Ministers.  There may be future Ministers who would take a very conservative view of applying to the Circuit Court on behalf of any person who may or may not have been wrongly dismissed.  If they do take too conservative a view it is likely that people may be done out of their rights, rights which would have been affirmed and established in a court of law if the Minister had taken action.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister entirely satisfied with the situation in which he alone has the right to go to the Circuit Court on behalf of a person who claims to have been unfairly dismissed?  There are further consequences from this <Col N="611" /> which relate to other sections, such as the costs of proceedings, legal aid and so on.</P>

      <P>There is no way out of that problem.  The Minister is the only person who can take these proceedings.  Does the Senator wish some further provision to be included in that section?  The ministerial initiative is governed by facts outlined in the Bill.  Granted the point that an element of interpretation is open to the holder of office at the time, it is pretty clearly laid down what the circumstances are in which there is reference to the courts by the Minister of the day.</P>

      <P>Is it not an unfortunate consequence of this subsection that, in the case of a worker who thinks he has been wrongly dismissed and on whose behalf the Minister is not making an appeal to the Circuit Court, that person is also, by virtue of this Bill, prevented from taking civil proceedings for wrongful dismissal?  In this kind of situation the person does not seem to have any remedy at all, even at his own expense.</P>

      <P>Under section 10 (2) there is a problem in a case where a court may decide that the appropriate redress is reinstatement.  Is the Minister happy that the courts can and will operate such a personal procedure as reinstatement, which involves instructing employers to re-employ certain people on identical conditions and terms as they were employed beforehand and not to discriminate against them in any way?  Is the Minister happy that this is practicable?</P>

      <P>I thought it useful that that possibility should be there, even at that level.  I know the Senator is aware also of this controversy whether under our existing Constitution these rights are there.  We are assuming they are.  We have been advised that it is covered.</P>

      <Col N="612" /> SECTION 14.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 14 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 14 (1) lays down that an employer shall give notice in writing of dismissal procedures to an employee within 28 days of the employee entering his employment.  I would have thought that the dismissal procedures are so important that they should have been made known to every employee at the time he takes up his employment.  Twenty-six or 27 days after he has taken up his employment the details of the dismissal procedures will be of purely academic interest to him.  He will not have had an opportunity of making up his mind on the basis of those procedures before actually agreeing to take up the employment.  Would the Minister not agree that this should be done, that employers should be required to give notice of dismissal procedures at the time at which they are actually employing somebody</P>
      <P>The second point is in relation to section 14 (4), which makes it obligatory for an employer to give written grounds for dismissal to an employee within 14 days, only if so requested.  I would have thought that the action of taking away a man's job and his livelihood should carry with it a positive requirement to give a written reason for a dismissal.</P>

      <P>The first section was discussed with both sides.  The union side were happy enough with the 28-day clause because there are practical problems here.  At any rate unions are not unhappy with the provision of 28 days.  They do not see it as an obstacle to acceptance.  An employer could say, quite justifiably, that this is providing a further obligation under this Bill, under which he might claim he has too many obligations already.  One might say fairly that such obligations as there are should be complied with in any case, irrespective of legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quite satisfied about the 28 days.  It is a practical necessity to give that period.  This Bill has been criticised by many employer interests as being <Col N="613" /> excessively onerous for employers. Even as put here in section 14 (4) many employers object to the requirement that the reasons should be given in writing.  I believe that this meets the case here.  I would not honestly seek to tighten it at that point.  There is the provision here that the employer shall, if so requested, furnish to the employee within 14 days of the request, particulars in writing of the grounds for the dismissal.  Remember that if the employee proceeds to act under this Bill, reasons for dismissal must be furnished in any case.  This is simply a provision that would apply in all other cases.</P>

    <P>Government amendment No. 9:</P>
    <P>In page 12, after line 40, to insert the following subsection:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(4)  A person who accepts redress awarded under section 9 or 10 of the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974, in respect of any dismissal shall not be entitled to accept redress awarded under section 7 of this Act in respect of that dismissal and a person who accepts redress awarded under the said section 7 in respect of any dismissal shall not be entitled to accept redress awarded under the said section 9 or 10 in respect of that dismissal.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>These are provisions concerning dismissal under certain circumstances in the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act.  It is possible that an employee might decide to make claims under both that Act and this Bill.  I do not wish to interfere in the employee's choice, but this amendment is intended to avoid the possibility of duplicating awards in respect of the same dismissal and is simply to avoid confusion.  This is an uncontroversial amendment.</P>

      <P>I should just like to ask a question.  As I understand section 15, it tends to force the employee to make a decision between strategies of action.  In other words, if he takes the common law action he will not be entitled to invoke procedures under this Bill and if he invokes procedures under this Bill he will not be entitled to take a common law action.  Is that the intention?</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Minister.  Is it wise to present an option such as this?  I can think of a situation where, for example, in other kinds of law, such as in a case of injuries, the exercise of one option does not preclude the exercise of another option.  I can think of a situation where, for example, there is a question of damages, and the fact that to initiate one course of action would preclude one from the other would be a limitation in terms of redress to the employee.  I am thinking particularly of a certain category of employee.  I should like the Minister to convince me a little more that it is necessary to limit the employee's options in this way.</P>

      <P>We are providing adjudication machinery at tribunal level and at Labour Court level paid for by the taxpayer.  I think it is a fair enough bargain that, if someone decides to take one course, he had better abide by it.  We do not want a person deserting one course of action in midstream by saying he is dissatisfied with the service at this point and he takes himself off to the courts.  The person has to make a choice as to which road he wishes to take.  If he has any sense he will take this road, which is an advance on the common law position.</P>
