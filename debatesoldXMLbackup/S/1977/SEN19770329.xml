      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 1 and 2 in that order.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose that we take No. 5 first and then Nos. 1 and 2 on the grounds that the Family Planning Bill, which was introduced as far back as 1974, is still hanging fire.  Subsequent developments have shown our legal situation to be seriously in conflict with our Constitution.  I make my proposal in view also of the fact that five weeks ago we were promised by the Tánaiste that a joint committee would be set up and a joint front put forward to the Irish people on this extremely important, urgent and constitutionally serious issue.  Nothing, as far as we can see, has happened.  The story seems to be that the letter sent out by the Tánaiste in relation to this issue has not yet received an answer from the major party of the Coalition, Fine Gael.  I do so also on the grounds that this situation as it stands creates a state of embarrassment, scandal, legal and constitutional disgrace within the society.  The people of Ireland demand immediate and urgent action on this.  If the present situation is allowed to persist a general election will take place and a Government will have run their entire course without having taken action on an issue which has been so long and urgently in front of the Irish people.  Therefore, I argue that the situation at the moment is one of such crisis, of such governmental dislocation and of such critical concern to the entire conscience and, indeed, the self-respect of the Irish people, to say <Col N="452" /> nothing of their Parliament and legislators, that it would be ludicrous to take a Bill as comparatively peripheral to the central issues of conscience involved in the Family Planning Bill as the one that stands now first on the Order of Business.  On all these grounds I argue in the strongest possible way that the Order of Business for today should be reorganised along the lines I suggest and that the Family Planning Bill be given the salience, prominence and priority it deserves in today's proceedings in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Martin's amendment to the Order of Business, that item No. 5 should take precedence over items Nos. 1 and 2. The order should read Nos. 5, 1 and 2.  We are in the middle of the Second Stage debate on item No. 5.  This debate was adjourned as a result of an initiative by the Tánaiste and Minister for Health, Deputy Corish.  As the House knows, the Independent members have been trying to get this debate concluded since that initiative took place.  I wish to quote from Deputy Corish's speech in which he made the initiative because the order of events is important.  He states at column 95 of the Seanad Official Report of 9th of February, 1977:</P>
      <P>Accordingly, I propose that the three main parties should consult with each other in a sincere and genuine attempt to discover if agreement is possible on a new law concerning the availability of contraceptives in this country.  I have given this proposition a great deal of personal thought and I am convinced there is no other avenue of approach with any prospect of success in the near future.  I am also convinced that the initial consultation between parties should be on an informal basis so as to ensure the maximum degree of mutual trust and so as to eliminate whatever temptation there might be to reduce the matter to one of party politics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Seven weeks later there is no sign of this debate being concluded.  This is becoming a matter for discussion in the public Press and a matter of disgrace to this House: that we cannot <Col N="453" /> simply and effectively deal with the debate, have a vote, and if the vote is successful let the Bill go to the next Stage.  If the vote is unsuccessful that is the end.</P>
    <P>Seven weeks after that statement, with a general election looming up, my belief is that this initiative is being used as a whitewash, because none of the parties wishes to vote on this.  I want to ensure that this issue is resolved before the general election.  It has gone on too far and is becoming a joke.  The initiative of Deputy Corish took place on 9th February.  I raised the matter, with Senator Noel Browne, on 9th March.  I raised it again on 15th March and Senator Robinson, in reply&mdash;I quote from column 193 of the Seanad Official Report&mdash;said:</P>
    <P>It is my understanding that the process which the Tánaiste and Leader of the Labour Party described when he was speaking on the Second Stage of this Bill in the House&mdash;the process of consulting the other two parties&mdash;has not yet been completed.  Until that time I would not like the Bill itself to be pressed.  But when that process is completed and if it does not show a satisfactory result, then I think it would be appropriate to seek a date for a further debate of this Bill.</P>
    <P>There was no sign last week that this process of consultation had been completed. Senator Browne and I raised the issue and we got no satisfaction. There is no sign that the consultations have been completed and, therefore, no sign that the Bill is going to be completed.  The parties are using this so called consultation just to ensure that there will not be a vote on the Family Planning Bill before the election. This could be the last week this House will meet before the election. This suits all the parties.  If the parties disagree let them say so, but in my view it suits them that there should be no further debate and, certainly, no vote on this issue.</P>
    <P>Fortunately for this House, there are still a few Independents who can get up and say that what the parties think is good for them is not good for this House and is certainly not good <Col N="454" /> for the nation.  It does not increase the average citizen's faith in democracy, the citizen Senator Martin described, in an emotive moment, as the man on the Rathgar tram or omnibus.  What does the average citizen think of this sort of thing.  That has been commented on by the Press.  In the edition of <i>The Sunday Press</i>, March 27th, the following comment was made by Mr. A.M. Duffy in an article&mdash;not a very complimentary one to Senator Robinson&mdash;which described her as keeping her seat by not rocking the boat.  The article stated that so embarrased were Fine Gael by Deputy Corish's initiative that at one stage officers of the party, men like Deputy Percy Dockrell and Deputy John L. Sullivan, kept hopping the ball between them, each refusing to pick it up.</P>
    <P>As far as I know it, the situation as it stands concerning this initiative which is holding up this debate, is that the Fianna Fáil group in the Seanad and the Fianna Fáil Party as a whole replied to Deputy Corish's initiative, but it is unhelpful.  Their attitude it totally wrong, but at least we know what it is.  We have got a reply.  There is no argument whatever for abstaining on this Bill.  As far as one can ascertain the Labour Party have replied favourably to Deputy Corish's initiative&mdash;it would be strange if it did not, seeing that he is the leader of the party.  But, seven weeks after the initiative took place, there is no reply from the Fine Gael Party.  This is becoming a whitewash; it is a con job, we are all being conned.  It is just as well there are a few people who can get up and say this.</P>
    <P>I should like to say to the Labour Party that they are putting two of the sponsors of this Bill, Senator Robinson and Senator Horgan in an absolutely impossible position.  Who would disagree that if Senator Robinson was still on this side she would be out doing exactly the job I am trying to do.  She did it with the previous Government and with this Government.  She pressed for this debate to take place.  She pressed for a debate on the previous Family Planning Bills to take place and now she has to sit there keeping her mouth shut and the Labour Party <Col N="455" /> are effectively hiding behind her and Senator Horgan.  The thing has become absolutely preposterous.  It is clearly a fact that the parties do not want this. They just want it swept under the carpet.  They do not want to know. There is an election coming off and everybody thinks that this issue loses them votes.  It is just as well that there are a few Independents who can get up and say something that may not appeal to the parties, that we want to have a vote on this issue.  The whole business is bringing this House and our democratic system into disrepute.  It is Government by delay.  The greatest trick in Government is to put things off when one does not like them.</P>
    <P>I ask for support on this issue.  I want the parties to say where they stand. Senator Lenihan has said he would say where his stands.  Let Fine Gael and Labour say where they stand.  Where does Labour stand?  On two previous occasions we asked for an amendment of the Order of Business.  There is no reason why the Order of Business should not be amended.  This initiative will never be concluded.  In my belief the Fine Gael Party will never reply to the letter.  It suits them not to.  It suits them fine to have it swept under the carpet.  It has gone far enough.  Where do the Labour Party stand?  I know where Fine Gael stand.  They do not support this, nor do they support the Family Planning Bill.  Where do the Labour Party stand?  What are they going to do?  Are they going to appear continually to the general public as if they do not support this call by the Independent Members, which, if one extrapolates a bit, means that they really do not want to know about contraception. It is going to lose them votes; they are not interested.  Let us hear them.</P>
    <P>The Independents are continually in a weak position in this House.  There are three of us here; we have lost two to the Labour Party&mdash;two of the most vociferous people in favour of this Bill who continually pressed to have it taken.  Everybody can see that the initiative is gone, it is a dead duck.  We do not need any replies from any of the parties any more because everybody knows what the replies will be. <Col N="456" /> However, at least two of them have had the courtesy to reply.  If the Tánaiste took his initiative seriously he could have spoken to the chairman of the Fine Gael Party, whom he must meet three days every week in the corridors of Leinster House, and obtained the Fine Gael reply.  All he has to do is put a word in somebody's ear and something would be done.  As an Independent.  I am fed up with the whole business.  I want to get this debate concluded and I want people to support, to say where they stand on this issue.  Let us have a vote and get the Second Stage debate out of the way.  Let us face the facts, let the people see where their public representatives stand before the election comes off.</P>

      <P>Senator Robinson, who is not here today, has been referred to as being a person who has to sit down silently and say nothing because she is a member of the Labour Party.  I do not want to debate what has been said; I only wish to answer this point.  Senator Robinson has not, in fact, sat down and said nothing.  Senator Robinson, no later than this morning, corresponded with me.  She is not able to be here today.  She is not sitting silent about this matter and until such time as I get an opportunity of discussing with her the next step, there is nothing more I can do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I regard this as a fundamental matter of democratic debate in a free parliament.  Apart from the merits or demerits of the Bill it is on the Order Paper and it has already had considerable debate.  It surely takes from the authority of this Assembly to engage in an obvious manoeuvre to postpone debate on a very fundamental matter that is agitating the minds of many of our people.  It is this aspect, in my view, that has got the Seanad and the whole parliamentary institutions of the State into disrepute.  There is no reason why we should not proceed with the debate, have our vote and show ourselves as a responsible democratic Assembly in that way.  I want to make the Fianna Fáil position clear on this matter.  One of the urgent and immediate tasks we <Col N="457" /> will undertake, if elected to Government by the people in the next general election, will be the introduction of a Bill to regularise the situation in regard to the free wholesale and uninterrupted importation of contraceptives. We will introduce legislation to deal with family planning.  That is a commitment which has been given by the Leader of our party and which I reiterate.  We regard that as a basic and urgent task on achieving Government, to bring in such a Bill to regularise the whole chaotic position in regard to family planning that exists.  When that happens, we will see a full party&mdash;there is this much to be said for proper party Government&mdash; including the Taoiseach and Leader of the party going through the lobby to support a Bill that has been agreed by the Government in order to regularise the position I am talking about.  There will be no question of any defections on that occasion.  On that occasion every member of the Fianna Fáil Party in the Dáil and the Seanad will support whatever Bill is required in the public interest to regularise the position in regard to family planning and the importation of contraceptives. Every member, including the Taoiseach, the Leader of the party, will be in attendance in the lobby to vote for the measure agreed by the Government and the Parliamentary Party. That is our position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We believe fundamentally in government. It is the Government's duty to implement such legislation.  This Government have fallen down on their duty.  We say, as a commitment, that we will not fall down on that duty if and when the people make their decision to give us the task of bringing in at least some elementary social legislation necessary to rectify a chaotic state of affairs that exists at present. In the meantime, pending that situation, I believe the democratic process should continue and this debate should not be left aside and discarded.  We should continue with the debate.  I support the point of view presented by Senators Martin and West that we should have this measure on the Order Paper and that it should not be consigned to the wastepaper basket until <Col N="458" /> people with responsibility are in Government to deal with this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must take with a pinch of salt Senator Lenihan's worry that any further delay in this admittedly important matter would bring the House into disrepute and bring the whole processes of democratic debate and discussion into disrepute, because I have been involved with this matter since 1969 whereas now we are talking about a matter of delay of a period of seven or eight weeks.  I was on the other side of the House in 1969 when for a period of no less than three years the party of which Senator Lenihan is an adornment refused permission even for the printing of a Bill on this subject let alone its discussion, let alone the conclusion of a Second Stage debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I also listened with interest to the remarks of Senator Martin and many of his sentiments I would share.  I can only express my regret that he did not make these sentiments any part of his appeal to the electorate in 1973.  I also listened with interest to what Senator West said.  Of all people Senator West cannot be accused of opportunism on this issue, but there are a number of questions of fact which should be clarified.  The first of these is about the method of consultation involved in the initiative proposed by the Leader of the Labour Party.  Under the method of consultation proposed by him the Leaders of the other two parties were not to report to this House but to him.  In other words, he had no conrol over the timing of their response to his initiative.  I can assure Senator West, and the House, that there has been no ready-up between the parties on this issue.  To the best of my knowledge&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;neither of the other two parties in this House were aware of the Minister's initiative before he made it.  They have responded to it, or not responded to it, in their own good time, or bad time.  Any delay in replying to this initiative must be laid at the door of the parties concerned and not at the door of the person who made this important initiative.  I understand that responses actually have been made to this initiative by each of the other two parties.  I only understand this informally; I have not been in contact with the Leader of my party but I gather, at least from the newspapers, that this has happened.  I have no doubt that the Leader of the party will in due course, communicate these responses to the party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the Leader of the Labour Party.  I have no doubt that these responses, assuming they have reached the Leader of the Labour Party, will be communicated by him in due course to the party of which he is a member and, indeed, also the Leader.  I have no doubt that the decision that will be arrived at in that context will be the appropriate one.  I can assure the House that the Labour Party have a mind of its own on this issue and it is a mind to which Senator Robinson and myself have and will continue to contribute.  Perhaps the only point at all on which I would take issue is where he asks, where does the Labour Party stand on this issue?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of us who have been any length of time in politics believed that the so-called &ldquo;Corish initiative&rdquo; of seven or eight weeks ago was, indeed, a rather sordid and cynical political trick devised simply to defer any finality about the discussion of this Bill in the Seanad.  The Fianna Fáil Party had made their position completely clear, re-emphasised by Senator Lenihan again today, that they intend to bring in a Bill which will be voted unanimously on by the party, including the Taoiseach.  The suggestion that the Tánaiste, the Deputy Prime Minister, working in coalition with the Fine Gael Party did not know at the time he made this proposal what their response would be to it, is such an absurd, ludicrous suggestion that I find it very difficult to understand or believe that two Independent Senators, Senator Horgan and Senator Robinson, seriously believed that it had any&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;serious intent.  We now know that Fianna Fáil have repeated what they said they would do and we know from today's press that the Fine Gael Party have gone back even from the position they took up before and do not wish to have any discussion.  At least they divided on this issue before and we had the shameful position of the leader of the country, the Taoiseach, going into the lobbies against his own Minister's Bill. At least that was an advance on what is apparently the present position, that Fine Gael does not want any discussion of the contraception issue before the coming general election because they are frightened of even discussing the issue in the coming general election. Is this the kind of party which deserves the support of the community, a party given the power and authority to govern and yet frightened to do so? This is a unique issue&mdash;contraception, the family planning issue&mdash;because, unlike the other issues on which we have listened to the Labour spokesmen over the past three or four years apologise for their failures in practically every regard and giving as their <Col N="461" /> excuse that it is due to either the Arab oil crisis or the world financial crisis, this has nothing to do with either.</P>
      <P>This is a simple demonstration of the reality of the total impotence of the Labour Party within the present Coalition and could not be better demonstrated.  It is worse than that because, as Senator Horgan rightly pointed out many years ago, a long time ago, we in conference in the Labour Party gave to our Leader, Deputy Corish, the authority to put this forward and implement it as Labour Party policy.  He, luckily for him, became Minister for Health with all that power and authority.  Because he was afraid to implement it he devised what I consider to be a completely sordid and cynical device in order to defer any final decision on the matter.  He knew as well as we that Fianna Fáil would not in the circumstances collaborate.  He knew as well as we that Fine Gael would not collaborate.</P>
      <P>The two Independent Senators who were elected as Independent Senators must now know that they have no defence whatever but to honour their responsibilities to the independent constituency which elected them&mdash;on the one hand, Trinity College, and on the other hand, the National University&mdash; and to act as Independents in this Seanad.  I question the possibility that there is even a precedent for a political party imposing the party Whip on Independent Senators, thus effectively disenfranchising the constituency which elected these Senators in order that they might purloin two or more Senators, when they could not elect them in the ordinary way, to carry out Labour Party policy or Fine Gael policy or Fianna Fáil policy.</P>

      <P>Senator Harte, speaking for the Labour Party&mdash;each of them hiding behind the other&mdash;is now hiding behind the unhappy Senator Mary Robinson, for whom I have the deepest respect as a Senator and who has fought very hard indeed in her days as an Independent.  He tells us that because he cannot have a discussion on the telephone clearing up the issue as to whether the Labour Party will or will not support us in this our attempt to have this matter discussed now, we must wait until she is in a position to complete discussions &mdash;when or how he does not tell us&mdash;before we are allowed to discuss this very serious issue here in Seanad Éireann.</P>
      <P>As Senator West pointed out, this may be the last time that the Seanad will be given an opportunity of discussing this Bill.  Now we must wait not just for the Tanáiste, who has the power to introduce a family planning service anyway and will not do it, but it appears we have to wait until Senator Mary Robinson is in a position to come into the House and tell us how she feels about the Labour Party's right or authority or decision as to whether they should or should not support this Bill.  Surely this whole matter, Sir, if it were not so serious in its implications for the mothers and families of Ireland, would amount to the most total example of high farce that we have ever had in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an issue which we all know has repercussions outside this House. This is an issue about which the Oireachtas, both the Dáil and the Seanad, should think very carefully before they decide finally.  Coming up to a general election, when matters of great importance must be discussed, they must show not just to this House &mdash;we have grown used to cynicism here&mdash;or to the Dáil but to the people north of the Border that this is an issue.  The issue of family planning is a simple humanitarian need for the people in our society, an issue bound up in the whole question of minority and majority rights.  This is <Col N="463" /> an issue which the Oireachtas is too frightened to talk about.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Each week on the Order of Business we tend to have a family planning semi-debate from our colleagues representing the Independent seats in the House.  They feel that this is the only opportunity they have of trying to get this legislation debated and voted upon and they make use of this time to try to have it taken.  I would seriously question their credibility in this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not interrupt Senator West.  The credibility in this matter was the initiative shown by the Tánaiste, Leader of the Labour Party and Minister for Health, in starting discussions with the three main political parties involved in the Government of this country.  Surely the gentlemen on my left, who have more experience in this House than I have, are not so naive as to think for one moment that legislation in this field particularly, bearing in mind past history, has anything other than a snowball's chance in hell of getting through any House of the Oireachtas without consultation.</P>
      <P>I am not hiding behind my Whip. I am not hiding behind Senator Mary Robinson, who is well able to defend herself.  I have already contributed to this Bill and I have laid it on the line where I would vote and where I would like to see amendments.  On general principle, I think this Bill should succeed.  The reason the consultations are going on and the reason it would not be voted by us as No. 1 on the Order of Business is this: as it stands now without agreement the Bill would be defeated.  I have a vague suspicion that Senator Browne, who last week called us Pontius Pilates, would like to see it defeated.  We would like to see the Bill, or an amended Bill, succeed.  That is the reason for consultation.</P>

      <P>The only reason that the matter has not been moved forward is that consultations have not <Col N="464" /> been completed.  It is not a Government Bill; it is not a Fine Gael Bill and it is not a Labour Bill.  It certainly is not a Fianna Fáil Bill because when they had the opportunity some time ago they left it on the Order Paper. Senator Lenihan has promised that when they are in Government they will govern and will put a Bill before the House.  Live horse and you will get grass, I say.  If there had been a free vote of conscience in the other House on a previous occasion, there is no doubt that the Bill at that time would have got through, but the Opposition opposed everything.  They sniggered today when a remark was passed about us hiding behind one another's backs and all this kind of thing.</P>
      <P>Most members of this party have spoken out in favour of legislation of this kind or an amended Bill.  Most of them are on the record as contributors to this debate and I think there should be no doubt in anyone's mind where we stand on it.  We would hope that the consultations would be successful.  Senator Robinson, as the initiator of this Private Members' Bill, has given a commitment that as soon as the negotiations are completed she will be pressing for the Bill to be taken.</P>

      <P>Anyone who was here for the discussion on the Order of Business for the last few meetings of the Seanad will at least <Col N="465" /> concede that, when this matter was raised, on no occasion did I kick for touch.  I have made it quite clear, and I make it clear again today, that this is a matter for the House to decide, a matter which the House is entitled to decide; and the right of the House to decide that question or any question on the Order of Business will not be filched from the House by three Independent Senators or by anyone else.

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one thing I would like Senator West to bear in mind&mdash;I think it is important for the dignity of Parliament as a whole, for the dignity of this House and for the dignity of every Senator in this House&mdash;and that is that the time has come when all of us should be courageous enough to say that we will not be led by the nose in taking our decisions here by press comment or by headlines in the newspapers. Very much play was made by Senator West and Senator Martin of the fact that this matter was hitting the newspaper headlines and that there was newspaper comment.  I am long enough in politics to be able to take newspaper comment and shrug it off. I do not regard it as any part of the business of this House to allow itself to be led by the nose or over-influenced by newspaper comment.</P>
      <P>As regards Senator Lenihan, I take it I am not saying this facetiously&mdash; that he is quite sincere in his approach to the question that has been posed by Senator Martin's amendment.  He will have his opportunity of supporting it.  His party have had the opportunity of supporting it on the last two occasions on which the Seanad met. I made the position quite clear from my point of view and from the point of view of the Fine Gael Party.  It is a matter for the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No member of the Fine Gael Party is obliged to vote one way or the other.  I am proud of the fact that, from the Taoiseach down, no member of my party is required to give his <Col N="466" /> conscience into the custody of the Party Whip and I would not take pride in a situation where people taunt a man of the character and calibre of the present Taoiseach because he is prepared to be guided by his conscience.  This is essentially a matter where people should be allowed freedom and be uncontrolled by the Party Whip.  Rather than taunting and jibing at the Taoiseach for the decision he took and the vote he cast in the Dáil I think we should be big enough to recognise his courage and his intergrity in voting as he did.  Whether we agree with that vote or not, I think it is very small, particularly when the Taoiseach is not here to reply, that attacks of that sort should be made.</P>
    <P>I think it is very small also that attacks such as have been heard in this House today should have been made on the Tánaiste, and particularly that those attacks should have been made by a former colleague of the Tánaiste.  That former colleague is also a former member of Fianna Fáil, a former member of Clann na Poblachta and a former member, I think, of the National Progressive Democrats.</P>
    <P>Maybe Senator West and Senator Martin will learn this from the experience of Senator Browne.  It is very easy to be an Independent.  It is very easy to throw off the responsibilities of parties and do as you like as an Independent.  But remember that those of us who take pride in serving in the political sphere as members of a party recognise that we also have certain responsibilities.  We recognise that we have responsibilities to our own colleagues to discuss with them and to come as far as we can to a consensus.  It is easy to stand up here like a jack-in-the-box every time the Seanad meets and pose questions. It is easy to drop out of one party after another and get back into an independent position.  It is easy, having done that, to make the kind of attack that was made on the Leader of the Labour Party here today.</P>
    <P>I am not accustomed to blowing my own trumpet in politics or anywhere else but one thing I can say is that throughout the entire discussion on this question of family planning I <Col N="467" /> have consistently and deliberately given credit to every person who took part in the discussion as talking sincerely. I never questioned anybody's motives and I certainly would resent, particularly when he is not here, an attack on the Tánaiste as engaging in &ldquo;a sordid and cynical political device&rdquo;. I think that is the phrase that was used.  I say that as a person who, whenever we vote on this Bill, will vote against it and will vote against the proposition put up by the Tánaiste's colleagues in the Labour Party.  But certainly I do not doubt the Tánaiste's sincerity.  I do not doubt the motives of the proposers of the Bill nor, indeed, do I doubt the motives of Senator Browne or Senator West or Senator Martin in their support for the Bill and in their desire to have a vote. Senator Browne, in particular, is long enough in the tooth in politics to have the same respect for those who oppose him in this matter.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary) Michael O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>In recent years developments about worker participation have been gathering momentum throughout the industrialised world but especially in Western Europe.  In France the report of the Government-appointed <Col N="469" /> Sudreau Committee on Company Reform was published recommending radical changes in company law and company structure.  The EEC published its Green Paper outlining tentative proposals about employee participation and company structure on a Community-wide basis.  In Germany co-determination in decision-making was extended to companies with over 2,000 employees.  In January this year the Bullock Committee, appointed by the British Government, published their recommendations on industrial democracy.</P>
      <P>It is not too difficult to identify the factors which have given rise to the mounting concern about company structure and the related question of worker participation.  Apart from the more basic reasons such as the democratisation of the workplace and the humanisation of working conditions, the recent experience of a worldwide recession has exposed the serious limitations of economic liberalism as regards curbing inflation or reducing unemployment.  Indeed, the recession has given greater urgency to the search for another system of economic and social development that will combine efficiency and freedom for the citizen.</P>
      <P>In that quest inevitably the role of industrial and commercial enterprises, as institutions of strategic importance in relation to a country's economic and social system, had to be looked at and assessed.  However a justification for company reform should be sought less, perhaps, in its operational deficiencies than in developments and trends occurring in society itself. Quite simply, because a response has to be found to the rapid and profound changes that are now taking place in all industrial societies, the enterprise cannot expect to remain immune or out of step with new ideas and events. As a sub-group of the economic and social system, the enterprise cannot escape the latter's general logic of change.  Indeed, it could be said that the whole question of worker participation and industrial democracy is bound up with the debate about the place of the enterprise in society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The entitlement of workers to participate <Col N="470" /> in company decision-making is based on the emerging concept of the company as a social institution, comprising a variety of interest groups such as shareholders, financiers, management, employees and consumers, each of which is indispensable to its overall welfare and success.  In this light the company is no longer seen as the exclusive property of shareholders: ownership of its physical assets is no longer regarded as conferring an absolute right to exercise control without taking into account other interests such as those of employees or society generally.  The power and complexity of industrial enterprise and the remoteness of decision-making have led to increasing demands for large companies to be more responsive to the needs of society in general and of their employees in particular.</P>
    <P>Traditionally managerial prerogative has rested on property rights. Through direct ownership or through power delegated by shareholders, managers have claimed the right to manage enterprises unilaterally without reference to their employees. Nowadays the justification of managerial prerogative based on property rights is being increasingly questioned and challenged.  The development of a mixed economy with a large public sector has undermined the strength of the case based on private property rights.  Indeed, in large firms the link between ownership and control is now so tenuous that the property argument is decisively weakened.  However, it would be wrong to assume that new concepts of the role of employees in company level decision making are just reactions to economic trends; they also derive from social changes, especially rising standards of education and higher living standards.  The significance of the educational developments is not just that more people have received a basic education; the fact is that the nature of education itself has changed.  Nowadays there is less concentration on formal authoritarian instruction and more encouragement towards the adoption of independent and questioning approaches so as to develop individual initiative and ability.  As a result of improved living <Col N="471" /> standards people's expectations as regards working conditions have also risen and they are less inclined to accept boring and repetitive jobs, inadequate provision for safety and health in their working environment and being isolated from those decisions which can have an important bearing on their livelihood.</P>
    <P>The Worker Participation Bill accepts the principle that employees are entitled as of right to participate in the decision-making of the companies in which they work.  The seven State companies in which the legislation will operate are viewed as organisations of social enterprise in which the contribution of each person, whether he or she works at desk or on shop floor, is considered on its merits.  The assumption underlying the quest for improved participative systems it that the total resources of the company must be harnessed if company objectives are to be attained. For this purpose new mechanisms have to be found whereby workers' knowledge and ideas can make a valuable and positive contribution to the quality of company decisions.  In this way participation should make for greater efficiency and more worth while employment.  In this context management based on the traditional hierarchy principle is increasingly becoming an anachronism as new industrial structures develop.  Industry in the future will tend to be organised increasingly along these lines in this general direction.  The Bill now before the House is designed to provide the framework in the State sector for this evolving situation in industry generally.</P>
    <P>One may ask why State companies were selected for implementation of the proposed legislation.  The reason is that for many years now I have thought that the take-off point for worker participation in Ireland should be in the State sector.  Indeed, as far back as 1968 I advocated the development of forms of industrial democracy in State companies, since it is they which approximate nearest to the ideal of the company as a social enterprise which I have already referred to.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="472" /> State enterprises have already made a substantial and creative contribution to the development of our economy. Unfortunately too often their contribution does not seem to be fully appreciated or recognised as the integral part that it is of the mixed economy which has evolved here.  However State enterprises must not be regarded as some kind of second-best expedient if their full potential is to be secured.  I have always believed that the State companies should be different in their inspiration and management from firms in the private sector.  Many of them have been set up to do jobs in the national interest and, if their pioneering role is to continue, I would like that role to include innovation in the field of industrial relations.  In other words, their traditional economic contribution to the general wellbeing must now be augmented by their adopting a creative role in the development of new and progressive organisational forms.  While the provisions in the proposed legislation are intended to meet the imperatives of work reorganisation which would, in turn, contribute to humanising relations in the work-place, the extension of worker participation as envisaged must also I believe have a beneficial effect on the climate of industrial relations.</P>
    <P>One may speak positively of the achievement of the State companies in economic terms.  Nevertheless, even on the most superficial examination, the conclusion is inescapable that their industrial relations record in many instances reflects to a large extent the same level of confrontation and unrest observable in the private sector.  One may speculate about why this is so, but nobody who is familiar with the background can be in any doubt that the large number of unions organising a relatively small number of workers is a contributory factor.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>While I have already sought to improve this state of affairs through the adoption of the Trade Union Act, 1975, I would hope that the implementation of the proposed legislation will lessen the potential for conflict in a multi-union situation <Col N="473" /> by the substitution of a single electoral list for all workers and thereby create a more favourable climate which will facilitate closer co-operation between the representative bodies.</P>
      <P>The Worker Participation Bill is concerned with worker participation at board level: that is the area where the most important decisions in a company are made.  Apart from defining and articulating general policies set up by the Government, State boards should also be concerned with the evaluation of management performance and with the exercise of strict financial control. For this purpose it is essential that board members should have a strong sense of commitment to community-owned enterprise.  At the same time, if worker participation is to be a meaningful exercise and a positive force in industrial relations, it is essential that it functions at every level of the organisation from the board room to the shop floor.</P>
      <P>In the case of the seven State companies covered by the proposed legislation, now, for the first time in the history of this State, their boards will be reconstituted to provide for the direct representation of employees.  I am convinced that the advent of employees as board members will add a new and fruitful dimension to the functioning of these enterprises as a whole.  Employees can make a positive contribution to their boards' deliberations because they will bring with them a wealth of practical knowledge and experience of their operations, as perceived by workers.  As a result, a new grouping in the trade union leadership will evolve, one which will be well acquainted with the realities of the economic situation in these companies and with the kind of problems with which State boards are confronted from time to time.  The introduction of worker participation in the seven State companies, which have a total employment of 50,000, will have a significant contribution to make in the development of a new State enterprise role and to the creation of a new economic mandate for our State enterprises, leading, I would hope, to the revitalisation of the entire public sector in our mixed economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the preparation of the <Col N="474" /> Bill itself, the House may recall that, before deciding what provisions it should include, I issued a document outlining my ideas and proposals on the legislation.  These proposals were considered by individual trade unions and were the basis for extensive consultation with other interested groups including the Congress of Trade Unions and representatives of management. The provisions in the Bill are those on which there has been a broad measure of agreement.  Indeed, it goes without saying that the full cooperation and support of those concerned is absolutely essential if the measures are to be a success.</P>
    <P>Because of its innovative nature, the Government decided to confine its scope initially to seven companies.  The reason behind this decision was to facilitate a close and effective monitoring of the operation of the scheme in order to discover what lessons might be learned from its practical application and to see whether any changes might be called for in future legislation on the basis of this practical experience. Based on the successful implementation of the proposals it is intended to extend it, by way of further legislation, to other State enterprises.</P>
    <P>I should explain that the seven State bodies to which the Bill applies &mdash;Aer Lingus, Bord na Móna, B &amp; I, The Irish Sugar Company, CIE, ESB and Nítrigin Éireann&mdash;were specially selected because they satisfied certain criteria which would seem to indicate that they offered the best prospects for effecting a successful transition to a more participative form of company structure.  The criteria included a requirement that the company should be engaged in operations of a commercial or quasi-commercial nature involving a medium to fairly high level of technology, coupled with the existence of developed trade union/management relationships, preferably with some experience of joint consultation structures such as works councils.</P>
    <P>It will be noted that while some of the companies involved are relatively compact, others are very geographically dispersed.  This was a deliberate policy decision to ensure that the legislation would be applied on a <Col N="475" /> national scale rather than confining it to traditional industrial centres.</P>
    <P>The operations of the companies concerned include air services, air transportation, peat production, processing, shipping services, sugar manufacture and food processing, rail and road transport, electricity generation and fertiliser production.  In effect, the full range of the country's economic life is represented.  At the same time a very wide range of occupational skills is covered among the 50,000 workers who will be affected by the legislation.</P>
    <P>The primary objective of this Bill is to enable elections to be held in the seven State enterprises, referred to as &ldquo;designated bodies&rdquo; in the Bill and which are listed in the Schedule, so that employees can be selected by and from the workforce for appointment to their boards.  The provisions of the Bill are brought into operation by means of an Order made by the Minister for Labour under section 3 which empowers him to prescribe an &ldquo;appointed day&rdquo; for the purpose of determining &ldquo;election years&rdquo; under section 6.</P>
    <P>For the purposes of the Act &ldquo;election years&rdquo; shall occur in the year in which the Minister makes the first order under section 3 and every successive third year thereafter to coincide with the three-year terms of office of elected directors.  Section 6 requires that not later than the 15th September in each election year the Minister must prescribe by regulations the day for receipt of nominations of candidates. I should like to emphasise however that under section 13, which allows a ballot to be taken among employees, implementation of the legislation can be suspended where a majority of the workers so decide.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides that the secretary of the State enterprise concerned shall act as returning officer for an election or, alternatively, any other person who in his opinion is able to do the job of returning officer and is acceptable to the majority of employees.  Under section 8 the returning officer is required to fix a day called the &ldquo;stated day&rdquo; by reference to which he decides which employees shall be eligible to vote and to stand as candidates.</P>
    <P>Section 9 empowers the Minister for <Col N="476" /> Labour, in consultation with the other Minister concerned and with the designated bodies, to prescribe by regulations the manner in which elections shall be conducted.  In this connection I should like to assure the House that prior to the holding of elections there will be consultations with all the interests concerned, including management and trade unions, in regard to the procedures which should be prescribed for the conduct of elections in each individual State company.  Section 9, subsection (3), provides that where an election is contested&mdash;that is, where the number of candidates exceeds the number of seats&mdash;a poll shall be taken by secret vote according to the principle of proportional representation.  There will be only one electoral list in each State enterprise, comprising the total number of employees eligible to vote. This is provided for under section 9, subsection (4) (w).</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides that every employee who has completed not less than one year's service and who is not under 18 years of age shall be entitled to vote in elections.  Section 11 provides that candidates must be over 18 and under 65 years of age and must have completed at least three years' unbroken service.  I might say at this point that these age and service qualifications have been agreed in consultations.</P>
    <P>Subsection (1) of section 11 provides that only a &ldquo;qualified body&rdquo; shall be entitled to nominate candidates. Subsection (6) states that a qualified body is a trade union or other body recognised by the State enterprise concerned for the purpose of conducting collective bargaining negotiations.  As regards the inclusion of this stipulation may I say that I am convinced that any approach to worker participation must be based on the already existing trade union structures here, especially since the vast majority of employees in the seven State companies are, in fact, organised in trade unions?  To attempt to introduce new forms of representation without the support and co-operation of trade unions would be to ignore one of the basic realities of Irish industrial life.  For that reason I am satisfied that the provisions in <Col N="477" /> the Bill about nominations are the only ones which have any prospect of general acceptability and success.</P>
    <P>Under section 13 I have provided an &ldquo;opting out&rdquo; provision whereby a trade union, or a number of trade unions, representing not less than 15 per cent of employees eligible to vote, may call for a ballot to determine whether or not a majority of the workforce favours holding an election.  This provision is an essential feature of the Act.  It is not my intention to impose industrial democracy on workers who do not want it.  Where a majority of employees votes against the holding of an election, it lapses for three years; otherwise, it is proceeded with in the normal way.  In other words, after we have passed this Bill&mdash;even when it is enacted&mdash;if a majority of workers in any enterprise do not favour the application of the provisions of this Bill in their work place, so be it.  Their final sanction will be required if the provisions of this legislation are to be applied in the place of work.</P>
    <P>Section 23 empowers me, after consultation with the other Ministers concerned, to prescribe by order the number of members of the reconstituted boards, including the number to be appointed under the Act.  Where the total number is a multiple of three, elected representatives must constitute one-third: otherwise, the proportion must be rounded upwards to the number which is next to that which would constitute one-third.</P>
    <P>Since it is not possible at this stage to determine in advance the size of the reconstituted State boards, I have refrained from specifying the numbers in the Act.  In order to afford the Government Ministers concerned a degree of flexibility in this respect, I feel the best solution is to allow the number to be prescribed by affirmative order under the Act.  In this connection Members of the House will have noted that under section 4, subsection (4), a draft of an order to be made under this section or under section 25, which deals with quorums, requires the approval of the Oireachtas by way of affirmative resolution of each House. This will ensure that there will be no diminution of the authority or responsibility of the Oireachtas as regards <Col N="478" /> determining the appropriate size and quorum in relation to the boards of individual State enterprises.</P>
    <P>The debate and discussion on worker participation has been proceeding for almost a decade now in this country.  While I believe that such debate and discussion has been useful, I also believe that it has yielded us at this point all that analysis of ideas can in fact yield.  I believe it is now time for the discussion phase to give way to practical decisions.  The legislation now before the House would not have been possible without this prior discussion-phase for which we are indebted to the trade unions, the employer organisations, the Productivity Centre, the Irish Management Institute and other bodies which over the years have played a prominent role in advancing the debate and in stimulating interest.</P>
    <P>The Bill was generally welcomed in Dáil Éireann where it was the subject of a very constructive and comprehensive debate.  On the Committee Stage there I was happy to incorporate a number of improvements in the measure.  As I am anxious that elections under the Bill be held this year, I would respectfully urge the House, without wishing in any way to curtail debate and discussion on its provisions, to accord the Bill a speedy passage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is in line with similar legislation that is being proposed, is being passed or has been passed in most countries within the European Economic Community.  Indeed the most private enterprise society within the Community, paradoxically, is the most advanced in this area of worker participation.  I refer to the Federal Republic of Germany.  The British, ourselves and indeed all other EEC countries have not proceeded as fast as the Federal Republic of Germany in regard to this whole question of devolution of responsibility down to shop-floor level.  The Minister might correct me here, I suppose the Germans would be first and the Dutch second in this respect.  Other European countries are attempting now to follow them.  I mention that point because I regard worker participation as being an essential counter-balance to enterprise. <Col N="479" /> I believe the two can go hand in hand. This is one area in which we can make the enterprise, as such, more human, meaning something to the worker and manager at every level and, at the same time not take from the essential ingredient of enterprise fundamental to the success of any operation in a market economy.</P>
      <P>This is the area of social improvement that one can support totally without being in any way doctrinaire in either the capitalistic or communistic sense.  Without being doctrinaire and ignoring doctrinaire attitudes it makes tremendous sense that the enterprise in a free society should be balanced by the undertaking of responsibility by all the workers and managers in that enterprise; that the old notion of company or enterprise being merely responsible to shareholders, without any responsibility to the managers and workers, is old-fashioned, is not geared to today's society and is unacceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I go along fully with the thinking involved in worker participation.  I would suggest only&mdash;and I appreciate this is a start as far as Ireland is concerned&mdash;that this not be regarded as the conclusion in the matter, that this is really a very tentative, initial type of Bill and that much more needs to be done in this area.  In particular there is a lacuna in the Bill in that there is no reference to the essential role to be played by works councils, the essential role that a whole structure of works councils right down to shop-floor level play in the social and economic functioning of an enterprise. I appreciate that the seven State enterprises the Minister has chosen&mdash;and I take it that this was one of the paramount reasons they were chosen&mdash;are probably the most advanced in the development of joint management/ worker consultation procedures and in the development of works councils. There is no question about that.  I know from personal knowledge, as a former Minister responsible for a number of them&mdash;it would be invidious to pick out any particular ones&mdash;that some of them have been quite outstanding in this area.  I might mention in particular <Col N="480" /> the B &amp; I, the Sugar Company and Aer Lingus.  The other four involved have been exceptionally good in this respect. I would like to hear reasons from the Minister why Irish Shipping Limited are not included because they have always appeared to me to be very advanced in their whole philosophy in this area.  I appreciate that the dispersed nature of the Irish Shipping Limited enterprise, geographically speaking, may be responsible for this. Along with the seven included by the Minister, Irish Shipping Limited have always been a very advanced organisation as far as consultations are concerned between management and worker, the establishment of consultation procedures and so on.</P>
    <P>This must be only the start in this area.  The whole question of not merely recognising but having, by way of regulation under legislation, the establishment of works councils built into the whole structure of each of these seven and all State enterprises must be the objective of anybody concerned about worker participation. Linked with that are the training and education of the relevant participants in works councils, people going for election, possible qualifications in this area of education and training and, similarly, after their election to the board.  What we are concerned about here is not just people who may represent a third of the board, who can then sit on the board and be isolated by reason of their lack of knowledge and training in the matter, being on the board merely to make representations on the part of their constituents. I take it the Minister will agree with me that we are concerned here with a lot more than that.  We are concerned with a third sitting on the board who are trained and educated in the whole procedures of the enterprise's operation, what the company is about, what their objectives are, what their tactics are and what their strategy is&mdash;the whole basis of knowledge that the board or company director should have, in the fullest sense, to operate efficiently on the board.  This is what we want, not just people sent as delegates to represent a particular cause or interest, valid though that may be. They must be in a position, through <Col N="481" /> education and training, to take the view of the enterprise as a whole and participate in board decisions as fully responsible people.</P>
    <P>The works councils are a more fundamental aspect in regard to this than membership of the boards concerned. It is in the strengthening of works councils, in their recognition in statutory and regulation form, that greater progress could be made.  I am sure there are reasons for it but I am a little disappointed that this aspect is not included in the Bill.  The Minister will probably say that this Bill is a tentative start&mdash;I agree, a definite start &mdash;but that much more needs to be done to strengthen the involvement of worker and mid-manager through works councils and other consultation procedures at every level through a company's operations and that actual presence on the board itself is not as important as the other involvement of which I speak down to the shop-floor. That is more fundamental.  The presence in the boardroom, as such, should be a distillation of the experience and knowledge garnered through the works councils and various consultation procedures at mid-management level up to the top.</P>
    <P>We must not allow this excellent philosophy of worker participation to get bogged down in the notion that once you send your men through the voting procedures outlined in the Bill that is the end of it&mdash;they will make representations for us in the board room for the new three years and that is the only function they have.  That is a valid part of their function but should be a minor part, the main part being to contribute to the overall development of the strategy, policy and philosophy of the company to which they belong and of which they form a part.  If it is fleshed out in that way we could see a gradual beginning of the organisation of better industrial relations in some of the firms concerned. One or two of them here have had certain unfortunate experiences over the years, due to a multiplicity of trade unions within their operations.  Let us hope that this type of worker participation&mdash;provided it is properly fleshed out right down to the shop-floor through <Col N="482" /> the various consultation procedures and works councils&mdash;will see the assumption of responsibility gradually developing so that disputes and misunderstandings that should not happen are nipped in the bud and basically that situations do not arise where face cannot be saved and the inevitable unfortunate dispute takes place.  This will not be settled merely by implementing the Bill and by having the members represented on the board. Much more needs to be done in regard to fleshing this out at all sorts of levels further down that are not incorporated in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister, or some other Minister at some future date, may introduce more advanced legislation along the lines about which I have been speaking.  There is nothing Utopian in what I say.  It is already a fact in the Federal Republic of Germany and the Netherlands.  We are merely taking the first, faltering step in this direction, something I welcome.</P>
    <P>Section 11 states that the only qualified bodies entitled to nominate candidates are trade unions.  For the time being that may be all right, but to some extent my democratic instincts rebel against it.  There should be some places for popular vote on the part of responsible workers in a plant&mdash;for the voice of a man, either at worker or management level, who is appreciated by his fellow workers, managers or foremen and who is regarded by them as somebody fit to participate in board discussions.  Trade unions are an integral part of the Irish industrial scene. But as soon as possible this or another Minister might provide in some future legislation for one or two, as a start, of the third to be selected by popular and well-merited support from workers and managers within the operation.</P>
    <P>I understand the inherent dangers. It may be felt that by having the trade unions as nominated bodies what are alleged to be responsible people will emerge and accordingly be selected and adopted as members of the board.  There is a certain exclusivity about that I do not altogether like. One may then have on the board merely people who are replicas of trade union representatives.  They may be putting to the board, merely <Col N="483" /> points of view that have already been put by the respective trade unions in the course of negotiations with the management.  In other words, one would be merely duplicating a point of view through these board representatives which is already well known through ordinary management/trade union and board/ trade union discussions.  I appreciate the Minister may fear that some sort of mad Bolshevik representatives may emerge if there is not a trade union as a nominating body.  That possibly is the Minister's conservative fear.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that in the first amending Bill&mdash;and there must be an amending Bill because this is only the start&mdash;providing for a greater degree of participation down to shop floor and so on, there will be provision for a proportion of this third to be elected freely by the operatives themselves irrespective of whether they are nominated by trade unions.  This would bring to the board a fresher point of view that will not be obtained from merely having a trade union nominated member on the board.</P>
    <P>There is another point of view to be expressed that may not come up through the orthodox trade union and management channels to the board. Perhaps there is a case for this other type of person who may not be a favourite child of a trade union but who would be highly regarded by his fellow workers and managers.  Possibly there may be a case at a future date for amending section 11 to allow that type of person to emerge on the board within the third suggested by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Apart from those few remarks&mdash; I will have some views to express on Committee Stage&mdash;I think it is high time we adopted this procedure in Ireland.  It is in the line with general European and civilised thinking in regard to securing the fullest participation in a responsible way by all people in an enterprise.  It will help to eliminate the boss versus worker; management versus worker; board versus worker; board versus management type of complex that has bedevilled industial relations.  We have <Col N="484" /> a chance to do it in the State boards concerned, who have already reached a high degree of development in terms of worker-management consultation procedures.  We have a chance to make a start with them and gradually to move on and out from there.  I would hope that the points of view I have expressed will be incorporated in future legislation, providing the experience will work out well and that we can intensify this development in the years ahead.</P>

      <P>I join Senator Lenihan in welcoming this Bill.  People who have been involved in industrial relations down through the years have heard and spoke and talked about worker participation and finally we see the beginning&mdash;I agree with Senator Lenihan that it is only the beginning&mdash;of worker participation in industry in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Of course I should much prefer to see a wider experiment so that not alone would it affect State enterprises but also private enterprises.  However, it is a beginning and I hope it will prove successful.  We realise today that ownership is no longer regarded as an absolute right to control decisions which affect the workers and the consumers. For that reason it is necessary that we endeavour to bring about worker participation in Ireland.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the limitations of this measure but, although Senator Lenihan has expressed regret at the lack of wider provisions affecting workers outside the trade union membership, the vast majority of firms, especially State enterprises, comprise mainly trade unionists.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kerrigan</NameTxt>
      <P>At this stage it is better to confine it until such time as we have obtained some experience.  It will give workers a greater share of decision-making and a greater interest in the concern.  My experience of worker councils has been that few decisions have been made there.  They play an important part in another stratum, below the decision-making level.  I would agree with Senator <Col N="485" /> Lenihan that within the context of this eventually the whole area will have to be broadened.  This will only come with experience and time.</P>
      <P>The semi-State companies selected seem to be ideal for this experiment.  It will make a fair effort to humanise industrial relations in industries.  It will also help to bring about closer cooperation between the different representative bodies within the State enterprises.  This will be essential to the success of this Bill.  I wish the Minister success with this Bill and hope to see him back within a short time with amending legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the philosophy in the Minister's speech, which I think everybody here supports&mdash;the idea of worker representation.  But I am not happy about the way the worker representation is being effected in this Bill.  One cannot look at worker participation on boards of semi-State bodies without considering other groups that might well be represented on the boards of semi-State bodies. In my opinion there is an argument for tackling the whole restructuring of the semi-State body boards.  This would give more balance.  One of the problems in the present proposals is that there is a lack of balance, and this worries me considerably.  I am in favour of what the Minister is trying to do; the argument is about the mechanics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has talked about the important role semi-State bodies play in our national life.  He could not be more correct.  I am sure he knows that the only semi-State body which got a really thorough and vigorous debate&mdash; a debate in which there were <i>pro</i> and <i>contra</i> arguments&mdash;was the first one that was set up by Mr. McGilligan, who was the Minister for Industry and Commerce in the first Government of the State.  That was the Shannon Scheme legislation.  Mr. McGilligan's proposals, which he pushed through against very considerable opposition from the Labour Party, led by Mr. Johnson, are very illuminating.  The Labour Party opposition was constructive. It was a total new concept: it was the establishment of semi-State bodies and was probably the biggest <Col N="486" /> change from the previous regime to occur in the country apart from the adoption of a written Constitution.  It was probably the biggest single difference that occurred after 1921.</P>
    <P>The semi-State bodies have played a tremendously important role.  It is a complicated role and something we should try to understand.  I am glad to say that people are looking into the origins of semi-State bodies now. The only Dáil debate that really worked thoroughly through the establishment of semi-State bodies was the famous debate on the Shannon Scheme.  There was tremendous opposition to it.  The Minister involved told me that he staked his whole future on the Shannon Scheme.  The scheme has been a huge success and, of course, from there on semi-State bodies have been accepted without much debate in the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>One of the problems that we face as Oireachtas Members is that the semi-State bodies are at some remove from the Minister.  It is not possible to get information by means of Dáil questions on the operation of semi-State bodies and virtually the only opportunity the Seanad has to question the operations of semi-State bodies is when a Bill comes before the House to increase the borrowing powers of that body or do some restructuring such as this.</P>
    <P>The Government have&mdash;and it is generally agreed that this is a useful move&mdash;attempted to overcome this by setting up a Joint Committee of the Dáil and Seanad of 11 Members to oversee the operations of semi-State bodies.  I protested that after some initial juggling there was no independent Oireachtas representative on that committee.  I wish to protest again that I do not think this Joint Committee will provide the flow of information that is necessary and my feeling is that, with 25 semi-State bodies to survey, they will find themselves unequal to the task and will turn out rather like the corresponding UK Committee on Nationalised Industries and find that the work is too much for them.  It has not really contributed to the development of nationalised industries in the UK.</P>
    <P>I have advocated for some time that <Col N="487" /> one of the groups that should be represented on the boards of semi-State bodies is the Oireachtas.  There is a clause that we inherited from British legislation which debars Oireachtas Members from being members of boards of semi-State bodies.  It is time we grew up.  We are not past the stage when we have to accept this without discussion, without questioning. I think that Oireachtas Members should also be represented on the boards of semi-State bodies.  This would fulfil a number of functions, including the one of providing information for the Oireachtas on certain operations of the body, and it would also see that as well as the worker being represented on the boards of semi-State bodies there would be a consumer interest and a taxpayer interest.</P>
    <P>Of course if one is to contemplate this one should not contemplate the single-tier structure the Minister seems to have in mind here.  One wants to go the whole hog and copy the European model and set up two-tier boards.  I do not agree with what Senator Lenihan has said: we are not just slavishly following the German model or the European model.  We are going on a linear path when to my mind the real argument is for two-tier structures.  One of the problems that I see in having worker representatives on the boards, just putting in workers and having other directors as they are at the moment, is that the worker can end up in no man's land.  He can end up involved in taking decisions which will be unpopular with his fellow workers and he can end up just as a worker representative not fully involved in the total business of the board.  This would be to a great extent circumvented if we had followed the two-tier model and if we had an upper tier board which was really the board which looked at overall policy and had played no part whatever in executive decisions and then a lower tier which carried out the executive and management functions of the industry.</P>
    <P>I should like to quote at this stage from the <i>Common Market Law Review</i>, an article written by a distinguished <Col N="488" /> Irish expert on European Law, Mr. John Temple-Lang, entitled &ldquo;The Fifth EEC Directive on the Harmonisation of Company Law.&rdquo;  I quote from page 158:</P>
    <P>The Draft Directive, which applies to the AG, SA etc. in the old Six member States would require all these companies to have two organs, a management and a supervisory body.  These would be an executive or management board (Vorstand in German terminology), responsible for managing the company's affairs and representing the company in negotiating contracts, and a supervisory board (Aufsichtsrat), responsible for supervising and controlling the management board.  In addition, the company would, of course have general meetings of shareholders. Such two tier management structures have been obligatory under German law for certain types of company for many years, and the principle has recently been introduced, on an optional basis, in France by a law of 1966, and for large companies in the Netherlands in 1972.</P>
    <P>Mr. Temple-Lang goes on to divide the functions of the two and he says again, and I quote from page 159:</P>
    <P>The supervisory board appoints the management board for fixed periods under the Directive.  The members of the two boards must be mutually exclusive and the supervisory board must designate one member of the management board to be responsible for personnel and labour relations.</P>
    <P>He goes on to outline the division of functions that would be essential in a two-tier system.  I think it is a pity, in view of this EEC directive and in view of the fact that this ultimately will become compulsory in EEC countries, that we have not gone the whole hog and established a proper two-tier structure when we are reorganising the boards of semi-State bodies restructuring.</P>
    <P>One of the problems that semi-State bodies face is that it is difficult to judge their performances precisely because the profits and loss criteria of an ordinary private company does not apply and companies such as CIE and <Col N="489" /> Aer Lingus operate under quite different constraints.  They have problems in determining their role and, if one leaves aside the basis on which these bodies have been set up, it is very hard to determine exactly what the role of the company should be. Should Aer Lingus continue to fly the Atlantic and lose money because of prestige?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely when a board is being restructured and worker participation is being suggested in the Bill the objectives of the company are relevant? The point is that the semi-State body are not like a private company. The Minister knows this; everybody knows this.  The problem is how different are they from a private company? A private company would not have their jets flying the Atlantic half empty and losing money, and the problem is the problem of role&mdash;the role the semi-State body plays in our national life.  We should consider this, and this is another argument for having an upper tier which just determines the framework within which the company works.  On this upper tier one would have worker representatives, one would have civil servants from the interested Departments and one would have Oireachtas representatives. That would be my proposal. Instead, the Minister has a single-tier proposal on which there are worker-directors and the directors who are already there.  He should have gone the whole hog and it is a pity that he has not done so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are obvious links with various civil service Departments and I think that these could be cemented and they <Col N="490" /> could be straightened out, because there is continual tension between semi-State bodies and the civil service.  Everybody knows this and these problems could be solved by the two-tier structure.  It is a pity the Minister did not go further and did not initiate a fuller restructuring. Perhaps he will tell us that he will be able to do this later and perhaps it is his intention to develop the structures further and establish a two-tier system as we may be forced to do by EEC law.</P>
    <P>I should like to comment on the problem of the trade unions, which the Minister mentioned in his speech, and particularly the problem which occurs in section 11 (1)&mdash;nomination by qualified bodies.  I presume that this is constitutional and that the Minister has the best advice.  I know that there is a problem about a trade union.  The elections could not be carried out by a trade union, even if the trade union represented all the workers in the company because of constitutional difficulties.</P>
    <P>Here we ought to think about the role that the trade unions play in Irish life, an absolutely vital role.  One of the sad things is that we slavishly copy the British model in our trade union structures.  We should have our own union structures much more suitable for our own situation, and I would hope that sooner or later we can get round to a practice in certain other European countries of having a single union dealing with the problems in one industry.  There are moves in that direction and I welcome them.  That is the right way to go.  It would get over these problems, and then there would not be the difficulty that occurs in section 11 of this Bill.  Perhaps it is asking the Minister for a great deal, but I should like to see him contemplating legislation which would have a single union representing all the workers in certain of our larger industries. We should be thinking about this sort of thing and then this difficulty would not arise.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a very valid point and he is right.  One has only got to look at what is happening in the NET factory in Cork.  One of our problems is the appearance on the particular <Col N="491" /> shop floor of many different unions. It causes terrific problems.  I wish we could move away from that.  I am glad to see, for example, unions like the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union moving towards the stage where when a company are set up they will become the only employee representative, the only trade union involved in that company.  I would be quite happy to have a situation in which I as on employee of a big company would be represented by the ITGWU.  I think they would do an excellent deal for me and in the long run would do a much better deal for the worker involved than a multiplicity of smaller unions. We should move towards that and I am glad to see that the ITGWU are hoping to achieve this.  It is very important. There are probably constitutional problems but they have been overcome in other European countries.  That is the way things should go and I should like to see them going in that direction a great deal faster.</P>
    <P>It is clearly in the interests of the employees that a semi-State body should be run efficiently and well.  It is not in their long-term interest that the body should be continually showing signs of coming apart at the seams either through bad management or through bad labour relations.  It is in their interest that the body would be run efficiently, and I hope that the practice which was practised in the early days of the State of getting experts from the private sector to come and take responsible positions in semi-State bodies will be continued and that attractive salaries will be offered to first-class people to come in and take managerial posts.</P>
    <P>We might look at the problems which have been highlighted in the nationalised industries in the UK, and the McKintosh Report bears out what I have said.  It suggests that rather than the single tier there should be two tiers, a policy council and a corporation board which would fulfil the functions that I think the boards of semi-State bodies should fulfil.  As I have said before, my fear is that the worker-directors will be in no man's land and that their position on the board should be balanced by other <Col N="492" /> interests, by Oireachtas Members, by civil servants&mdash;that this should be in the top tier which would look after policy only in the most general sense and that there should be a separate executive structure which would do the actual day-to-day management of the semi-State bodies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  In doing so I will begin by saying that perhaps this Bill will not satisfy all of the needs of the concept of democratising industry and the services as a whole.  But it is a good beginning and, particularly since it is starting in the State industries, it will lay the basis for future development within industry. I say that particularly having regard to the question of works councils.  Perhaps one of the speakers today might have confused work committees with works councils.  I am talking about works councils in the sense of people who participate at middle level and who are involved in the decision-making process at that level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even the most hard-nosed in society cannot afford to ignore now the sort of might that is rowing in behind this challenge to the question of one-sided decision making and the challenge that is cropping up to the traditional structures and authorities, particularly when we realise that we have a much better educated workforce.  It is becoming abundantly clear they will not wait for long on the sideline and accept the monopoly of one-sided decision making.  This Bill, of course, will not necessarily change the monopoly but it will lay the basis for change, and in putting people on the board it allows workers to bring to that level of industry shop floor expertise and knowledge and, at the same time, help in the overall development of good industrial relations within the plant.  It will not happen overnight; people have got to find their way.  There is in the first instance a need to recognise that they are elected to the executive board and therefore will in some case be described as members and directors. But, nevertheless, they will be involved in running the place.  They will be no different.  They will be directors, but not necessarily there to protect the interests of trade unions as such, even <Col N="493" /> though the trade unions will be the nominating bodies.  They will be there to help the other directors run the company efficiently.</P>
    <P>It would be unjust if I claimed that the trade unions in Ireland have been advocates of the introduction of industrial democracy, of participation. In fact, it would be true to say that some of the trade unions looked at industrial democracy a little askance. Equally, it would be untrue to say that the employers have resisted it. What has been happening over the past decade is that discussions have been proceeding and, through the benefit of analysis of those discussions and the ideas emanating from them, some clearer thought emerged.  I hope the Minister's idea to bring in worker directors into the State bodies arose as a result of this wider discussion that has taken place.  I would also like to think that the Labour Party had some hand in it in the sense that we wrote our policy on worker democracy a long time ago and saw a great need for it to develop.  We set out on paper many years ago&mdash;we were the one party to the forefront in this field&mdash; exactly how the various industries, State bodies and so on should be structured in this respect.  For that reason it gives me great pleasure to see a Minister who is a member of the Labour Party introducing the beginning of what is going to be a wind of change in respect of democratising industry.</P>
    <P>It is a good development and I have no doubt it will be welcomed by all. It will be a development towards industrial harmony and I do not think anyone would quibble at that.  There has not been any evidence of quibbling today.  At the same time we cannot forget what was happening over the years if we are to think of how democracy should develop.  People have been exercising democracy outside their work place and it is only natural they would want to exercise it inside the work place.  The workers and the community, as investors&mdash;just as people invest in finance or the State invests in State bodies&mdash;are partners in the industry. They and the community, over the years have been denied their rightful <Col N="494" /> place in industry and it is good to see this matter being tackled in this way because it will lead to better things.</P>
    <P>If someone asked me the most effective way workers can exercise an overall influence I would be inclined to go for the concept of works councils with a development from there.  That is where the hub of it all lies, where the people involved in running the plant assemble.  That includes unions and different categories of management; they all come together at this point. Through the structures, information, discussions, recommendations and so on a lot can be done.  A lot can be done to help people develop towards the board situation.  I am a little worried that we might pass the Bill today and leave it at that, say that we have sort of done a good job in introducing worker participation in State industries. Directors may become more part of the company than the original directors themselves and the vital areas where participation is needed may, in fact, be ignored.  I support this measure, but we should not pass the Bill and leave it at that.  We should have regard for the fact that there has been this denial of a right for many years.  It was not only the denial of a right to participate at board level but to participate in he social funcion which is exactly what work is.</P>
    <P>Workers should be entitled to participate at levels where they can make the best contribution in the initial stages. In order to give emphasis to this question of denial of a right it is necessary to trot out an old argument about investments.  Some people invest money &mdash;even the State invest it in State enterprises or spend money to protect industry&mdash;but investment by workers is investment of a human kind.  Of the two, the investment of the human kind is more precious.  Therefore, there is no reason why this category of worker or investor should be denied that right any longer.  I say that not only in respect of State industries but in respect of the private industries.  We cannot leave it lie at just having people put on a board and forget the other levels that are important.</P>
    <P>I was surprised at the amount of <Col N="495" /> harmony on the Bill and I will not flog it to death, but the whole idea of one-sided decision making must continue to be challenged by the workers.  They must assert this as often and for as long as possible through constructive means and by constitutional behaviour to ensure they are no longer denied their rightful place as investors in industry.  I say that not only in respect of the workers but in respect of the community.  We have a situation where the investors of capital had two says&mdash;a say in appointing people and a say in the government of industry.  They have also taken the profit out of it while the workers, either weekly or annually after long negotiations, merely get the one right out of it.  I was pleased to hear the Minister say it will no longer be sacrosanct that a person because he puts money into something has an overall right that cannot be challenged.</P>
    <P>A lot has been done in some places, apart from the State industries.  It is hard to talk about worker participation in its fullest possible way without having regard to what is happening in other areas.  There is development in some of the areas with regard to the question of participation in decision making.  Therefore, I should like to give credit to some of the employers who have embarked on this, particularly those who have brought in a substantial number of trade unions.  I know of one industry where there was a multiplicity of unions, somewhere in the region of 26, and they have established a works council.  It is operating on a trial period for one year.  I hope a lot of other employers will take the lead from that industry.  I urge that for the reason that over the past 50 to 60 years a guerilla war has been going on.  Both sides have had control, but it was of a separatist nature and was based on how much injury one could inflict on the other.</P>
    <P>Participation will go a long way to take us from that road and help ease the situation.  I do not expect it overnight, but this beginning should give some hope to a lot of people who want this development and have been advocating it.  When they get the opportunity they will be the first to cooperate <Col N="496" /> with it.  I hope we are now at the point where the exclusive control of capital and management in the government of industry&mdash;including the State in the context of capital because the State is an investor&mdash;can no longer be the situation.  Where it is possible and practicable further developments along the line of democratising those industries should begin so that we can get away from the cause of the denial of that right.  There are many areas in which they can jointly pursue solutions. It does not happen regularly but there are many areas where it does and in those one will find that industrial relations have been developed to a fairly good pitch.  The coming of industrial democracy to State industries, where we have not a great record in regard to good industrial relations, is a great step.  It is only on the basis of people having got their rightful place in industry and the services that a joint approach to solving problems can be made.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and I should like to thank the Minister for it.  The idea in it expresses harmony of interests and I hope it is taken that way by the people who have to work it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not delay the Minister or the House with my contribution. Like the last speaker, I welcome the Bill.  It is the first of its kind introduced into these Houses and is very welcome.  One important consideration for us is to remember our membership of the EEC.  Consequently, we will have to make a greater effort to ensure our country advances economically and that we will be able to sell our goods on competitive markets. That should be the aim of our manufacturers and workers.  To do that it is essential that there should be a certain amount of harmony, liaison and co-operation between the owners of industry and the work force.  For too long real economic progress has been jettisoned and bedevilled because of the attitude of management and by strikes very often forced upon the workers.  In the past many of the wealthy got richer because of the way the workers were treated.  Indeed, it was only when trade unions were established that the workers were able <Col N="497" /> to fight for their rights, not alone for fair wages but for proper holidays, amenities and various other things they felt were necessary to enable them to stand as equals in the world.  That should be the purpose of this legislation.</P>
      <P>One cannot cast any aspersions on the people who set up industries.  The Government set up these State-sponsored bodies and it is in regard to the seven mentioned State bodies that this Bill refers.  Naturally it took a long time to get around to the idea that the workers were an important part of any industry.  While the people who invest their money in industry do so to make a profit, and as good a profit as possible, it would be too bad if such industries paid their way at the expense of the workers.  All the workers wanted in these cases was to know exactly what the position was. For too long there has been a great lack of communication.  This Bill aims at rectifying that.  Whether it will succeed or not we will have to wait and see because if a shop steward in a factory, being a prominent man in the industry, is elected on to the board, there is always the danger that he will lose the confidence of his fellow workers.  They may eventually say to him that he is running with the hare and hunting with the hounds. How that will be got over I do not know, but I welcome the idea that the workers will get a seat on these boards.  In fair play they would be very anxious to see that the enterprise succeeds.  It is most important for our economy that we should do everything in our power to avoid lightening strikes that cause chaos in our cities and towns.  The Minister gave the number of man-days lost last year as a result of strikes and the great loss to the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this Bill can do anything to avoid a situation such as that it is certainly going in the right direction.  It is true, as Senator Harte said, that the workers are well educated.  They are not workers like those in the 1920s. They have had the benefit now of good primary, post-primary education and often university level.  They are highly skilled.  I do not think there is any place in Irish industry today for <Col N="498" /> an unskilled worker.  Any person not properly qualified has to wait for years and probably never gets a job. No matter what type of a job one is engaged in at present in industry a certain amount of technical knowledge and expertise is needed, and that is recognised.</P>
    <P>Our vocational schools, colleges of technology and universities have been turning out tremendously well-skilled personnel.  These are the people who are often working on the shop floor and they will not be fobbed off with lame excuses.  They know their rights. Their experience will be useful on these boards.  It is well too that the members of the boards themselves understand that they are dealing with highly educated workers.  By both sides understanding each other they will be able to work out a compromise beneficial to the firm, one that would give the workers and the owners a pride in the firm and would make them glad to be associated with it. It is important that they play on sports teams if the firms have such, that they buy the products of the concern, that they advertise these products at home and abroad and, indeed, that they be proud to wear the products their fellow workers make in the factory rather than some of the imported goods being foisted on us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAMartin" hpid="Dr. Martin Dr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not weary the Minister by a long speech.  Indeed, I should like to concentrate mainly on complimenting him on the Bill.  It has had a fairly long gestation.  It is arguable that a Bill such as this should have been introduced 20 years ago. The Minister is certainly to be applauded for having brought in a Bill which is so elegant and compact in its format.  Those who drafted it clearly were very cognisant of the need to make legislation meaningful.  This Bill is eminently technical.  It reads well, and that is one aspect of it that should be welcomed and commended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The essential part of it&mdash;and this is really the main burden of what I have to say and I will say it briefly&mdash;is that it shows an awareness that one of the biggest sicknesses in western society and, indeed, throughout the world wherever large conglomerates and <Col N="499" /> heavy industry exist, where multinational companies function, and where there is the industrialisation of society, one of the concomitant sicknesses of that society, the kind of malaise that tends to fall over it, is first of all the dehumanisation of labour.  After that there is their alienation from both their management and their country and, finally, the kind of barren confrontation that results in this &ldquo;I&rdquo;, &ldquo;thou&rdquo; opposition that exists within society.  We witnessed in Great Britain some of the worst examples of that recently&mdash;absolutely barren, totally non-philosophical, utterly unfruitful antagonism between workers and management.  There is no doubt that the captains of industry have been very slow in recognising the need for this kind of worker participation.  Equally, states have been unaware of it.  That is why its introduction to these seven companies which are well within the ambit of the State's direct power and influence is very important.</P>
    <P>One of the faults in our society has been the alienation of the individual from the State itself.  The word &ldquo;bureaucracy&rdquo; is not a neutral term, as everybody knows.  It is a term of opprobrium and of abuse and it very properly has become so.  There is a difference between a civil servant and a bureaucrat.  If one is talking about a civil servant, one is reasonably respectful, but if one is talking about a bureaucrat, one is exercising the rhetoric of abuse and condemnation. That kind of abuse and condemnation involves the &ldquo;I&rdquo;, &ldquo;thou&rdquo;, the &ldquo;me&rdquo; and &ldquo;you&rdquo;, the sense of antagonism confrontation and alienation that exists so much and is becoming such a canker at the heart of so many countries. It destroys not just goodwill, good work, good effort and so on, but old and very important values like patriotism and selflessness and the sense of community.  That is what this Bill sets out to alleviate and to that extent it has been welcomed by everybody.</P>
    <P>This Bill creates an instrument for communication and co-operation.  But the instrument itself will be useless unless it is constantly monitored and <Col N="500" /> unless it is implemented with the maximum of humanity, delicacy and finesse.  In other words, we welcome the Bill but are aware that it may hit many pitfalls.  Its spirit is correct; its drafting is elegant and effective.  We will all be looking with great anticipation and interest to see its functioning on the ground.  I should like, in concluding, to wish the Minister and his Department every success both in the spirit and the letter with which the measures set out are pursued.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  The underlying social and humanitarian reasons for it are obvious to all.  In welcoming it, it is only right and proper that we should pay tribute to one of the first and most effective writers on co-partnership, one of the first who called for the participation of workers in decision-making and in other areas, who sought to humanise industrial relations.  That person whom I am happy to pay tribute to on the floor of Seanad Éireann is Most Rev. Dr. Newman, Bishop of Limerick, who has at all times been courageous and outspoken and, indeed, at most times very far ahead of his time in his thinking.  It is well to recognise that his pioneering work&mdash;I think it was written in 1952; 24 years ago&mdash;is at last being realised in some measure.  That should be a great consolation to him for the lonely road he trod at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While we welcome this and all the emphasis on workers' rights and participation, it would be less than honest on our part not to query why, in turn, the responsibilities of workers are not being more underlined and encouraged by Government action.  I have in mind in particular the outmoded strike weapons in the way it hits at all and especially at the defenceless and the innocent in the struggle.  It is no longer a proper instrument of industrial action or industrial partnership.  I would hope that with the introduction of worker participation into our enterprises this would be used as a means to develop the social consciousness of workers of their obligation to their fellow workers in the industry itself but especially to their fellow workers <Col N="501" /> at all levels in Irish society.  Damage done to any one section hits the whole economy.  It is about time we showed some enlightenment and some progress in this direction.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the many enlightened leaders in the trade union movement who are trying to achieve this, but unfortunately the message is very slow in getting down to the factory floor to the rank and file.  We have too many needless, destructive and absolutely unnecessary strikes at the present juncture.  I would ask the Government to bring about a balance in their approach to this and let us see some effort to get the strike weapon into perspective and into its place in a modern society.  Without that I am afraid we will still occupy a rather sorry position in the European league of days lost through strike action.</P>
    <P>It grieves one to tot up those days and find the millions that are lost and see what could have been done for the educational process.  We are told that the demands for money, especially in primary and secondary education, almost exceed our capacity to keep up.  Even 25 per cent of what is lost by strike action would revolutionise the facilities in primary and secondary education.  It would bring the pupil-teacher ratio down to an acceptable figure.  It would provide us with remedial teachers and with all the other ancillaries that we need for the proper education and development of our children.</P>

      <P>I am looking for some response from the trade union movement and from the people as a whole to this very positive Bill which gives the workers so much and gives them rightful participation in company decisions and in general management. Let us, as a people together, cut the waste of strike action, even by 25 per cent, and make the benefits available for the better education of our children. If we do that we will be acting in a proper, responsible, patriotic and Christian fashion.  It will be the type of answer that Dr. Newman will value <Col N="502" /> most in seeing his work on co-partnership come to fruition.  Co-partnership meant partnership between all elements in society and ruled out anything that was anti-partnership&mdash;any deliberate and wanton destruction of our national assets.  To my mind unjustified strikes or rash strikes are just that.  I call on the Government and the trade union movement to back up this series of Bills with some positive action that will get us out of the appalling position of being either at the bottom or on the second rung of the ladder in regard to days lost through strike action.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank Senators generally for their positive welcome to this Bill.  Senator Lenihan said that it marked the first faltering steps.  I agree with him that it marked the first steps but, I would hope, not excessively faltering.  This Bill is the end product of four years' work.  Soon after the change of Government I established a worker participation unit in my Department which started work in this area.  As I made clear&mdash;Senators have referred to this&mdash;there has been a good deal of discussion on the topic for many years.  Like a lot of discussion in this country, plans seem far more golden, interesting, more ambitious when left at the discussion stage and the actual product, the proposals for implementation, look somewhat prosaic by contrast to the dreams and the fantasies.  I always line myself up on the side of perhaps prosaic action, but action as contrasted with discussion. In any case I have made the point that we have had sufficient discussion in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many Senators referred to the question of whether we should have gone for the two-tier or single-tier system. We have gone obviously for representation at board level.  We have not taken up the model referred to by Senator Lenihan, the German two-tier system. That is an old debate.  I do not want to take up the Senator's time in going into a debate on the relative superiority of the single-tier or the double-tier system and which should we have chosen.  The merits of that two-tier as against one-tier system <Col N="503" /> were thrashed out in the reports I referred to at the start here today and the majority reports of the Bullock Committee, signed by the two academics and the TUC nominee, opted for the unitary system, while the minority reports, signed by the employers' members of the Bullock Committee, came out strongly for the two-tier system.</P>
    <P>I do not make a special point about the employers favouring a two-tier system and the TUC and the academics favouring the one-tier system.  Apart from my own conviction of the single-tier system being the appropriate model for us here, the substantive reason was that the two-tier system would require further changes in our company law.  If we wished to take the German model we would not be in a position to talk about any legislation here in this area in the near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not believe that the EEC will actually ensure that we must take the two-tier system?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The Green Paper on employee participation and company structures acknowledges that a transitional period is probably required during which member states can choose between the two-tier and the one-tier system, but it proposes four options.  We have taken option four, which gives us the unitary system.  But there is no doubt that, if we were to take the German model, the two-tier system, we would be required to change our company statute law, and that is a debate that is just in the preliminary stage of discussion in the European Community. It will be quite some time before there is any agreement on a uniform company law structure throughout the EEC.  We had the choice of either postponing any legislation in this area until the European debate was completed on a uniform company structure or of proceeding here on the single board system.  We have taken the latter path.  It does not mean we set our faces against the development of non-statutory consultative procedure <Col N="504" /> below board level in the State companies selected here.  We do not set our faces against that development. That possibility is open.  Our own trade union movement was itself of two minds on this question of the relative merits of the single board as against the two-tier system, and the amount of discussion within the trade unions accounts for some of the time spent in the preparation of this legislation.</P>
      <P>Senator Lenihan referred to the confining of nominations to trade unions. That was a practical decision.  I have made it clear that, despite the fact that this is enacted into law, if there is not a majority of support in a particular firm for this provision it will not apply in that firm.  In employments which are 99 per cent organised by trade unions if we do not draft our legislation to fit into existing collective bargaining procedure&mdash;that is, the collective bargaining procedures represented by trade unions&mdash;it is clear we cannot hope to gain that majority support on which the success of this measure depends. It is clear that if we did not give this basic platform role to the trade unions in these companies we would certainly be stacking the cards against acceptance of these provisions in these companies. It must be clear to anybody who would be concerned about the fact that these nomination rights are confined to trade unions that they are also open to staff associations recognised for collective bargaining purposes in the companies concerned.  Above all, whether a person is in a union or not &mdash;and there are very few who are not in a union in these companies&mdash;it must be clear that all can participate in the election.  Only the nominations are confined to the unions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I sympathise with Senator West in terms of company policy in the State enterprise sector, we are not dealing in this Bill with the restructuring of the boards.  We are concerned simply with reconstituting the boards up to a certain number.  We are not restructuring the boards as such.  That still remains the responsibility of the Ministers concerned, to whose Departments these boards report in the first place.  My own responsibilities are <Col N="505" /> directed exclusively to the question of reorganising employee representation on the boards concerned.</P>
    <P>To refer back to Senator Lenihan's advocacy of the German works council system, one of the main reasons the works councils developed and gained such wide acceptance in Germany was, of course, the virtual disappearance of the German trade union movement after the second world war.  It was necessary to re-establish them rapidly and therefore the works councils gained a good deal of support because of the need to re-erect the trade union structure. Such a need, fortunately or unfortunately, did not arise in Ireland. Trade unions had not been wrecked by the second world war.  They had, in fact, flourished both in membership and in the number of separate organisations. I have made the point that German company law is based on the two-tier system.</P>
    <P>Senator West referred to the need for having consumer interest.  It is open to the Ministers concerned, who nominate all members to the boards of these companies apart from the one-third who are directly elected, to nominate people representing consumer interests.  The two-thirds would still remain within the province of appointment of the Ministers concerned.</P>
    <P>There was a reference here to the fact that the McIntosh Report on the UK nationalised industries put forward proposals for a kind of two-tier structure. This was used in our discussion this afternoon to suggest that the two-tier system had some innate superiority to the single board representation. I have been reminded that there was a specific reference made in the footnote of the McIntosh Report to the fact that the recommendation for a two-tier structure was being made in advance of the publication of the Bullock and Lord Reports on industrial democracy and that the McIntosh recommendations might have to be changed in the light of what these reports suggested as regards structure. We now know the fate of the Bullock Report, what its majority report suggested, what its minority report&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Senator Lenihan raised the question as to why Irish Shipping were excluded.  This company was considered but we thought that because of the fact that so many of the workers were seagoing for long periods there would be practical difficulties, as Senator Lenihan envisaged. I make the point constantly that we will consider the extension of the provisions here to other State companies. Senators have remarked that this is a very limited measure and I agree. Senator Harte made the point that there has not been a great deal of interest up to now on the part of trade unions in the whole area of worker participation.  Over the years one looks in vain at annual conferences of separate trade unions to find much interest in this whole area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill does not address itself to the problems of private industry for the simple reason that there is no area of agreement whatever between either <Col N="507" /> unions or employers in private industry. I would hope that on the practical attainment of this limited measure of worker participation in the State sector we may see a revival of interest in the subject in private industry.  Based on the practical attainments of the ideas in the area of the State we might see some of the proposals embraced in the private sector also with the support of trade unions.  These companies were chosen so that the lessons to be learned from them might have more direct application in industry.  These measures could be taken over by industry in some shape or form and better utilised throughout industry, since we have chosen companies which are in the main involved in manufacturing or commercial activities.</P>
    <P>I intend to arrange for a continuous and systematic review of the legislation when it is in operation, and I may amend it in the light of that review and as practical circumstances expose deficiencies in the legislation here. Fresh primary legislation will extend the scope of the scheme to other State enterprises following practical experience of its operation.  Full worker involvement can increase efficiency and improve organisation of industry.  Those who are substantially affected by decisions of social and political institutions must be involved in the making of those decisions.</P>
    <P>At this point I should like to thank the members of the industrial committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions who spent a good deal of time considering these proposals.  This is the end of four years' work.  We started by setting up the unit on worker participation. After a period of work by members of that unit, a paper embodying all proposals in this area was published. These were subsequently studied by the Congress of Trade Unions and there was a good deal of public discussion on the merit or demerits of these proposals.  Subsequently agreement was reached with the industrial democracy committee of Congress, who went into very great detail on the proposals. It is correct that I should read the names of the members of that industrial committee of Congress into the record.  It was chaired by Harold <Col N="508" /> O'Sullivan.  The members included such well-known personalities in the Irish trade union movement as Donal Nevin, Dermot Doolin, Ruairí Roberts, Paddy Cardiff, Senator Fintan Kennedy and John Carroll.  All of these men took time off from their normal full-time work to consider very seriously the concepts and provisions of this Bill. I am indebted to them for many suggestions they made which I am convinced contributed to the improvement of the proposals we had in mind.</P>
    <P>I have attempted to cover most of the points raised by Senators.  If it is true so say that in this country, as in all EEC member countries, our prospects for economic survival in the immediate future depend on the efficiency of our industry, then it must be accepted also that if we are to free the resources of our industry and fully utilise them in getting back to a growth path in our economy a new basis of consent is needed throughout industry by both sides.  That new basis of consent, I am convinced, is given in the provisions of this Bill.</P>

      <P>I should like to reiterate briefly that, while I welcome this Bill, I regard it as just the first stage along the line the Minister has charted towards a fuller industrial democracy.  An interesting aspect concerns the voting procedures.  We have an excellent precedent in voting procedures which can be adopted over a wide area of industrial democracy, particularly in regard to pre-empting industrial action.  This is a matter towards which we should all be seeking to make progress.  If one can so democratise responsibility within industry, then there should be the co-responsibility with that of democratising in any form of industrial action arising out of procedures having gone wrong within an industry or enterprise.  The type of democratic voting procedures embodied in this Bill in regard to electing worker directors should be embodied in future legislation and should be followed before decisions are made to take industrial action.</P>

      <P>Before the Seanad enters on discussion of the Bill, I should like to draw its attention to the fact that an erratum slip has been issued in relation to an error in page 4 of the print of the Bill as passed by Dáil Éireann.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary) Michael O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>The basic proposal of this Bill is that the dismissal of an employee will be regarded as unfair unless the employer can show grounds which justify the dismissal.  Its objective is to limit the area of arbitrary decision by employers in relation to dismissals of employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The employer at present has the absolute legal right to hire and fire at his discretion.  The Bill seeks to foster better relations between management and employees in relation to <Col N="510" /> discipline and dismissals.  It is accepted by successful employers that industrial efficiency must be based on management practices which respect employees' rights.  Arguments in the past about the rights and wrongs of decisions in relation to dismissals have led to costly strikes.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that the contents of the Bill present no problem for the majority of managements.  The exercise of care and justice in making decisions which result in dismissals of employees should not impose any significant burdens on firms which develop enlightened personnel policies.</P>
    <P>For the employee's part, the Bill seeks to correct a serious omission in our statute law in respect of the individual's right to fair treatment in circumstances where the employer decides on dismissal.  As the law stands, apart from the employee's rights to the requisite notice under the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973, the employer could implement dismissal in circumstances where the culpability of the individual worker need not be soundly based.  The employee's only legal recourse up to now against the unjust dismissal lay in a common law action for wrongful dismissal in the civil courts which could entail considerable costs and delays.  This omission in our worker protection legislation has resulted in arguments about the rights and wrongs of dismissal decisions which have frequently led to costly strikes.  Frequently an employee who has felt aggrieved at his dismissal has resorted to the support of his fellow employees.</P>
    <P>Disputes have occurred in firms where large numbers of workers were drawn into disputes which primarily concerned an individual who felt that an injustice had occurred.  Despite the best efforts of Rights Commissioners and Labour Court, large numbers of workers were drawn into disputes stemming from unfair treatment of an individual in relation to his dismissal.</P>
    <P>The economy has suffered through these strikes.  In 1975, 116,000 man-days were lost as a result of disputes relating to engagement, dismissal or redundancies and much the same figure is shown in the provisional figures of <Col N="511" /> man-days lost through strikes in 1976. I am convinced that the numbers of such strikes will be lessened by remitting disputes arising from individual dismissals to the calm deliberation of the adjudicating bodies mentioned in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The general objective behind worker protection legislation is to raise gradually the standards of justice and fair play accorded to employees in line with the economic and social developments of our society.  The area of arbitrary behaviour in industrial relations, from whatever side it emanates, must be limited.  In its place we must institute codes of behaviour jointly obeyed by both sides in industry. This requirement is being met already in many firms which have fully developed dismissal procedures.  The Bill gives special recognition to agreed disciplinary and dismissal procedures within firms.  It should provide a stimulus to their establishment in firms where such procedures do not exist at present.</P>
    <P>I believe that, in addition to procedures at the level of the firm, there should also be a national code of agreed dismissal and agreed disciplinary procedures relating to dismissals.  I have already announced my intention to initiate discussions with representatives of trade unions and employers as soon as the Bill is passed with a view to agreeing such a national code.  This national code should suggest alternatives to dismissal and incorporate a graduated scale of sanctions, such as reprimands and suspension, commensurate with the perceived shortcomings. The code should also give guidance on appropriate appeals machinery within the firm.  The main purpose of this code would be as a guideline towards the achievement of agreement on both sides on necessary steps in grievance procedure.</P>
    <P>The provisions of this legislation will apply to employees in all occupational categories&mdash;manual, white collar and technical employees at all levels from the shop floor to the managing director. In all about three-quarters of a million employees will be covered.</P>
    <P>The Bill lists in detail criteria for unfair dismissals and sets down the <Col N="512" /> forms of redress and the methods of adjudication on claims.  The basic proposal of the Bill is that the dismissal of an employee will be regarded as unfair unless the employer can show grounds which justify the dismissal.  In order to clarify this basic prescription and to make it easier for employees, employers and the adjudicating bodies to fulfil the spirit of the legislation, I have listed the criteria in relation to dismissal.</P>
    <P>It will be unfair to dismiss an employee because of trade union membership or trade union activities either outside his hours of work or at times during work hours agreed by the employer. Dismissal will also be unfair if it arises from the religious or political opinions of the employee; civil proceedings against the employer which involve the employee as a party or witness; criminal proceedings against the employer which involve the employee as a complainant or witness; and the race or colour of the employee. In addition, where pregnancy is the sole reason for dismissal it will be unfair, subject to certain conditions, not the pregnancy but dismissal on grounds of pregnancy.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that it will be for the employer to demonstrate that the dismissal was justified and he must show that it resulted from one or more of the following or some other substantial grounds justifying the dismissal: the employee's capability, competence or qualifications for the work he was employed to do; the employee's conduct, redundancy or if his employment in his particular job contravened statutory requirements.  An unfairly dismissed employee would be entitled to reinstatement in his old job or to re-engagement in his former job or in a suitable alternative position.  The third alternative form of redress would be an award of compensation within a maximum of two year's pay.</P>
    <P>The redress available in the Bill should act as a deterrent by encouraging employers to think seriously before dismissing a worker&mdash;in fact to ensure that dismissal is a last resort which must be shown to be fully justified. It is in this context that we can be reasonably sure that this legislation will help in reducing the number <Col N="513" /> of instant dismissals, bearing in mind that at present industrial action is often the only practicable resort available to workers in disputed dismissal cases.  I want to make it clear that this legislation will not give protection to employees who are clearly incompetent in their work or whose conduct at work is seriously detrimental to the performance of their job.</P>
    <P>The adjudication process in the Bill envisages three possible stages, involving hearings before a rights commissioner, an Employment Appeals Tribunal and, finally, the Circuit Court. This provides an effective system under which disputes about dismissals would be investigated with a minimum of formality and expense.</P>
    <P>There are limited exceptions in section 2 in respect of a few categories of workers.  These relate mainly to employees at retiring age, close relatives, persons being trained by AnCO and to persons in public sector employment, many of whom have the benefit of dismissal procedures under other legislation.</P>
    <P>State employees known generally as &ldquo;industrial civil servants&rdquo; are however covered by the Bill.  I am taking power to bring excluded groups within the scope of the legislation, if this appears to be desirable at a future time.  Section 2 also sets a qualifying period of one year's service with the employer concerned before the Act will apply.  An exception to this qualifying service requirement is that a woman who is dismissed on grounds of pregnancy can appeal even if she has less than 12 months' service. Incidentally, a provision in section 1 ensures that the rights of a deceased employee in a dismissal claim are carried forward to his personal representative. I considered that it was desirable to clarify in the Bill the position about the termination of fixed-term contracts.  Broadly speaking, I have provided in subsection (2) of section 2 that a dismissal which represents the expiry of a fixed-time contract cannot be disputed under the terms of the legislation.  In subsection (3) of the same section, I have proposed provisions to make clear the position of employees working abroad.</P>
    <P>The provisions of section 3 recognise <Col N="514" /> the special relationship which exists when an employee is on probation or training and the accepted concept that he has to prove his worth over a trial period.  In specifying that the Act will not apply to such a dismissal, I have provided the safeguards that the contract of employment must be in writing and the duration of probation or training must be one year or less and be specified in the contract.  Having regard to the role of professional training and examination bodies in relation to the rigorous training and tests which must apply for qualification as nurses or for para-medical employment, provision is also made whereby the Act will not apply to a dismissal during the initial training period only.</P>
    <P>Section 4 continues a concept enshrined in other legislation whereby employers who take on more employees than they require for training as apprentices will not face the possibility of unfair dismissal claims if the worker is dismissed within six months after the apprenticeship begins or within one months of the completion of the apprenticeship.  In making this provision my objective is to avoid undermining the practice of some large organisations which recruit and train more apprentices than they would need for their own requirements.  These firms are performing a useful function for the benefit of the entire community.</P>
    <P>Section 5 deals with dismissals by way of lock-out or for taking part in a strike or other industrial action.  I have provided that dismissal by way of lock-out will not be unfair if the employee is offered reinstatement or re-engagement or resumption of work. In the case of strikes or other industrial action, I felt that some protection against victimisation was necessary for employees.  In the return-to-work situation there must be equal treatment for all participants.  I have provided that, if an individual is picked out for dismissal or if he is not offered his job back along with his colleagues, he can claim unfair dismissal.</P>
    <P>Under section 6 I have set out the criteria for unfair dismissals.  As I mentioned, it will be unfair to dismiss an employee because of his trade union <Col N="515" /> activities, his religious or political opinions, civil or criminal proceedings against the employer which involve the employee, the race or colour of the employee and pregnancy.</P>
    <P>The right not to be dismissed on grounds of pregnancy is qualified to the extent that dismissal of a pregnant employee is unfair unless she was unable by reason of pregnancy to do her work or her being at work contravened some other legal requirement and the employer could not offer her another suitable vacancy or she refused an offer of suitable alternative employment.</P>
    <P>I have also provided in section 6 that unfair selection for redundancy shall be regarded as grounds for unfair dismissal.  I consider that this provision is very necessary to guard against victimisation of individual workers for other motives in a redundancy situation. In this connection section 19 provides that redundancy payments must be refunded if an employee is awarded reinstatement or re-engage. ment on foot of an unfair dismissals claim based on unfair selection for redundancy.  Under section 6 it is provided that it will be also for the employer to demonstrate that the dismissal was justified and he must show that it resulted either from one or more of the following matters, to which I referred earlier, or from some other substantial grounds justifying the dismissal: (a) the employee's capability, competence or qualifications for the work he was employed to do; (b) his conduct; (c) redundancy; or (d) if his employment in his particular job contravened another legal requirement.</P>
    <P>I have provided in section 7 that if a dismissal is deemed unfair the employee may be granted reinstatement in his old job or re-engagement either in the old job or in an alternative position on suitable terms and conditions. The third alternative is an award of compensation, subject to a maximum of 104 weeks' pay.  In determining the level of compensation account must be taken of the extent to which the employer or employee were responsible and of other guidelines, including the extent to which the <Col N="516" /> employer or employee abided by negotiated dismissal arrangements or complied with the code of practice relating to dismissal procedures approved by me to which I referred earlier.  Further recognition of negotiated dismissal procedures is given in section 14, to which I will refer later.  I am taking the specific power in section 7 to approve a general code of practice relating to dismissal procedures which could be a guideline to all employers and employees.</P>
    <P>In sections 8 to 10, inclusive, I set out the proposals for adjudication on claims of unfair dismissal.  While these may seem a little complicated, I intend to produce literature when the Bill becomes law&mdash;this is a matter which was raised in the other House and presumably Senators will raise the same question in relation to clarification of provisions of the Bill&mdash;which will leave employees and employers in no doubt about the procedures they should follow.  I will ensure that the information literature will receive the widest possible circulation.  The adjudication process envisages three possible stages, involving a rights commissioner, the Redundancy Appeals Tribunal, which is being renamed the Employment Appeals Tribunal under section 18, and finally the Circuit Court.  As Senators will know, the rights commissioners' service operates on a voluntary basis under the Industrial Relations Act, 1969, in areas of dispute which are not connected with pay or general employment conditions. We have now also increased the number of commissioners; we have three now whereas we had one only until quite recently&mdash;we have extended it by two more.  The former chairman of the Labour Court is the latest recruit to the rights commission service.</P>
    <P>The Redundancy Appeals Tribunal deals at present with minimum notice and redundancy dismissal disputes and my decision to assign unfair dismissal cases to the tribunal achieves a unity of subject matter relating to dismissals for adjudication purposes.  I feel that the tribunal is the appropriate forum if dismissal disputes are to be removed from the area of industrial disputes. The third stage of recourse is to the <Col N="517" /> civil courts.  This is necessary in order to integrate the proposals with the existing legal system.</P>
    <P>Under section 8 there is provision that a claim for redress for unfair dismissal must be initiated by an employee within six months of dismissal by giving a written notice to a rights commissioner, or to the tribunal if the employee objects to a hearing by a rights commissioner.  Either party may object to a claim being heard by a rights commissioner.  In cases which come before him, however, the rights commissioner will make a recommendation in relation to a claim.  If that recommendation is not carried out, the employee may bring his claim to the tribunal, which will make a determination in relation to the claim. I should mention here that there is separate provision in section 9 enabling either an employee or an employer to appeal to the tribunal against the terms of a recommendation of a rights commissioner within six weeks of the date of the recommendation. The tribunal will make determinations on all claims which come before it.</P>
    <P>Section 10 introduces the third stage in the adjudication process, whereby, if an employer fails within six weeks to carry out a determination of the tribunal, the Minister may institute Circuit Court proceedings on behalf of the employee for the remedies provided in the Act.  In that case, and that case only, the Minister will pay any costs imposed on him by the court.  This section also provides that either an employee or an employer can on their own initiative appeal to the Circuit Court against the terms of a determination of the tribunal but in these cases the Minister would not be liable to pay costs.</P>
    <P>On the question of costs I should like to stress, that, other than any travel or subsistence costs which may arise, no costs necessarily arise for either the employer or employee in the first two stages of the adjudication process.  It is open to either the employer or the employee, at their own expense, to be legally or otherwise represented before the tribunal but it is not necessary, and in fact only a limited number of cases now coming <Col N="518" /> before the tribunal involve legal representation.  As I have said earlier, the only case under this Bill in which the State can bear an employee's legal expenses will be when an employer fails to carry out a determination of the tribunal.  The Minister then takes the case to the civil courts on the employee's behalf and the courts might award costs against the Minister.</P>
    <P>In section 14 I give special recognition to the existence of negotiated dismissal agreements and require employers to give written details of such dismissal procedures to employees within 28 days of taking up employment.  Similarly any alteration in these procedures must be notified in writing within a 28-day period.  These requirements will of course be satisfied if the procedures are incorporated, for instance, in a staff manual which is handed to each worker immediately on taking up employment.  I am also providing in this section that where an employee is dismissed the employer must, if he is requested to do so, give written particulars of the grounds for the dismissal to the employee within a 14-day period.  There is a qualification to this in that any other substantial grounds which would have justified the dismissal may be taken into account by the adjudiction bodies when considering claims under this legislation.</P>
    <P>At present the only legal recourse available to a dismissed employee is a common law action for wrongful dismissal. That right of action is preserved under section 15.  In making available the simple and effective system of adjudication and redress under the Bill and in committing taxpayers' money to their operation, I consider that the employee can reasonably be required to choose between a common law action or a claim under this legislation.  I have provided for such choice in this section.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House and look forward to its passage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the previous debate in regard to the Worker Participation Bill we, on this side, commended the Minister and supported <Col N="519" /> the Bill at all Stages on the basis that it was a practical measure to test the grounds, as it were, with regard to seven State-sponsored companies and initiate gradually a very desirable policy of industrial democracy and involvement on the part of workers in the running of enterprises.  I am afraid we cannot give all Stages to this Bill.  While supporting the broad principle of improving the law as it stands, there are too many matters for discussion on Committee Stage. We can assure the Minister that while we can allow Second Stage this evening we cannot give any subsequent Stages because of what I have mentioned.  There are far too many fundamental matters involved, particularly in regard to section 6, which is the basic section of the Bill involving various details relating to unfair dismissal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate that up to now the only legal recourse available to a dismissed employee lay in a common law action for wrongful dismissal.  That ignores the basic reality in our industrial life &mdash;a reality to which the Minister referred on Second Stage of the previous Bill&mdash;the reality of existence, and rightful existence, of the trade union movement and trade unions. Once trade union power exists&mdash;the extent of trade union power which is a reality of modern, civilised society&mdash; then, in 99 per cent of these cases, trade union power is able to look after the situation.  It is another day's work in regard to the previous Bill&mdash;which I think very socially desirable&mdash;where there should be a greater degree of responsibility in education laid on the shoulders of workers, managers and enterprise to participate in the running of the enterprise.  I am totally in favour of that.  But I wonder is the efficient working of the enterprise going to be helped by the elaborate sort of system proposed now mainly in section 6, and the following sections, designed to ensure that the gap which exists in the law in regard to unfair dismissal must necessarily be filled by this measure, in particular these sections which altogether ignore the basic fact of legitimate trade union power.  Is it not a fact of life that a <Col N="520" /> man cannot be unfairly dismissed in our society at present if he is a member of a trade union and has that power behind him?  We know that.</P>
    <P>I question the erection of a whole edifice of unfair dismissal procedures side by side with the existing common law structure, a whole set of procedures involving the rights commissioner, appeal to the Employment Appeals Tribunal and to the Circuit Court&mdash; all of this in a country that does not have the substantial employers, impersonal employers against whom this would be warranted.  Indeed it is one of the anomalies of the Bill that the impersonal employers who may, and do, commit real wrong in regard to their employees tend to be excluded under section 2, where there is a whole set of exclusions that excluded, for instance, officers of local authority, of a Health Board, of a Vocational Education Committee, prison officers&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I might point out to the Senator that I did announce an erratum slip.  Prison officers are no longer included in the list of those excluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Forgive me, that is in the correction.  If one goes through section 2 one sees a whole range of people excluded: members of the Garda Síochána, a person in An Comhairle Oiliúna, local authority employees, health board and vocational education employees.  I have not great practical knowledge of this because up to now I have had about two legal actions on the part of people unfairly dismissed. Outside that area of safe employment where buried within an impersonal bureaucracy real wrong can be done, there is the whole area of small enterprise employment people, who are taken on by small and medium-sized employers, now being subjected to the sort of situation envisaged under section 6 of having to prove that they were right in regard to the dismissal of an employee.  One justification for this type of measure lies in regard to large impersonal bureaucratic organisations where wrong can be done, many of which are excluded under section 2. The people who should not be brought into this net, who should not be subjected to the onus suggested in section <Col N="521" /> 6 are the small and medium-sized employers on whom this country is at present dependent for its recovery. The country will not recover economically if small and medium-sized employers are to be burdened with a certain onus that is involved in this Bill, particularly in section 6 and the following sections.</P>
      <P>What it comes down to is that if the small employer in the building industry, in the wholesale industry or in the retail industry, or any type of industry or sphere of commerce that you can envisage, wants to switch his labour force and take on somebody whom he might prefer and let go somebody whom he might not particularly like and whom he feels is not fitted to the particular needs of his industry, that person is being prejudiced under section 6.  I am all for having a procedure of tribunal established to investigate the merits or demerits of dismissal.  I do not mind that fundamentally. What I do mind is the onus of proof that is put over on the employer under section 6, and this is the kernel of this matter.</P>
      <P>There is in my view an undue onus of proof shifted over on the employer. I do not mind if it is a big battalion employer who has plenty of personnel relations departments and public relations departments to look after this.  The big employers in the private field, like Guinness or any other of that category you wish to mention, have plenty of offices and departments to look after this sort of thing. They can process this legislation and are sure that it will be processed through a rights commissioner and on to the Employment Appeals Tribunal and on to the Circuit Court.  Similarly, the bureaucracy has plenty of people of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not talking about them at all. I am talking about the people on whom the Minister is depending, through sections in his Department by way of premium grants, to stimulate manufacturing activity.  I am talking about the thousands of small textile and footwear factories.  I am talking about the hundreds of meat processing and food processing industries.  I am talking about the hundreds and <Col N="522" /> indeed thousands of small building contractors.  All of these people whom the Minister under another section of his Department is seeking to stimulate into the economic activity by way of grants if they employ extra people, who are being smothered in paper by way of taxation and other areas, on whom the Government and the economy are dependent, are being prejudiced.</P>
    <P>If there is a row on a building site on a frosty morning and a fellow is let go because he is not doing his thing&mdash;I do not want to itemise the million and one ways in which this can happen: all of us here are human beings and we know the way human nature works and how it ticks&mdash;that employer is going to be asked now under section 6 to come along and to spell out the substantial grounds justifying the dismissal&mdash;not just grounds, but the substantial grounds justifying the dismissal of a particular man on a morning on a building site.  The substantial grounds, when one goes into them in detail, mean that in effect the employee must be shown by the employer not to have been adequate to do the work for which he was employed.  The employer must show that the employee was not capable of behaving in a proper way and that the conduct of the employee was the matter at fault.  The main matters are the capability, competence or qualification of the employee, and the conduct of the employee.</P>
    <P>Instead of having an open-ended type of investigation into this matter, what is being done in this Bill is that the onus is being put on the employer to show that there was culpability, lack of capability, misconduct on the part of the employee. In other words, the employer is in the dock from the word go, rather like a criminal being tried.  The whole onus is put on him to prove that he was right in dismissing the employee, instead of the matter being on an open-ended basis where both employer and employee present their case, not in a confrontation issue where the onus of proof may be on one side or the other, but rather in a sensible investigation system before the rights commissioner, and subsequently before <Col N="523" /> some form of appeals tribunal.  It should not be, and it is totally wrong as it is now spelt out under section 6, that in regard to any unfair dismissal the onus is entirely on the employer.</P>
    <P>What we are talking about is dismissal, and this dismissal under section 6 is presumed to be an unfair dismissal and the presumption of unfairness lies with the employer who has to go in and say before the rights commissioner and subsequently before the tribunal and, perhaps in the Circuit Court, that it was not unfair, this this employee was incapable, culpable and guilty of misconduct. The whole onus is thrown over on the employer in regard to any dismissal. This is the rather serious matter that resides in this particular section.  The presumption is that dismissal automatically is unfair.</P>
    <P>This, in my view, is very bad in a climate where we have adequate union power to handle any unfair case involving arbitrary action, discrimination and injustice by an employer. There are adequate trade union facilities to deal with that situation and it is being dealt with every day of the week in every factory in operation in the country, and rightly dealt with. That is what trade unions are there for.  If they have to deal with it more effectively and if they want facilities to deal with it more effectively, I am for that.  I am for any form of arbitration between trade union and employer being established.  I am all for the rights commissioner idea where a rights commissioner goes in and he is there on the spot to deal with a situation of this kind between trade union and employer, without prejudice and without bias and without any onus on one side or the other to prove or disprove a case.</P>
    <P>We are now bringing in here one side or another to prove or disprove a case.  We are now bringing in here a legal constriction.  Instead of the traditional common law, which is being retained, side by side with it we are bringing in a new legal conception of right and wrong and we are presuming here under section 6 that every dismissal is unfair, and because that presumption <Col N="524" /> is there we are putting the onus over on the employer to rebut that presumption.  Is it not a far more sensible thing, without bringing in the whole panoply of expensive legislation and potential litigation, that we have more rights commissioners, more people on the ground, to deal instantly for and on behalf of the rights commissioner with such disputes quickly and effectively as they arise, to go into it not on a legal basis, not on the sort of basis that is set out in this legislation, but on the basis of common sense, and <i>ad hoc</i> approach, which is the only way to deal with 99 per cent of these problems?</P>
    <P>I do not think people realise the extent or the enormity of what is being done here.  If this sort of legislation is pushed to its logical conclusion, the normal relations that exist between employer and employee will be damaged completely because it will give rise to a whole system of nark complaints and everybody here knows what I am talking about.  It will encourage the begrudgers and the narkers and the complainers and the people in our society who should be discouraged and given every disincentive. I am all for having strong trade unions, strong rights commissioners and plenty of staff attached to strong rights commissioners to ensure that no wrong is done to employees. If you are to have a situation where small and medium size employers are faced with the requirements of this Bill, day in day out, in discharge of a particular action which they may consider necessary for the survival of their business, then you are in very serious trouble so far as future economic development is concerned. I say that advisedly because I took a more extreme standing than the Minister on the previous Bill in regard to worker participation in industry.  I believe totally in worker participation, total involvement by workers at every level of both tiers, at the works council tier and at the board of directors tier&mdash;the more responsibility workers and managers have at middle level the better&mdash;but I suggest that this Bill is in reverse to the responsible measure that the Minister proposed here earlier in the day and which has <Col N="525" /> been passed with our help.  This Bill is an encouragement to something that we do not want to see in our society and which can be dealt with adequately within the existing structures of the trade union movement.</P>
    <P>The pragmatic step should be taken of having a corps of rights commissioners available in each segment of industry to deal immediately in a fire brigade operation aspect with any trouble of this kind where it arises and to move and operate totally on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis without giving more rights to people.  The whole trouble with the modern world is that too many people have rights and feel they should have more rights.  If we add more rights, we will kindle more trouble.</P>
    <P>I would have every confidence in a pragmatic system operated under the Labour Court, with strengthening of the staff of the existing rights commissioner system, which could be done on a practical and <i>ad hoc</i> basis without any need for this legislation which will put an enormous burden on small and medium size employers and, apart from that, will add an enormous amount of extra cost litigation, narkiness, trouble, aggravation, call it what you will, to the whole industrial scene.  The only ultimate beneficiaries will be the profession to which I belong myself, the legal profession.</P>

      <P>In welcoming this Bill I must point out initially that I cannot examine it from a legal viewpoint. I think it is a most desirable and necessary Bill.  As a trade union official who has dealt with numerous dismissals and numerous stoppages due to dismissals&mdash;unfair dismissals, may I add?&mdash;after much hardship to people and so on, these things have been overcome.  I would hope that this Bill will alleviate, if not eliminate, most of these difficulties. Senator Lenihan said the trade unions would be catering for 99 per cent of the people involved and that they have plenty of muscle to protect those people.  I would not disagree with that&mdash;perhaps the percentage is too high but I hope that will be the right percentage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, there is a section in <Col N="526" /> industry which is subject to unfair dismissal. Most big industries have procedures which normally work out reasonably well, but you have the smaller industries, even though there may be joint labour committees acting in them, who are not organised.  For that reason this Bill is more than necessary.  We have to realise that the welfare of the company is at stake but at the same time we have to ensure that no one would unfairly lose his job.  That has not been my experience up to now.  By and large I have found that many people who were unjustly dismissed had to go all the way to a dispute and a disruption and maybe a strike lasting five, six or seven weeks.  With a bit of common sense, we could have outlawed the causes for that long ago.  It is not called &ldquo;sacking&rdquo; now.  It is called a &ldquo;dismissal&rdquo;, but is means sacking, and it is the fault of both sides of industry that it still occurs.  Admittedly, there will be people who will be entitled to be let go, but this Bill provides a safeguard for the employee, who is the weakest in this country.</P>
    <P>The only thing I have to ask the Minister on the Bill itself is in regard to section 2, the one year service with the employer.  I wonder, as there is normally six months' probation, why he has decided on another six months before the Act would apply to him. This is one thing I cannot understand because normally probationary periods are of six months.</P>
    <P>By and large I welcome the Bill.  It will help to protect those who are at the mercy of not alone small business but big business in the event of a takeover bid.  We have had many of those. People have lost their jobs because somebody has taken over the industry but has not re-employed everybody. This Bill should eliminate dismissals such as that, and without security and proper protection I do not think we will get the industrial relations we need.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator Lenihan I have many misgivings about this Bill.  I agree with the principle involved and, indeed, we would all like to ensure as much security for <Col N="527" /> everybody as possible.  We have to take it that we are living in a real world, a rather rough competitive world where it is not merely the slacking employee that sets the pace and goes to the wall but the whole firm.  It seems rather unfortunate, yet it is a fact of life that in small industries, small businesses and so on they cannot carry the employee who is not pulling his weight. That is quite different from being able to make a watertight case in the Circuit Court and everywhere else about unfair dismissal.  It is something that worries me.</P>
      <P>I have as much compassion and sympathy as anyone, but it worries me when I get a circular as I and many Senators got from the Irish Hotels Federation in which they express worry about the procedures in the Bill and especially about the lack of consultation with the employer organisation. It seems crazy to me to approach something that so intimately involves the two sides with a measure that does not comman the respect and confidence of both sides.  It is just as criminal to leave the employers out or not to take cognisance of their legitimate suggestion as it would be to put this through without full and adequate consultation and advice from the trade union movement, because the world outside the sheltered halls of the public service is a very different world.  It is a harder and more competitive world, yet it is the production and the competitiveness of that world outside the sheltered halls that unfortunately provide our production.  That is the pace-setter&mdash;it is on that we depend for our existence as a nation.  We pay lip service to the fact that we are a mixture of public and private, but as far as I can see the Government and Minister give the private side very little encouragement and help in the task they have got.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very worried about this and I hope we can tease it out more on Committee Stage when we should have quite a bit of time to think over the problems raised.  I would prefer, as Senator Lenihan has suggested, to see many more rights commissioners available because when you put it into a legalistic framework with the employer <Col N="528" /> in the dock he has to have evidence on which to sack the employees concerned. That evidence very often will be given in confidence by his fellow employees against the person in question. They are not likely to put their names to that evidence.  They are not likely to come forward and present that evidence before a rights commissioner and certainly not before a Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>Though I am very much opposed to strike action where it can be avoided, it seems to me that in industry if his fellow employees have a certain knowledge that the man in question is not doing his job, that he is doing something they consider very wrong, and if he is dismissed based on that, not one of them would come forward in court and give evidence of the unsuitability of the person concerned.  But when they are asked to back his retention by strike action then they express their opinions by the way they react.  They will not go out on strike for a fellow employee whom they consider not to be pulling his weight in the industry.  That to my mind is something that is rather crucial.  Indeed I had experience of it at university level recently.  There was something that I had got evidence on and then when I needed the evidence I found it was not forthcoming.  I cannot understand the attitude, but I am sure that is the prevailing attitude in industry generally. This Bill makes it almost impossible to dismiss anyone.</P>
    <P>I am very worried that the employers' side do not seem to have been consulted on this and have not been adequately heard.  The idea of a six-months period is fantastic.  If an employee feels he has been wrongfully dismissed, within a few hours of his dismissal&mdash;certainly within a week&mdash;he should have lodged his complaint, but waiting for six months seems indefensible. Under the Road Traffic Act if you are involved in an accident notice has to be served on the person involved that the Garda Commissioner may be contemplating prosecution. Therefore you have early warning to assemble your evidence.  That is not so with the employer here.  An employee out for mischief could decide he will not lodge his complaint until <Col N="529" /> some hours before the six months have elapsed.</P>
    <P>This seems to be a totally different question from worker participation and management decisions.  This to my mind strikes at the very root of the operation of any efficiently run industry. The answer is, as Senator Lenihan has pointed out, an extension of the rights commissioner procedure.  The total man-days lost in the past year is not an impressive condemnation of the present situation.  It was 100,000 man-days which, calculated in money, is probably a loss of production of around £1 million.  In the context of industrial output that is not an alarming figure, but it is one which could be very substantially reduced.  If 10 per cent of it, £100,000, was used to employ another five to ten rights commissioners I am sure they would do an excellent job.</P>
    <P>The length of time in which this right is accorded in this Bill&mdash;I take a different point of view from Senator Kerrigan on this&mdash;seems unfair because it is two years before a worker acquires rights under redundancy legislation whereas he is required to have only one year's service under this Bill. Why the discrepancy there?  The redundant worker needs much more protection.</P>
    <P>We must consider from a different standpoint what is in the legislation where the employer is regarded as being in the dock from the word go. We must ask ourselves if in 90 per cent of the cases which have occurred in the past the employers' actions were vindicated?  Are there any reports on that?  No employer or manager who was competent in any way would move in such a situation unless he had more than ample grounds.</P>
    <P>I would not like to be a manager in industry today and carry all the headaches associated with it and try to keep the firm going in the difficult production, sales and other climates we have today.  We have fewer managers than workers and the value of good ones cannot be estimated.  The whole success of an enterprise depends on management skills.  These skills are different in public employment as against private.  There are protections in public employment for managers <Col N="530" /> and employers which do not exist in the private sector.</P>
    <P>I am worried about this measure and I should like an assurance that whatever we bring in, like the previous Bill, it will be a trial venture.  The previous Bill was good and it was right that it should be on a trial basis. I hope the Minister can in some way ease our worries by detailing the consultations he has had.  Can the Minister say if any of the management bodies have doubts about this and if so will he try and meet some of those before Committee Stage is passed?  This is a highly critical Bill.  We would not be doing our duty if we did not take time to analyse its implications and see if it will be to the detriment of our industrial production.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which, for the first time, ensures that there is adequate protection of employees in their employment.  I have listened with interest to the way in which Senators Lenihan and Quinlan have been wringing their hands over the plight of employers in this regard. On the contrary it is incredible that it has taken until March, 1977, to achieve this protection of employees in their jobs.  I would regard this as an essential provision in ensuring job security and maintaining a better balance in this area of industrial relations.  It is appropriate that the burden of establishing that a dismissal was not unfair, unjust or wrongful is placed on employers. It is appropriate because employers take the step of dismissing, because they are in possession of the information, and they can establish a case that in the circumstances the dismissal was not unfair and that injustice was not done.  That is the appropriate balance and I am glad to see it is maintained in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of specific matters to which I should like to refer. But before doing so I should like to recall a debate on the question of unfair dismissal which arose in relation to the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Bill, 1974.  At that time attempts were made to provide that a person who was dismissed because she had pursued an equal pay claim should have a right <Col N="531" /> of reinstatement.  I recall the Minister stated at that time that there were constitutional difficulties.  That is not the first time I have heard an obscure reference to constitutional difficulties. I do not see them.  I see there is a right of association and a right not to associate.  I see where some sort of case might be made that an employer should not be required to associate with an employee, but any balanced judgment on the balance of constitutional rights involved would have to come down in favour of the right to work, to be employed and not to be wrongfully dismissed in employment. I would be grateful if the Minister would elaborate on this question of a possible constitutional difficulty.  I am glad, if there was one, that he has been able to resolve it and bring in this legislation.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to clarify very precisely the position in relation to equal pay claims.  I take it that this legislation now applies to any person who pursues a claim for equal pay so that if that person were to be dismissed he or she would be fully protected by this Bill and could bring a complaint to the rights commissioner and could be reinstated or re-engaged, depending on the circumstances?  That is very important because there are a large number of women, particularly in the private sector, who are afraid to pursue their claim for equal pay because they are afraid they would be dismissed.  It would be important if the Minister could ensure that the position was clarified and state, very categorically, that such women would be protected by this legislation, could not be dismissed on that ground and could be reinstated under this legislation even though they could not be reinstated at the time under the provisions of the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974.  That is the first point on which I would welcome clarification.</P>
    <P>The next point relates to section 6 (3) which refers to the question of dismissal under redundancies where, in fact, there was a wrongful dismissal in the circumstances.  I should like to refer in particular to the question of <Col N="532" /> the possibility of married women being declared redundant in priority to other workers.  Firstly, I should like to quote from a study on Attitudes To Women At Work With Particular Reference To Attitudes Towards Married Women, carried out by Deborah King, under a scholarship provided by AnCO, concluded in September, 1976, and recently reported in the press.  In that study there is reference to a particular question which was asked of workers in selected places of employment. The question was: &ldquo;In the case of a redundancy do you think married women should be the first to go?&rdquo; The answers to that question are very revealing because in all the categories of workers, married men, single men, married women and single women, there was a significantly high proportion of all of them who felt that married women should be declared redundant first.  Taking the case of married men: 69.3 per cent thought married women should be declared redundant first; 28 per cent said &ldquo;no&rdquo; and 2.7 per cent &ldquo;do not know&rdquo;.  Of single men, 53.3 per cent said &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, 41.9 per cent said &ldquo;no&rdquo; and 4.6 per cent &ldquo;do not know&rdquo;.  Of married women, 46.9 per cent said &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, 50 per cent said &ldquo;no&rdquo; and 3.1 per cent &ldquo;do not know&rdquo;.  Of single women, 59.2 per cent said &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, 23.1 per cent said &ldquo;no&rdquo; and 7.7 per cent &ldquo;do not know&rdquo;.  That report goes on:</P>
    <P>Fewer married women as compared to other groups support the view that married women go first in a redundancy situation, perhaps because they themselves would be personally affected.  Conversely, the high percentage of single women who state that married women should be made redundant first may reflect the fact that the single women frequently do the same jobs as married women and would be more secure in their positions if such a policy prevailed.</P>
    <P>We also find that a high percentage of married men&mdash;69.3 per cent&mdash;believe that married women should be made redundant before workers in other sex/marital status groups.</P>
    <P>Because of the attitudes of fellow <Col N="533" /> workers revealed in that survey it would be important for the Minister to clarify the position with regard to any such attempt to declare that a category of workers, mainly married women, would be declared redundant first in similar circumstances.  I assume that that would be an unfair or wrongful dismissal under this Bill but I would be grateful if the Minister would make that clear when replying?</P>
    <P>I regret I was not present in the House at 2.30 for the Order of Business. I was chairing the Textile Advisory Committee of AnCO when in fact the contents of this survey were being considered by the members of of that committee.  I understand that in this House a matter very dear to my heart, namely, the Family Planning Bill, was being discussed.  However, I hope to have an opportunity in the very near future of making my views clear, and my concern that the Bill itself be processed as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to clarify the position regarding the pregnancy of an employee.  In section 6, subsection (2) (f) it is stated that the pregnancy of an employee or matters connected therewith would not be of itself a justification for a dismissal unless:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  the employee was unable, by reason of the pregnancy or matters connected therewith&mdash;(I) to do adequately the work for which she was employed,</P>
    <P>Is that not too vague and potentially subjective a criterion?  Who is determining whether it was adequate?  Might there not be a situation where a person becoming pregnant would be deemed not to be able to do the work adequately?  The burden would be on the employer in the circumstances but is that sufficiently tightly worded to prevent abuse in practice?  I would ask the Minister to clarify the position in relation to the right to pregnancy leave, particularly for a person who wishes to negotiate pregnancy leave where the situation is not clear in the particular employment.  Any attempt to dismiss a person who looked for pregnancy leave would, presumably, constitute <Col N="534" /> an unfair dismissal under the Bill?</P>
    <P>Unlike Senators Quinlan and Lenihan I do not regard this Bill as unduly legalistic.  It maintains a very good balance.  The situation as it prevailed prior to this Bill was the imbalanced and inadequate situation where a worker, wrongfully dismissed, if he was a trade union member might rely on trade union pressure and, ultimately, on industrial action to provide the adequate bargaining power and ultimate protection, or else had the alternative of pursuing a common law claim for wrongful dismissal.  As a lawyer I know how unreal and inadequate that particular course of action could be.  This is reflected in the few cases of common law proceedings for wrongful dismissal that there have been.  In the cases that occurred it was generally a manager who claimed he was wrongfully dismissed or somebody at that level who regarded the courts as being protective and could afford advice and have lawyers representing him.  It was not, in fact, a very adequate type of proceeding, though it is appropriate that it should continue as part of our law because there is a place for an action for wrongful dismissal.</P>
    <P>Senator Lenihan made frequent use of the phrase &ldquo;trade union power&rdquo;. He felt there was so much trade union power that this Bill was superfluous. He must know that there are a considerable number of workers who are not members of a union, and this tends to be the case with women workers to a considerable extent. Regrettably it is important that they should become members of unions but there are a number of employees who are most in need of protection because of the type of employment and because they are not members of a trade union.  These employees, for the first time, have adequate protection and adequate job security.  This is an important Bill and it has created the appropriate balance.  I await clarification from the Minister on the other points I raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VincentMcHugh" hpid="Mr. McHugh Mr. McHugh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to clarify a few points on section 6 (2) (a) and (b).  Paragraph <Col N="535" /> (a) refers to engaging in activities on behalf of a trade union, while paragraph (b) deals with the religious and political opinions of the employee.  Does this mean that a person can do whatever work he likes on behalf of a trade union but can only hold a political opinion and no more?  Does it mean that a person cannot become a Jehovah Witness or a Salvation Army member?  Does it mean that a person cannot act on behalf of a political party in one's spare time because that is going further than having a political opinion?</P>
      <P>There are many pressures put upon people who engage openly in politics if for any reason their employers do not like their activities. I have seen this in action many times. Employers can be quite vindictive and destructive regarding their employees' activities.  Many pressures come on people who openly engage in politics if for any reason their employers do not like their activities.</P>
      <P>I know a county councillor who has been given a nomination to contest the election for Dáil Éireann but he cannot accept the nomination because he is employed by the Post Office. The Post Office is not mentioned in subsection (2), unless perhaps it is covered by subsection (1) (h).  If that is so I hope the Minister will elaborate on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There should be some explanation by the Minister why he mentions specifically activities on behalf of a trade union and purely the religious or political opinions of the employee. Surely an employee is entitled to engage in his spare time in religious or political activities undisturbed by his employer.  Surely he is entitled to ask for time off or to take his holidays to engage in both political and religious activities without having his employer asking for explanations and threatening his dismissal.  It might be said that this would not happen but I have seen it happen many times.  I have seen it happen in concerns where people who attended county council meetings were told clearly in writing that unless they gave up their political activities they should look for another <Col N="536" /> job.  The Minister should state why political opinions are mentioned and trade union activities are covered.  I have no objection to trade union activities and I am a member of a trade union myself, but I should like to be certain that I am safe in pursuing my political activities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators for the various comments they made on the provisions of the Bill.  By and large they were useful comments.  Naturally, this Bill has been the subject of a certain degree of controversy in its passage through the Dáil and it is not surprising that some critical points should be made in relation to it in the Seanad also.</P>
      <P>Senator Lenihan talked about the trade unions being quite capable of looking after the existing situation.  It would be fair to sum up his position by saying that he did not quite see the requirement for this legislation since, as he put it, the vast majority of workers belonged to trade unions and the trade unions had the strength to look after their members, men or women, in a dismissal situation.  Trade unions might not make the point very often, but they only organise 60 per cent of the total work force.  Even in organised employments where trade unions organise the workers the fact is&mdash;and the Bill was designed to meet this particular situation&mdash;that trade unions in these situations manage to rectify an injustice relating to dismissal by, in too many cases, utilising the ultimate sanction of the strike weapon.  The Bill addresses itself to meet this fault in the existing system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even where unions organise a work-force for the union to defend its member in the unfair dismissal situation it calls for resorting to the crude weapon which most Senators in the contributions on both Bills here today say is an outmoded weapon, one that should not be utilised in today's conditions, namely the strike weapon.  Yet, unions are forced to utilise it in the absence of legislation of this kind.  I would not agree with the Senator that there is not a need for such legislation, nor would I say the reasons cited by him, <Col N="537" /> that the trade union movement is competent to look after the situation, should obviate the need for such legislation.</P>
    <P>Senator Kerrigan referred to section 2 (1) (a), about the one-year continuous service requirement, and made the point that this was possibly too long a period.  This point was referred to by other Deputies.  All legislation that comes from the Department of Labour has to go through this consultation process with employers and unions and, in the nature of things, it is obvious that protective legislation will not simultaneously meet with agreement from both sides.  In the nature of things it is obvious that there will be disagreement and conflict between employers and unions in any legislation dealing with this area.  In that situation it is always my unhappy position to make a judicious decision, hopefully, as between the disagreements on what should or should not be done.  In this case, on the one-year's continuous service requirement which is now in the Bill, the FUE wanted a two-year qualifying service while the Congress of Trade Unions wanted a six-months qualifying service.  That is obvious disagreement. In the face of that rather fundamental disagreement on the period of service I made the decision that it should be one year on a compromise basis. Throughout the Bill, in answer to the query &ldquo;Has this met with the entire agreement of one side or the other?&rdquo;, the honest answer is &ldquo;No, it has not&rdquo;. In many cases, despite the most searching consultation with both sides, the civil servants in the section and myself have come to the conclusion that it is not possible to get unanimity about certain sections and in that case we are always forced to make decisions for good or ill.</P>
    <P>Senator Lenihan used the argument that trade unions could look after the situation and made the point that the rights commissioners could deal with the situation, that they would not need the legislation.  In fact, if either one party or the other refuse to utilise the service of the rights commissioner, that is the end of the matter and we cannot proceed any further with it. The simple expedient of expanding the <Col N="538" /> number of rights commissioners would not meet the situation that this Bill seeks to remedy.</P>
    <P>On the question of onus of proof, there was a lot of criticism that the onus of proof should rest on the employer. Yet, as Senator Robinson rightly said, the employer is the one person who has all the facts in relation to the dismissal at his fingertips before he comes to the rather serious decision for the employee that his service is to be terminated.  That is what the Bill is aiming at: to make employers think seriously before they decide that a man's or woman's services are to be dispensed with.  It does not mean that we feather-bed the inefficient employee because the criteria are quite explicit in regard to competence and qualifications. They are set out quite clearly and, therefore, the employee who is unable to meet these criteria will be unable to claim the protection of this Bill.  Senator Lenihan was worried in case this Bill would be a means of nark-complaints threatening the efficiency of industry.  I do not see that this Bill would result in that situation.  The criteria are set down under which an employee can be dismissed.  If these criteria are met with, the tribunal which investigates the matter must stand over the employer's case and accept that the employer was correct in terminating an employee's contract.</P>
    <P>It is necessary that the imbalance which in the nature of things exists between an employer and an employee should be redressed to some extent when it comes to dismissal.  After all, who initiates the action, who is the person saying that X person is no longer suitable in his or her job?  Who is it who says to an employee after a certain period of service, ten, 15 years of service, &ldquo;I no longer require you&rdquo;?  Is what we propose not perfectly appropriate and just?  Most employers accept it, in any case.  It is not as if we were talking about legislation that will be new to most employers, because most successful managers operate in natural justice the requirements set down in this legislation.  However, for that small minority of employers who would for trivial reasons dispense with the services of an employee with a long period of <Col N="539" /> service this Bill spells the end of the kind of arbitrary rights they had up to now to dismiss their employees.  The Bill seeks to remove the imbalance which exists in the relative power in the matter of dismissal as between employer and employee.  The employer, after all, has reports of supervisors, records and information that is relevant to the dismissal decision.  The employer is the one who is taking the decision that X should be dismissed and it is only correct that on his shoulders should rest the onus of proof that that was the correct decision to take.  In the absence of that provision the employee would be stranded with no information or reasons assigned for the dismissal.  He would be unable to defend his position.  He would not have much hope of successfully putting forward his case that he had been unfairly dismissed.</P>
    <P>Senator Kerrigan raised the question of certain people who are not reemployed following a takeover of a business.  Of course, the Bill makes provision whereby unfair selection for redundancy can be argued to be an unfair dismissal and employees affected as the Senator suggests would be covered by the Bill</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson raised a question under section 6 (2) (f) on pregnancy. She queried whether it was sufficiently definitive in regard to a pregnant woman being unable to do the work and asked if this was a bit loosely drafted.  She queried whether this might be excessively vague.  I am loath to introduce a cumbersome arrangement in relation to pregnancy which might have to involve stipulating doctors' reports and so on.  I am sensible of the point she makes in relation to the question of the person's competence to do a job when the person is pregnant, but the broad requirement that a dismissal based solely on the person's pregnancy is unfair would, I hope would be sufficiently protective under the Bill.  We must not forget that the tribunals that examine all of these matters are there to see that particular clauses mean what they say.  Senator Robinson has a good point, however, that we will have to watch this closely in practice.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="540" /> Senator Quinlan asked if there was adequate consultation with employers and trade unions interests on this Bill. There was adequate consultations with both sides but we did not get this general agreement on several of the provisions of this Bill</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the circular of the Irish Hotels Federation.  Having read that circular it is only too clear that the only solution which would meet the requirements of the Irish Hotels Federation is the withdrawal of the Bill.  Obviously, there is no agreement on that matter.</P>
    <P>Some employer organisations, it must be said in honesty, are unhappy with the provisions of the Bill.  This Bill is drafted to defend the employee from unfair dismissal and it is rather difficult to assume that such a Bill would in the normal course of things have the wholehearted approval of employer organisations.  Naturally employer organisations would in the main look at the experience of managers around the country.  It must be said that for the majority of succesful managers the provisions of this Bill will be unnecessary, because natural justice and their own sense of fair play ensures that these employers are at present voluntarily carrying out the provisions of this legislation.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinlan referred to the six-month period for lodging claims in section 8.  This, of course, was one of the complaints of the Irish Hotels Federation.  The reason for this is that I was anxious to give the normal disciplinary procedures within the firm time to operate to see whether the dispute could be settled at that level.  The procedures in this Bill here need not be invoked at all where the necessary disciplinary procedures in the firm deal with the situation.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson raised the point that we did not provide in the equal pay legislation for re-instatement of a person seeking implementation of its provisions.  It is true that at the time constitutional problems were cited that prevented us from doing this. Obviously the Constitution has not changed nor has the legal advice <Col N="541" /> available to us.  It would be tragic to think that legislation that Deputies and Senators in both Houses agree is desirable should be held back or rendered less strong because of legal advice that the Constitution could be cited against these provisions.  It would be nonsense to think that legislation did not offer the option to the aggrieved party of re-instatement.  The Constitution has not changed but we have accepted the possibility of certain elements of the Constitution being cited against the legislation before us.  On the other hand, there is conflict in relation to this advice.  Is the aggrieved party in the equal pay claim now covered by this legislation?  In fact we are amending the Anti-Discrimination (Employment) Bill which is before the other House at present on Committee Stage. We are amending it to make the provisions consistent with the provisions in the Unfair Dismissals Bill so that by that means it will cover the person in the equal pay situation.  It will not be covered by this one; it will be covered by the Anti-Discrimination (Employment) Bill, which will be coming before this House shortly.</P>

      <P>Yes.  Unfair selection for redundancy of married women.  They can bring and argue a claim under section 6 (3) and it is provided in the Bill that reinstatement or compensation will be available if the claim is successful.  In other words an employer cannot pick them out and get rid of them in a redundancy <Col N="542" /> situation where the criterion is the fact of their being married.  That is covered under the provisions here.</P>
      <P>It is quite understandable that there should be a certain amount of contention in relation to a measure of this kind.  Many Senators in good faith will not see the necessity for such legislation.  A small number of employers may not see the necessity for such legislation.  I think the majority of people in industry on both sides, management side or the trade union side, will acknowledge that this legislation will make it more difficult in that minority of cases for real injustice to occur.</P>
      <P>On the passage of this legislation I intend to seek the agreement of both unions and employers to accept a voluntary national code, as I have indicated in my Second Reading speech here tonight, and to get that adopted on a national basis.  I would hope by means of the adoption of that code and the enactment of this measure before us that we can remove the question of dismissal as a potential for strikes or stoppages in industry. Even if we were to ignore the importance of this measure for individual rights in industrial situations and simply look at its contribution to improving the industrial climate on a national basis, I think the Bill should have our support.  Its chief contribution must be in those areas where the employee is unprotected by union organisation; where the employee, he or she, is alone; where the employee can be defended by nothing other than the law.  It is to remedy the deficiency in our existing statutory law that this Bill is devised.</P>
