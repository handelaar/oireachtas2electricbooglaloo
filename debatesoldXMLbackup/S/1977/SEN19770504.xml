      <P>Since we last met, the country has suffered a sad loss by the death of His Eminence, William Cardinal Conway.  I am sure it would be the wish of all of us that we should record the deep regret felt by Seanad Éireann on the death of the late Cardinal.</P>
      <P>Cardinal Conway was a native of Belfast.  He was a man of outstanding academic achievement.  In the course of a distinguished career he held the posts of Professor of Moral Theology and Professor of Canon Law in St. Patrick's College, Maynooth.  His selection as Cardinal was a source of pride, joy and satisfaction to the whole country.  As Cardinal and Primate of All Ireland he displayed the qualities of the truly great.  Holding his high office at a time of undoubted difficulty, he gave courageous and faithful leadership without losing his inherent patience and gentleness.  He will be remembered as a great churchman, a strong and fearless leader, a talented teacher and a devoted and patient pastor.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Cathaoirleach to convey the deepest sympathy of Seanad Éireann to the Auxiliary Bishop of Armagh, the Most Reverend Dr. Lenny, and to the mother and relatives of the late Cardinal.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Fianna Fáil group in the Seanad I should like to associate myself with what has been said by the Leader of the House, Senator O'Higgins, particularly in regard to the man himself, <Col N="616" /> the late Cardinal Conway, Primate of All Ireland, who, during his period of primacy, in charge of the major church in this island, had to cope with a period of very profound change within the Church itself.  He coped with it successfully by combining a degree of realism and humanity in his administration of the Church during its period of change.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately during most of that time of primacy one had a period of almost revolutionary political developments causing great sorrow to all of us and he, in particular, must have suffered very intensely during that time which, unhappily, is still with us.  At all stages during that development he showed leadership and courage and maintained a sense of dignity, showing at all times his abhorrence of all things violent and at the same time emphasising the basic virtues of peace, tolerance and charity which alone can bring all of us on this island out of the sorrow of the past ten years.  He has set an example both within his Church and within the country.  He has given spiritual and political leadership.  We are very thankful to him for that.</P>

      <P>My associates in the Labour Party have asked me to join in the remarks on the Cardinal.  We believe that despite the trials and the coercive situations which imposed themselves on Northern Ireland society, the great Cardinal showed himself to be a man true to his purpose and loyal to all the people of Ireland, irrespective of creed or class, and that he was very compassionate in decisions which he had to make in very difficult circumstances. We recognise him as a man who was very tolerant and understanding and, as the Leader of the House and Senator Lenihan have said, he has brought something into the present situation in Ireland that will lay the basis for people to carry on in the future by his example.</P>

    <Title>National Agricultural Advisory, Education and Research Authority Bill, 1976: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a second time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Clinton) Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Clinton)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Clinton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The re-organisation of the agricultural advisory service was one of the matters awaiting resolution when I assumed office as Minister for Agriculture in 1973.  It had been the <Col N="618" /> subject of debate in agricultural circles for a very considerable time.  The solutions put forward were almost as numerous and diverse as their proponents, but if there was any common factor among the many suggestions submitted it was that the advisory service needed to be re-organised.</P>
      <P>It seemed to me that if any progress were to be made in this direction, it was high time to conclude the debate and come to a decision.  Having carefully considered the many opinions put forward and my responsibility as Minister to the Government, to the Oireachtas, to farmers as well as to the community as a whole, I lost no time in putting my proposals before the Government, who publicly endorsed my views in the form of a White Paper which was laid before this House in April 1975.  The measure now before you is intended to give legislative effect to Government policy as outlined in that document.</P>
      <P>The explanatory memorandum circulated to Senators gives particulars of the provisions of the Bill as introduced in the Dáil.  As you will observe, the measure now before you, following discussions in the Dáil and representations from other relevant quarters, includes a number of amendments and, accordingly, the text of the Bill as it now stands differs at a relatively small number of points from that as originally introduced.  I shall deal with these in detail in the course of my speech.  A close examination of every section of the Bill is scarcely necessary at this stage.  It should be sufficient merely to concern myself with the more important proposals.</P>
      <P>During the passage of the Bill through the Dáil considerable exception was taken, both in the Dáil itself and elsewhere, to the proposal that the agricultural research services should be amalgamated with the advisory and educational services.  Not only was it alleged that the proposals in the Bill, if implemented, would lead to undue interference in the day to day activities of the research service, but that&mdash;and this contention, in my view, was wholly dishonest&mdash;the research services would completely disappear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="619" /> Far from this being the case, the position is that the Bill proposes to extend the scope of these services by giving the authority additional functions in relation to veterinary research and plant breeding.  There is no intention to impede in any way the discretion of research officers in carrying out their duties, nor can any such intention be read into the Bill.  The initiation of any programme in relation to research, education or advice will rest with a board among whose members agricultural interests will predominate.</P>
    <P>The authority will be a very large organisation requiring large sums annually to finance them.  Most of this money will come from the Exchequer and it can scarcely be argued that, as the immediate custodian of the public interest in this connection, the Minister for Agriculture should not be concerned in the setting of priorities not only in relation to the research function but in relation to the advisory and education functions which also come within the province of the new organisation, and it is only in relation to these priorities that the Minister will have any function.  The board of the authority will bring their programme each year to the Minister. Naturally, the Minister will discuss the programme with the board and, having reached agreement with him, they will discuss what is possible to do and having received the necessary finance, the board will be completely free in carrying out the agreed programme.</P>
    <P>As to the contention that research should be entirely excluded from the authority's functions, it must be understood that much of the work carried out at present by the staff of the Agricultural Institute is associated with that of the advisory service and it is to the advantage of both that they should be in the same organisation.  A similar arrangement exists in several other countries for this very good reason.</P>
    <P>I am aware, that the Institute are somewhat dissatisfied with the slow uptake of new technology on Irish farms and are considering the adoption of a programme to correct this association with the advisory service. <Col N="620" /> It is quite obvious, therefore, that both services should be in the one organisation.</P>
    <P>Differences of opinion emerged in the course of the debate in the Dáil as to the proportion of elected representatives on committees of agriculture. The original proposal was that each committee should be composed equally of elected and non-elected members.  In deference to the views put forward since the introduction of the Bill in Dáil Éireann, an amendment has been inserted in the measure to provide that rural organisations will have the right to nominate 40 per cent of the members, the balance, at the discretion of the county council concerned, to be elected members.  This amendment is, in my opinion, a fair compromise and will result in better committees while retaining for the elected members a reasonable majority.</P>
    <P>Sections 33, 34 and 69 have been amended to meet objections raised both in the Dáil and by staff representatives. I want to say in relation to section 34 that a staff scheme is essential if the authority are to have an integrated staff, and such a scheme can be introduced only after full consultation with the staff.  The amendment to section 69 provides that the person appointed to hear complaints from transferred staff will be agreed by the Minister and the person making the complaint.  The procedure set out in this section gives any aggrieved person access to the widest possible appeals machinery.</P>
    <P>With regard to transferred staff, I wish to emphasise what I said during the Committee Stage in the Dáil that I could not give a guarantee that nobody at any time in the future will be changed from his present position to another.  I also said that I would be astonished if the new board or administration would want to kick everyone around from one part of the country to another.  It is my hope that should any difficulties arise it will be possible, assuming a modicum of good will, to have these resolved by discussion between the authority and staff representatives.</P>
    <P>I would visualise also that the <Col N="621" /> authority will adopt measures on the lines of those in operation in the civil service to mitigate the expense of moving house in the case of staff members whose headquarters may have to be transferred.  For my part, I would heartily endorse such an initiative.</P>
    <P>The existing advisory, education and research services have the common objective of making the maximum contribution to the welfare of the farming community and, therefore, it is necessary to group them together in one unit and to provide a common direction to ensure the necessary coordination and co-operation between them.  The existing network of agricultural colleges, research stations and farm training centres will have the greatest possible influence on farming in the surrounding areas.  Training courses at educational institutions will provide young farmers with the knowledge and skills which clearly already exist.  The advisory service will continue to keep the knowledge of practising farmers up to date and the task of the research arm will be to generate new knowledge as well as to provide answers to problems arising within the industry.</P>
    <P>These are the aims and objectives of the measure now before you.  I am satisfied that the Bill if enacted provides the best means of achieving these goals and I am confident that the enthusiastic support and co-operation from all concerned will ensure that the legislation now proposed will greatly benefit farmers and the agricultural industry as a whole.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Our view on this Bill as expressed in the Dáil, and which will be reiterated here, is that it was wrongly conceived and that it is a Bill which Fianna Fáil, if returned to Government, are committed to repeal.  It was not asked for in the form in which it now is in the White Paper which was laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas in April, 1975, to which the Minister referred, dealing with the whole question of agricultural advisory education and research facilities.  All the farming bodies concerned gave <Col N="622" /> their views on the White Paper and I quote from the second paragraph on page 1:</P>
      <P>An Foras Talúntais is already an autonomous organisation established in 1958 to review, facilitate, encourage, assist, co-ordinate, promote and undertake agricultural research.</P>
      <P>This is the key sentence.</P>
      <P>It was held at that time that agricultural research should be detached from the Department of Agriculture so that research could be initiated in any area of agriculture without fear of being hindered or prevented from doing so by Departmental or other pressures.  It also became clear, however, that a great need in agriculture was to get existing knowledge applied in the solution of problems of under-production, processing and marketing.  This influenced the programme followed by An Foras Talúntais after its establishment and striking advances have resulted.</P>
      <P>That White Paper, to which everybody subscribed on its production in April, 1975, on the first page emphasises the fact that (a) An Foras Talúntais, as an autonomous, independent organisation, has achieved striking advances by reason of the independence which they were guaranteed in the area of research and development under the Act establishing them in 1958.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was made possible by the generosity of the American Government at the time who gave the funds initially to establish the institute.  The terms of reference for the giving of those funds initially, and the basis on which the then Taoiseach, the late Éamon de Valera, who took a personal interest, introduced the Bill in the Seanad and the Dáil, was to establish an independent research institute. That was the view held by his predecessor, Deputy James Dillon, who was Minister for Agriculture.  He had the same view in the preparation of the Bill establishing the institute throughout 1956 and 1957.  We happened to come into Government in 1957 and in 1958 the then Taoiseach took such a personal interest in it.  The <Col N="623" /> whole basis for the Agricultural Institute Bill of that year was the establishment of an independent institute.  They have made, in the Minister's own words in the White Paper, striking advances in the years since their establishment and yet we now have the Bill which has been introduced here which, to put it bluntly, is removing that independence which would properly attach to a research and development institute such as the Agricultural Institute.</P>
    <P>In case anybody thinks that this is just Senator Lenihan giving his views, we have in all of today's daily newspapers a display advertisement from the research staff of An Foras Talúntais. It is a very unprecedented step and certainly it must be an unprecedented measure that has forced people of this calibre to set out, to use their own words, &ldquo;their grave reservations&rdquo; about the Bill before the House.  I quote from the advertisement:</P>
    <P>We have consistently objected to the principle of abolishing An Foras Talúntais, for which no convincing reasons have been advanced.</P>
    <P>They say that they have made representations to the Department of Agriculture and have failed to get the Minister to amend the most undesirable features of the Bill.  This research staff are going to be the key people on whom the whole future of agricultural research and development will depend. The people who signed the advertisement in today's daily papers have written to the Minister confirming that they are personally and professionally committed to the role of research in agricultural development.  They reiterate their fears and suggest certain specific matters which are again frustrated by a number of sections in the Bill, as I propose to illustrate. They want statutory provision for the appointment of a deputy director in charge of research.  In other words, they want to take research away from the maw of the Department of Agriculture. They want the allocation of a clearly identifiable research budget, again to take research away from the maw of the Department of Agriculture and their bureaucrats.  They want determination <Col N="624" /> of the programme by the board of the authority and not by the Minister for Agriculture and his bureaucrats.  They want the appointment of staff to be left to the board of the authority in accordance with the Industrial Democracy Bill.  That is reasonable enough.  They want consultation between the Minister and the board on matters of general agricultural policy.  They want industrial relations in line with those of the existing negotiations framework in the institute.</P>
    <P>That advertisement was signed by headquarter's staff, by the staffs at the Economics and Rural Welfare Research Centre, the Kinsealy Research Centre, the Dunsinea Centre, the Western Research Centre, Johnston Castle, Oakpark and Moore-park Research Centres.  It is outrageous that in a democratic community a Bill as important as this&mdash; this is a major Bill&mdash;can advance to the stage of being debated and passed through various stages in the Dáil and come to the Seanad and we find that practically the whole expert professional research staff involved in this totally new situation&mdash;the abolition of their institute&mdash;have not had basic dialogue leading to some sensible decisions on the part of the Minister of an Irish Government.</P>
    <P>It is also outrageous that a bureaucratic machine, using the Minister as a label, can steamroll a measure of this kind through the Oireachtas.  This represents the greatest danger to democracy.  I will go into the merits of the Bill afterwards, but it should not happen that at this stage practically all the staff involved in this Bill should make such a definitive statement and express it in the public press, having expressed it already in letter form to the Minister and to most of the Members of this and the other House.  That should not happen.  I am sure those people feel that they have been &ldquo;conned&rdquo; because there is nothing in the White Paper, which was published in 1975, to indicate that this sort of drastic surgery would be carried out on an institute which had served the country very well and indeed in a striking manner.</P>
    <P>The White Paper on the first page refers to an institute that have gained <Col N="625" /> an international reputation, that have done remarkably good as far as Irish farming is concerned in the past 20 years.  I should like to include in that the man who supervised that institute over a number of years while that development took place, Dr. Tom Walsh.  He was a man of outstanding integrity, ability and comprehension, both in the intellectual sense and in the practical sense, and who surrounded himself with people of excellent quality and built up an institute that could not have been built up were it not for their autonomy and independence, particularly in the area of research.</P>
    <P>In my view there is an overwhelmingly powerful argument to maintain an institute such as An Foras Talúntais independent from a Department of State.  It is all-important that people engaged in research should be able to follow through on projects without hindrance or interference. It is important that they should not be switched away from work which they consider of great fundamental importance merely at the whim of administrative bureaucrats who decide that some other course is necessary and possibly that the money could be spent better.  That would mean diverting resources and directing people engaged in research and development work into areas which may appear to be appropriate to the bureaucrats of the day but may be absolutely wrong from the long term research and agricultural development purposes with which these people are concerned.</P>
    <P>This is the classical example of departmental interference with an autonomous institution which can do its research excellently well if given an overall budget as heretofore and is set to get on with the job.  It is part of the craze which has arisen since the Devlin Report on the re-organisation of the public service, part of a general craze on the part of the administration and bureaucracy to put their hands on all the independent institutions which have rendered good service.  Nowhere is it more ill-deserved or ill-thought out than in the case of this institution engaged in the <Col N="626" /> work of research.  By reason of the nature of the work involved this is a type of work which cannot be subject to the day to day minutiae and directives of civil servants in Government Departments.  Research is work which, inevitably, has to be of a long drawn out nature, particularly in the area of agricultural research.</P>
    <P>I do not have to be an agriculturalist to emphasise that this is the type of research which takes years to work out.  It cannot be simply defined on a departmental file to produce results in &ldquo;X&rdquo; weeks or months. Research in the area of genetics and breeding is not the sort of thing one settles overnight.  It is a matter of checking and working out on an empirical basis over a number of years the particular strain necessary, or the type of food input necessary or fertiliser required.  They must test out various strands of grasses and so on.  There are so many variables of investigation and research involved in this type of work that it cannot be subjected to day to day departmental direction or interference.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say I am raising a hare that does not exist in the Bill. I will go through the Bill section by section to show that the hare of ministerial interference or direction is there in many sections.  There is no personal reflection in this; it means bureaucratic interference and direction.  Section 10 states that The Institute is hereby dissolved. Under section 9 a body to be known as the National Agricultural Advisory, Education and Research Authority is established.  An Foras Talúntais is an independent institute with no ties to the Minister other than a grant.  A combination of financial support from the American Government, initially under the Marshall Aid Funds and, subsequently, from the Minister as is the case with every independent university.  That independent institute devoted to research is dissolved. We then have a new animal created by this Bill we are examining. The authority has general functions under section 11.  In subsection (1) of section 12 we have the transfer to this authority of various agricultural educational functions which were being exercised by the Minister and committees <Col N="627" /> of agriculture.  Subsection (1) (e) states:</P>
    <P>provide scholarships to students of agriculture at institutions of higher education, or such other institutions as may be approved by the Minister;</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) provides that the authority:</P>
    <P>shall not, except with the prior approval of the Minister, provide courses in higher education or courses which in the opinion of the Minister are of an equivalent standard....</P>
    <P>Under section 13 the authority must co-operate with other educational institutions while section 15 deals with the advisory functions.  In regard to the advisory services we have a situation where the Minister now proposes, through this creature of his, to absorb the advisory services at present administered by county committees of agriculture. That will be done under section 15 which states:</P>
    <P>Without prejudice to the generality of section 11, the Authority shall, in relation to agricultural advice and instruction, have such functions as, immediately before the commencement of this section, were exercised or performed or were capable of being exercised or performed by committees of agriculture or by the Minister....</P>
    <P>It is proposed that the authority take over the functions of the committees of agriculture in regard to advisory services.  I intend to return to the other take-over aspect later.  Section 16 deals with the question of liaison with other agencies.</P>
    <P>Section 17 involves the research functions and under subsection (1) the authority is given the function to deal with agricultural research and basic veterinary research.  Subsection (2) deals with the whole series of powers the authority may exercise in conjunction with the carrying out of this function in regard to agricultural and veterinary research.  The various provisions set out in subsection (2) are excellent.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) states:</P>
    <P>In case of doubt as to whether <Col N="628" /> any activity in relation to veterinary research is or is not proper to the Authority, the decision of the Minister shall be final.</P>
    <P>That, in fact, effectively brings this body totally under the control of the Minister as far as that major area of research is concerned.  There is nothing so blunt or bureaucratic as that simple statement in subsection (3).  A whole series of admirable functions are set out under subsection (2) but subsection (3) states:</P>
    <P>In case of doubt as to whether any activity in relation to veterinary research is or is not proper to the Authority, the decision of the Minister shall be final.</P>
    <P>That means that the Minister can direct the type of veterinary research to be carried out by this body.  Instead of an agricultural institute functioning as it is at present through the various centres involved in very advanced and progressive veterinary investigation and research, under this new creature of the Minister his decision, the Minister's, shall be final.  That will be a bureaucratic or administration decision.  The Minister will direct that a particular line of veterinary research shall be stopped if he so wishes.  The Minister can direct the new body not to spend money on a particular programme of veterinary research and his decision is final.  This can happen like that in the way the Minister has chopped the staff in the course of bringing in this legislation. This can be administered at the drop of a hat by the bureaucracy at any stage in regard to any programme of veterinary research in which this new body would be engaged.  The wording could not be clearer; the decision of the Minister shall be final.  That is the end of that story as far as this body is concerned.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce is brought into this with the Minister in subsection (6):</P>
    <P>If there is disagreement as to whether any activity in relation to research is proper to the Authority or the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards the matter shall be determined by the Minister and the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="629" /> The two branches of bureaucracy are brought into it in that subsection to decide whether or not there is an impingement by this new Institute on the work of another Institute, the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards.  That is a totally wrong sort of impingement because it is obvious that in the area of research one cannot contain research in a single channel.  The work of any genuine research institute, such as the Agricultural Institute, will bear on other areas such as those administered by the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards.  The Devlin Report cannot be applied to institutes of this kind.  That report deals with Departments of State and administrative efficiency.  One cannot impose administrative efficiency of that kind on an institution of this kind or the work involved in research and development assigned to an institute like this.</P>
    <P>Under section 19 there is the assignment of specific activities and the Minister tells them specifically what to do under this section:</P>
    <P>The Authority may, on such terms and conditions as the Minister may with the consent of the Minister for the Public Service, approve, arrange for the performance of any activity in relation to any of its functions by the Minister or by another agency.</P>
    <P>Under subsection (2):</P>
    <P>(2)  The Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for the Public Service, prepare a list of activities of the Authority which may at the request of the Authority, be performed by the Minister or by another agency....</P>
    <P>We have the Minister coming in again on the assignment of specific activities under that section.</P>
    <P>Section 20 which relates to the assignment of additional functions states:</P>
    <P>The Minister may, subject to the consent of the Minister for the Public Service, on such terms and conditions as he may determine, by order assign to the Authority such <Col N="630" /> of his functions as he may think fit in relation to Council Directive...</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture, and the Minister for the Public Service, may assign functions on their terms to the authority.  Section 26 sets out the composition of the board of the Authority and deals with the appointments by the Minister and the Minister for Education.  There is complete control by the Ministers in regard to appointments and nominations, apart from the members representative of agricultural and rural organisations, but the Minister, and the Minister for Education, are in on the actual appointments.</P>
    <P>Section 27 deals with the chairman and his conditions, again subject to consent of the Minister for the Public Service.  Section 30 deals with the powers and duties of the board.  That section states that the board shall&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  exercise general supervision over the work of the Authority and be responsible for the attainment of the objectives of the Authority and the completion and implementation of such educational, advisory and research programmes as may, in accordance with section 32, he adopted with the approval of the Minister,</P>
    <P>The board, under section 30, must:</P>
    <P>(f)  afford free access, at all reasonable times, to its lands and premises to any duly authorised officer of the Minister, give him such information as he may reasonably require for the satisfactory discharge of his duties in relation to the finances of the Authority and allow him to examine such documents and records as he may reasonably consider necessary for that purpose.</P>
    <P>The Minister's authorised officer must be given free access to go in and generally move around the institute. Section 31 deals with the director of the authority, the key man, the sort of man it is hoped will be able to do a job similar to the magnificent job done by Dr. Tom Walsh over the years as Director General.  This director will be chief officer of the authority, but under subsection (3).</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="631" /> The first Director shall be appointed by the Minister....</P>
    <P>There is no such thing as consultation procedure or examination procedure or other educational, university, research or farming organisations being brought into it.  The first director shall be appointed by the Minister, and that is that.  Everything will be determined by the Minister in regard to terms and conditions.  Subsections (3) (4) and (5) all relate to the director to be appointed by the Minister.  That is the final chop off in relation to the independent, autonomous work that has been done by Dr. Tom Walsh and his excellent staff in the Agricultural Institute over the years.  From now on this man will be appointed by the Minister and his Department.  The institute is suitably coralled in its early years by section 31 (3).  It is not just for the early years that the coralling will be effective because subsection (6) states:</P>
    <P>Every Director, other than the first Director, shall, subject to the approval of the Minister, be appointed by the Board.</P>
    <P>The first director will be appointed directly by the Minister without consultation. There will be no advice or anything of that kind.  Every subsequent director of this new institute, replacing a fine institution, can only be appointed with the approval of the Minister.  That is some board.  If ever a board was appointed to be merely a creature of the bureaucracy this board is one.  This body is expected to emulate the magnificent work&mdash;&ldquo;the striking advances&rdquo;, to quote the Minister's own White Paper, already made by the Agricultural Institute.  This new organisation is now expected to emulate this and while, at the same time, is being hogtied and spancelled to the bureaucracy of the Department of Agriculture in regard to the appointment of the first director and the appointment of each subsequent director.</P>
    <P>There will not be much imagination or investigation into research or development for the benefit of Irish farming if we are going to translate some administrative person who is in a <i>cul-de-sac</i> in the Department of Agriculture, <Col N="632" /> put him in charge of the Agricultural Institute and tell him to get on with the job.  &ldquo;This is what has to be done and here is your budget.&rdquo; That is not what research or development is about nor is it looking into the problems of Irish agriculture. That is transferring the dead hand of bureaucracy into an autonomous independent institution that should be doing work for Irish agriculture.  Section 31 effectively hogties the director for years.</P>
    <P>Section 32 deals with the annual programme of activities.  We are now bringing them totally within the civil service maw in that normally a research body has a number of years in which to prepare programmes and work them out on a planned basis, the only way research can be done.  But in respect of each financial year, under section 32, the board shall prepare a programme in such form as the Minister may require of the projected activities of the authority in that year. We are bringing the major research institute here into our major industry, agriculture, and that is what it should always be called, an industry.  We are bringing this institute into the sort of situation that would obtain in regard to running the gate to the Minister's office, or something like that.  The section states that the board shall prepare, in respect of each financial year, a programme, in such form as the Minister may require, of the projected activities of the authority in that year.  What do the board do?  The board produce for some principal officer in the Department of Agriculture for the next year, as required by the Minister, the activities for the coming year.  The section continues:</P>
    <P>The programme as adopted by the Board shall be submitted to the Minister for his approval.  The Minister may, in conveying approval, indicate such further amendments of the programme as he considers necessary.</P>
    <P>The board are given some independence, however, because they may:</P>
    <P>with the approval of the Minister, make such alterations in the programme as it subsequently considers necessary.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="633" /> The board have got this independence that they may, with the approval of the Minister, make such alterations as they consider necessary.  After submitting the programme to the Minister for his approval they may then, with his approval, prepare further amendments. This is gobbledegook of the first order and bureaucracy gone mad.  This has been ill-considered by the democratic representative of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Minister in charge of agriculture has allowed a totally bureaucratic piece of legislation to be imposed on him to the detriment of Irish agriculture, education and research.</P>
    <P>The Minister, who cannot get out of any part of the Bill, is referred to in subsection (4), which states:</P>
    <P>The Minister may fix a date on or before which the programme in respect of the succeeding year must be submitted to him.</P>
    <P>The Minister is referred to in every subsection of section 32 in relation to the preparation not just of a programme of research but of an annual programme of activities of what is supposed to be a major research institute.</P>
    <P>Even on the question of staff, dealt with in section 34 the Minister comes in in respect of remuneration and allowances, with the concurrence of the Minister for the Public Service.  In regard to staff schemes, under section 34, similarly the Minister, and the Minister for the Public Service, must approve of them.  The same thing applies to superannuation also.</P>
    <P>Committees of agriculture are referred to in section 36.  We have a situation in which, effectively, the committees of agriculture are being subsumed in this situation.  Along with the Minister putting his paw into the whole area of research and obliterating An Foras Talúntais as it now stands and effectively as I have outlined taking over research, now the other paw is going into the advisory services and eliminating the committees of agriculture, democratically established institutions of our country, from the scene as well. Of course they will always be there <Col N="634" /> and will go through procedures and have them elected and so on.  There is no interference with that, but they will be mere lillies in the pond to be gazed at without any power because the real power is taken from them by section 36 (4) of this Bill.  I do not know what they are going to call the new body although I believe it is some disastrous name, NAAERA but it will subsume and take over the committees of agriculture.  The Act of 1931, as amended under section 37, and various sections subsequent to that, effectively copperfastens and buttons down the committees of agriculture to be nothing more than fronts in which the people, and in particular the ordinary decent elected representatives, are gulled into the notion that they are on committees of agriculture with some power when, in fact, they have no power.</P>
    <P>It would be more honest to have eliminated them altogether, because the Minister has effectively truncated and emasculated them and left them with no power.  They will have their meetings in the county town, have a few drinks, and go home, but they will have no power and the Minister knows that as well as I do.  The Minister is dishonestly pretending to have regard for local democracy and local members of county committees.  It is a rather futile arrangement for these people to waste their day travelling to the county town to meet and have no power of appointment, or control, or direction in regard to the advisory service.  They have been effectively emasculated by the Bill.</P>
    <P>This is a two-pronged attack by the bureaucracy.  It is an attack by the Department of Agriculture to take over the independant autonomous areas of research which were the purview of An Foras Talúntais heretofore and also an attack by them on local democracy to emasculate and truncate the powers of county committees of agriculture. At two levels the bureaucrats have effectively moved and incorporated the two-pronged attack into one Bill here before this House.</P>

      <P>We all know that.  Let us not have any more fictions introduced into the debate; I am talking about reality.  The purpose of having a debate in Houses like this is to have a degree of reality in the debate.  The reality of the matter is that this is an intrusion by the bureaucracy of the Department of Agriculture into an independent research and development institution known as An Foras Talúntais at one level.  It is an incursion by the same Department and its bureaucrats into the committees of agriculture at another level.  That is what this Bill is about.  I hope the language is not too plain.  It is the purpose of people contributing to democratic debate to make the legislation under discussion plain so that people understand what is involved. We are here to explain the real meaning behind measures of this kind.  In relation to the financial aspects the Minister has total control.  Section 44 provides:</P>
      <P>(1)  The Board shall prepare, in respect of each financial year, an estimate in such form as the Minister may require of&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the moneys required to meet the expenses of the Authority.</P>
      <P>And subsection (3) of section 44 provides:</P>
      <P>The estimate when adopted by the Board shall be submitted to the Minister for his approval.</P>
      <P>Subsection (4) states:</P>
      <P>The Minister, in conveying his approval, shall indicate such (if any) amendments of the estimate as he considers necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the estimate is submitted to the Minister, he can tell them to cut certain parts and can say what he considers to be necessary.  Why have the board at all, weak creature that it will be?  Why not let it die entirely? Section 10 is the best liquidation section I have ever seen in a Bill&mdash;&ldquo;the institute is hereby dissolved&rdquo;. <Col N="636" /> That may as well be the Bill.  It might have been better to leave it at that and bring in a one-section Bill&mdash;&ldquo;The Institute is hereby dissolved.&rdquo;  We would not have been put through all the pain of debating legislation to set up a new authority which will be entirely the creature of the Minister.  If the institute is hereby dissolved we can debate that issue and let the Minister and the Department take it over altogether.  We could have a two-section Bill&mdash;the Institute is hereby dissolved; the county committees of agriculture are hereby dissolved.  That is really the purpose of this legislation.</P>
    <P>I am sorry for boring the House but I had to deal with the aspect of finance because, basically, this is where the real power lies.  Under subsection (4) of section 44 the Minister, in conveying his approval, will indicate what he wants chopped.  Then the Board get a little bit of independence &mdash;they may:</P>
    <P>with the consent of the Minister, incure expenditure that&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  is not provided for in the estimate as originally approved by the Minister but is subsequently considered necessary, or</P>
    <P>(b)  exceed the total net expenditure originally approved by the Minister, if such excess is subsequently considered necessary.</P>
    <P>They can provide for something only if it is considered necessary by the Minister at a later stage.</P>
    <P>Section 45 deals with the annual programmes and in section 46 the Minister fixes the date on which the estimate is to be submitted to him. Section 47 deals with the county committees, and then we go on to the State endowment of the authority.  The Minister is, of course, involved here and he is also involved in section 49 in regard to expenses.  He and his colleague, the Minister for Finance, are involved in section 50 in regard to power to borrow.  The authority may borrow only with the consent of the Minister and the Minister for Finance.  Their audits and accounts must be kept in such form as the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Finance agree.  The reality is that there is total financial control. <Col N="637" /> There are certain consequential and transitional functions later on which I do not propose to go into because the same kind of intrusion continues in the detail of various other procedures.</P>
    <P>It is very sad that we should be debating a matter of this kind.  I was in this House when the Agricultural (An Foras Talúntais) Bill was introduced by Éamon de Valera in 1958. It was a very high level debate.  There was general agreement with the Bill on all sides.  Deputy Dillon supported it in the other House.  I will be referring to excerpts from it at a later stage. The whole tenor of the debate concerned the importance of setting up this institute on an independent basis. The independence and autonomy of An Foras Talúntais was the most emphasised point when the legislation setting up the now to be dissolved institute was debated in the Dáil and Seanad.  It was brought in by the late Mr. de Valera in the Dáil and supported by Deputy Dillon&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Aiken was the Acting Minister for Agriculture.  I am just reading his speech.  It is fascinating. He said everything that Senator Lenihan is now saying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Aiken was in the Dáil.  Seán Moylan who was Minister for Agriculture had died and Deputy Aiken handled it in the Dáil. Deputy de Valera handled it in the Seanad and Deputy Dillon spoke on it in the Dáil and I spoke on it here in the Seanad.  There was total agreement on that Bill on the basis that it would achieve what is set out here in the Minister's White Paper.  It would achieve striking advances in regard to Irish agriculture.  One of the major factors in the progress of Irish agriculture over the past 20 years has been the striking contribution made by this institute by way of the research and investigation, which was done not just on a national but on an international plane; the co-ordination of information and research with all the other leading agricultural countries throughout the world; the bringing in of experts and specialists from New Zealand, Holland and Denmark and the exchange of our people with their <Col N="638" /> institutes throughout the world.  The gathering of this knowledge was not inhibited in any way by bureaucratic or civil service interference.  When genuine results had been achieved and definite opinions reached, the information was passed on to the Department of Agriculture, the county committees and the farmers throughout the country.</P>
      <P>I would like to inquire about who is going to look after farmers' education in the future.  The universities have shown no great inclination to invest in this area. They have neglected the whole area of the professional training and education of farmers.  In the future the institute, if it remained as it was, could have achieved enormous results in this area.  I am told that they had programmes of work in this direction. This whole area has been grievously neglected over the years.</P>
      <P>There are many areas in Irish agriculture which need to be investigated. It is fundamentally important that we should have a thriving agriculture backed up by the most expert research and specialists with top-class advice and information, with top-class training and education for farmers and teachers in agriculture and for the whole processing side of agriculture as well as the industrial.  To give the Minister credit, he wants that to be achieved as well.  But my point is that it cannot be achieved by a body that is hogtied in every section of this Bill to the bureaucracy and the administration; a body that has to submit every project for approval before embarking on it; a body whose programme of activities has to be subjected to the approval of the Minister and his Department; a body who cannot move outside an annual preparation of financial investments and preparation of projects.  That is a body which is replacing one that had this relative independence in regard to finance, in regard to its research and development projects and its administration.  We are going backwards instead of forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sensible thing to do is to improve the facilities available to An Foras Talúntais instead of embarking on a slow process of strangulation. <Col N="639" /> This is what the Minister's Department have been trying to do to the Agricultural Institute since it was established.  The fact that a magnificent man emerged in the leadership of An Foras Talúntais is no reason for any politics of envy in the Department of Agriculture <i>vis-a-vis</i> that institute's activities or that man's capabilities and achievements.</P>
    <P>The attempted strangulation over a long period of years has borne fruition in a Bill designed to kill any imagination, any progressive development and any real forward thinking in regard to the research and development that is so essential for Irish agriculture of the future.  The Department of Agriculture and Finance between them have been trying for some years to do this and we would not allow it, but they have now succeeded in the form of a Bill which is nearly an Act of Parliament.  That is one Bill or Act which will not last long if there is a change of Government.</P>
    <P>This time the Minister has allowed himself to be subsumed by departmental thinking, and not just in the Department of Agriculture.  I know the institute has been a target of the Department of Finance for several years now and this was resisted years ago by a Government who knew how to resist these people.  If the Department of Finance and the Department of Agriculture between them achieve the final strangulation of a worth-while experiment that has been very fruitful as far as Ireland is concerned over the past 20 years, then I regard it as a very sad thing that we should be present at the demise of an institute of which this country can certainly be proud.  To see its demise being deplored by the great majority of people employed in it is certainly a very sad aspect of public and personnel relations between the Minister and his Department and these employees.  Some of the foremost experts in the world in regard to Irish agriculture put their names to that. These people are experts on agricultural education and research.  Their action at this stage cannot be anything but a reflection of the sort of attitude of mind that exists <i>vis-a-vis</i> the administration <Col N="640" /> and any independent body that wants to show its worth and mettle in this country.  Independence and autonomy are essential for a body of this kind. It is certainly very sad that, associated with the demise of this body, we see disillusionment on the part of the staff and we see a new body being established that is nothing more than a creature of the Minister.  It will be hogtied to the Department of Agriculture regarding financial development and investment aspects and in regard to funds and will be subject to administrative rather than research criteria as far as its work in the future is concerned.</P>
    <P>We will certainly oppose this at every stage.  We put down a number of amendments.  Hopefully we will go through the parliamentary process here and if the electoral process is fruitful we will do what requires to be done with this Bill after the election.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PierceButler" hpid="Mr. Butler Mr. Butler">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to Senator Lenihan, one would think from his contribution that the Minister for Agriculture should have no function as far as agricultural production is concerned and that the Agricultural Institute never approached the Department of Agriculture and never put forward and discussed a programme with the people in the Department of Agriculture before this Bill was introduced.  Of course they did.  Of course the Minister for Agriculture had a say, and so had the Minister for Finance, before the introduction of this Bill.  When money was being allocated, naturally the Minister for Finance had to be consulted.  Let us forget the argument that this is new.  It is not new.  The heart of this Bill is good.  All that is necessary is in this Bill.  It is necessary that production will be developed.  When we look back at the great development in agriculture over the last 20 years, we must admit that it could have been better.  We would like to see a greater development in agriculture from now on.  This board will have an important function in this.  All farming organisations and the people involved in production and the sale of agricultural products will be represented on this board and will have a vital say in what <Col N="641" /> is necessary for agricultural production in Ireland.</P>
      <P>I think if we look at the whole field of agricultural development over the past few years&mdash;I am involved in one section of it myself&mdash;we can see that there must be over one million acres land in Ireland that is producing almost nothing.  If that is the case, then something must be done about it and some organisation must be set up to examine what has gone wrong and what is necessary in future.  I think this Bill will do that.</P>
      <P>Research is necessary but unless the results of research go down to the farmer level, then it is no good.  There is no point in writing books about research if the farmer has not the opportunity or is not educated enough to read and assimilate the results of that research.  This new board will be a very important section of the Agricultural Institute.  We also look at animal production in Ireland.  Looking back over a number of years we can see that the annual produce from the cow has not improved very much. The yield per cow in the west of Ireland is only 450 gallons.  Even in the Golden Vale and the Mitchelstown area the annual yield per cow is only 600 gallons.  Nobody can say that is a good yield for cows.  We must examine the situation and say why that is so. Research is necessary but the results of that research must follow down the line and the advisory people must go out and advise the farmers.  Out of research comes knowledge and that knowledge must be disseminated not just by publishing the findings in documentation form, but by word of mouth in the language that the ordinary farmer of Ireland will understand. That is the important thing.  It is obvious that the ordinary Irish farmer must not have understood in full the findings of that research because the development of agriculture in Ireland is at a very low ebb.</P>
      <P>I am glad that education is included in the Bill.  Education is vitally necessary because without education people will not be able to assimilate knowledge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board should be comprised of representatives from advisory and <Col N="642" /> research organisations, from farming organisations and from processing bodies, as well as marketing and consumer organisations.  The agricultural sector will benefit by having such representations on the board, as will people in other sectors of the community.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the value of one acre's produce.  Given one cow per acre, yielding 600 gallons at 50p a gallon, we are talking of something in the region of £300 per acre.  This figure would be only £200 per acre in the west of Ireland.  Therefore, we must get that 1,000,000 acres in full production so that it will benefit the country in general.  It is accepted by everyone that we do not have full development in agriculture.  Why is that so?  It is because the organisations which I mentioned were not represented on the board so that all available information could be passed on to the ordinary Irish farmer.  I hope there will be representatives on the board of the groups I have already mentioned.  The consumer has a contribution to make, too, because what the consumer wants the consumer will get.</P>
    <P>The heart of the Bill is definitely good.  There must be some type of amalgamation of those engaged in research and advisory work and education. There is so much work to be done and the need is so urgent that the Bill should be passed as quickly as possible.  I consider that the officials of the Department of Agriculture, who were castigated in the Dáil and here, have done a reasonably good job.  I say this because I know many of them through my work.  I know the interest they take in the development of agriculture.  I know that it is easy to approach them if a person wants advice.  I would stand side by side with the officials whom I meet.  They are doing an excellent job.  When you condemn the Department of Agriculture you condemn their officials also.</P>

      <P>I can see it hurts some people, but what I am saying is true. I want to see agricultural development taking place.  My heart is in agriculture and I know that so much can be done.</P>
      <P>People engaged in the educational sector are interested in this Bill because they have a vital part to play. The people being educated will convey the necessary information through the board of this authority to the people. This Bill is essentially good.  It may need an amendment or two but time will tell.  We must see the board in action before we can say that this or that amendment is necessary.  The agricultural colleges are to be taken over by this authority and it is necessary to do something in that field.  I spent a year in the agricultural college in Ballyhaise and it was a most enlightening year.  I learned from that college a love of agriculture.  I feel that agricultural colleges have a vital part to play in educating Irish farmers.  The young farmers are interested in attending agricultural colleges and they would be even more interested if they knew how much they would benefit from attending them.  I believe that the future holds good for the young farmers and that they will receive the knowledge they require through the influence of this board.  I have spoken about milk production, because this is the area I know best but all other areas of production can be developed to a great extent.  It will be necessary for all the interests represented on the board to consider what should be done. I am sure those who will represent the research authority will be able to advise those who will represent the advisory service and education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be important also that the advisory people and those involved in education be able to advise those in research on what they should be doing.  A free flow of information is necessary, from the farmer to the board <Col N="644" /> which will represent all of those sections. If such a free flow does not take place we cannot, and will not, get what our land can produce.  If our land does not get what is necessary out of this board then we will all suffer, even those who have little to gain from the land.  However, we all have something to gain from the land because there is a flow from agriculture into every Department.  The greater the flow, the greater the benefits accruing to every Department and to our people.  Let us accept that something is necessary to allow this to take place.  Having accepted it, let us see what we should do about it.  I believe this Bill is a step in the right direction to get all those organisations together around the table to discuss what is necessary for the development of Irish agriculture so that we may all benefit.  I shall have more to say on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>If I were Minister for Agriculture I would try to project, to the best of my ability, an image that would be received well by farmers small and large all over the country.  It is the duty of a Minister for Agriculture to fight to the last for the wellbeing of the people he represents in Government.  As Minister for Agriculture he is answerable to all of our farmers.</P>
      <P>It would be very wrong if any Member of the Oireachtas was inhibited in any way from criticising any Department of State.  The Department of Agriculture should not be immune any more than any other Department.  If some reference is made by a Senator on either side of the House to activities of various branches of the Department of Agriculture it should not be laid at such Senator's feet that they were being disrespectful to any of the officials who work in these departments.  It would be wrong to suggest that any elected representative here would not be free to criticise these people if he felt it necessary.  The Minister is here to defend them and it is his duty to defend them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Butler made reference to agricultural production here.  Let me remind the Senator that the cattle <Col N="645" /> population dropped drastically in the last four years.  Let me also remind him and the Minister that the farming community got a very severe knock since the Minister came to office, particularly by virtue of his representation of us in the EEC.  Milk processors here got away with millions of pounds while the ordinary farmers were fleeced.  The Minister for Agriculture did not lift a finger to save them.  On his return from Brussels recently he dangled before the electorate some great concessions he has won for farmers.  Let our farmers not forget that that was the reason they have not advanced in the past couple of years. We entered into the EEC; we were on the threshold of great expansion; that was the time the Minister should have been moving ensuring, as did his Italian counterpart and others, that we got a fair crack of the whip.  This Bill relates to various facets of farming and, in particular, production. We would all like to see farming advancing.  It is and has been the backbone of this country.</P>
    <P>Senator Butler referred to cattle, milk production and so on.  He quoted, I think, a figure of 600 and perhaps 200 or 300 for the west.  I am sure he realises that there is a vast difference in the quality of soil in different parts of the country.  Surely he is aware there are 12 undeveloped counties and that the soil there is not on a par with what is to be found in the Golden Vale or around the east coast or southern parts where there is a climate more suitable to dairying.  Let us remember that the people in the west have tried very hard to eke out an existence on their very small farms; they are very hard-working people.  If the figures for production were compared it would be found that it was the farmers who had the greatest production. Senator Butler&mdash;being in the milk field&mdash;should be so aware.  I am in total agreement with anything any Minister for Agriculture could do to advance the interests of our farmers.</P>
    <P>Let us not forget that the Government, as far as I am aware, are trying to drive a wedge between the farmers and ordinary workers, which is bad for the nation as a whole.  The <Col N="646" /> farmer is an essential component in the make-up of this community.  It is wrong for any Government&mdash;no matter what they think about gaining votes&mdash; to try to pretend that price increases and so on are going into the farmers' pockets.  They are not.  Workers are very essential; we all have friends and relations, workers, in unions; we like to see them getting on well.  But remember that many of their jobs are dependent on agriculture.  This Bill will, we hope, benefit agriculture and, in time, produce extra jobs for our people.  It is in the field of agriculture that the greatest advance will be made because it takes up to £5,000 to put a worker into an industrial job.</P>
    <P>An Foras Talúntais was set up in 1958 to do a specific job.  They were very highly educated men in their field. Their main object was to undertake research into agriculture and subjects pertaining to it.  If we now have better herds of cattle, more and healthier cattle to sell, it was that body which was responsible.  The same could be said regarding the other areas of agriculture where great advances have been made in the scientific field.  These men have carried out experiments over a long period.  It was necessary that there be a long span between them so that they could tabulate the results of their research in an intelligent manner to be deciphered by and implemented for the benefit of farming in general.  They did their job very well.  They were an autonomous body. They were given a certain amount of money which as we know was backed up by the American people at that time, later helped by the ordinary taxpayers.</P>
    <P>The benefits accruing from that experiment were of vast potential and importance as far as Irish farming was concerned.  Indeed we should feel proud that our men in that institute were associated with other well-known figures in farming all over the world.  We have a particular climate, soil and various other advantages.  It was very important for our farmers that we should have personnel dedicated to their advancement, the improvement of techniques, output and so on and, at the same time, the retention of <Col N="647" /> a fair proportion of our population on the land is of great importance.</P>
    <P>It is sad to see an efficient body such as that being gobbled up in this new type of board the Minister is about to launch.  While members of the board may be senior officers in the Department of Agriculture and are highly educated, there should have been room on the board for the ordinary man in the field.  We are too fond of getting away from the man who drives a tractor, ploughs the land, reaps the harvest and milks his cattle seven days a week.  It is very important that farmers, being the large body they are, holding such a key position so far as production is concerned, should have a much bigger representation on the board.  Elected representatives of the county committees of agriculture should also be represented.  There is nobody with the same freedom, who can criticise in as helpful a way, without ruffling the person being criticised, the public representative. These people go before the electorate to gain appointment to a committee of agriculture.  It is unfortunate that the Minister did not ensure that they had at least 50 per cent representation on the board.</P>
    <P>I am from rural Ireland.  I have met people all over Ireland and, indeed, Europe, who have been at universities, people with strings of degrees longer than their names.  Yet one can meet a rural man who would have more common sense, an essential ingredient for any board, who would ensure that it functions well for the benefit of the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>For that reason I am very critical of the composition of this board, certainly very critical of the fact that An Foras Talúntais is being swallowed into it.  There are to be 24 members on this board.  As far as I know, every one of those members will be appointed by the Minister&mdash;I am subject to correction on that.  In other words, the Minister will select the whole team himself countrywide.</P>
    <P>The Minister is setting himself up as the be-all and end-all of all agricultural expansion and production here. He will be almighty so far as agriculture is concerned; he is the <Col N="648" /> person who will save our farmers and our country by forming this wonderful board that he thinks will do all these wonderful things.  As Senator Lenihan has said, in every section of the Bill, he is involved to ensure that every time the board go in or out they have to report to the Minister and say: please, sir, have I leave to leave the room?  The board would appear to be one which will be hand-picked by the Minister.  I am sure I will be pardoned if I suggest that the Minister already has a fair idea of whom he will appoint.  Very often it may not be the best players who are picked; many players find themselves on the sideline or even among the spectators, while incompetent persons are picked because of the colour of their hair. This board will be deliberating on behalf of all our poor farmers from Inishbofin to Kerry and Cork.</P>
    <P>Naturally one would expect that the Minister for Agriculture would know something about the necessary finances. Bearing in mind the part farmers play in our economy, the Minister might have allotted the board a certain amount of money, as was done in the case of An Foras Talúntais, and let them go ahead in their own way. There is a vast field of research to be completed if we are to advance.  Our first line of advancement must be through our farms.  That is the source of the raw material for by-products from milk powder to canned beef and so on.  If I examine my own constituency in County Cavan I notice that most of the successful industries there, as is the case throughout the country, are based on agricultural produce.  But for the small farmer who produces the milk, there would be no cheese factories, no milk powder, no tractors being bought, no new milking machines and so on and there would be thousands of people out of a job.  The Government seem to be classifying these farmers as the richest sheiks in Western Europe.  I always agreed with taxing rich farmers but the majority of ours are far from rich.  If able, they have been paying their rates and their just share of taxes.  Let us not forget that under the EEC directive, where a farmer was supposed to show that he would have <Col N="649" /> an annual income of £1,800, he was unable to do it.</P>

      <P>I was merely making a reference to transitional farmers who would fall into this category.  According to the Minister he is appointing a board with the sole aim of improving and advancing agriculture.</P>
      <P>The Minister has brought the advisory services under the umbrella of this board and is abolishing the committees of agriculture.  The committees of agriculture have done a fair job down the years.  They are comprised of many elected representatives. Both the ICMSA and the NFA have representatives on the Cavan committee, which has been doing a fairly efficient job down the years.  However, the Minister belongs to a Government the majority of whose members are city-orientated, who would not credit the committees of agriculture north or south with the ability to assist local farmers amongst whom they work and live.  According to the Minister they would not have the ability to help or advise them in any way, or even to instruct the advisory services instructors on what they should do for farmers.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that the Minister is in complete control of the advisory services and that An Foras Talúntais will be merged into these.  The agricultural colleges have played a very important part.  There were not sufficient of them.  Neither were there sufficient scholarships offered by county councils, committees of agriculture and so on to help young farmers to enter these colleges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past it was unfortunate that when people entered these colleges they took up advisory or other jobs but would not go back and work on the farms.  We must remember that now we have very well educated young farmers taking over land and succeeding to farms, people who had the chance of going to a secondary or vocational school.  They are a different type of farmer to those of 20 years ago. The farmer must now be well educated to cope with the many changes taking <Col N="650" /> place in methods of harvesting, sowing crops, breeding stock and so on.  It is important that these colleges should be extended or that more young farmers have the opportunity of doing ordinary courses, as they have been doing in my own county, under the committee of agriculture to extend their knowledge and bring them into line with modern techniques universally approved for doing such jobs.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House, as Senator Lenihan has said, are committed to repealing this legislation, we hope, in the very near future.</P>

      <P>The previous two speakers have referred to agricultural production in recent years.  Senator Dolan referred to lack of production and Senator Butler to the need for improvement.  Figures published as late as today indicate that there has not been a sufficient improvement in production. Any improvements which have come about in monetary incomes in farming have been the result of improved prices at EEC level.  Farmers seem too dependent on that as a source of improvement.  Therefore, not enough thought has been given to possible increased production.  Any measure that might assist must be welcomed.  In an endeavour to implement such improvement in production the Minister was faced with what has been over a number of years the thorny question of the reorganisation of the agricultural advisory services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A lot of emphasis is placed on the value of the agricultural advisory services and what they realise in increased agricultural production.  This area of legislation has not been very effective, has not produced what successive Ministers wanted in this area. This type of legislation was initiated and was the subject of debate and discussion at many levels in the previous Government.  At all times, when the then Minister for Agriculture tried to grasp the nettle, he let go.  The present Minister at least must be given credit for having grasped it.  I do not know what his reward will be.  I know he is a dedicated Minister.  I hope what he has envisaged emanating from this legislation will come to fruition, that the most important section of our economy, that of agriculture, will <Col N="651" /> benefit from the co-ordination of all the people involved in agriculture whether it be in the advisory, educational or research fields.</P>
    <P>There are a couple of different headings under which I have some knowledge or experience.  I hope the Minister will accept my views, not as being critical of the Bill but in an endeavour to be constructive in trying to improve sections of it.  I should like to have an opportunity of discussing any amendments I might suggest with him.  While these amendments may not fundamentally change the purpose of the Bill they could change specific areas of it where democracy has to be seen to be justified.  I should like a commitment from the Minister that he would be open to suggestions for amendment, whether they come from this side of the House or from the Opposition, and that he would not be afraid to go back to the Dáil if we had something constructive to add to the Bill.</P>

      <P>The first section of the Bill which concerns me is that on the county committees of agriculture.  The Minister himself came through this very valuable section of the community, the county councils and their elections of county committees, straight through to the General Council of Committees of Agriculture. County councils and their elected members are the people who go before the public, through the ballot box, and place before them their policies, ideologies and ask for their support. Having got that support they take on themselves the power to elect county committees of agriculture.  They also have political interests.  We are all politically minded.  There is nothing intrinsically wrong with members of the county committees of agriculture who are nominated by the county councils having political beliefs.  If they were put there for political reasons, it was because of their political and agricultural expertise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This democracy, as it is in action at grass roots level, has played a significant part in our advisory services&mdash;in the formulation of educational <Col N="652" /> programmes, the awarding of scholarships to young men for agricultural colleges, the setting up of winter farm schools, the designation of staff and people engaged in advice to farmers at field level.  In recent times in meeting the challenge of the farm modernisation scheme, and all the bureaucracy that that entails from Brussels, the county committees of agriculture have not been found wanting at membership or staff level. Local democracy has been seen to be competent and active in this field.  One of the main reasons county councils appoint county committees of agriculture is that they are statutory bodies and are set up with the right to strike a rate for agriculture in their county.  That rate demand is made and the members are responsible, not alone to the county council but also to the public in the ballot box.  This is democracy as it should function.  Anything which waters down that power should be subject to scrutiny.</P>
    <P>I welcome sincerely and thank the Minister for having made a significant amendment to this section.  If we accepted it as outlined in the White Paper, paragraph 3.1, that only 50 per cent of county committees would be members of county councils, we would have handed over that power in one piece of legislation to people who have no commitment to the public, through the ballot box, for any suggestions or recommendations about the spending of money whether it be in their own industry or another industry. I am glad that at least the Minister has responded to the pleas of the General Council that it is vital we retain control, because we are responsible.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has responded to these and the General Council of Committees of Agriculture, that it is vital that we will retain control. No committee of agriculture in Ireland that I am aware of, and I speak regularly to representatives of all the county committees in Ireland, were against the principle of involvement of expertise at county committee level.  No committee objected to the inclusion of these experts if they want to come into the recognised farming bodies as opposed to being nominated by themselves. <Col N="653" /> The important thing is that we were open to the suggestion, and agreed to the ratio of 75:25 so that the best possible expertise and brains in the industry would be available to us.</P>
    <P>Having the majority in a 60 per cent situation, I would like confirmation from the Minister that the county councils are still the responsible bodies for the appointment of these committees, that the nominees of the select few, as they will now be, must be elected and answer to the public.  The others can select themselves and submit their names to us.  At least this power should remain with us.  We should appoint them and we should and can question their right to be represented. I can foresee a situation where many pseudo farming organisations could spring up overnight and demand representation at county committee level.  I would be worried about a development of that nature.  I would also be worried that those of us responsible for the collecting of the money would then find ourselves in a situation that we could be dictated to by people who have no such responsibility either at local or at national level.  That is my interpretation of democracy.</P>
    <P>In the 1975 White Paper at paragraph 3.3 the formation of the General Council of Committees of Agriculture is outlined and it is stated:</P>
    <P>The Council will become a statutory body and its membership will consist of two members selected by each County Committee of Agriculture. It will have representation on the National Agricultural Advisory, Education and Research Board.</P>
    <P>As it stands at present, each county committee can nominate three members.  I represent a very small part of this country.  It is small particularly in this field of agriculture and also in terms of numbers on county committees of agriculture.  I would be concerned that my party, who have a significant part to play in agriculture not alone as workers engaged in the fields but those of us who have other knowledge and other faculties in industries allied to agriculture, would <Col N="654" /> be denied the right to representation on the county committees and again on the General Council because we would be outvoted by the bigger parties and by the nominated members who are selected by the chosen few.</P>
    <P>I am anxious that this representation would remain at three and I am also anxious that the proviso would be allowed to remain that if committees so wish they can appoint one of those three to be CAO, because there are several CAOs on the General Council of Committees of Agriculture, and I would say that the functions of the General Council are made possible by the expertise of the CAOs appointed by various committees for their expert knowledge of administration and their knowledge of stock and breeding and all the various aspects in which the General Council involve themselves.</P>
    <P>The General Council have the right, according to the Minister, to have at least one representative on the new board.  I accept that at least the Minister has quantified the representation that the General Council are entitled to&mdash;he said at least one member.  I am concerned that it would be only one because I feel that one representative could not adequately reflect the views of 27 county committees of agriculture.  I feel&mdash;and I would like a commitment from the Minister that he would feel this way too&mdash;that there should be something like four, that we would have a representative from each province on the General Council on the new board.  That is the minimum that should be given to the General Council based on the fact that they are responsible directly to the county committees which in turn are responsible to the county councils for the striking of the rate and the collecting of money which is vital to the funding of the board.  Most of the money assigned to this board would be State money and in that regard I would reserve the Minister's right to have a say and an input, and indeed the Minister for Finance also.  Any Minister responsible for a Department must, if he is to play a part in this, have an input.  I would accept that the Minister, because he puts up the vast majority of the funds, should have a <Col N="655" /> say in this board, in the appointment of the chairman and in that kind of matter which is only natural and normal in many of these Government boards we have.</P>
    <P>I am concerned because of our responsibility&mdash;this is the only reason we are still in being as county committees &mdash;for putting up 50 per cent of the total budget for the county committees. This is why we are required, not because there is any love for us by anybody in the Department or otherwise. We are an instrument through which money can be collected and that is why we are retained.  The functions of committees are mentioned in various sections of this Bill.  That is one of the functions that will be retained and because of that I am looking for adequate representation for the county committees on the General Council and for the General Council on this board.</P>
    <P>Accepting the principle of the board and respecting democracy as I have outlined it&mdash;which I am sure the Minister having come up through the same channels himself will accept&mdash;we should not be unmindful of the concern of staff in this field.  I read with interest the advertisement in today's newspapers and the signatures thereto. I agree with Senator Lenihan that they represent some of the foremost brains in research in this country and I would not likely discard what they would have to say.  I welcome from the Minister a commitment in his speech to us this morning that there would be adequate and complete consultation with the staff in any matter arising as a result of the introduction of this board.</P>
    <P>He admits that it is essential for the authorities to have an integrated staff and that such a scheme could only be introduced after full consultation with them.  In addition to these experts who have signed their names to this advertisement, other unions represent many other sections of the staffs in these centres and I am pleased that the Minister has agreed that adequate staff consultation will take place.  He has given this commitment to us and I respect him for it because without the co-operation of the full <Col N="656" /> staff we will not get the improvement that he has hoped would be forthcoming in the drafting of this Bill. Representation of staff on the board is important because the Houses of the Oireachtas recently initiated legislation regarding industrial democracy.  I would like to see the principles of that industrial democracy forthcoming in the relevant sections of this Bill to ensure that there is adequate representation of the staff on this board.  It is a function that must have recourse to expertise and the real experts in this field are those engaged in the research. I am not speaking entirely of agricultural research.  I am also concerned with veterinary research.  There is a term used in the very first section of the Bill, &ldquo;basic veterinary research&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the interpretation of the words &ldquo;basic veterinary research&rdquo;.  In my opinion, and indeed the opinion of many other people the term &ldquo;basic veterinary research&rdquo; is negative and meaningless. It is a very restricted one, too.  There is no such thing as basic veterinary research.  Veterinary research is no more than a part of the wide field of biological research.  By its very nature it must be termed &ldquo;applied&rdquo; as opposed to basic and therefore the word &ldquo;basic&rdquo; before &ldquo;veterinary research&rdquo; will have to be deleted where it occurs in the Bill.  Present veterinary research is tied up with biology and involves diagnosis, investigation, consultancy, applied research and basic research.  That is veterinary research.</P>
    <P>The veterinary profession man the advisory services which service the farming community with tremendous knowledge and expertise throughout the county through their regional veterinary laboratories.  These laboratories are 100 per cent available to give advice on animal disease and control.  In the two areas of compulsory disease eradication like tuberculosis and brucellosis if veterinary research is to be really effective it should be brought within the scope of the Bill and there should be provision in the Bill for the fullest possible co-operation between the veterinary research people and the other research <Col N="657" /> institutions, and that veterinary research should not preclude the examination of animals at flock level or farm level as opposed to just examining one animal biologically in a laboratory.  There should be wide scope available to the people involved in veterinary research and I hope the Minister would agree that they should be brought within the ambit of the Bill so that there will not be duplication but there will be complete integration of the services.</P>
    <P>There are many other sections in the Bill which have created controversy in various quarters and I do not intend to go into them.  Research is so important that one of the first functions of the board would be to appoint a co-director in charge of research.</P>
    <P>I will deal briefly with the question of the autonomy of the institute, which has been referred to.  For all intents and purposes, the Bill abolishes the institute.  For me, as a democrat, autonomy is a word I am not very happy about because it confers on people certain rights without any recourse to them available to those to whom they are responsible.  I am concerned about the Civil Service Appointments Commission, in relation to agriculture specifically, because they have such autonomy that county committees are precluded from making recommendations to them in regard to the appointment of staff who they know from experience have provided expertise at local level and who have been accepted by the community, as is proved in the case of the agricultural instructors who have become completely integrated in the community. However, if a county committee made a recommendation to the Civil Service Commission, they might feel that a certain temporary agricultural adviser was not competent to be permanent in Tipperary but would be competent to be permanent in Wicklow where he might not fit in at all because the people there might have programmes of special local application.</P>
    <P>So, autonomy for me can be quite a dangerous word.  When you are dealing with an ongoing process, like research, whether it be of the agricultural <Col N="658" /> institute or veterinary research or otherwise, there must of necessity be a certain amount of freedom for those involved irrespective of the financial implications.  Persons in this field could be on the threshold of a major breakthrough and if because they did not have autonomy research had to stop pending permission, tremendous damage would be done.</P>
    <P>I know that this is not what the Minister has in mind.  I realise that once the programme is set out the board will work to a programme, but I would like to have it in the legislation and have it as clearcut as possible so that the people working in these conditions and in this field would feel secure in carrying out worth-while research into animal husbandry, crop husbandry, veterinary research, disease control and eradication.  Research should be assisted, and the board should be charged with the responsibility of ensuring that there is no dead hand laid on research.  If I could get that assurance, the word &ldquo;autonomy&rdquo; would not worry me.  Autonomy does not necessarily remove the anatomy or the spirit and the soul of research provided the Minister is progressive and helpful and that sufficient funds are made available by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>This is where we all have a challenge and responsibility.  This is where the farming bodies have responsibility; this is where the taxpayers have responsibility.  We must be prepared to provide sufficient funds, and I say this particularly to the farming bodies who question every move that is made to bring their representatives into the tax net&mdash;all we are asking for is an increased flow into the Exchequer to make sure that sufficient funds are available.</P>
    <P>Of course the Minister will say: &ldquo;If you give me enough money I will ensure that there is enough money for research&rdquo;.  This is legitimate.  I have no objection to his having control of the board because he as Minister is responsible for not alone the expenditure of money in his Department but the formulation of policy.  His policy in the past four years in Government and indeed the continuation of the <Col N="659" /> policies since we entered Europe should not be lightly knocked by people, whether they be consumers or otherwise.  Consumers are dependent on the agricultural section and the agricultural section are dependent on the consumers.  The vast majority of our agricultural produce is exported, to the EEC nations and to Britain. It is imperative that the producer get adequate compensation and in respect of any changes in the value of money at international level that creates devaluation of the green £, it is only right that the farmers would get their fair share of what is coming to them.</P>
    <P>We as a Government must ensure that we are progressive enough not to rule out food subsidies, particularly for the poorer sections of the community. I do not accept what Senator Dolan said that this Government are driving a wedge between one section and the other.  We are not.  Any wedges that are there are being conjured up by one section agitating that the Minister give more and another that the Minister give less.  The Minister has done an excellent job in this field.  The recent announcement of food subsidies satisfied me that the section that deserves will benefit, and that the farming community grow the crops and produce the milk and the meal will be adequately compensated. The section of the community who have benefited should contribute to the Exchequer to ensure that the Ministers responsible have adequate finance available so that the board will not fail for want of finance.  If these principles are acknowleged by the Minister I will welcome and compliment him on his courage in this field.</P>
    <P>The matter of representation got very little debate in the other House. Whether Deputies are not as involved as Senators in county councils and other local bodies I do not know, but the Dáil debate was disappointing apart from the Opposition spokesman, the Minister and one or two others.  I should like the Minister to consider the amendments I have suggested which are fundamental to democracy and to the principles I have expounded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keegan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is being introduced at a time when there appears to be no public demand for it.  I cannot understand the reason for the introduction of a Bill which will have such far-reaching effects on agriculture, our greatest national industry.  The Bill proposes to abolish an institute that have served this country remarkably well.  An Foras Talúntais enjoyed the confidence of the farming community because of their selectiveness and independence.  I am not convinced that this new body will have the same degree of independence.  It took some time for the agricultural advisory services to realise the importance of An Foras Talúntais but the changes that have taken place in agriculture in recent years have brought home very forcibly to those engaged in agriculture the importance of that body.  It is with a degree of sadness that I speak of the steps being taken by the Minister and the Government to abolish that institute.  Only today we saw an advertisement by the staffs involved directly in the institute expressing dissatisfaction with the proposals which the Bill incorporates.  I would appeal to the Minister for a change of heart. Ministers are not prone to making changes as a result of pressure from staff organisations and so on, but because of the importance of agriculture to the Irish economy a re-think and a re-look at this legislation is necessary.</P>
      <P>What additional benefits can this Bill bestow on the agricultural community? Agriculture is going through a new era of excitement, expectancy and revolution.  The way all those engaged in agriculture have responded to the challenge which has confronted them is a tribute to them.  The challenge which has arisen in our main export industries, the new markets and outlets which membership of the EEC has given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In spite of farmers' willingness to avail of all the services at their disposal, it is unfortunate that we have not had any marked increase in the volume of agricultural production.  It is to be regretted that cattle numbers have declined in recent years and that there is no immediate signs of any upsurge in our cattle population because <Col N="661" /> of the disastrous situation in which Irish agriculture found itself in 1964.</P>
    <P>What is needed is a body that will go all the way towards inducing our farmers to increase production by the implementation of the most modern and up-to-date agricultural techniques available.  A revolution has taken place in that field in recent times.  In the old days a farmer talked about his family.  He decided he would send Johnny to school, he would send Mary to college and he would keep Paddy at home.  He felt that all Paddy required in those days were brawn and muscle.  Great changes have taken place since then.  The farmer of today is highly educated.  He is an intellectual, a scientist, a theorist and he has the ability to operate all the new mechanical devices which have come the way of agriculture in recent times.  There is a need to have a board, an authority or an institution that will be able to assist those younger farmers to secure the maximum income through the amount of ability, brains and skill that they have put into the development of Irish agriculture.</P>
    <P>It is important that greater emphasis be placed on the role of the small farmer.  Something must be done through research to ensure that pig production is restored to its rightful place in Irish agriculture in the farmyards of small farmers.  Pig production is becoming a highly competitive enterprise with the result that many small farmers are not in a position to market or farm properly because of the changed situation.  What is needed is a body with the necessary drive and incentive to encourage the small farmer to go into intensive methods of production to ensure that he will have a future in Irish agriculture.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in this Bill to encourage an increase in cattle or sheep numbers or in pig production.  Farming today is a highly sophisticated business, one that can no longer be looked upon as just a way of life.  It is a business that is subject to stresses and strains, to upheavals in other countries and to changes in policy. Long-term planning is needed.  This National Agricultural Advisory, <Col N="662" /> Education and Research Authority Bill will not meet the needs of the changing situation in agriculture.  We need to improve the existing arrangements, the arrangements whereby we have a county committee of agriculture composed of a CAO, his staff, and a body who in most cases are the elected representatives of the people.  They went before the people at local level and secured an endorsement in the ballot box.  Those people are in daily contact with the farming community and they realise the needs of that community.  The needs of one area will vary a great deal from the needs of another.  The requirements of the farming community in Donegal differ a great deal from those of the farming community in Westmeath, Tipperary, Cork or elsewhere.  Therefore local advisory services under the auspices of county committees of agriculture should be strengthened and given new powers so as to be in a position to deal adequately with the changes that are taking place.</P>
    <P>Many useful and worth-while schemes were introduced by county committees of agriculture and they have brought success to many areas. Therefore, it disappoints me to think that county committees of agriculture will be nothing more than talking shops without any real power of decision or authority to improve the lot of the farming community.  County committees of agriculture are dedicated people.  I am a member of a committee and I know that, irrespective of party political affiliation, they are dedicated people who have always expressed concern for the needs of the farming community.</P>
    <P>Any Minister, irrespective of his party, would be well advised to seek the advice and guidance of the members of county committees of agriculture who work in close liaison with the local advisory services and the CAOs. Those people have produced the perfect combination necessary over the years to achieve the results required in agriculture, namely to improve farm incomes and the lot of the agricultural community.  It is true to say that farm incomes have increased in <Col N="663" /> recent years but it is also true that expenditure has kept pace and, in some cases, has outpaced the rise in farm incomes.  Farmers will have to be kept advised of the changes necessary if they are to play their full role in Irish society.  We must bear in mind that agriculture is our greatest industry and is responsible for our greatest share of exports, earning for us much needed and highly valued currency from abroad.  Our entry into Europe has presented agriculture with a challenge which must be met because the earning of foreign currency is something which is very important for us in view of the diminishing value of sterling.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to note that Irish agriculture has secured for itself a foothold in the European markets where foreign currency is available.  However, markets are not sufficient if we have not available at all times the type of product demanded by those countries. It is in this area that education and research will play a very important part.  Research is important because our farmers need to be highly educated and fully informed of all the changes that are taking place.  The only way this can be done is through the local agricultural adviser, who, in turn, shares and pools his knowledge with advisers from every part of the country.  We all know that from time to time our advisers hold seminars and exchange views and ideas.  They must create new ideas.  This is necessary if agriculture is to play the role expected from it in the European Economic Community.</P>
    <P>Education and research must be improved and made available to those who wish to participate in agriculture. The agricultural colleges have been a great help to the younger farmers in recent years.  They have enabled them to play their role in the advancement of agriculture.  The night and day schools operated by the county committees of agriculture have also been worth while, and had it not been for those classes agriculture would not be in the highly sophisticated situation in which it finds itself today. Unfortunately we still have in our community those engaged in farming who are not inclined to avail of the <Col N="664" /> services which are available.  For reasons unknown to most of us, they feel that farming is just a way of life and what was good enough for their fathers should be good enough for them.  That is a situation we must change and the only way it can be done is through the continuation of education and research and the making full use of the local agricultural officer.  He can act as the public relations officer through the farming community.  He can secure their confidence quicker and easier than an official in the Department of Agriculture or somebody who will be on the board envisaged by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I am opposed to this legislation because this is not the time for a change.  We are in the midst of an agricultural revolution at present and it is only now that the work of An Foras Talúntais and the agricultural advisory services is bearing fruit because of the good public relations work carried out by the advisory services under the auspices of the county committees of agriculture.</P>
    <P>It is disappointing to discover that it will be mandatory on local authorities to give 40 per cent of the representation on those bodies to organisations who have never sought an endorsement in the ballot box.  If such changes were contemplated with the vocational education committees there would be an uproar.  If such changes were envisaged with the health boards there would be an uproar because the local people have confidence in public representatives, irrespective of political affiliation. They have confidence in the people they elect.  He is the man first to know of the problems and the man best equipped to give advice on the changing situation or to place them in the way of seeking advice from the advisory services.  Veterinary research, as mentioned by previous speakers, is very important if we are to produce top quality agricultural goods.  Losses which occurred through disease and otherwise in recent years have cost our economy millions of pounds.  I refer not alone to the eradication of brucellosis and the eradication of tuberculosis but to all the other diseases which affect the livestock <Col N="665" /> industry from time to time.  We have swine fever and hoose in livestock and all the diseases associated with the sheep industry.  Those diseases can cost Irish agriculture millions of pounds and, indeed, more will have to be done to ensure that the farmer has some sort of veterinary service available other than he has at present through his veterinary officer.</P>
    <P>There is need for some form of directive whereby a type of dispensary veterinary service could be made available to the farming community.  We must bear in mind that the manufacturers of antibiotics in recent years have been pushing their products continuously and they have succeeded in encouraging farmers to avail of a wide range of drugs.  I have often queried the wisdom of the widespread use of antibiotics.  Has it any affect on the end-product, milk, beef, mutton, pork or whatever the case may be?  Every farmer is inclined to make use of these antibiolics and I wonder if he is upsetting the balance of nature and producing an end-product which would be affected by the excess use of them.</P>
    <P>By and large, the legislation will not serve the purpose envisaged by the Minister.  He is abolishing An Foras Talúntais for the sake of creating something new.  If an authority serves a useful purpose and is performing an adequate role in the agricultural sector, it should be allowed to remain and even improve.  To dismantle an organisation which has served Irish agriculture and the economy is a retrograde step and it is for that reason that I am opposed to the Bill.</P>

      <P>It is fair to say, at the end of this discussion, that comment on the whole, with a few exceptions, has been favourably disposed towards the Bill. Senator Lenihan, leading for the Opposition, could see nothing good in the Bill and was totally opposed to it. He stated that Fianna Fáil would, at the earliest opportunity, repeal the Bill if it became an Act.  I stated in the Dáil that I was happy about such a situation because I felt it would be a long time before that opportunity arrived and that a great amount of good would have been done before we reached that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="666" /> The main burden of the Opposition, from wherever it came, lay in the fact that we were abolishing the Agricultural Institute.  The Opposition were relying a good deal on public comment in relation to this and quoted from an advertisement in today's paper to which 179 names are appended.  I should like to inform the House that we are talking about an authority with a staff of approximately 2,500 and of that figure 179 people do not like some part of this legislation.  I do not think we should be unduly upset about this because there will always be people to oppose any change whatsoever, whether it is a progressive step or otherwise.  Senator Lenihan has very little support for his view, that there is no demand for this legislation.  He is not supported by the vast majority of the population and he is certainly not supported by the majority of the staff being integrated into this authority.  There are 179 objectors out of 2,500.  The chairman of the study group of the IFA commenting on this in <i>The Nationalist</i>, Clonmel, on 25th March, 1977, stated:</P>
    <P>Finally, might I add IFA requires that the bulk of expenditure made by the new Authority should be spent on direct services to farmers. The Minister must be congratulated for introducing this Bill to streamline the operation of the advisory, education and research services to farmers.  With a few minor amendments this Authority will be very capable of meeting the challenges of the 80s.</P>
    <P>That is what the IFA had to say about the Authority.  They welcomed it.</P>
    <P>There is an immense amount of confusion in the minds of the Opposition and this was also obvious in the Dáil.  Senator Dolan said that the composition of county committees should remain 50 : 50.  There was the same sort of confusion in the Dáil.  Some, obviously, wanted changes while others did not.  Certainly, the least they were prepared to accept&mdash;this was supposed to be Fianna Fáil policy in the Dáil&mdash; was 75 : 25.  Therefore, at the end of the Second Reading in this House I do not know what Fianna Fáil want in relation to the composition of <Col N="667" /> county committees of agriculture. There has been a good deal of discussion about the composition of them and the figure in the Bill was originally 50 : 50.  I made what I considered to be a fair compromise in making it 60 : 40, giving the balance of power to the elected representatives.  Senator Ferris seemed pleased that the amendment was made and felt it provides a sufficient safeguard for democracy.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that the quality of county committees will be improved by bringing rural organisations into these committees.  I was the first member of a county committee to propose that this should be done and this was carried out in County Dublin where I was a member for many years.  My proposal for a change was seconded by a well known Fianna Fáil Deputy and it was unanimously decided that this was the right thing to do.  I hope that, as a result of these amendments, there will be satisfaction about the composition of county committees.</P>
    <P>To say that there was and is no demand for this legislation is ridiculous. When I assumed office I received many demands for this type of change and reorganisation in the service.  I went through those volumes of demands very carefully and I felt we had to do something quickly to satisfy the people.  I put my recommendations before the Government as a result of which we had a White Paper in 1975.  It is fair to say that that White paper was well received and that there was practically no opposition to it.  There had to be some gentle noises here and there and some criticism but, on the whole, that White Paper was welcomed.  What we are doing now is implementing the recommendations in it.</P>
    <P>A point made by Senator Ferris should be explained.  He complained that we are now proposing that only two representatives of each county committee will compose the General Council, which we are making a statutory body.  That is not written into the Bill.  That suggestion, was meant to be a guideline and it was contained in the White Paper.  With <Col N="668" /> three from the 27 county committees of agriculture we would have a very unwieldy body.  I am sure Senator Ferris would be the first to admit that. We are leaving it to the county committees, to the General Council as it now stands, to decide.  We are leaving it to their discretion and are simply suggesting as a guideline that, if this number be reduced but still give fair representation, it might be a more effective body.</P>
    <P>My aim in this Bill is to bring all the agencies that provide a service for agriculture together to work as a team in the interests of agricultural development and to kill the unhealthy rivalries and the suspicions they have of each other.  There was considerable concern among the staff of the agricultural Institute that the findings of their research were not being accepted and implemented as quickly or as well as they expected.  One of our hopes is that by bringing these services together there will be one organisation, and it will not be a question of who does what.  My aim is to remove all these barriers, these lines of demarcation, so that whatever is good should be used with the greatest possible expedition.  There is no other reason for bringing these agencies together.  Nothing could be further from the truth than to say we are demolishing or abolishing the Agricultural Institute</P>

      <P>I appreciate this.  I went back a second time to the legal people to ask them why this was necessary and they said this was the only way the Agricultural Institute could be integrated.  It first had to be technically abolished to have it integrated into the new service.  It was never part of my intention, and it is no part of this legislation, that there should be any question of diminishing or discontinuing in any way the excellent work the Agricultural Institute <Col N="669" /> is performing for Irish agriculture and has been performing over the years.</P>
      <P>Senator Lenihan said the present director of the institute was an excellent man.  I agree entirely but I should like to remind him that he was appointed by the Government in exactly the same way we are proposing to appoint the new director of the new organisation.  We have not changed in any way the method we propose to appoint the membership of this authority.  It is an exact replica of the way appointments were made in the past under previous legislation. It is outrageous now.  Fianna Fáil were outrageous in the past.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course.  There was criticism of the fact that now everything would be decided by officialdom and by the bureaucrats in the Department of Agriculture.  Again, nothing could be further from the truth.  We are getting all these services outside the Department of Agriculture that are there already.  Nobody has more respect than I have for the contribution being made by the officials in the Department of Agriculture to agricultural development today.  I am glad to be able to say that Agriculture House was never as open as it is at present.  None of the agencies we are talking about would agree with the criticism that they do not get the fullest possible co-operation from the Department of Agriculture and that it is not an open house.  On more than one occasion recently they have admitted that this is so.  Because of our membership of the EEC the Department of Agriculture are becoming a collossus and I am as anxious as anyone to get enough of this outside the Department and get agencies working on it.  On this new body we have all the agencies that have been providing a service for agriculture represented in one combined authority.  This is the best and most effective way it can be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot say that there is anything <Col N="670" /> we are requiring An Foras Talúntais to do now that they have not been required to do previously.  I have been in on discussions year after year for the past four years with An Foras Talúntais when they presented their programme and sought money to carry it out.  I discussed the programme with their director, their chairman and the Minister for Finance.  The only difficulties that arose were in relation to money to pay for the operations. There was never any dispute. Questions were asked such as &ldquo;Is it necessary to continue?  Have you gone as far as you think?  It is wise?  Can you drop this?  Can you start something else?&rdquo; If the Minister for Agriculture is not concerned about agricultural developments and has no say whatever, and if some autonomous body makes all these decisions for him there is no need for a Minister for Agriculture, the Department or public accountability.</P>
    <P>We must have public accountability because payment for these services in 1976 amounted to £6.9 million and £3.7 million of that was a Department grant.  Education in agricultural schools cost £2.7 million and £2 million of that was a Department grant.  Expenditure for An Foras Talúntais was £8.4 million, of which £5.6 million was a Department grant.  To say that we should completely opt out, give complete autonomy and have no accountability for any such organisation is democracy gone mad.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Ferris about this.  To think that there will be any undue interference once this body is set up is simply saying that we have no confidence whatever in the membership of the new authority.  The only stipulations made are that the Minister for Agriculture will have at least one appointee on the board, that the Minister for Education will have at least one and that the General Council of Committees of Agriculture at least one representative.  The remainder of the board will be composed of nominees of the various rural organisations. There will be quite an amount of discussion among the existing rural organisations, the county committees and the various agencies coming into this before we make a firm decision on <Col N="671" /> the exact composition of this board.</P>
    <P>It is reasonable that we should have such discussions before we make firm decisions, because we want people on the board who will act responsibly. They will have all the decisions to make.  The taxpayer will have to provide most of the money and consequently there must be accountability. If we are to have an agricultural policy, it is not unreasonable or wrong that every year the programme of work for this new authority should be looked at by the Minister for Agriculture.  We need a national policy and this is one of the things that have been absent for far too long.</P>
    <P>The Opposition are talking about the terrible things that we are doing to the county committees of agriculture.  Last October Deputy James Gibbons produced a document and asked the question: What is wrong with Irish farming?  I would like to quote from that.  He states:</P>
    <P>The advisory services need to be reorganised.  Ideally, these should be controlled by properly run co-operatives, but since these do not yet exist, Government participation remains necessary.</P>
    <P>That was last October.  Further down he states:</P>
    <P>Control of the advisory services by &ldquo;Committees of Agriculture&rdquo; has become an absurdity because most committees are made up, in part at least, of people from outside the industry.  This anachronism should be ended.  New county committees, elected by farmers, co-ops and farm workers might be considered as an interim measure pending the establishment of a co-op run service.</P>
    <P>That was the policy of the Opposition as late as last October.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanKeegan" hpid="Mr. Keegan Mr. Keegan">

      <P>This is it.  They still have not made up their minds on that side of the House as to their agricultural policy.  If the Opposition are confused, they cannot complain that I am also a bit confused as to what they <Col N="672" /> are looking for.  Senator Lenihan put up a very good performance in ridiculing this Bill and in criticising it in every possible way.  It might be a good thing for him to have done, seeing the constituency he hopes to represent and which I represent at the moment.</P>
      <P>Section 12 (1) of the Agriculture (An Foras Talúntais) Act, 1958 states:</P>
      <P>For the purpose of assisting the Institute to carry out effectively its functions under the Act, there shall be paid to the Institute in every financial year, out of monies provided by the Oireachtas, a grant towards the expenses of the Institute the amount of which shall be determined by the Minister for Finance in consultation with the Minister and the Council after due consideration of any information furnished under subsection (2) of this section. Subsection (2) states:</P>
      <P>The Council shall furnish to the Minister such information regarding its income and expenditure as he may from time to time require.</P>
      <P>That is part of the Act on which Senator Lenihan spoke very favourably in this House at that time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a short Bill to provide for an increase from seven to nine in the statutory maximum number of ordinary judges of the High Court, ignoring for the moment the terms of section 14 of the Law Reform Commission Act, 1975, which provide <i>inter alia</i> that, in certain circumstances, the number shall be one more; an increase from nine to 11 in the statutory maximum number of ordinary judges of the Circuit Court; and an increase in the statutory maximum number of justices of the District Court&mdash;in addition to the President&mdash;from 34 to 39.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the moment there are two temporary judges serving in the Circuit Court and five temporary justices serving in the District Court, in addition <Col N="675" /> to the statutory complement of permanent judges and justices.  Accordingly, in practical terms, the net increase in the membership of the judiciary which this Bill proposes to effect will be two judges of the High Court.</P>
    <P>The Bill also contains certain changes in existing legislative provisions regarding assignments of Circuit Court judges, the principal one being the proposed increase from two to four in the number of judges permanently assigned to the Dublin Circuit.  The opportunity has also been taken to consolidate in one Bill existing provisions relating to assignments of Circuit Court judges by the Government. This is being done in section 2. Section 3 of the Bill contains certain consequential provisions, including the necessary substitution of a new paragraph for paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of section 14 of the Law Reform Commission Act. 1975.</P>
    <P>High Court business has increased substantially in recent years.  Between 1970 and 1976 the number of cases set down for hearing increased by 151 per cent and, although there was an increase of 143 per cent in the same period in the rate of disposal of cases, serious arrears have accumulated.  As a result, the position at the end of March was that 1,418 cases awaited hearing.  On top of that, Judge Pringle, who had been acting full-time in the Special Criminal Court, following his retirement from the High Court in 1974, was appointed chairman of An Bord Pleanála in January of this year.  As a consequence sittings of the Special Criminal Court now absorb the equivalent of the full time of one High Court judge and this will continue while the existence of that court continues to be necessary.  To highlight the seriousness of the situation it is sufficient to point out that the average time-lag between the setting down of a jury action and its coming on for trial is now about ten months.  The last occasion on which an increase in the number of High Court judges took place was in 1973 when the Courts Act, 1973 increased the number of ordinary judges from six to seven.  At <Col N="676" /> that time there was a time-lag of about 12 months between the setting down of a jury action and its coming on for trial.  As a consequence of the appointment of the seventh judge this time-lag was reduced by mid-1975 to five months.  The deterioration in the position since then is due to a further increase in the volume of business and, in recent months, to the replacement of Judge Pringle by a judge of the High Court on the Special Criminal Court.</P>
    <P>I should also mention here that in the past two years there has been a sharp increase in the number of family law cases coming before the High Court and this increase has been given added impetus by the coming into force of the family law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act and the Family Home Protection Act during 1976.  The position has already been reached where the hearing of these cases accounts, for all practical purposes, for the full time of one judge.  I am sure the House will agree that, having regard to the nature and special urgency of such cases, any undue delay in dealing with them must be avoided.</P>
    <P>As Senators will be aware, I have already arranged for the provision of special additional court facilities for the hearing of family law cases in rented accommodation in the immediate vicinity of the Four Courts. These facilities are intended as a temporary measure pending completion of the redevelopment of the Four Courts Hotel site which has been purchased for the purpose of enabling the existing courtroom accommodation within the Four Courts proper to be considerably increased.</P>
    <P>The Government are satisfied that the growth in the volume of High Court business generally, which of course is largely of a civil nature, will continue for the foreseeable future and that, accordingly, the proposed increased complement of High Court judges will be fully occupied even after sittings of the Special Criminal Court cease.</P>
    <P>This, then, is the background to the proposal to increase by two the statutory maximum number of ordinary judges of the High Court.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="677" /> The maximum number of permanent judges of the Circuit Court authorised by statute (section 2 of the Courts Act, 1964) is nine.  However, section 14 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1936, authorises the Government temporarily to increase that number whenever it appears to the Government that such a step is necessary to prevent the work of the Circuit Court getting into arrears either generally or in any particular circuit or circuits. Successive Governments have over the years found it necessary from time to time to increase temporarily the number of Circuit Court judges to cope with the persistent growth in the business of that court and, in recent years, to contribute judicial time to the sittings of the Special Criminal Court.  As I mentioned earlier the full complement of Circuit Court judges at present includes two &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; judges.  These appointments were necessitated by the continuing growth in the volume of court business and the involvement of Circuit Court judges in sittings of the Special Criminal Court, the membership of which includes three such judges.  The business of the Circuit Court has, as I have already indicated, continued to grow over the years and this growth has accelerated in recent years. Between 1970 and 1976 the growth in the overall business of the court has been of the order of 30 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government are satisfied that the business of the Circuit Court will continue to grow for the foreseeable future and that, accordingly, the existing complement of 12 judges, including the President of the Circuit Court, is the minimum number that is now required and that will continue to be required to cope with the business of the Circuit Court even when sittings of the Special Criminal Court cease. The Government are also satisfied&mdash; and I am sure the House will agree with them in this&mdash;that in such circumstances it is unjustifiable that two judges should continue to hold office on a temporary basis.  Accordingly, the <Col N="678" /> Bill provides for an increase of two in the statutory maximum number of ordinary Circuit Court judges.  I may add that it is the intention of the Government that the two serving &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; judges be made permanent so that the question of new appointments does not arise as a result of this provision.</P>
      <P>Section 28 of the Courts (Supplementary Provisions) Act, 1961, provides that the number of justices of the District Court, in addition to the President of the District Court, shall not be more than 34.  However, as in the case of the Circuit Court, the Government are authorised to increase that number temporarily whenever it appears to them that such a step is necessary to prevent the work of the District Court getting into arrear. This authority is contained in section 51 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1936. At the present time, in addition to the complement of 34 permanent justices, five &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; justices stand appointed.  One of the temporary justices is, of course, required to make good the loss of the permanent District Justice who acts as full-time chairman of An Bord Uchtála.  The number of such justices was increased from one to five during the years 1973 and 1974 because of the need for more justices to cope with the then rapidly increasing volume of business and the substantially increased demand that sittings of the Special Criminal Court were making on the services of District Justices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The overall volume of District Court business increased by about 43 per cent between 1970 and 1976 and the Government are satisfied that the volume of business will continue to increase.  Another pertinent factor is the growth in the number of maintenance cases following the enactment of the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976.  Due to their complexity and delicateness each of these cases can account for a proportionately large amount of court time compared with, for example, parking cases.  The position has been reached where the existing complement of 39 justices in addition to the President of the <Col N="679" /> District Court, is the minimum number that is now required and that will continue to be required for the foreseeable future to cope with the business of the District Court even when sittings of the Special Criminal Court cease, and also to continue to provide a full-time Chairman for An Bord Uchtála.  As I have already pointed out in relation to the Circuit Court, it is, in the Government's view, unjustifiable that in such circumstances five justices of the District Court should continue to hold office on a temporary basis.  Accordingly, the Bill provides for an increase of five in the statutory maximum number of district justices.  Here again, it is the Government's intention that the five existing &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; justices should be given permanent appointments so that the question of new appointments does not arise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as we are concerned, there is no objection to increasing the efficiency of our courts. Obviously, in view of the figures quoted by the Minister, one of the ways of dealing in practical terms with the lack of efficiency or expedition in dealing with cases is to increase the number of judges, as is suggested in the Bill, from seven to nine in the case of the High Court, nine to eleven in the case of the Circuit Court&mdash;although I appreciate two of those are already operating in terms of temporary Circuit Court judges&mdash;and five more in the District Court.  There is absolutely no objection to this because the figures the Minister has quoted in regard to the increases in the number of cases coming for hearing justify it.  As a practitioner I can fully see that the time lag in regard to both criminal and civil cases, particularly on the civil side in the Circuit and High Courts and such applies on the criminal side as well is getting out of hand, unless this practical expedient, as is suggested in this Bill, is adopted to appoint more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While it is admirable and necessary to increase the number of judges in the three divisions mentioned by the Minister, it is not enough.  There is the whole problem of delay in hearings both on the civil and criminal side. <Col N="680" /> Then there is the new division which should be put in neither category, the family law court situation, which is a growing one.  The governing legislation is excellent.  The only question needing attention is to have more immediate dispatch, as applies in the ordinary civil and criminal cases.  The greatest area where the law comes into disrepute at every level at present&mdash;unless tackled in a more fundamental way than is being done here&mdash;is the delay in hearings, in processing either in prosecutions, civil claims or family cases. This has to be tackled in a far more radical way by the Minister for Justice than has been done as yet.</P>
    <P>There are many recommendations available already from the committee hearings presided over by the present Law Commission President, Mr. Justice Walsh, in regard to basic matters such as in the sphere of civil actions, particularly in the High Court, settling issues beforehand, before the Master of the High Court or Registrar of the Circuit Court, getting agreement on technical evidence, in the medical and engineering fields&mdash;the two technical areas I mentioned are the more usual ones particularly in negligence actions&mdash;getting agreement on matters of that kind so one does not have to produce the whole panoply of technical witnesses and take up the time of an actual hearing.  This is a practical way in which the actual period of time per case in civil actions in the Circuit and High Courts could be cut very substantially.  There could be, for example, a pre-trial procedure for the hearing of issues, before a Master in the High Court, Registrar in the Circuit Court or some officer of that kind who would have the lawyers on both sides in committee before the hearing, who would agree on the pre-trial issues that are agreed, decide on the pre-trial issues that are not agreed and only have evidence at the actual hearing on the issues on which there is disagreement.  There is a specific report recommending that such a procedure be adopted.  The present President of the Law Commission, Mr. Justice Walsh, was president of that committee we set up on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis and which the present Government have set up on a permanent <Col N="681" /> statutory basis, in the form of the Law Commission.  It is something that could be done fairly quickly and would cut the time of the proceedings as far as the litigant is concerned, certainly in the civil area, very substantially.</P>
    <P>The other matter which takes up a substantial proportion of all courts' time is the question of juries in civil actions, particularly in negligence actions.  The whole business of panelling juries and having the various speeches in the High Court in regard to juries, the opening address, the closing address, the speech to the jury and so on is, to put it bluntly, a time wasting factor.  I appreciate that under the British system with one judge hearing substantial cases of this kind in regard to negligence and damages one is in on a risk situation as between one judge and another.  That is one of the reasons why people in Ireland have been reluctant to advocate an adoption holus-bolus of the British system. Surely there could be devised here some tribunal system with three judges sitting which would balance out any prejudices that might appear under the one judge hearing a substantial damages case, three judges sitting as a tribunal of the High Court.  This would mean the appointment of extra judges, to which I would not object, and would lead to more expeditious hearing of cases.</P>
    <P>In the ordinary course of events at present there is a two to three year lag between the actual accident, in the case of a negligence factor or road accident injury and the actual hearing or settlement in the client's interest. That is not good enough; that is what brings the law into disrepute.  Side by side with appointing extra judges, with which I agree, I should like an indication from the Minister&mdash;I am sure he is fully aware of the position himself and his officials have the facts&mdash; that he would be sympathetic to this view.</P>
    <P>Side by side with the appointment of extra judges we should adopt all the methods that are there, which have been contained in committee reports over a period of years and are obvious to most practitioners, to cut <Col N="682" /> down the time lag between the occasion of a cause of action and the resulting decision in that cause of action one way or the other as far as the person alleged to be aggrieved is concerned.  From a commonsense point of view, from the lawyer's point of view and a social point of view, that would be the most practical thing that could be done to bring the law into good repute with the ordinary citizen.  Every effort should be made&mdash; and there is part of it in the Bill&mdash;to cut down the two or three year lag in regard to civil cases to a six months lag.  Similarly, in criminal cases there is the incessant awarding of bail which results in further crime being perpetrated during the bail period.  It delays in bringing people to a final decision on whether or not they are guilty and where they should be put or dealt with as far as their offence is concerned, or found not guilty. There are substantial grounds for belief that the recurrence of bail on easy terms within our criminal courts, at district and circuit level particularly and the ease with which bail can be granted&mdash;I appreciate that the Minister has no control over this by reason of judicial independence&mdash;gives rise to a situation in which people utilise their bail period to engage in similar type offences.  In other words, they profitably utilise their bail period for further criminal effort.</P>
    <P>If there was not pressure on courts this would not arise.  I know there is a problem of gathering proofs as far as the State is concerned.  One of the main reasons is lack of judges, lack of capacity to handle the business of the courts, to ensure that, if a person is apprehended, is charged within the period of one adjournment, that matter can be brought to fruition one way or the other within a month or two months rather than hanging on for six months, nine months or a year.</P>
    <P>That is the case in criminal matters. I appreciate the weight of the security situation as far as the gardaí are concerned. It boils down to another question which I know is not strictly within the purview of the Bill&mdash;I mention it in passing only&mdash;the back up to the courts in the form of Garda <Col N="683" /> personnel.  It is all very well for the Minister to state that he has plans for 500 extra gardaí.  These plans were announced last July.</P>
    <P>I know that recruits are in course of training in Templemore.  The Minister in the present situation should not be talking in terms of 500; he should be talking in terms of 2,000.  I do not mind the amount of money that is involved either.  I appreciate that the money is in the order of £10 million to £12 million for the training of gardaí of that number.  Unfortunately in the present situation of Irish society we should be thinking in such terms. Part of the reason that the courts are clogged is that there is inadequate police back-up to bring cases to fruition by way of gathering proofs. Another part of the reason is that the crime rate is increasing and detection rates are falling.  Crime is in a situation now where it is beginning to pay. The old popular police and self-protective cliché was that crime did not pay.  I do not want to be alarmist about this but crime is beginning to pay because of the lack of police protection on the ground as far as the ordinary citizen is concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point.  It is a very essential point because it is one of the reasons why we have to have in the Bill an increased number of judges at three levels.  There is (a) the increased rate of crime&mdash;I am not talking about the civil side&mdash;on the criminal side related not just to the Northern situation but to ordinary crime on the ground and (b) the fact that the gardaí, by reason of inadequacy in personnel are unable to process the proofs quickly enough in regard to specific cases.  The result is cases are adjourned continually in the District and Circuit Courts, people are out on bail committing more crime, all while the State gathers proofs to present its case properly.  I suggest that it is all wrapped up in one package <Col N="684" /> of delay in regard to apprehension on the criminal side and, after apprehension the processing through the courts of offenders.  Lastly there are the delays on the civil side by reason of an insufficiency of judges and the fact that the procedures of our courts in the two areas I have mentioned&mdash; of settling pre-trial issues and having juries on negligence actions&mdash;tend to an over-elaboration and delay in regard to the hearing and settlement of cases.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will agree that this is all part of one package.  I know there is money involved but I do think, and I say this as a final thought, that it should be realised in Ireland&mdash;and we have been near enough to the brink North and South for the past few years&mdash;the difficulties the Minister has&mdash;I appreciate them fully&mdash;in coping with the serious security and criminal situation that is rising.  That fact should make everybody in society here realise that the most fundamental thing in society is precisely the knowledge that everybody is reasonably free to go about his business, have privacy and pleasure, free from attack, and that if somebody is attacked or if his property is damaged there will be fairly immediate redress on the criminal side in regard to the offender and also as far as the person is concerned <i>vis-á-vis</i> civil action or claim damages for injury.  Unless this is seen to operate, seen to be the case in society. society, democracy and the people who seek to run society, such as we people here in one of the Houses of Parliament, are brought into disrepute and the system is seen to fail.  We are very grievously at that situation at present.  It makes me sad to say that. Never before, since the formation of the State, were we so near that brink as we are at present.  It is a very serious reflection on a Government who talk about law and order.  Real law and order come down to the basics of people's person and property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no point in making law and order an issue of politics.  Law and order should be the essential duty of any Government, democratic or otherwise.  If there is any fall down <Col N="685" /> or inefficiency in that respect it reflects very seriously on the community and society as a whole.  That is more important than all the matters we could debate here.  I can go through the whole panoply of administration, social, economic and political.  Nothing is more fundamental than that about which I have been talking.  At present this area is in very serious jeopardy. The Government are not tackling it; they are play-acting with it too much. This Bill which will be supported by us, is at least an attempt to deal with one aspect of it.  However, there is no attempt to get down to the totality of what is involved to ensure that we have the personnel, the legislation, the procedures and the capacity, as a Government, through all the elements that go to make for an ordered State in the form of the police, the courts, the procedures of the courts to ensure that we do really have an ordered State; get that working in a reasonably smooth manner so that people have confidence in the whole system. In the last analysis it is the confidence of the people in the system that will ensure that the system works.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thought that strikes me with regard to Senator Lenihan's contribution is that when Senator Lenihan resists the temptation to try to score political points he can be very constructive, particularly in dealing with a topic such as this.  For approximately three-quarters of his contribution he resisted the temptation and proved to be constructive but he fell in the last quarter; he was not able quite to make the last lap.  The concluding portion of his contribution was not particularly helpful.  I recognise I am speaking as a supporter of the Government but I hope I would adopt the same attitude if I were speaking as a member of the Opposition.  I do not think it is helpful in the circumstances which exist in this country today to attempt to lay at the door of the Government the difficulties in connection with law and order when the responsibility for the present situation&mdash;for the fact that sufficient and more gardaí are required and possibly that sufficient are not there&mdash;must rest fairly and squarely on the shoulders of <Col N="686" /> of those who are tying-up our security forces in additional national security duty in connection with the Border, banks and so on.  In other words it must rest fairly and squarely on the shoulders of the Provisional IRA.  Responsible politicians do no service by obscuring that picture in order to score political points against their political opponents.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Bill before us and not merely the desirability but the necessity in present circumstances to increase the complement of the Judiciary at all three levels, many of the matters to which Senator Lenihan referred were valid and constructive.  I know he was talking to some extent with benefit of recommendations which have been made but he had also some ideas of his own worthy of examination. Possibly, either the committee to which he referred or the Minister's Department may examine them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not specialise in litigation as a lawyer, other people in my office do that, but from my memories as a practising lawyer who was involved in the field of litigation I can appreciate the force of the point Senator Lenihan makes, that is, the amount of time which would be saved if a system could be devised where a case would go into court on the basis of issues being known and agreed in advance and, consequently, out of the way so far as the actual court hearing was concerned.  The court could well be concerned, in so far as evidence goes, merely with trying the issues being contested.  In most cases going before the court, whether it is a running down case where there is a question of medical evidence, or even the simple question of medical fees, if there is agreement as to the amount due for medical fees there is no reason why that should not be agreed in advance and noted.  In most cases it is, but as the law stands at the moment, obviously it is open to the defendant, if he should so choose, not to agree to anything.  That would put the plaintive on proof as regards the various matters which could have been agreed, such as the amount of the hospital bill or the amount of the doctor's fees and so on.  The same <Col N="687" /> applies to damage to vehicles as a result of a collision.  Very often it is agreed between assessors what the damage was and what the cost of repairs would be.  But if a defendant chooses to do so, he can insist on formal proof of all these matters. There is something in that whole area worth investigating.  It is quite possible that a considerable saving in the actual time it takes to hear civil cases could be achieved by some adjustments.</P>
    <P>I referred before and should like to refer again to the view, which I still hold&mdash;I expressed it fairly strongly in the Lower House when I think Senator Lenihan occupied the position of Minister for Justice and I was spokesman for the Opposition&mdash;that our superior courts are, so far as working hours are concerned, living in the coach and buggy days.  The courts start at 11 a.m. and break for lunch normally from 1 to 2 p.m. and sit again from 2 to 4 p.m., although, in fairness to members of the Judiciary, it should be said that they are in no way slow to put themselves out if it is a question of accommodating witnesses or counsel or trying to get a case concluded, when they will sit longer hours.</P>
    <P>I understand that one argument against varying the time to ordinary office hours is that it is of value both to counsel and solicitors, the legal advisers of the litigants, to have an opportunity, both before the case commences in the morning and when evidence concludes in the afternoon, for consultation with their clients. Possibly, if there were signs of a settlement, the advisers would have an opportunity of negotiating with the legal advisers on the other side.  That is true.  Nevertheless, some extension of the existing hours could be encouraged.  That is the best way I can put it.</P>
    <P>The question of whether one should continue juries in civil actions is a very large one which I do not want to go into.  I recognise, as Senator Lenihan did, the time consumption element in the jury system but there are definitely pros and cons here, <Col N="688" /> particularly in a small country where, generally speaking&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all I am doing.  The point I was going to make is that the smaller the country catered for, the less desirable it would be to depart from a system such as we have.</P>
      <P>My last point&mdash;Senator Lenihan also touched on this&mdash;one which is difficult for laymen, particularly, to understand, is the number of pleadings required at present in civil cases.  My view&mdash;naturally I speak with a certain amount of diffidence because practising members of the Bar would have greater experience and the closest association with the system of pleadings&mdash;is that there is room in civil cases for cutting down fairly drastically the number of steps required by way of pleadings from the time of the institution of the proceedings to the ultimate service of the notice of trial and setting down the action for trial.</P>
      <P>While saying that, I am conscious that the system of pleadings which exists at present and the necessity for exactness in the pleadings, for each side being tied pretty closely to what they set out in the pleadings so far as proof and so on is concerned, is all in the interest of the litigant; it is all for the purpose of ensuring that each side will get a fair hearing, that one side will not be disadvantaged or taken by surprise by something being sprung on him without giving him an opportunity to call evidence.  For those reasons, exactness and precision in the wording of pleadings is necessary.  But there could be an examination as to whether some might be cut out and the general length of time be reduced.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, the action the Minister is taking at the moment to increase the number of judges and justices is certainly likely to produce the results required, results which were produced previously when the numbers were increased, such as a reduction in the time-lag between the initiation of proceedings and the final determination of the proceedings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Briefly, I welcome the Bill in so far as its provisions may help to speed up the work of the courts.  There has been the revelation that the length of time between the setting down of a jury action and the coming to trial is about 10 months. Surely that is much too long?  It is unfair to those involved in the action. Even though the proposed increase in the number of judges goes some part of the way, I do not think it goes far enough.  I should like to see that period drastically reduced.</P>
      <P>It seems evident from listening to Senators' contributions that there is great wealth of legal talent available in the Seanad.  Would the Minister consider setting up a committee from the Seanad to devise ways and means of shortening the litigation procedure and in general modernising the system?  It would be a worth-while use of this excellent resource we have in the Seanad of so many of the top luminaries in the legal world.</P>
      <P>This proposed increase in the Judiciary is due to the recent legislation on family law and the protection of the family home.  We must provide the necessary resources to have cases arising therefrom dealt with expeditiously.</P>
      <P>With the number of district justices being increased to 39, it seems to me there is a lack of uniformity.  Is there any mechanism by which there could be some small group to act as a coordinator? There seem to be very glaring differences in sentences meted out for similar offences.  There should be some type of advisory committee who would act in that role to the district justices, periodically making reports to the justices on their findings, on how sentences that had been handed down over the period under review corresponded. In this way we might strive towards uniformity.  Surely that is part of justice?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I endorse Senator Lenihan's plea on the necessity for an increase in the strength of the Garda Síochána.  There is a great increase in the crime rate and consequently the response of the Government should be to recruit more gardaí and give them better facilities to provide the necessary protection.  It is scandalous to read of attacks on <Col N="690" /> elderly people living in lonely parts of the country.  The Garda Síochána are doing a tremendous job and deserve every help and encouragement we can give them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister said, this is a short Bill to achieve the limited purpose of increasing the number of High Court judges by two, and of confirming temporary appointments to the Circuit and District Courts.  The Minister made reference to the increase in the work load and in actions being brought before the courts at different levels.  I think he understated the increased volume of work and the need for further judges.</P>
      <P>I wish to clarify one point in relation to the Circuit Court.  As I understand it, the President of the Circuit Court is to retire at the end of this week. Does this mean there will be a new appointment to the Circuit Court apart from the two temporary judges who are being provided for in the Bill? Presuming that there is to be a new appointment following the retirement of Judge Durcan, there is still a very strong case for the two further judges in Dublin, in other words, two additional judges of the Circuit Court as well as the two temporary judges provided for in this Bill.</P>
      <P>There is a serious backlog of civil work in the Circuit Court in Dublin. The arrears result to some extent from the increase in criminal work and in tax work which takes up the time of Circuit Court judges.  It is very depressing for members of the Bar who practice in the Dublin circuit, trying to get civil work on.  It is giving rise to a good deal of comment and frustration by these practitioners.  The question of Circuit Court judges in Dublin should be kept under review.  There are strong arguments for an increase in judges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to support the observations made both by Senator Lenihan and Senator O'Higgins about the use of time by judges and time in the courts.  Senator O'Higgins made the point about court working hours.  I would not totally agree with that.  More and more courts are sitting at 10.30 a.m. to take family law matters in <Col N="691" /> camera and the Master's Court sits at 10.30 a.m.  The courts often sit beyond 4 p.m.  However the whole question of the long vacation is no longer valid. It was introduced to allow judges an opportunity to carry out their part-time activities.  This is no longer the case.  Indeed, it is prohibited by the Constitution that they have other salaried activities of any sort.  We should use the summer months to provide additional court time and in particular to allow the backlog to be cleared.  There is no reason why the courts would not sit in a cyclical way right through the summer months. Alternatively the long vacation should be much shorter than it is.  A short break might be desirable but not several months without courts except for emergency cases.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate when considering the question of increasing the number of judges to raise again the method of appointment of judges.  It is extremely important that we promote the values and the objectivity and fairness of our system and that we ensure that the system is not only fair as it operates but is clearly seen through its own structures to be fair.  It is wrong that the impression is created in the public arising from the method of appointment that a particular Administration appoint their judges when they are in office and ensures&mdash;for example with a Courts Bill like this&mdash;that any temporary appointments made are confirmed before there is an election and a possible change of Government.</P>
    <P>That is unnecessary and it undermines the objectivity of the administration of justice.  I would prefer that we address our minds to the establishment of a fair and objective method of appointing judges.  Also there are strong arguments for broadening the pool of those eligible for consideration as judges of our higher courts.  It is no longer a significant value in itself to draw the judge solely from the pool of practising barristers.  In a country like Ireland that pool is necessarily small.  It is little more than 200 people, from whom will be selected Circuit Court, High Court and Supreme Court judges.  It would be appropriate to broaden that to include members of <Col N="692" /> the solicitors' profession and also to include academic lawyers or others with a particular expertise and experience. I am well aware that a High Court or Supreme Court judge requires a specialist knowledge of court procedure and a particular expertise. However, other people, apart from practising barristers, would have had in their careers the possibility of that sort of expertise or they could go through a period of training and apprenticeship in a real sense for the position of judge.  I would favour both a more objective and fair system of appointment of judges which reinforced the concept of the objectivity of the appointment of judges and separation of powers and also a broader base of people who would be eligible to become judges.</P>
    <P>I should like to turn to another matter which I think is very important and which relates to the courts&mdash;not to the appointment or indeed even the remuneration of judges but rather to the question of staff in the Four Courts.  There is a considerable problem about staffing in the Four Courts giving rise to discontent and frustration among many members of the staff, particularly on the chancery side, on the side of the registrar of chancery, bankruptcy and the examiners. The staff there feel, and there is substance in their feeling, that they have been downgraded and that they do not have promotional opportunity. Consequently there is a very quick turnover of staff in some of these offices.  People who have acquired a certain expertise, for example in the bankruptcy office, move on because they do not want to remain there because they have not got a proper promotional structure, because they have not got opportunities and so on.  It is very serious, because we depend on the quality of the staff and the back-up service for the proper administration, particularly on the chancery side where there is a considerable amount of important paper work involved.</P>
    <P>In that connection, it is my understanding that there was a report on staffing and administration commissioned by the Government and carried <Col N="693" /> out by the firm of Coopers and Librant.  I should be grateful if the Minister would give some details of this report and, indeed, if he would indicate whether this report will be published.  It is a matter of public interest and concern that the question of proper staffing and proper administration be catered for.  This is becoming critical because we have passed, or are in the process of passing, legislation which makes further demands on the staff, legislation like the two Acts that Senator Quinlan referred to, The Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act and the Family Home Protection Act, and indeed the Landlord and Tenant Bill will make very considerable demands on staff. It is important that we ensure that there is adequate staff and that they have adequate promotion and adequate facilities in order to carry out the additional responsibilities which we give them.</P>
    <P>I should like to turn to the question of the increase in family law cases which the Minister referred to.  He said in his speech:</P>
    <P>I should also mention here that in the past two years there has been a sharp increase in the number of family law cases coming before the High Court and this increase has been given added impetus by the coming into force of the Family Law (Maintainance of Spouses and Children) Act and the Family Home Protection Act during 1976.  The position has already been reached where the hearing of these cases accounts for all practical purposes for the full time of one judge.  I am sure that the House will agree that having regard to the nature and special urgency of such cases any undue delay in dealing with them must be avoided.</P>
    <P>It is more important now, when we have brought in necessary reform in areas of family law, that we again address ourselves to the question of establishing family courts or tribunals. As a barrister who carries out some practice in the area of family law, it is my firm belief that the courts at the moment are inadequate for family law matters.  The High Court is not an adequate forum to decide complex <Col N="694" /> problems relating to the guardianship of infants or marital breakdown situations. It is not equipped to do it, it does not have the facilities to do it; It leads to delay and frustration which are compounded by the very high costs involved.</P>
    <P>This point has been raised by me before and the Minister was not enthusiastic about the idea of establishing family courts or family tribunals. I hope that the experience of the operation of these two Acts passed in 1976 has persuaded him somewhat. They have increased the number of family law cases but they have not improved the quality of administration of family law cases.</P>
    <P>I should like to make it clear that I regard our courts and judges as exceptional in a number of areas.  I regard the standard of judicial review by our judges as being of extraordinary good quality, of extraordinary concern for protecting the freedoms of the individual, for preventing State encroachment in one way or another, for fulfilling their constitutional responsibilities.  I think the courts are adequate in the normal area for determining matters of tort and contract, but there is a basic underlying weakness which imbalances the system, and that is the absence of free civil legal aid and advice.  This factor apart, the courts, under the adversary system, with the type of pleadings and the type of evidence which is adduced, constitute a system which I would certainly be prepared to stand over.</P>
    <P>In the area of family law, however, this is not an appropriate approach.  Time and again family law cases have not centred on the real problem because the court is not equipped to get the expertise it needs, because the judge himself has not the particular skills to assess and resolve the question of family law.  It is something which is undermining the credibility of the courts.  There are too many frustrated people with serious family problems who are not getting an adequate response from our courts system.  This is further compounded by the absence of free legal aid.  Somebody can pay more than £1,000 in the course of a Guardianship of Infants Act case which has dragged on for <Col N="695" /> several months and at the end of the day still not feel that they have got a satisfactory solution of the problem &mdash;similarly in other areas.</P>
    <P>It is time we seriously reviewed this situation and established a court or family law tribunal which would sit separately from the other courts. There could be a number of these family law tribunals which would be informal&mdash;without the need for wigs and gowns and other intimidating aspects of our court procedure&mdash; where there would be an emphasis on counselling, on the expertise of psychologists and psychiatrists where it is called for; where there would be a possibility of follow-up by the expert staff of the court itself and where this would be integrated with the health services of the State to give a structured response to family breakdown problems; where the matter was not coming before the judge in an adversary way by two people who were in contention, with counsel representing them on either side of a divide, and that that was the way the evidence had come forward.  The judge has not got the power or capacity or knowledge to seek other background information.  He is dependent on the parties bringing it forward in this contentious and adversary atmosphere.  It is a completely unsuitable type of approach to the particular problems which present themselves.</P>
    <P>Ironically, the problems which present themselves in Ireland in the area of family law are infinitely more complex than in other countries where there are more remedies&mdash;for example, where there is the remedy of civil divorce and remarriage.  Because we do not allow civil divorce and remarriage we have more complex family law problems, more complex problems relating to children, relating to the property of spouses where there have been breakdown situations.  We need to have adequate courts to deal with that problem.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the question of free civil legal aid and I should like to refer to it again.  The Minister established the Pringle Committee to examine the matter more <Col N="696" /> than two years ago&mdash;the Minister can correct me on the precise date; it is certainly over two years ago.  Some people think that the country cannot afford civil legal aid at the moment.</P>

      <P>I should like to intervene because the Senator is returning, for the second time, to the question of legal aid.  This is not central to this Bill or dealt with in it. While a passing reference would be in order the Chair would be somewhat perturbed if it was made a central issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to tie it in to the volume of work coming before our courts which necessitates the appointment of new judges and the confirming of temporary appointments to the Circuit and District Courts.  If it were possible to have a decision, and implement that decision, to establish a system of civil legal aid and advice then the volume of work, certainly in the area of family law, would increase again, perhaps qualitatively.  A number of cases are not brought because people cannot afford to bring them and there are a number of cases not brought because the people affected do not regard the courts as protective or as a place they can go and vindicate their rights.  There are cultural reasons for this and also the economic reasons that if one wants to have access to the courts one has to be able to afford to pay for the expertise, for the solicitor and counsel.  A significant number are deterred from that.  In the area of family law a number of cases could have been brought down the years but were not because of the absence of free legal aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I only have to look at the rising figures in the FLAC centres to support this argument.  Those FLAC centres which operate in the cities only reach a small portion of the possible cases. Mind you we cannot solve all the problems of citizens by encouraging and promoting litigation.  That is not the <Col N="697" /> point I am making.  Indeed, I can see ways in which we could reduce in certain areas, the need for litigation. One way would be to have a properly integrated system of family courts which included compulsory counselling. It may well be that if people get free advice early enough they could be well advised not to get involved in litigation.  That would be better for them, for the whole family situation, for their nerves and, ultimately, for their pocket.</P>
    <P>There are two essential reforms in the area of family law which have become more urgent because of certain legislative changes we have made, the establishment of a system of family courts or tribunals and the provision of free civil legal aid and advice.</P>
    <P>One point which is relevant to the question of the appointment of judges, and the increase in the number of judges in certain courts is the background from which we draw our judges.  I am not making the earlier point about the fact that the judges on the higher courts are drawn from practising barristers in the Law Library, I am talking about the educational background.  It is no longer acceptable, if it ever was, that those who study and practise law, and become judges and law teachers, come from a very narrow stream in our society.  The stream is narrower than for third level education generally and we know it is much too narrow even for the broad area of third level education.  It is narrower for a student reading for the Bar because there is no State aid or grants for that.  A student's parents have to pay substantial fees for membership of the Honourable Society of the Kings Inns, fees for the education during the four years and, ultimately, a fee to become a barrister, and a fee for the dinners which must be consumed in the process of becoming a barrister, or alternatively, a person works to support himself, and is therefore carrying a double burden of holding a job while reading for the Bar or, thirdly, as is the case with a significant number of people, they are being paid for by a State agency, the Garda and so on, to get the legal <Col N="698" /> qualification.  That person is unlikely to practise and is more likely to use that qualification in work in the Civil Service, Garda and so on.</P>
    <P>The majority of practising barristers come from a very narrow stream in society.  They are the practitioners before the higher courts and are, ultimately, the judges of the higher courts.  It is not acceptable that they do not reflect the whole population.  It accentuates a feeling of &ldquo;them&rdquo; and &ldquo;us&rdquo;, the cultural attitude of a significant proportion of the people towards the courts, lawyers and the administration of what they do not regard as being their justice.  They regard it as being something from which they are excluded.  That is a very serious matter because of the norms decided by the courts and because of the whole structure of the court system.  It is vital for the health of our democracy that our court system be open and accessible, that people genuinely feel it is protective of them, that we provide civil legal aid and advice as part of our State service early in people's problems.  One way to cut down on litigation is to give people good and adequate advice at an early enough stage to prevent the problems arising.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister, as a solicitor, will agree that a significant number of legal problems that end up in litigation arise because a person was not advised, or got the wrong advice from a non-lawyer or maybe got wrong advice from a lawyer, did not get adequate advice early enough to prevent the mistakes and the situation from accelerating and ultimately requiring litigation.  When we are talking about increasing the number of judges we also have to look seriously at the background from which we draw them and at the way in which our educational system makes the study of law a privilege for a very narrow section of our society.  This has very important implications when judgments are handed down, when justice is administered, when law is taught in universities and when there is a new group of law students coming up.  It is a very serious matter and something we should try to redress by ensuring that <Col N="699" /> there is access by any student desiring to become a lawyer, and with a sufficient level of educational achievement. They should be encouraged and promoted to take up the study of law and become practitioners and, ultimately, judges.</P>
    <P>With those remarks and the hope that the Minister will give some details of this report by Coopers and Librant on the question of staffing and conditions in the Four Courts, I welcome the Bill as a limited measure. For the reasons given I would like to see a more comprehensive measure which would introduce family law courts and a system of civil legal aid.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney) Patrick M. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Senators for their contributions and their welcome for the general principle of the Bill. Senators have glanced at various matters which the Cathaoirleach has reminded are not strictly connected with the main purpose of the Bill and I am sure the Chair will forgive me if I reciprocate some of the glances.  The main purpose of the Bill is to overcome delays in the High Court.  That is the kernel of the Bill.  The Bill seeks power to appoint two extra judges of the High Court.  It does not seek power to appoint extra judges of the Circuit or District Courts.  In relation to those two courts it seeks to make permanent the present temporary judges and justices serving there.</P>
      <P>I was disappointed to hear Senator Robinson make a reference which was similar to one made in the other House to the effect that cynical people might consider that these temporary judges and justices were being made permanent on the eve of a general election as a matter of patronage.  I wish to deny that that is the motivation. The motivation is to face the reality of the situation of temporary members of the Judiciary which has pertained for a long number of years. Invariably, when a person is appointed to the Circuit or District Court in a temporary capacity that person, in the fullness of time, becomes a permanent appointee without any break in service. That has been the reality for a number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="700" /> When temporary appointments were made about ten or 15 years ago they were to deal with particular exigencies and in many cases the appointees returned to practice.  For some years now there has been no break in service and it is a bit unreal not to recognise that when the appointment is made it is tantamount to permanency.  That should be recognised from the beginning so that the person is not prejudiced in terms of his service with regard to a pension and any other factors that may be involved.  It has been the practice of this Administration and previous Administrations to make permanent members in the order of their appointment in a temporary capacity.  There is no element of political patronage in this provision, nor is it a pre-election ploy.</P>
    <P>I shall deal with the question of delays in the three courts separately and I will take the High Court first. From the time a client instructs his solicitor until the case comes for hearing there are two stages, broadly speaking, the pre-trial procedures and the delay that that involves and the other stage of waiting from the time the case is set down for trial until it comes to hearing.  With regard to pre-trial procedures, Senators Lenihan, O'Higgins and Robinson spoke of the need to make the procedures more efficient and, if possible, speedier.  I agree that this is something which needs attention and reform.  The Committee on Court Practice and Procedure reported a few years ago on this point and made recommendations for large-scale reform in pre-trial procedures in the High Court, reform which would increase the jurisdiction and functions of the Master of the High Court which would enable parties to agree to certain matters in advance&mdash;it would enable them to agree to technical reports from doctors, engineers, architects and so on and fees.</P>
    <P>I am glad to tell the House that a Bill to implement the recommendation of that committee as regards that point is at an advanced stage of preparation.  I doubt if the timetable before the Summer Recess will enable me to have the Bill introduced <Col N="701" /> but, hopefully, it might.  That Bill implements the report of the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure on this point and I hope when implemented and it becomes law and when the new procedures are in being that they will have the effect of considerably shortening the pre-trial period so that the long delay that now exists from the time of the giving of instructions to a solicitor until the matter is set down for hearing can be considerably reduced.  We can only provide mechanisms to ensure that there will be no delay. After that we are in the hands of individual lawyers as to how speedily the procedures are worked.  That is not something over which I have or can have any real control.  One can have a situation where solicitors may be more or less efficient than others. They may consult barristers who may be more or less efficient or expeditious than others.  There are a variety of factors which can influence the length of time involved in pre-trial procedures.</P>
    <P>The Committee on Court Practice and Procedure reported in detail on this about four or five years ago. Nothing was done about it but I am glad to say that a Bill to implement that report is at an advanced stage of preparation.  I should like to correct Senator Lenihan on a point of accuracy.  He stated that that committee had now been superseded by the Law Reform Commission.  That is not so.  The Committee on Court Practice and Procedure still sits although it is not at the moment examining any particular matter relevant to its terms of reference.  The Law Reform Commission was set up to deal with matters of subtantive law as opposed to matters of practice and procedure.  The Committee on Court Practice and Procedure did on one occasion deal with a matter of substantive law at a specific request I made to them&mdash;and to enable them do it I extended their terms of reference&mdash;to advise me on the question of maintenance and protection of the family home.  It was their very valuable report which gave me the basis for the Bills which I had the privilege of proposing to this <Col N="702" /> House last year.  That Committee have done extremely valuable work in the past and I look forward to its doing work of equal value in the future.  It is not to be confused with the Law Reform Commission which deals only with substantive matters and whose programme was recently published. Senators will be aware that the programme they have undertaken contains matters of immense importance and of great interest to us all.</P>
    <P>As far as pre-trial procedures are concerned there is reform coming and I hope that reform will have the effect of speeding up the pre-trial procedures. We depend, ultimately, of course on the efficiency of the people involved in the system.  As far as the system is concerned we are making it more efficient, practical and less cumbersome.  This will have a very beneficial effect in one area of court practice, the necessity for professional witnesses to come for two, three or more successive days to the Four Courts in anticipation of their case coming for hearing.  Cases are called for a certain day but there is no certainty that they will be heard on that day.  A number of cases are ordered for the same day because very often cases are settled or adjourned or take a shorter time than anticipated so other cases must be ready to step in and fill the court's time but the converse can happen and cases might not be adjourned or might take longer than anticipated.  That means that those in the queue will have to wait longer than was originally reckoned.  This can lead to a great waste of time on the part of professional witnesses.  Understandably, they become irritated and some of them refuse to attend.  That makes it difficult for advocates and litigants and very often there is a pressure forcing settlements that possibly should not be effected at all.  If these pre-trial procedures for agreed medical reports can be implemented much of this waste of time of professional people can be obviated.</P>
    <P>The other area where there are delays is from the time of setting down until the hearing takes place.  I am hoping that the provisions in the Bill <Col N="703" /> to appoint extra judges will have a beneficial effect in reducing that time-lag. At the moment, as I indicated when I opened the debate the time-lag is of the order of ten months. When I took office in 1973 that time-lag was of the order of about 12 months.  We appointed an extra High Court judge then and that had the effect of reducing that time-lag gradually until by mid-1975 it was down to five months.  Five months sounds long but it is not unreasonable because from the time a case is set down for trial until it comes for hearing a lot of work may need to be done by the lawyers involved.  They generally want at least two months, and possible more.  Five months is possibly a bit long and I would like to see the time-lag reduced even less.</P>
    <P>Since mid-1975 the position commenced to deteriorate again and the time-lag has now crept up to ten months but I am hopeful that the appointment of an extra judge will have the same effect now as it had in 1973 of bringing that down.  We will keep the position monitored in consultation with the Presidents of the Courts concerned. In so far as administrative procedures or changes can contribute to more expeditious trial these will be effected.  Hopefully, there will be speedier litigation in the higher courts as a result of the two proposals, the pre-trial procedures being improved and, secondly the time-lag from the setting down of the action until its hearing being considerably shortened.</P>
    <P>The advice I have received is that the extra number of appointments required is two and that is what is provided for in the Bill.  It may well be that in 12 months' time or so, if there is a growth in litigation, particularly in family litigation, two judges are not enough. This is something we will keep under review.</P>
    <P>It is a simple matter to appoint extra judges but it is not a simple matter to provide the courts for them to sit in.  This leads me now to the position in regard to the Circuit Court where the position with regard to arrears and delays is much more serious.  I gave the figures in detail <Col N="704" /> in the other House and I do not propose to go through them again.  The number of cases that are awaiting trial, in the criminal and civil side, is depressingly large.  I should say that in relation to the High Court the arrears are entirely of a civil nature. The bulk of them relate to jury actions. They do not relate to non-jury cases where there is no delay of any consequence between setting down and getting a hearing.</P>
    <P>I should like to revert to the High Court and the question of juries. Senator Lenihan suggested that the presence of juries in tort cases is a cause of delay.  It may well be but the arguments for retaining juries in this type of case are sufficiently strong to continue with juries, even if they are a contributory factor to delays.  We should tackle the delays from some other angle rather than by removing the juries as part of the litigious procedure in tort cases.  The arguments for and against juries in these cases were fully gone into when we were debating a Bill dealing with juries last year.  It is hard to quantify the contribution of juries as a delaying factor.  I do not think it is very large.  Certainly, the arguments against removing them are sufficiently strong as to outweigh any arguments in favour of removing them from the point of view of their being a delaying factor.</P>
    <P>In the Circuit Court the arrears are almost exclusively in the Dublin area. There is one provincial circuit where, from time to time, there are arrears for reasons that are nobody's fault but they do not represent a serious problem. The arrears essentially are on the Dublin Circuit.  If it was only a question of appointing judges to clear these arrears that could be done in the morning and in this Bill and the number of judges could be increased but we are seriously short of court space in Dublin.  There are a number of remedies to deal with this on a short term and long term basis.  On the long term basis, as the House will know, we have acquired the Four Courts Hotel and it is the intention to turn that into a complex providing five or six additional courtrooms.  When they become available it will be almost <Col N="705" /> inevitable that extra Circuit Court judges will have to be appointed.  When I say, almost inevitable, the House may wonder why I do not say, it will be inevitable.  It may be possible to use the time of Circuit Court judges, who sometimes have spare time, to take up some of the slack on the Dublin Circuit. That will have to be fully investigated before we could go appointing extra Circuit Court judges.  It will be inevitable that extra Circuit Court judges will be appointed when the new courts come into operation.  In the meantime, and in the shorter term, accommodation has been acquired suitable for housing the Circuit Court office staff presently housed in the Four Courts building.  We are engaged in a crash programme to get this new accomodation ready so as to vacate part of the Four Courts with a view to turning that vacated part into a jury court for the Circuit Court.  That will certainly give immediate space early, I hope, next year for extra sittings of the Circuit Court to make some inroads on the arrears.</P>
    <P>We also have some other plans under consideration but because we are at a very early stage and consultation with a number of interests will be necessary before they can be announced, I would not like to preempt those consultations by indicating what I have in mind.  Senator Robinson touched on it when she spoke about the length of vacations and how possibly some portion of the vacations might be used.  I will say no more than that at this stage because the long vacation is rather a sacred thing.  I am hopeful we can introduce some remedial measures by the extra court space that will be provided when the Circuit Court staff move out.  There will also be extra court space available to us by reason of the new procedure of the High Court sitting in provincial centres.  This was a very desirable development. The High Court now sits for jury actions in a number of provincial centres, Galway, Limerick, Sligo and Cork.  This has had the effect of bringing justice to the litigants rather than making people come from far ends of the country to Dublin and have to spend three or four days on spec waiting for their case <Col N="706" /> to come up.  It also has the effect, of course, of leaving court space empty in the Four Courts.  I have been endeavouring to come to an arrangement with the various judges of the various courts to make use of this empty court space even on a temporary basis with a view to reducing the arrears in the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>In the District Court the position is much better than in the other two courts.  Essentially, there are no delays there.  There is some over-crowding in Dublin but we will have a temporary court in the Four Courts Hotel and we will also be able to use some of the space in the High Court complex also.  We hope that this will enable the District Court to be brought up to date.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson asked about the question of staff in the Four Courts. This, of course, is a serious matter.  It is important that there be an efficient and contented staff so that the courts can be serviced fully.  It is essential that this be the case because if courts are not serviced fully and efficiently there will be delays and breakdowns. I should like to pay tribute to the existing staff because there has never been any complaints about the servicing of the courts either from lawyers, from the bench or members of the public.  This, of course, is a tribute to the efficiency of the staff.  If the courts are going to expand by increasing their numbers and if the amount of business coming in is expanding the staffing arrangements have to be looked at.  It is true, as Senator Robinson said, that the Department had a management consultancy study done on the organisation of the staffing in the Four Courts.  The report has been received and is presently being analysed.  I expect to receive the report and the resulting analysis in the near future.  I will then consider any changes that will have to be made or new procedures adopted.</P>

The implementation of it, naturally, of course, will be discussed in the greatest detail and completely and fully with the staff concerned.  There will be no question of implementing anything over their heads.  They will be consulted on the implementation.  That is not to say that one will get agreement on every point of implementation but, so far as possible, agreement will be sought.  The staff will be fully consulted on the implementation of the report.  That is an indication that we are conscious of the need to keep staff and staffing structures under review so that that end of court administration will be able to keep up with increased work and expansion.</P>

      <P>Ironically, this came up in the other House when the Opposition criticised the Government for the method of appointment and recalled that when the present Government were in Opposition they too had criticised the Government of the day in precisely the same terms.  It was clear that both sides of the House were agreed that it was a bad system of appointment. The irony occurs in the fact that both sides of the House were also agreed that that imperfect system of appointment has produced an excellent <i>corps</i> of judges.  That was the conclusion that both sides reached.  I think that conclusion has been confirmed here by Senator Robinson's tribute to the members of the Judiciary.  We have been very well served by the judges who have sat in our courts since the foundation of the State.  The result is what we have to look at.  Perhaps, theoretically, the system of appointment could be faulted but in practice it has worked extremely well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of broadening the pool of persons eligible for appointment, <Col N="708" /> possibly this is something that we could debate in depth on another occasion, As a solicitor, I would receive sympathetically the suggestion that solicitors should be considered eligible for appointment to the higher courts.  Again one must consider that the qualification for appointment in the higher courts requires a knowledge and experience greater than that achieved by the average solicitor in the course of his work.  It requires an intimate knowledge of the workings of the higher courts and experience in reading law and judicial decisions.  It also requires the capacity to write legal judgments.  This comes from practise as a barrister more than it would come from practice as a solicitor because the practising barrister has to read much more law than does the practising solicitor.  He is also involved in writing legal opinions to a much greater extent than is the practising solicitor.  These are arguments in favour of continuing the present system.  However, I do not want to go into the matter in any more detail than that.</P>
    <P>On the question of the High Court not being a suitable forum for dealing with questions of family law, this is a complex area of sociology and law that I do not propose to go into now.  Senator Robinson makes the point that the present system leaves feelings of dissatisfaction in the parties coming before the courts and is not dealing fully and competently with the problems coming before them. These problems are so emotional, sensitive and complex, and they are sociological rather than legal, that it is difficult to see what sort of tribunal could have within itself the reserves of wisdom, experience and intelligence that would give to the parties in that particular type of case a full feeling of satisfaction that the decision is absolutely perfect.  That is hoping for something that literally cannot be achieved.  As I say, we are moving in that direction in the sense that we have now set up, away from the courts complex proper, two courts, one for the District Court and one for the High Court, which will be reserved for cases of this type.  We will get experience from the people practising <Col N="709" /> in those courts and from people sitting in those courts of how the matter is developing and it will be kept under review.  It is not something that I am against but it is something that I would be slow to introduce and not until I would be satisfied that I knew exactly what the problem was and satisfied also that the problem was capable of being solved along the lines of what is loosely termed a family court.  This definition will have to be hardened up and we will have to know exactly what we mean by a family court, what it is to be composed of, where it is to sit and what part of the judicial system it is to be inserted in.  There is a lot of consideration to be given to that particular concept yet.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinlan pleaded for uniformity among justices in passing sentences. It is not possible to have absolute uniformity.  There must be disparity between sentences for the very good reason that no two cases are the same.  There may be two case of dangerous driving but the elements going into making up the offence of dangerous driving will inevitably differ in the two cases.  They will be serious or less serious and, consequently, the verdict of the District Court on the two similar offences must vary to take account of the particular case before the court.  It is not possible to have absolute uniformity, nor is it possible to have even approximate uniformity. There must be disparity.  It may be possible to have uniformity in minor cases where what are called technical absolute offences are concerned.  This is a matter that concerns the District Court justices.  Meetings between these justices are provided for by statute.  I understand that on the agenda at these statutory meetings is consideration of the question of uniformity of decisions.</P>
    <P>I think I have covered all the points that were raised in the course of the debate.  I conclude by thanking Senators again for the welcome for the Bill.  The Bill is designed to do a very necessary thing&mdash;to increase the number of judges in the High Court by two with a view to minimising and reducing the delay in trials in that court.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Corish) Brendan Corish">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Corish)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to bring the law on narcotic drugs up to date.  The Bill also provides for certain amendments of the Poisons Act, 1961 and other Acts, which are purely technical and have no direct relevance to the provisions in relation to the misuse of drugs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although the Bill is a complex one, in the sense that it is designed to deal with a difficult social problem as well as meeting our international obligations as a member of the United Nations, its general layout and construction&mdash;excluding the provisions relating to the amendment of the Poisons Act&mdash;can be summarised under four main headings.  The Bill first of all specifies certain offences which are directly or indirectly related to the suppression of illicit traffic in drugs. Next, there is provision for a wide range of controls over the production <Col N="711" /> and supply of controlled drugs, the general aim of which is to ensure that these drugs will be used only for legitimate medical or scientific purposes and will not be diverted into illicit channels. Thirdly, there are clearly defined provisions for enforcement including powers of inspection, search and arrest, allied to which are the provisions for penalties and the concomitant provisions for treatment and rehabilitation of drug offenders.  Finally, there are miscellaneous supplementary and ancillary provisions such as the procedures for dealing with cases of irresponsible prescribing in sections 7 to 12.</P>
    <P>It is scarcely necessary for me at this point to comment in detail on each of these four broad segments of the Bill, especially as there will be greater scope for discussion and clarification of their salient features at Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I would like, however to say a special word about section 28.  This section, which is largely an extension of the penalty provisions in section 27, contains the provisions relating to treatment and rehabiliation of drug offenders.  These provisions deserve special mention because they are innovative in modern drugs legislation and add a new dimension to the disposition by the courts of persons convicted of certain drug offences.</P>
    <P>Heretofore the courts had no option, once a person was convicted of an offence, other than to impose a fine or sentence of imprisonment.  This frequently resulted in the rather harrowing spectacle of a young person with a drug problem, who was not a criminal in the real sense, being committed to prison to no real purpose. Under the Bill it will now be possible for the courts, and mandatory in some cases, to obtain a report on the health and social circumstances of the convicted person before finally deciding how the case should be disposed of.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, the Bill as originally introduced in Dáil Éireann was referred to a Special Committee of that House.  In commending the Bill to this House, let me pay particular tribute to the very effective <Col N="712" /> manner in which it was dealt with in the Special Committee of Dáil Eireann whose members, Government and Opposition alike, contributed significantly to making it a more effective legislative instrument.</P>
    <P>Whilst this was a logical procedure for a Bill of such complexity, it also proved very useful in the sense that it helped to resolve more readily a number of issues which could otherwise have proved tedious and on which a consensus would have been difficult to achieve in Committee Stage debate of the full House.</P>
    <P>The first of these issues was in relation to the penalties for offences involving cannabis.  There was a strong body of opinion in the Committee that there should be some relaxation in the maximum penalties for &ldquo;simple&rdquo; possession of cannabis.  The view had been put forward that cannabis should be legalised but, when the issues involved were comprehensively discussed by the Committee, a consensus emerged that such an approach would be too drastic and could not be justified in present circumstances, particularly as there is considerable debate in scientific circles as to the effects of cannabis, especially in the long term.</P>
    <P>There was, as I have said, a very full and frank discussion on this subject in the Committee characterised by a willingness on all sides to responsibly and constructively face the issues involved, both from the point of view of the offenders and the public good.  In the event it was decided that for first or second offences involving possession of cannabis for one's personal use the maximum penalty should be a fine of £50 or £100 respectively, without the option of a prison sentence.  Only following a third or subsequent offence with this drug is the option of prison sentence given to the court.  I feel that the structure of the penalties for possession of cannabis provided for in the Bill reflects broadly the general feelings of the public at large on the subject.</P>
    <P>This decision necessitated the amendment of section 27 of the Bill and the consequent restructuring of the schedule of controlled drugs.  The more complex system of classifying the drugs in three <Col N="713" /> separate categories for penalty purposes was abandoned in favour of a single list, the only distinction now remaining being that between cannabis and all other drugs in the case of the particular offence to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>The second aspect of the Bill which underwent substantial alteration as a result of Committee Stage consideration was in relation to enforcement.  For instance, in the case of section 24 there had been strong representations by the organised medical profession and other bodies to the effect that the section as originally drafted was so wide that it could be interpreted as enabling the Garda or an officer of the Minister to enter a doctor's surgery and inspect confidential medical records.  This of course was not the intention of the section as drafted.  For this reason, and also because I considered the section unsatisfactory in other respects, I suggested certain amendments which would more clearly and precisely reflect its real purpose, which is to enable enforcing officers to inspect the premises and records of persons producing or distributing controlled drugs in the ordinary course of commercial business.  These amendments were unreservedly accepted by the Special Committee and I am satisfied that the new section meets the case made by the medical profession.</P>
    <P>For the same reasons I proposed, on Report Stage in the Dáil, the deletion of a specific reference to forged prescriptions in section 23 and this proposal was also unreservedly accepted by the House.</P>
    <P>Section 25 of the Bill, dealing with the power of arrest, was the subject of protracted discussion at Committee Stage.  In its original form this section conferred an unqualified power of summary arrest on any member of the Garda Síochána who was of opinion that a person had committed an offence under the Act.  Some members of the Special Committee expressed serious concern that this power was excessive and too all-embracing.</P>
    <P>While accepting that the provision for summary arrest was not without precedent and that a strong case could be made for the original section <Col N="714" /> on the grounds that the nature of drug-trafficking and the ease with which evidence of it can be concealed called for flexible powers of the Garda, it seemed to me that a balance had to be struck by defining the circumstances in which the power of summary arrest could be used, while at the same time retaining the original unrestricted provision for the more serious offences.</P>
    <P>Although it was not possible to reach finality on this issue on Committee Stage, the Special Committee had expressed its approval in principal to an amendment of section 25 on the general lines which I had indicated, on the understanding that I would introduce such an amendment on Report Stage.</P>
    <P>Section 25 of the Bill as passed by the Dáil represents a substantial modification of the original section. It provides an unrestricted power of summary arrest for an offence under section 15, that is, &ldquo;pushing&rdquo; or &ldquo;peddling&rdquo; of drugs.  Such provision is absolutely necessary to cope adequately with the problem of pushers whose &ldquo;stock in trade&rdquo; is extreme mobility.  For all other offences this power is qualified&mdash;the Garda must be reasonably satisfied that the suspected offender will abscond or evade the course of justice or that he has given a false name and address and so on.</P>
    <P>In my view the section as it now stands represents the best possible compromise in a difficult situation.  It is adequate and suitable to deal with the drug problem in this country as it is at present or as it is likely to be in the foreseeable future.  At the same time it safeguards the rights of citizens against arbitrary or unreasonable use of police powers.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say at the outset that we welcome the Bill introduced here by the Minister.  Its very title reminds us of the fact that there has been misuse of drugs ever since the beginning of civilisation.  The Bill is more or less concerned with the misuse of drugs which are otherwise very useful, particularly in surgical <Col N="715" /> hospitals, in dentists' rooms and in various other places.  History tells us that Red Indians and tribes in Africa and other areas discovered thousands of years ago that certain drugs existed and there has always been a certain amount of trafficking and drug pushing.</P>
      <P>Drugs were meant in the first instance to relieve pain.  Whether that pain was mental or physical, it was important to the sufferer that some method would be found to alleviate it. Today we have many different types of drugs.  They are used not just for humans but also used for animals and plants.  They seem to have a very great effect on every one of these categories.</P>
      <P>To control the use of drugs at present is often rather difficult.  Small quantities of drugs can be very potent and dangerous.  They can be very easily smuggled from one country to another and transported from place to place.  Consequently it requires an enormous amount of detection work by the staff at ports around our coasts and at airports.  Even then, despite the minute searches that may be carried out by customs officials, these drug pushers are probably able to evade them.  Coupled with that, there are the hardships caused to other innocent travellers who may be delayed because of the suspicion that certain people may be carrying drugs.</P>
      <P>The Minister has mentioned certain controls in the Poisons Acts.  When the Minister mentioned this I immediately thought of certain types of drugs or chemicals used to kill plants or weeds, in particular, I thought of paraquat, which is deadly dangerous.  It causes the loss of many lives from year to year.  Very often in the case of drugs which are prohibited the reaction is to change the name and they appear again in a different form.  Could the same thing apply to the various drugs, in particular cannabis, mentioned by the Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem of drugs is a social one.  It transcends national frontiers. If the use of drugs is commonplace in the United States and elsewhere it is only natural to expect that the same situation will exist here, but perhaps not on the same scale.  Nevertheless, <Col N="716" /> pushers are able to cross national frontiers and reach teenagers with their drugs.</P>
    <P>It is stated&mdash;I do not know how reliably&mdash;that there are many drug pushers operating in this city and drugs are being offered in bars, discos, dance halls and various other places where young people congregate.  Our young people are a highly educated sector of the community.  The media should warn them about drug pushers and point out to them the medical effects that such indulgence will have both on themselves and their families in years to come.  I would welcome such a campaign by the media.  Very often we find in some of these horror films that the hero becomes a superman through using drugs.</P>
    <P>Before imposing penalties it is important to see if we can effect a cure of some kind.  We should try to marshall all available resources to point out the dangers.  It is easier to do that than to wait until the drug pushers have been caught and the teenagers have had the experience of drugs, possibly leading to addiction. At that stage it is very difficult to cure them.  Many hospitals and doctors are trying to combat this problem. Rehabilitation of people who have been addicted is a very difficult process.  It behoves us to have the best possible medical advice, whether we get it here or abroad.  A large proportion of our population is in the 18 to 30 age bracket.  Younger people are more likely to try drugs to see what kicks they can get from them.</P>
    <P>To speak of penalties is a difficult matter.  I am not <i>au fait</i> with the situation but I believe that some of the drugs are very expensive and thousands of pounds worth could be carried in a very small container and the imposition of a £50 fine on drug pushers does not seem to be a great deterrent.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of a prison sentence.  This is also a difficult matter, but if it would help to prevent this problem it should be welcomed. These drug pushers are doing no service to the nation or to future generations.  In so far as we can, we must be firm with them.  There is no <Col N="717" /> place for kid gloves.  If they commit this offence on several occasions they should be sent to prison.  They are a nuisance to the nation as a whole.</P>
    <P>I do not know what techniques the Garda and the Special Branch use or how well-equipped they are to deal with this problem.  A garda who is in uniform is at a disadvantage.  This is a situation in which it would be beneficial to have some trained group of young people who would check the spread of drug taking at the roots.  The misuse of drugs is not prevalent among elderly people.</P>
    <P>I am in agreement with the opinion of the Special Committee regarding the confidentiality of patients attending doctors and the consulting of medical records.  It would be wrong for some individuals to have the power to inspect the medical records of any person.  There should always be a certain amount of confidentiality between the patient and the doctor.</P>
    <P>The Minister is to be commended on the introduction of this very important Bill.  I can assure him of every possible help from this side of the House in trying to eradicate this problem.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to say a few words on this Bill as I have a particular interest in it.  Being the officer in charge of student discipline in Trinity College, the drug problems impinge on me and have done so over the years.  I can only speak about the student community. Six or seven years ago there was a very severe increase in the problem of drug taking but, I am glad to say, that <Col N="718" /> has now decreased and the problem, so far as I have been concerned, has been minimal over the past couple of years.  We were faced five or six years ago with a very severe drug problem among the student community.  I would guess this was a reflection of the general situation in the country as a whole.  Perhaps this tied up in some way with the world-wide situation.  I have been disturbed to read some reports recently of very severe problems in some of the continental cities where the problem seemed to be increasing rather than decreasing.  It is as well that we should update our legislation.  We should be prepared for the sort of eventualities that we may have to face, even though the problem may not be as severe here as it has been.</P>
    <P>I agree with the basic tenor of the Bill.  The people to get at are the pushers.  They are the people to deal with severely.  They are the ones who are making money out of this.  They are exploiting drugs to the detriment of others and they are in it for the money.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that rehabilitation of offenders at an early stage is the best course.  I have a special interest in rehabilitation.  A great deal can and has been done for first offenders, people who have been led into the fringes of the drug scene.  The best approach is to wean them away from it.  I am glad to see that this is the approach of this Bill.  We are not dealing solely with first offenders and with the soft drugs.  The Minister has mentioned the problem of distinction between the various classes of drugs.</P>
