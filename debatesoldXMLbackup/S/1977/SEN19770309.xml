      <P>I should like to ask the Leader of the House what is the position about No. 7 on the Order of Business.  I think the Second Stage debate on the Family Planning Bill, 1974, was taken on the last sitting day, which was a month ago today, and it was adjourned to give the Tánaiste an opportunity to consult with the political parties.  That consultation was not to take very long and my guess is that the consultation is finished.  Therefore we should continue with the Second Stage of the Bill.  It might be convenient for the political parties to let it rest, but I do not think we should.  I think we should take item No. 7 as soon as possible.  I would like an undertaking from the Leader of the House about the possibilities of taking item No. 7.</P>

      <P>I should like to support Senator West in his suggestion that we should continue the debate on this very important subject.  It would be quite absurd if we leave it hanging in midair like Mohammed's coffin without apparently having the courage of our convictions to vote for it or against it. That is positive action.  But we should not leave it the way it is.  Could the Leader of the House give us some <Col N="176" /> indication when he thinks it will be possible for us to take it?</P>

      <P>I have not any information when the proposers wish to continue the discussion on No. 7.  As far as I am concerned it is a matter for the House.  If the House want to order it for today, they are entitled to do so.  The Minister has already made his contribution, so it would not seem to me that the Minister's attendance is necessary if the House want to go ahead with the discussion.</P>

    <P Just="Center">SECTION 3.</P>

      <P>This is a drafting amendment.  Although most people assume that the term &ldquo;friendly societies&rdquo; covers all societies registered under the Friendly Societies Acts, there is a specific definition of a &ldquo;friendly society&rdquo; in those Acts. This definition classifies one group as friendly societies for the purpose of the Acts.  There are four other groups variously described&mdash;for example, benevolent societies and especially authorised societies.  To enable regulations to cover all those societies it is necessary to delete the word &ldquo;friendly&rdquo; in section 2 (2) so that the more limited definition of &ldquo;friendly society&rdquo; will not be a confining factor in the type of regulation which can be made under section 3.</P>

      <P Just="Center">SECTION 4.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 2:</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(1)  In this section &lsquo;a society to which this section applies&rsquo; means a registered society of a class in relation to which regulations under subsection (2) of this section apply.</P>
      <P>(2)  The Minister may, by regulations, require that each society of a specified class or specified classes of registered society operating a loan fund under section 46 of the Principal Act shall, immediately after the first annual general meeting of the society to be held on or after a specified date, have a supervisory committee.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="178" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 4 previously applied to specially authorised loan societies, namely, only one class of society registered under the Friendly Societies Acts.  It has now been decided to make this section applicable by ministerial regulation to other classes of society operating loan funds under section 46 of the Principal Act of 1896.  The supervisory committee concept is borrowed from the Credit Union Act, 1966, and was applied to specially authorised loan societies in the Bill as introduced because their objects and mode of operations are considerably akin to those of credit unions.</P>
      <P>However, since other societies as well as specially authorised loan societies can in certain circumstances operate loan funds as a secondary activity, it was considered desirable that this aspect of their activity, namely, the operation of a loan fund, could also be controlled in a manner similar to that proposed in the original draft of the Bill for specially authorised loan societies to the extent that a supervisory committee could be required to be created by regulation by the Minister as and when he thought it necessary depending on the scale and type of loan funds operated by other societies apart from the specific category, namely, specially authorised loan societies which are covered in the original draft of the Bill.</P>
      <P>It is, in effect, extended to all relevant friendly societies who might operate a loan society, a principle which has already been accepted in the case of credit unions in the 1966 Act and in the case of specially authorised loan societies in the original draft of this Bill.  This concept of a supervisory committee is being extended to cover all such eventualities as and when the Minister deems that to be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (2) previously stipulated that each society to which the section applies must have a supervisory committee after the first annual general meeting after 1st January, 1977.  This particular date was inserted on the basis of the Bill being enacted during 1976.  Since this has not happened and the section can now be <Col N="179" /> applied to different classes of society at different times, it is intended to have the operative date under this section specified by regulation rather than in the actual text of the Bill as was originally intended.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

      <P>Amendment No. 4 is consequential on amendment No. 3.  Consequently they should both be discussed together.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (3), to delete lines 12 to 14 and to substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) At the first annual general meeting of a society to which this section applies to be held on or after the date specified in regulations under subsection (2) of this section in relation to a class of registered society to which that society belongs, and at each third subsequent annual general meeting of the&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In error I dealt with the principle involved in amendments Nos. 3 and 4 at the conclusion of my remarks on the previous amendment. Originally the provision for a supervisory committee was to be made at the first annual general meeting to be held on or after the first day of January, 1977.  It is now proposed, in view of the fact that the requirement for a supervisory committee may be brought in by regulation at different times in respect of different categories of society who may operate loan funds, that the date of the annual general meeting at which provision for a supervisory committee would be made should be settled by regulation rather than by provision of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point I should mention is a further change in the original provision. In the original draft of the Bill the supervisory committees were to sit for terms of one year only and it is now being provided that they will sit for a period of three years.  There is a very practical reason for this.  The duties of these committees are to supervise the activities of the friendly society in operating their loan funds to ensure that the officers of the <Col N="180" /> friendly society carry out their functions in a manner which is safe from every point of view, particularly from the point of view of people who have financial interests in the society. They are in a sense voluntary auditors.  Their job is to keep a detached eye on the activities of the society.  This can involve them in what could be quite difficult technical matters, studying of books, examining of officers of the society and so forth. Quite clearly, if the term of office of the supervisory committee was only to be one year there is the danger that people would only have mastered the technicalities of their job by the time their year in office had expired. Therefore, if they were then replaced by somebody else, there would never be a situation in which they would be a really effective and knowledgeable supervisory committee sitting in relation to the society in question.  It was felt therefore that a three-year term would be more appropriate. People would get to know their job in the first six months and there would then be two-and-a-half years of effective supervision by them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment seems to me to be a rather big change on the original.  Instead of the supervisory committee being elected at the annual general meeting they would now be elected and would sit for three years.  I am concerned with the effect of this in relation to credit unions.  It is specified in credit union regulations that the board of directors and the supervisory committee are elected at each annual general meeting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should explain to the Senator that this Bill does not apply to credit unions.  The Bill applies to societies which carry out activities analogous to those of credit unions.  It applies solely to friendly societies.  Credit unions are not friendly societies.  They are industrial and provident societies.</P>

      <P>Government amendment No. 4:</P>

    <P Just="Center">SECTION 8.</P>
    <P>Government amendment No. 5:</P>
    <P>In page 4, before section 8, to insert the following section:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister may by regulations amend sections 8, 41, 56 to 58, 62 and 65 of the Principal Act, or any one or more of those sections, so as to increase by such amount or amounts as he think fit any one or more of the amounts specified in those sections.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill as introduced gives the Minister power to alter by regulation only those financial limits which apply to the granting of loans by societies under section 46 of the Principal Act.  The present amendment is designed to give the Minister power to alter by regulation financial limits which apply generally to societies. These limits were last increased in 1966.  Since then there has been, obviously, significant devaluation in currency and the limits set then are appropriate to be considered for review 11 years later.  I might mention the limits in question which were imposed by the Principal Act.  Under section 8 of the Principal Act the limit of £52 was set on the amount a friendly society could assure by way of annuity and a limit of £1,000 on the amount a friendly society could assure by way of gross sum.  In section 41 of the Act there is a limit of £1,000 on the amount a member, or a person claiming to be a member, may receive by way of gross sum together with bonuses.  A limit of £52 is set on the amount a member may receive by way of annuity.  Section 56 of the Principal Act sets a limit of £1,000 on the amount a member can dispose of by way of nomination payable on death.  Section 57 sets a limit of £1,000 on the amount a society may pay to a nominee.  Section 58 provides that, <Col N="182" /> where a member dies intestate and his property in the society does not exceed £1,200, then the society may distribute such property among the persons who appear to be entitled by law to receive it.  In sections 62 and 65 there is provision that a friendly society shall not insure a child under five years for a sum exceeding £20 or a child under ten years for a sum exceeding £30.</P>
      <P>It is considered that it would be appropriate to allow the Minister to consider the amendment of these various limits.  The proposition before the Seanad is that power be taken to do this by regulation.  As the Seanad is aware, under section 8 of the Bill as at present drafted any such regulation will be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and shall not take effect until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each House.  In regard to any action to be taken by the Minister under this section the powers sought in this amendment ensure that the matter will come to the House for debate.</P>

    <P>87.  (3) If any person obtains possession by false representation or imposition of any property of <Col N="183" /> a registered society or branch, or withholds or misapplies any such property in his possession, or wilfully applies any part thereof to purposes other than those expressed or directed in the rules of the society or branch and authorised by this Act, he shall, on such complaint as is in this section mentioned, be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £250, and costs, and to be ordered to deliver up all such property, or to repay all sums of money applied improperly, and in default of such delivery or repayment, or of the payment of such fine and costs as aforesaid, to be imprisoned, with or without hard labour, for any time not exceeding three months.</P>
    <P>88.  If any person wilfully makes, orders, or allows to be made, any entry, erasure in, or omission from a balance sheet of a registered society or branch, or a return or document required to be sent, produced, or delivered for the purposes of this Act, with intent to falsify the same, or to evade any of the provisions of this Act, he shall be liable to a fine not exceeding £500.</P>
    <P>89.  A society or branch, and an officer or member of a society or branch, or other person guilty of an offence under this Act for which a fine is not expressly provided shall be liable to a fine of not more than £100.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an entirely new matter in the Bill.  Its purpose is to make provision to update the fines under Friendly Societies legislation in general.  These fines were set in 1896 and clearly given the great extensions since then, they have not a great deterrent effect in 1977.  It is now proposed to bring the fines up to date.  I might mention that the levels of fines being set in the amendment are similar to those which were introduced in Great Britain in 1974 when they introduced amending legislation to the same Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 87 of the 1896 Act deals with fraud and misappropriation.  The fine for a summary conviction is being <Col N="184" /> increased in the proposed amendment from £20 to £250.  Section 88 of the Principal Act prescribes a maximum fine for falsification of documents.  It is designed principally to cover omissions, erasures, or false entries of accounts. The maximum fine here is being increased from £50 to £500.  Section 89 of the 1896 Act set a maximum fine of £5 for ordinary offences.  These would include failure to submit returns or other documents to the registrar, furnishing information which is false or insufficient and so forth.  This limit of £5 in the 1896 Act is being raised to £100.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the motion is to give effect to the procedure necessary to deal with the Bill on Committee Stage. The Bill, as the House is aware, is a consolidation Bill of all the social welfare legislation stretching back over the years.  The number of Bills that will be consolidated is in excess of 60 dating back to 1908.  There is also the question of regulations.  There are about 100 which will also be consolidated consequent on the passage of this Bill.  The purpose of the motion is to give effect to the setting up of the Standing Joint Committee which will deal with the Committee Stage of the Bill under the Standing Orders of the House.  There is, as the House is aware, a standing committee of both Houses and I understand that under the rules of the House this standing committee may be added to by three Members for the purpose of dealing with the Committee Stage of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the House will agree that the need and desirability for consolidation of the social welfare code is long overdue.  Difficulties have been experienced not only by professional social workers and people within the Department of Social Welfare but also by very many people dealing, working and acting on behalf of both <Col N="186" /> statutory and voluntary bodies throughout the country who are interested in the field of social welfare and who play a very important role in conveying to the public what their rights are under existing legislation.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Seanad will agree that this is a very considerable advance in the field of social welfare, one for which there have been many requests from both sides of both Houses and from many organisations outside.  I would hope and indeed, I expect that we will deal with the Bill as quickly as possible.  If there are any questions from any Senator I will try to deal with them.</P>

On the question &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration&rdquo;, the Minister may explain the purport of the amendments made by the Dáil and this is looked upon as the report of the Dáil amendments to the Seanad. The only matters, therefore, that may be discussed are the amendments made by the Dáil.</P>
      <P>For the convenience of Senators, I arranged for the printing and circulation to them of a list of the amendments made by the Dáil.</P>

      <P>A number of amendments, mainly of a drafting nature, were made to the Bill in the course of its passage through the Dáil and I will comment briefly on each of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 1, 2 and 10 on the list which has been circulated are similar.  They provide for updating of the collective citation of the Fisheries Acts in sections 1 and 3 of the Bill <Col N="187" /> which was necessitated by the enactment of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1976, which became law following the passing of this Bill by the Seanad.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 3, 5 and 30 are related.  Amendment No. 3 amends the definition of &ldquo;local authority&rdquo; in section 1 to include the Corporation of Dún Laoghaire with the corporations of the county boroughs and councils of the counties in the definition for the purposes of this Bill. Amendments Nos. 5 and 30 are consequential on amendment No. 3. Amendment No. 5 applies the provisions of the County Management Acts relating to the performance of &ldquo;reserved functions&rdquo; by Dún Laoghaire Corporation to the reserved function of making water quality management plans under section 15 of this Bill, and amendment No. 30 provides that the expenses of Dublin county council under this Bill will be charged on the county exclusive of the borough of Dún Laoghaire.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 4 and 30 are related.  As the term &ldquo;monitoring&rdquo;, which is used in sections 4, 16 and 22 of the Bill, is open to a number of possible interpretations, it was considered desirable to define it for the purposes of the Bill.  The definition provided for in amendment No. 4 includes the various activities, such as inspection, measurement, sampling and analysis, coming within the meaning of the term as used in the Bill. Amendment No. 23 is a minor drafting amendment which is consequential on amendment No. 4.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 6 inserts a new subsection&mdash;subsection (8)&mdash;in section 2 of the Bill requiring the Water Pollution Advisory Council to make a report to the Minister each year of their activities in the preceding year and requires the Minister to cause copies of the report to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 7, 11, 12, 15, 16 17, 18, 19, 21, 24, 26, 27, 28 and 29 are related.  They are purely drafting amendments necessitated by the recent setting up of a separate Department of Fisheries.  They provide for the substitution <Col N="188" /> of &ldquo;Minister for Fisheries&rdquo; for &ldquo;Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries&rdquo; wherever the latter term appears in the Bill.</P>
    <P>With regard to amendment No. 8, the Bill as passed by the Seanad provided, by virtue of section 3 (5) (a), that the general prohibition in section 3 on the entry of polluting matter to waters would not apply to trade or sewage effluents.  The reason for this was that section 4, which sets up a licensing system, deals with the control of such effluents.  Section 4 (10), however, allows for exemption of certain classes of licensable effluents.  The classes of effluent which are likely to be considered for exemption by regulations under subsection (10) of section 4 are effluents which, in the generality of cases, are unlikely to cause pollution problems&mdash;for example, discharges from septic tanks serving individual houses&mdash;and may not warrant the inconvenience and administrative cost of licensing.  Any effluent so exempted would, under the Bill as passed by the Seanad, be subject neither to the licensing provisions of section 4 nor the general prohibition in section 3.  While, as I have said, the effluents concerned pose little or no pollution threat, it was nevertheless considered desirable to amend section 3 (5) (a) to provide that any effluent exempted from the licensing requirements of section 4 by regulations made under subsection (10) of that section would be brought within the scope of the general prohibition in section 3, unless it complied with any relevant standard which may be prescribed under section 26.  Amendment No. 8 makes this change.  Amendment No. 9 covers a minor drafting point.  It substitutes the word &ldquo;section&rdquo; for &ldquo;sections&rdquo; in section 3 (5) (c).</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 13 and 25 are related.  While I would emphasise that it would be the intention to consult the Water Pollution Advisory Council in relation to the making of important regulations under this legislation even if there were no specific statutory requirement to do so, Members <Col N="189" /> of both Houses seemed anxious to ensure that there should be a consultation requirement in relation to specific issues.  Senators will recall that amendments requiring such consultation were made by this House in the case of sections 25, 26 and 27.  Amendments Nos. 13 and 25 now require consultation with the council also in relation to the making of regulations under two additional sections.  These are regulations under section 4(10) exempting effluents from the licensing requirements of section 4 and regulations under section 24 dealing with the important issue of consultation between local authorities, boards of conservators and other interested bodies in the exercise of relevant powers and duties under this legislation.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 14 and 22 are related.  They incorporate a provision in sections 6 and 19, which deal with the making of regulations prescribing mainly procedural matters relating to applications for and appeals in respect of licences for discharges to waters and to sewers, to the effect that where a person is convicted of making a statement in writing which is false or to his knowledge misleading in relation to a licence application or an appeal, any licence issued to that person consequent on the application or the appeal will be automatically revoked.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 20 is simply a drafting amendment to eliminate a slight inconsistency in terminology. The amendment brings the wording of section 16 (1) into line with sections 4 (1) (a), 5 (4) and 18 (4) in which the word &ldquo;date&rdquo; is used.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank the Senators for the way in which they approached and dealt with the Bill.  I am most grateful to all Senators who contributed to the improvement. I was not here when it was passing through the House originally.  My Parliamentary Secretary, who is now Minister for Defence, was present and, on his behalf, I should like to thank <Col N="190" /> the House for the way in which it was dealt with.  I hope the Bill will enable all interests involved, including local authorities, fishery interests, the Water Pollution Advisory Council and other bodies concerned, to make a significant contribution towards the objective of keeping our waters free of pollution.  I am very grateful to the Press for the way in which they have reported this Bill because I think it is of great importance.  I was rather disappointed to find that two national newspapers the <i>Irish Independent</i> on Saturday last and <i>The Irish Times</i> on Monday last chose to publish second leading articles which were written, obviously, by somebody who either did not read the Bill or, if they did, did not understand it.  This is doing a disservice to the excellent work done by both Houses and the many people who have recommended portions which have been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>I disagree on the grounds that there is no Independent representative on this Committee.  It has been the practice in a Committee consisting of both Houses of the Oireachtas such as this to have Independent representation. While I know this happens with the agreement of the parties it is a sad thing that this tradition should be broken in this case.  There are Independents sitting on important Committees of both Houses, such as the Committee dealing with European legislation, and they have made a contribution.  They are willing to make a contribution and have made it clear that in this case they wished to be represented.  As the person who acts as Chief Whip for the Independents I was asked some time ago by the Government Chief Whip, <Col N="191" /> and I have mentioned this in Seanad debates, to nominate an Independent to sit on this Committee.  As the person representing the Independents I take a dim view of the fact that, when four Members of the Seanad were selected for this Committee, there should be one from the Fianna Fáil group, one from the Labour group and two from the Fine Gael group in the Seanad. It would have been fairer if there had been three Members, one from each party, and one Independent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to register a strong protest on behalf of the Independents. We traditionally hear the complaint that people do not have time to serve on these committees.  The Independents have more time and have contributed in no small way to the proceedings of <Col N="192" /> the Seanad.  They would like to have the opportunity to contribute further to Joint Committees of both Houses such as this Committee.  I hope this is just a small break in the tradition of nominating an Independent to a Committee of both Houses and I wish to make this strong protest on behalf of the Independent Members.</P>

      <P>I want briefly to inform the House that this was the unanimous decision of the Committee of Selection.  In this case the Seanad were instructed that there were to be four nominees.  I understand the proportions represent the political entities in the Seanad.</P>
