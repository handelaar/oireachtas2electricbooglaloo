      <P>I have notice from Senator Mary Robinson that, on the motion for the adjournment of the House, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The failure of the Revenue Commissioners to amend the notices informing visitors and Irish residents of the categories of prohibited goods which may not be imported, in order to have such notices comply with the Supreme Court decision in the McGee Case in December, 1973.</P>
      <P>I am accepting that notice and the matter will be taken from 8 p.m. to 8.30 p.m. or earlier if the business ordered is concluded.</P>

      <P>On the question of the Adjournment, I think it might be a mistake to fix a definite hour because the business in the House will be Nos. 1 and 2.  We want to finish No. 1 and also No. 2, if possible.  In other words, I am suggesting that we might leave open our finishing.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 1 and 3 are related.  It is suggested we debate them together and have separate decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, line 13, before &ldquo;agreement&rdquo; where that word secondly occurs, to insert &ldquo;secret&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to make it clear to anybody reading the Act, if and when it becomes an Act, that the agreement around which the Act is built was a secret agreement and those discussing and debating the Bill were not aware, in fact, of what they were agreeing to.  I think this is necessary for a number of reasons.  It is only fair to those who oppose the Bill that it should be apparent that they opposed it because they did not know what they were being asked to agree to and, consequently, that their opposition to the Bill was not necessarily because of what is proposed to be done, which in general terms may be a good idea.  But they were opposed to it because, not knowing exactly what the agreement was and not being <Col N="371" /> willing to buy a pig in a poke, they could not find it possible to support the Bill because of the fact the agreement was not known to them.</P>
    <P>It is only fair to those who are supporting this Bill as well as to those who are opposing it that it should be made clear that it was a secret agreement. If this transaction does not prove to be a successful one and if it proves to be entirely unsuccessful, which I hope will not be the case, then again it is only fair to those who supported this Bill that they will be able to say that they made an act of faith and supported this Bill but, in fact, they did not really know what they were voting for.  They did not know what the agreement was, they did not know what the rights or the liabilities or limitations were in regard to the agreement.</P>
    <P>From every point of view, it would be much better if the agreement was made available to the Members of the House.  It should be made quite clear to anybody who has occasion to read the Act, if it becomes a matter of public debate and controversy in the future as to why this Bill was passed, that the Members of the House did not know what the agreement was or what they were agreeing to.  In a few years' time somebody consulting this Bill would naturally assume in the ordinary way that the agreement around which the Bill is built was laid before the House or was made available in some way.  They would naturally assume that that was the position.  To save the time of practitioners or anybody else who may want to consult this Bill in the future it is only fair to make it apparent in the Bill that this is a secret agreement which was not available to the Members of the Oireachtas, not available to anybody when it was being debated, and consequently they will probably be wasting their time, just as we are to a very considerable extent, in trying to find out what was agreed to when this Bill was passed.</P>
    <P>I have a second amendment down which is really saying the same thing in a different way and I would not mind which of the two is adopted by the Minister.  If he would adopt one <Col N="372" /> or the other it would serve the purpose I have outlined, which I believe is a very valid purpose and something which should be seriously considered and accepted by the Minister.  The Minister has at great length, in the other House and in his opening speech here, emphasised the importance of keeping this agreement secret.  He has emphasised the difficulties.  He has made very strong and lengthy arguments about why this must be kept secret.  While I do not agree with him about that, it seems to me that if he is convinced that it must be a secret agreement, then there is no reason why he should not stand over that and accept that it is a secret agreement and put that in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister cannot be ashamed of the fact that it is a secret agreement. In the future people looking it up may not be aware of that and may be surprised, but at present it has been discussed at considerable length in the other House and now here.  It is quite clear to everybody that it is a secret agreement.  It is clear to everybody that it has not been made available to the Houses.  In the circumstances I cannot imagine why this should not be put into the Bill.  If the Minister is not prepared to adopt amendment No. 2, in which I suggest that the agreement should be laid before each House&mdash; of course, that would be after the Bill has been passed but nevertheless it would be some help to know what we were talking about even afterwards&mdash; I can see no reason whatever why he should not say in the Bill that the agreement was secret or, alternatively, that the agreement was not made available to the Oireachtas, which is possibly a less extreme way of describing what I suggest should be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating) Justin Keating">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating)</NameTxt>
      <P>We are covering ground that we were over yesterday to some extent.  I am happy to have the opportunity of saying again what the considerations are.  I devoted time to it in my Second Reading speech and I appreciate the point of view that Senators who hold the opinions that Senator Eoin Ryan has just expressed. While I do not agree with them I understand them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="373" /> On closing yesterday I emphasised that the Bill will not in any way make the agreement referred to in section 1 law and that it is not correct to suggest that the Bill proposes to make the agreement the law of the land or that, indeed the Bill ratifies the agreement. It is necessary to be clear about that.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I did not make any argument in relation to this agreement as such.  I made the argument in general that one cannot pick out one at random.  One cannot be arbitrary.  This agreement belongs to a category of agreements which during the whole life of the State have been confidential. Their confidentiality has always been accepted and has been guarded with considerable care.  I can think of no instance where, for example, there was even a request to see agreements made by the IDA to purchase shares in many firms.  I will not name any of them but we all know firms in which the IDA have shares.  I rested my argument on the category of agreements between the State and the private sector.  I have indicated that I am not prepared to be arbitrary in regard to one firm nor am I prepared to disadvantage the State in its relationship to the private sector or to competing firms.  Those seem to me good reasons.</P>
    <P>Perhaps our debate will be useful in a long-term sense.  I cannot accept the amendment but I said in the other chamber that I recognised that, from the point of view of the public and presentationally, I was in what I described as a no-win situation, that I would do damage and would be acting arbitrarily towards one company were I to reveal this agreement. On the other hand, my not doing so has been, and of course will continue to be, portrayed as a desire for secrecy because I had something to hide in this instance.  No amount of repudiation of that second suggestion by me will stop it being said.  I recognise that. I recognise that if I do make it public and lay it before the Houses of the Oireachtas I will do damage.  I will not do it in what Senator Horgan called last night the framework of law and in an organised disciplined way. If I do not publish it I am at a disadvantage and if I do publish it I am at a disadvantage.  Therefore, I urged, <Col N="374" /> and I urge again and hope that it will commend itself to Senators, that we look to an expansion of the mechanism that we started to initiate in the Committee on the semi-State companies. What we started to do in that Oireachtas Committee is to reveal what is properly confidential but to members of that Committee.  I was determined to act in this instance and I have acted in a way that has not been very tidy.  I have taken some risks.  I believe they are justified and as Ministers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, the Minister is now arguing why it is not being disclosed.  These two amendments are merely asking the Minister to acknowledge that there is a secret agreement.  Amendment No. 2 is asking the Minister to disclose the agreement, which is really what the Minister is talking about now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought, in fact, Senator Eoin Ryan had made some references to amendment No. 2 and I thought we were taking all three together.  However, I will confine myself because we will be coming on to No. 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the word &ldquo;secret&rdquo; it has, of course, in the moving of the amendment an argumentative point of view, one might say a propagandist purpose.  It is a perfectly correct thing to do in an amendment but I think the Senator will see why I decline to accept it from its propagandist aspect. There is another aspect.  The word &ldquo;secret&rdquo;, especially in law and diplomacy, refers to something which is not known.  I have had to exercise my discretion about this agreement because I could not bring the Bill to either House without telling the Oireachtas a great deal of what I intended to do.  I did do so.  A lot of that agreement is known.  It has been a difficult exercise in discretion as to what should properly be known and what should not.  I have also had to resist having it pulled out of me piece by piece in the course of Committee <Col N="375" /> Stage.  The word &ldquo;secret&rdquo; does not apply to it.  It is a confidential agreement but, of course, it is known.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The other amendment is a less objectionable one if the Minister likes&mdash;&ldquo;not being made available&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to amendment No. 3, I think it has the same basic argumentative point.  It is bad law to put arguments into the text of a Bill.  Anyone at any future date&mdash; Senator Ryan made the point about people in the future&mdash;who, apart from reading debates which have gone on now for nearly two months, reads any Second Reading opening speech from myself, which perhaps after the Bill itself is the first place one would go, would see references to this.  It is redundant, it is unnecessary and it is argumentative.  While those things are pretty normal in debate they make bad law and I cannot accept that we should put them into the text of the Bill itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is, of course, entitled to his point of view about this being redundant.  Nevertheless, he must recognise the fact that many Members of both Houses regard it as of very considerable importance. It is not a Bill dealing with all kinds of things, where possibly at some point there is mention of an agreement or schedule which is not of basic importance and which is not actually incorporated in the Bill.  This is a Bill which, without the agreement, is meaningless. The whole kernel of the Bill is the agreement.  The only thing in the Bill is that the Minister is asking the House to vote £9 million for certain rights and we do not know what the rights are or what he will in fact require. The agreement is such an important ingredient, such an important element in this Bill that I think it should be disclosed to the House.  Some effort should have been made on the lines the Minister has mentioned but it is not of any great help to us in this particular Bill.  If it is not to be disclosed, it is such an important integral part of the Bill that it should at least be made quite clear that it has not been disclosed to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="376" /> I think there is some validity in what the Minister says about the word &ldquo;secret&rdquo;.  It certainly has connotations which are perhaps too dramatic, but I can see no objection to adding that the agreement has not been made available to the Oireachtas.  That is a neutral kind of phrase which does not say whether it should have been made available.  It is not argumentative in any way, it merely states the fact that the agreement which is the kernel of this Bill has not been made available. It could still be assumed that there were good reasons for not making it available.  What is important is to say that it has not been made available.</P>
    <P>It is important for everybody concerned in this Bill&mdash;those who vote against as well as those who vote for&mdash; that it be made clear that the agreement was not available to the House. Those on the Minister's side of the House are making an act of faith. Those on the other side of the House might have accepted this Bill, given it full support and accepted it with enthusiasm if they had known exactly what the terms were.  They are opposing it merely because they are not able to give it support and authorise the Minister to spend that amount of money without knowing what exactly what is in the agreement.</P>
    <P>Whatever the arguments may be about whether this should, in fact, have been kept from the House, I cannot understand the reluctance of the Minister to state this fact, which is of very considerable significance and importance in explaining the way in which people discussed this Bill and voted for and against it.  It may not be a very important point but it would be of great assistance in the future to people who have to refer to this Act and who would normally take it for granted that the agreement was somewhere or other and that it was available.  It should be made clear to them that, in fact, it was not available.</P>
    <P>I can see the Minister's point of view, and at least I can see that he has a point of view and one which can be argued, that the agreement should not be disclosed.  I cannot understand the point of view that the Bill must <Col N="377" /> not mention the fact that the agreement was not made available, as though this is something which the Minister does not want to get around, or something that he is not very happy about.  The agreement was not made available to the House.  That is crystal clear; it has been discussed for several months; it is a fact.  I am sure that as far as the Minister is concerned he does not regard that as <Col N="378" /> being anything that he is ashamed of or may have to apologise for.  From his point of view there is absolutely no reason why he should not put into the Bill the simple statement of fact that the agreement which is the kernel of the Bill was not available to the House of the Oireachtas when the Bill was being discussed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 2, line 16, to add &ldquo;A copy of which Agreement shall forthwith be laid on the Table of each House of the Oireachtas&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is not of any great use in present circumstances because a copy of the agreement would only be laid before the Table of the Houses when the Bill had been passed.  That would really be too late to enable us to evaluate whether the agreement was a good one, what merits it had, and we would then be in a position to know whether we should support this Bill.  However, it would suffer from the disadvantage that we would only know afterwards whether we were right or wrong in supporting or opposing this Bill. Nevertheless, it would be of some assistance even at that stage to know what was in this agreement.  The whole question of whether the agreement should have been made public properly arises under this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has said that there are precedents for not making these things public.  He has mentioned a number of precedents, none of which, in my view, is exactly in point.  He refers, in particular, to the sums which are made available by the Industrial Development Authority.  The position there is that the Houses of the Oireachtas did agree, and have agreed over many years, to make sums available so as to stimulate and encourage the setting up of new industries.  It was undoubtedly a calculated risk.  It is quite true to say that the Houses of the Oireachtas are not shown individual agreements.  But it is a calculated risk that has stood the test of time.  It can be looked at regularly when new sums are asked for.  The proportion of success and the proportion of failures in regard to industries which have been helped by the Industrial Development Authority have been made available and the Houses of the Oireachtas can constantly decide whether, on balance, it is proper that the IDA should get further <Col N="379" /> money and should be able to make agreements which are not subject to scrutiny by the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>This is not the same kind of situation. The individual sums given to industries are not, with very few exceptions, anything like as big as the amount here.  It is given as a grant. There is no situation whereby the Minister is going to be a shareholder. This is coming in in a few cases now but originally and for a long time this was not a major element in it.  It is not the situation where the Minister in one particular case is going to invest that amount of money in a company where he is going to be holding 49 per cent of the shares and where the whole area, the whole matter which must be considered, is of paramount importance.  Why is this amount of money being invested in this particular mine?  What are the rights of the Minister, the State, in this situation, going to be in the future?</P>
    <P>To say that this is the same situation as giving a grant to a factory, to a firm to build a factory or instal machinery or something like this is stretching the point very far indeed. The Minister has been called upon, asked again and again, to say where there was a precedent and, in my view, he has not satisfactorily produced a precedent which is, in point, valid which could be relied upon for justifying what he is doing on this occasion.</P>
    <P>But even if he did have a perfect precedent that does not necessarily mean that it is the right thing to do. It is one of the things that is relied upon so very often when Bills are brought in, that if there is a precedent for it then it must be right, if there is a precedent then doing what is done in a particular Bill needs no further justification.  That, in itself, is a very serious line to take and a very wrong one.</P>
    <P>It is particularly so in present circumstances.  I think I said yesterday that the trend is very much in the opposite direction.  The trend is <Col N="380" /> that in relation to companies more and more information should be given to the public, shareholders and everybody concerned in one way or another.  In regard to this Bill literally everybody is concerned. Every citizen is in fact going to become a shareholder of this company through the Minister.  Even if there was a precedent, and I do not accept that there is, it would not justify doing what is being done in this Bill. It would not justify moving against the tide of public opinion and opinion generally about disclosure of information. I think the Minister would be doing something far more desirable and he would get far more credit for being ahead of public opinion in this respect and insisting that virtually all, if possible, of the agreement be made available.</P>
    <P>The issue of giving information about this agreement, disclosing what is in the agreement, is of vital importance and if this Bill is going to be passed in its present form and if it is going to become a precedent&mdash; I do not believe there is a precedent for it&mdash;I have no doubt whatsoever that an attempt will be made in the future to make it a precedent for doing the same thing again and again and giving less and less information to the citizens and to those who are concerned.  It is an unfortunate precedent to create.  It is particularly unfortunate in view of current thinking about this question of disclosure.</P>
    <P>As I have said, this amendment would not really solve the problem because the agreement would only be disclosed afterwards.  Nevertheless, even at that stage we would be aware of what we had voted for or against. We would know what was expected by the Minister when he proposes that this sum should be paid and we would have some opportunity of knowing as time went on whether the development of this mine, the rights and so on which are given to the Minister in this agreement, were matching up to his expectations in regard to this agreement and this Bill.</P>
    <P>In proposing this amendment I am far from satisfied that it meets the <Col N="381" /> real problem which this House has to face in debating this Bill but it would be of some assistance, even if it was only, in the future, to be able to study developments and to know whether the Bill was a good one which really means whether the agreement was a good one because the agreement is, of course, the whole kernel of the Bill.</P>

      <P>The first thing that occurs to me to say is that even when I am disagreeing&mdash;as I am in this instance&mdash;with Senator Eoin Ryan I appreciate the balance and the fairness with which he puts his arguments. I was stopped on the previous amendment because I was getting on to this one.  I was describing what I call the no-win situation.  I had indicated yesterday that the series of events whereby a great national asset was locked into litigation was not of my making.  I inherited it and it was necessary to act.  I never pretended that this was tidy or that this was a perfect solution.  It is not.  I had, in talking about this no-win situation, indicated that if I were to disclose this agreement uniquely I would be acting incorrectly.  If I was not to do so I laid myself open to the sort of charges that have been made and will be made. I had said that I hoped we would have a mechanism because the circumstances that I found myself in as a result of some bad law in the past, in a series of accidents and a series of court decisions, is nonetheless a circumstance that is going to arise in future and we are going to have time to consider it if we want to use that time.  We are, with the great companies, going to have to make confidential agreements.  They will really be confidential and the revealing of them would really damage the State's interest and our partners' interests because mining, like oil and gas, is a very tough and ruthless international business and the stakes are very high. That is a true description of it.  We have to have confidentiality and yet we have to have the possibility of scrutiny which crosses party boundaries, which is genuinely neutral and fair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me say in parenthesis that when <Col N="382" /> people say, as Senator Ryan said today and Senator Horgan said yesterday, that I believe as passionately as they believe about openness in Government, I recognise the tendency towards openness that Senator Ryan talks about.  I welcome it.  I will help it to the extent that I have departmental responsibility for it.  I have done things in Government in regard to openness that I never experienced in Opposition.  As my party's spokesman in Industry and Commerce I was never invited to the Department in my Opposition time for a briefing. I have had the Opposition spokesman in, not to talk to me, to politicise it, but I have my staff available to him so that he would be better briefed on matters that were coming up.  I believe in those things and I believe that what we have to do is to extend what we started doing about our Oireachtas Committee on semi-State bodies which is that even where there would not be a semi-State situation but the relationship of an agreement between the State and the private sector, the possibility of scrutiny exists simultaneously with the possibility of confidentiality which is commercially essential.  We need both of those factors.</P>
    <P>Senator Horgan used a phrase yesterday which struck me and which I noted.  He said that it should be across the board, it should be orderly disclosure, it should be democratic, it should be done fairly.  I believe in that but what I cannot believe in is the application of exceptional requirements of disclosure and exceptional treatment to a single company because no one who would read the whole of this debate fairly can believe for a moment that the principles of Bula had been treated properly or decently by the Opposition.  They have been pilloried in all sorts of ways.  In fairness, the treatment by the Opposition of this Bill in the other House would have indicated the desire for secrecy which is expressed by many civil servants on the basis of just making their work easy.  It would have thrust them back into extra confidentiality rather than giving them the courage to come out into the open and reveal more.</P>
    <P>I will not treat one&mdash;I called it a <Col N="383" /> David company&mdash;small disadvantaged Irish company which has enormous and powerful adversaries uniquely or disadvantageously <i>vis-á-vis</i> the others. Senator Ryan to some extent made my IDA case.  Grants are one matter. I did not base the case on grants.  I based it on the taking of equity by the IDA.  That is not unique or recent. It is in the 1969 Act and it was operated before I came to office and with large sums of money in certain instances.  It is not unique and we have many agreements every year, not of grants but of share participation, shareholding, minority shareholding in public and private companies for which we are never asked for agreement.  I will not treat one which is in this David situation uniquely from the others and I do not think I should be asked to do so. When that is affirmed I believe we would be doing a very useful job if we could at least reach a consensus but we have to have a mechanism whereby we can combine revelation to responsible people of the full details with commercial confidentiality.  I think that is essential and I would welcome it.  Were this agreement to be scrutinised by such a mechanism I would be absolutely confident in my vindication.  I am not prepared to seek that vindication on the basis of revelation if it requires my treating one company exceptionally and the breaking of long-establised traditions in a disorderly and disorganised way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the Minister hopes and intends to try to rectify a situation which is extremely unsatisfactory.  We are talking about a Bill here, a relatively short Bill, but we are talking also about a very large sum of money and we are talking about a deal.  In fact, as far as the Minister is concerned, he knows exactly what is involved.  I presume he is confident that he is right.  As far as we are concerned in this House what the Minister is bringing before us is a proposition: &ldquo;I have a bright idea, I think it would be a good thing for the State, please give me £9 million.&rdquo;  That is the beginning and the end of it as far as we are concerned. <Col N="384" /> That is what it amounts to.  I think that in the circumstances it can be understood that we are extremely unhappy to be put in a situation where that is in fact the proposition that is put before us.  Mining is a highly speculative form of activity. There are all kinds of things that can go wrong with it.  There are all kinds of factors involved which may evolve either in the wrong way or in the right way.  We know that the Minister is proposing something which is speculative by its very nature.  We are given the minimum of information and it ends up that the Minister is saying &ldquo;I have a mining proposal.  I cannot tell you anything about it but I think it is a great idea and would you let me have a cheque?&rdquo; Perhaps it is a great idea.  I sincerely hope it is a great idea and some of the figures which have been mentioned suggest that it will in fact prove to be a great idea.  It is, as far as we are concerned, doing what none of us would do in our private capacity if it were suggested by a stockbroker or somebody like that, that we would invest £100 or £1,000 in a mine but told that we could not be given any information about it but that it was a good tip.  Some people are entitled to do that kind of thing in their private capacity but we are here in an entirely different capacity.  We are representing the taxpayer.  It is our duty and responsibility to ensure as far as possible State money is spent in a wise and responsible way but we are being asked to approve money without having the faintest idea of how it is to be spent or whether it is justified.  It is an entirely unsatisfactory situation.  The Minister has given his point of view.  He has explained why he cannot and will not give any information about this agreement and he is justified in giving his point of view and explaining why he thinks he cannot do it.  I think we are equally justified in saying that it is an intolerable position for us to be in when we know nothing about the agreement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 2, line 22, to delete &ldquo;£9,540,000&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;£1,937,500&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This arises as a result of the same problem&mdash;the problem of knowing whether the amount in the Bill, £9,540,000, is the right sum, whether it is too much and what sum would be right.  Because of lack of information about the agreement and about the project generally we are not in a position to say whether the sum is right.  It could be £100 million, it could be £50 million, it could be any sum. The sum is absolutely meaningless.  I have substituted a sum which is based on the only information or report of any consequence that is made available, that is, the report of Lazard Brothers.  They came to the conclusion that the total value of the mine was £9 million odd, or £7 million when certain deductions were made.  I have suggested a figure of a quarter of that which would on their basis seem to represent 25 per cent of the value of the mine.</P>
      <P>I put it forward not indeed with any assurance, not with any conviction that that is in fact the right sum because I am totally unable to say with any conviction what the right sum is because of lack of information but I put it forward because as far as we are concerned it is the only figure that makes any sense.  Lazard Brothers, in putting forward that figure, were very cautious and very hesitant because they made the point several times in their report that they had not been given the information they would like to have, that they had not had time to make inquiries, that they had not the time to get the expert opinions on which they would finally put a firm figure.  Therefore, it is not a very reliable figure.  It is not one that I could go out on a limb for and say that that should be the figure and that the Minister's figure is wrong. It merely represents some relevance in a situation where information is so dreadfully scarce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important in the sense that if <Col N="386" /> I am asked why I suggest that figure at least I am able to refer to a report from a reputable firm that says the value of the mine is about £7 million and this is a quarter of it.  I am putting this forward merely to illustrate the desperate situation that exists in regard to information and the fact that we have to grasp at any straw, and the straw that is available to us is the Lazard report.  Based on that, the figure should be £1,937,500 rather than the £9.54 million.</P>
    <P>Lazard Brothers are very hesitant in what they say but they point out a number of important factors which nobody can deny.  Some of them are merely matters of common sense, for example, the cost of diverting the river, the question of whether planning would be just as simple as was envisaged and various other more technical problems, like the price of ore in the future and the cost of extracting it, which they did not have time to go into more deeply.  Even if they had gone more deeply into these matters I probably would not be able to understand.  But in the land of the blind the one-eyed man is a god.  In this situation where we have so little information, even a report which apologises for the fact that it really cannot mention any hard figure, in spite of its reservations and in spite of the fact that those who drew up the report were not given the information they wanted, it is the only thing we have.  On that basis £1.9 million seems to be a more appropriate figure than £9.5 million.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I shall start at the end with the observation of Senator Ryan that the Lazard report, which I said yesterday was stolen and posted under plain wrapper to the newspapers, was the only information available.  It would be very hard to find a commercial transaction in Ireland where there was more information available.  Since 1971, immense amounts of information have been published.  Most crucial of all is the scale, the grading and the configuration of the orebody because that is the asset that guarantees things.  We know how big it is and the grid of <Col N="387" /> boreholes in the sort of detail that is almost never available about a commercial undertaking.  To suggest that, on the basis of estimates, the Lazard one is the only one available is not correct either.  It was the one that received a great deal of publicity. Very substantial excerpts were published&mdash;I think I am right in saying they were published simultaneously&mdash; from other reports which were prepared for other people.  The various reports that have been referred to which contain estimates of the value of the orebody were prepared for the two sides in the arbitration.  They were submitted to the arbitration board and they were debated before it.</P>
      <P>I gave some information yesterday but I will reiterate it.  On the Bula side going to the arbitration board, stretching from May to October, estimates were produced by Bechtel which, in size and in status and acknowledged expertise, is one of the great companies in the world in this area.  The Bechtel Report on Bula went to the arbitrators on 5th May.  They had a number of other valuations and then they brought in a Mr. Alan Sykes, a consultant of great standing and expertise.  Later on, in October, they brought in Professor Carlsberg, again an extremely distinguished person.  There is nothing new in what I am telling the Seanad as it was all published.</P>
      <P>I shall give the House some of the valuations I spoke about yesterday, Bechtel, Sykes and Carlsberg, because you can have a grid of valuations depending on selected discount rates, and other selected areas.  The Bechtel estimate of May 5th was £94.36 million.  The Sykes estimates ranged from £61.57 million to £63.1 million; Carlsberg from £82.58 million to £104.8 million.  On our side I emphasise that there is no new information. It is all in the Dáil records, in the newspapers or in both.  We had the Royal School of Mines, Mergers Limited, the Geological Survey, Economic Consultants Limited and Lazards. We had a range of valuations too and they are all known.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is <Col N="388" /> talking about technical reports rather than the valuations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Some of these contained technical reports but they did contain valuations.  There are sums of money of exactly the same sort of standing as the Lazard sum of £7.75 million attached to the things I have given, Bechtel, Sykes and Carlsberg and the others.  So, we have a range of valuations, not a single one, and they are not new and they are not concealed.  About the sizing and grading of the orebody there is an enormous amount of information.  It is very seldom that an investment is secured by a known and proven asset of this kind but in this instance it is. Then the matter was argued before the arbitrators.  I said yesterday that I do not claim to know but this amendment purports, and Senator Ryan did not push it very hard, to have a valuation down to the last £500&mdash;£1,937,500.  That is for experts, but the arbitrators were experts.  That was their profession: they had a very high standing, at the peak of world reputation as arbitrators bringing a range of technological expertise, engineering, law, accountancy, and planning experience to bear on it. They went there and had a look.  They argued the planning aspect at length. They argued the diversion of the Blackwater.  They argued the technology of the mine at length and they came up with a figure.</P>
      <P>I do not think it is prudent for any of us to try to be wiser than they are. I do not think it is surprising if I retained a number of consultants; I am not suggesting that any of these consultants were other than the best. I know the other side got the best and we tried to get the best and I think we got the best.  Each side had very good people but it is interesting that all ours were below what the arbitrators decided on and all theirs were above.  Nobody behaved improperly, but people made a valuation for the purpose of an arbitration, depending on which side they were on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I made the comparison elsewhere of a court of law.  You have two lots of barristers of high standing, not cheating and not distorting the law, and yet <Col N="389" /> presenting the same events, with the same access to knowledge about those events available to each side, very differently, behaving quite correctly. Is it not our experience that that is what happens in a court of law?  Is it surprising that it happens in an arbitration?  Is it not the job of arbitrators in commercial life, as of judges in life in general, to resolve things so that things can continue and go ahead?</P>
    <P>We had to have an arbitration because we had already been locked at great length into delays and litigations we were promised for all of it. It was very difficult to get agreement. We did not think it was possible that we would find agreement at all by negotiation.  We had a mechanism that would resolve the difficulty which was normal and correct economic procedure. I do not think that it behoves any of us to try to be wiser than the arbitrators.  Neither do I think it right for the Opposition to pick out £7.75 million from Lazards and divide that by four or to take 24 per cent of it, to be more precise still.  It is no more correct for them to do that than for me to pick, for example, Carlsberg's lowest at £82.58 million and divide that and take 24 per cent of that.  One is as good as the other, surely, and what the arbitrators did was to come down in the middle and I accept it. We cannot have an arbitration if we do not accept what comes out of it. The purpose of an arbitration is to get a neutral, middle point and to get on with things.  The valuation was properly carried out.  Valuations are made routinely in economic and business life when there are many variables. In fact, an arbitration is precisely concerned with circumstances where you cannot quantify exactly. When one is dealing with things five years, ten years or 15 years ahead be it mining, the price of zinc, selling toys, refining petrol or whatever it may be, nobody will give you precision in regard to the future as it would be impossible.  Yet arbitrations must take place, and the more expert the people the better they can balance the different variables.  There is no guarantee that they get it right, but they have a better chance than most people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="390" /> This was a proper arbitration, properly carried out.  It enabled us to get on with things.  To suggest that we should ignore the middle position that they took and pick out at random one of the estimates which was prepared for our side is unreasonable.  I would not claim that I should have paid or sought to pay a quarter of Carlsberg, a quarter of Bechtel, a quarter of Sykes and, therefore, I do not consider it fair of the Opposition to say that we will pay a quarter of Lazards.  Lazards' report got a spurious special publicity and was given a special position in all of this because it was stolen and circulated.  It is not fair either that, once the Opposition is clear in that, they should go on perpetuating this spurious position.  I think therefore we must reject the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 2, line 22, after &ldquo;£9,540,000&rdquo; to add &ldquo;and the said shares so acquired shall rank <i>pari passu</i> with all other shares of the company for all purposes&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is put in to ensure that the shares which the Minister is acquiring shall in fact have equal rights with those of the other shareholders. It may be unnecessary, but there are some good reasons for suspecting that the shares the Minister will acquire will be in some way different from the other shares in the company.  In ordinary circumstances if he merely acquires ordinary shares then he would have the same rights as anybody else.  But there is an agreement there which may vary that.  We do not know the contents of it, but in the absence of that knowledge I think it is important that we should be sure that what the Minister is getting are shares exactly the same as the shares which will be held by other shareholders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has at best a minority holding, a situation which is far from a happy or a desirable one, but at least we would like to be sure that his <Col N="391" /> situation is no worse than the situation of a person who has 49 per cent of the shares.  If the Minister were able to tell me that I am unwise in pressing this amendment because in fact the shares are in some way more advantageous than the ordinary shares, then I would certainly be very happy to withdraw it.  I would like to be sure and, not knowing what is in the agreement, I do not know what the position is.  I would like to be satisfied that the shares are the same as the other shares, that they are not deficient in the rights which the other shareholders will have, or that the Minister will not suffer in his position as a shareholder any more than a person in a minority position holding 49 per cent of the shares.</P>
    <P>I think it is a reasonable suggestion and one which will reassure those who are worried about the fact that there is an agreement there which could affect this situation.  Not being able to see the agreement is disturbing for many reasons, but if we could eliminate one possible source of worry, one area of uncertainty, it would be some assistance; it would be reassuring and it would be helpful against the context of the Bill generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to do two things.  First, I wish to refer to the appropriate section of my Second Reading speech yesterday about this matter.  I pointed out yesterday that the agreement was a freely negotiated one and it therefore has provisions which are designed to protect the legitimate interests of both parties.  I then said that I am quite satisfied that it is a satisfactory agreement from the point of view of the State.  It protects the fundamental interests of the State in a reasonable manner and in so far as special rights are concerned the balance is substantially in favour of the State.  That was my Second Reading speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment that is proposed relates to a section which authorises the acquisition of shares in Bula Limited.  The effect of the amendment would be to provide by law for the rights which are attached to the shares to be acquired.  I pointed out on a <Col N="392" /> number of occasions that we are not in fact making the agreement the law of the land.  We are not legislating the agreement.  It is not appropriate that the rights of the Minister should be regulated in the manner proposed, because my rights as a shareholder have been safeguarded adequately in the agreement.  It would therefore not be appropriate for me to put into law the rights I have as a shareholder. As I said, we are not making the agreement part of the law.  It is understandable and by no means execptional that people who control the operation of a company should desire to ensure that the admission of a substantial minority should not result in their being deprived of the company's control.  Operational control is not in this case an objective of participation by the State.</P>
    <P>Subject to safeguards which I am satisfied are reasonable and adequate it is proper that such control should continue to be exercised by the existing private interests.  I have said already, and I have quoted the passage from the Second Reading speech yesterday, that on the other hand the State has secured a considerable number of preferential rights, some of which are designed to ensure that the State's interest cannot be prejudiced in a fundamental way.  Some of them have the objective of securing rights and powers of a kind which would be appropriate to a lease in respect of minerals the State owned.  I am satisfied that the State's overall interests have been safeguarded.  In so far as special rights are concerned, the balance lies in favour of the State. So I am unable to accept an amendment which purports to make provision by law in regard to rights which have been acquired under the agreement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is putting words into my mouth when he suggests that I said this Bill was making the agreement the law of the land or something of that kind.  I am not saying that.  It is pushing it too far when the Minister says that the Bill cannot interfere with the ordinary company law and with the ordinary articles of association and so on of the <Col N="393" /> company concerned.  It might be inappropriate for this Bill to interfere with the rights of shareholders, the articles of association or anything else in regard to this company.  What this Bill can do is say that the Minister may not expend the sum of £9,540,000 unless he is getting a deal which ensures that the shares which he gets will rank <i>pari passu</i> with those of the other shareholders.  That is merely saying that this should be part of the bargain.  It is not making the agreement the law of the land; it is not attempting in this Bill to interfere with the normal working of the Companies Act or with the articles of association of that company.  It is merely saying that unless the agreement gives the Minister shares which rank <i>pari passu</i> then this House is not willing to give him the money he requires.  It is merely a condition which would attach to the deal.  It seems to me to be a very reasonable condition.</P>
      <P>Of course it may be that there are other things in this agreement which are so attractive from the Minister's point of view that he came to the conclusion that it was worth taking shares that did not rank <i>pari passu.</i> That may be so; we do not know.  As an important element in the proposal which the Minister is making to the House it does not seem to be unreasonable to suggest that the shares which he gets are not going to be shares with less than ordinary rights, shares that are in some way deficient or are not as good as the shares held by the other people holding shares.  What is being obtained by the Minister for this large sum of money is shares.  We cannot go into all the details of the agreement; we cannot go into any details of the agreement.  What we are talking about is buying shares and it is not unreasonable to say; let us make sure that these are 100 per cent shares with full rights, shares that are just as good as the shares which will be held by the other shareholders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, far from reassuring me, rather does the opposite because he will not give us&mdash;perhaps I am anticipating this&mdash;his reaction.  I gather he will not accept the amendment and he <Col N="394" /> will not give the assurance that the shares rank <i>pari passu.</i>  He will say that the balance of interest is very much in favour of the State.  I think we are entitiled to take from that in fact the shares are not going to rate <i>pari passu</i>, that the shares are not going to be as good as the shares held by the other shareholders, that these in some way will rank as inferior because of the powers which they carry or the rights to dividends or rights of some kind that they carry.  The Minister is not saying: I can give you an assurance that these shares rank <i>pari passu.</i>  I am only saying that on the balance of interest the State is doing well.  We must assume that the shares are not going to rank <i>pari passu</i> but the Minister is nonetheless going to accept them because there is some other inducement in the agreement which makes it worth his while to accept shares which are less than good, having less rights than the other shares held by the other shareholders.</P>
    <P>We are back in the same position once again where the Members of this House on the opposite side will have to make an act of faith and where the Members on this side are going to be even more worried than they were because we now know, or at least we have strong reasons for believing, that the shares being bought in this company are not ranking <i>pari passu</i> with the shares held by other shareholders. That adds to our concern about what is being done.  The Minister says: &ldquo;I assure you that from the State's point of view there is a balance of interest in favour of the State.&rdquo; So, we make an act of faith or we do not.  Once again we have to take the Minister's word that it is a good deal.  The only tangible thing that we can really put our finger on in this deal is the shares.  For the £9 million we are paying, are we getting the normal shares with normal rights, equal rights?  It appears we are not.  I am more concerned than ever about the way in which this deal has been done.  I hope that the Minister's confidence in the advantageous nature of this agreement is well-formed.  If the other attractions which apparently induced him to take shares which apparently are not <i>pari passu</i> prove to <Col N="395" /> be illusory for one season or another, then it will certainly be most unfortunate that the shares are not as good as they might otherwise be.</P>
    <P>I accept it is possible that the Minister was right and has very good reasons for accepting shares of this kind.  It should have been possible for <Col N="396" /> him without giving away too much information to give us some idea or explanation or reassurance in some way by saying why he considered in the circumstances there were other factors which make it worth while and showed that the balance of interest was in favour of the State.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister in relation to subsection (1) why it is necessary that the Minister should specifically be given power to exercise all the rights and powers of a holder of such shares.  It seems that if he is the holder of the shares he should normally have the power of rights of a shareholder.  I am wondering why it should be necessary to say that specifically in the section.</P>

      <P>I am informed&mdash;this may not be a very satisfactory answer&mdash; that it is something that the draftsman has inserted as a convention in Bills of this type, this empowering to do something which, in fact, he is empowered to do already.  It is simply written into Bills and it is traditional to do it.  There is nothing from the norm in this.  I appreciate that that is not a very satisfactory answer but that apparently is the reason it is there.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 14, after &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and with the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (3) states that the Minister for Finance may, after consultation with the Minister, sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any shares of the company held by him under this Act. I am suggesting the words &ldquo;with approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas&rdquo; be inserted so that it would read: &ldquo;The Minister for Finance may, after consultation with the Minister, and with the approval of both Houses of the Oireactas, sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any shares of the company held by him under this <Col N="397" /> Act.&rdquo;  This is a reasonable amendment. We are dealing with a very big proposition which, it would generally be agreed, even by the Minister and those supporting it, is of a speculative nature, but we are getting the minimum information about it.</P>
    <P>The Minister is putting it to the House because he believes it is a good idea, a good deal and it is in the interest of the State to do it.  I hope his confidence will prove well-founded. However, if for some reason, this does not develop as well as the Minister hopes, if changes take place, if the speculative nature of the proposal proves to be even more speculative than is envisaged and it is necessary to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of the shares, it is an occasion upon which the Minister at the time should inform the Houses of the Oireachtas. He should tell the Houses &ldquo;This is what we spent money on; this is what we hoped would be the result but it has gone wrong and we are proposing now to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of the shares and we think it only fair to tell the House what has happened, how the position has developed, what we propose to do and why we propose to do it.&rdquo;  This is necessary and fair as far as those who support the Bill are concerned.  They are making an act of faith.  They are hoping this will work out well, that the £9 million will be spent on something which will give a return to the State and will prove of benefit to the State in general and all those concerned in the operation.  The least that should be done is that, if the situation does not develop satisfactorily and some kind of a compromise has to take place, if shares have to be sold for less than was paid for them or are to be transferred so as to try to prop up the situation by letting in some other company or something of that kind, the Houses of the Oireachtas be informed of what has happened.  We should be told how the position has developed, what is now proposed, why it is proposed and exactly what the new arrangement will be from the financial point of view.</P>
    <P>Maybe I am too pessimistic in my approach to this.  Things may go so <Col N="398" /> well that there would be an advantage in selling, transferring or otherwise disposing of the shares.  In that case also the Minister for Finance, or the Minister involved, as the case may be, should consider it right and proper to tell the Houses of the Oireachtas what has happened and what he proposes to do.  This is a big investment by any test and the mining operation involved is a big one.  It will be of considerable significance in the economy of the State.  We are all vitally concerned in it.  We are all involved in it because we are involved in this Bill and are entitled to know when any changes take place and what the changes are.</P>
    <P>It is too simple to say that the Minister for Finance may, after consultation with the Minister, sell all the shares.  Sell them for what?  I am not casting any reflection on the Minister because he may not be in office at the time.  It may be another Minister.  We do not know who may be involved at that time, who may be the holder of the shares.  It would be too easy if this proposal, starting with great hopes and expectations, proved in fact, to be a disaster and that the State wanted to bury this disaster quietly and to sell the shares, transfer or otherwise dispose of them with the minimum of publicity and information.</P>
    <P>This gets back to the inherently unsatisfactory nature of the Bill.  The Minister has argued that he has good reasons for not giving us information about the agreement, but must this necessarily continue into the future? Are we to be told nothing now and be left in that position when passing this Bill even if the project is a disaster&mdash;&ldquo;disaster&rdquo; may be too dramatic a word&mdash;or proves a great disappointment&mdash;one of the views put forward by Lazards was that there is a trend for costs of mining to increase faster than the value of the mineral that is taken out of the ground&mdash;or, from the State's point of view, it is hardly worth while continuing to be associated with it?  The Minister of the time may feel that he does not want the State to continue, that things may get even worse.  He does not want to admit that the State made a mistake, made a bad investment, and the whole thing <Col N="399" /> can be quietly disposed of without any information being made available.</P>
    <P>The least that should be expected is that if a situation ever develops when the shares have to be disposed of the Minister should have to come before the House and say: &ldquo;In spite of my high expectations&rdquo; or &ldquo;in spite of the high expectations of my predecessor, this has gone wrong; we will have to sell the shares, and what we are selling them for is, in all the circumstances, a reasonable price and we think it is the proper thing to do.  We are sorry it worked out like this but in present circumstances this is what we think we should do.&rdquo;  It is not too much to expect that.  It would take some of the sour taste away if we were told by the Minister: &ldquo;In spite of the fact that we cannot give very much information at present; in spite of the fact that I am convinced we are doing the right thing, nevertheless, if the thing goes wrong, the House will be told what happened, what the new arrangement is, and will be given&mdash;at that stage at least&mdash;some information and an opportunity of expressing a view about the second phase of this operation.&rdquo;  That is peculiarly appropriate in such a situation because we are now being told to accept this as an act of faith.  The Minister, and his advisers, and the Government, say: &ldquo;We are convinced this is the right thing to do; take our word for it.&rdquo;  If the Houses of the Oireachtas are convinced and persuaded to stay out of this at this stage and make an act of faith and if the Minister and his advisers are proved to be wrong&mdash;I hope they will not be&mdash; and there is a bit of mess, surely at that stage the House should be given an opportunity to express an informed view about what should happen next.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I find in this amendment the same sort of what I would call exceptionalism in regard to Bula that has animated a great deal of the debate, certainly from the Opposition side.  If this were to be accepted it would be an example of the Oireachtas trying with its structures, which are evolved for debate, to do the executive business of the Executive.  We have a practice that has gone on through the <Col N="400" /> life of the State from administration to administration, without change when there was a change of Government, not to make the disposal of shares by the Minister for Finance subject to the approval of the Dáil.  Indeed, it is not peculiar to shares.  It is a long continuing general rule that when property of any kind&mdash;it is well to remember that the State possesses and disposes of many kinds of categories of property &mdash;has been acquired by the expenditure of funds voted by the Oireachtas the management, and, ultimately, the disposal of that property becomes a function of the Executive.  We have had that traditional division.  It is not peculiar to our Oireachtas; it is very fundamental and as old as Parliament, the division between the legislature and the Executive.</P>
      <P>Of course there is accountability. That, again, if not as old as Parliament in its Viking or <i>Magna Carta</i> sort of origins, certainly has been there for many hundreds of years of our tradition of Parliament which comes down through Britain.  Of course there are mechanisms for accountability.  Indeed, in regard to matters like Private Members' Business the Standing Orders of the Dáil&mdash;I am not so familiar with those of the Seanad&mdash;permit greater freedom of debate, greater freedom to raise matters at short notice, greater freedom to have a detailed discussion of them, than existed when I was in Opposition.  The protective mechanisms which are proper and necessary are there, long evolved and in existence. The accountability, the duty of accountability, the possibility of debate on the activities of Ministers, the regulation on the expenditures of moneys voted and so on, all exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What worries me, firstly, is the exceptionalism and, secondly, the teasing out of the ramifications and results of that exceptionalism in regard to Bula.  It is not a frivolous debating point that I have been making when arguing that our natural resources policy are all of a piece.  We are going out onto the Continental Shelf fast.  We are going to have a lot of drilling this year.  We have agreements with all the great oil companies of the world.  The quantity of money here <Col N="401" /> is nothing to the potential quantities of money in those agreements, it is much larger.  We cannot be disadvantaged in our commercial practice.</P>
    <P>I wanted to get this Bill into the House on the last Wednesday of January but I did not.  I had to wait until the following Tuesday.  It was circulated about 20th January.  It has been on the go for two months now and it is not out of the Seanad yet.  It then must go to the President.  What happens if there is a commercial buyer who finds the whole thing trailed through the public, through the newspapers, subject to the sort of scrutiny, indeed, that Bula has been subjected to in the Dáil?  By the time one would come to close a deal on that sort of basis the man would be long gone. Those in the Oireachtas know that one cannot conduct these sort of transactions on the basis of protracted and non-quantifiable delays.  At one stage, Deputy O'Malley told me he would keep me in the Dáil for three months. If he had wanted to, technically, and if he had the stamina to do so, he could have done so.  The time is non-quantifiable. The borrowings of Bula in this instance were recorded in the Companies Office and found themselves in the newspapers as revelations. The fact that a stud farm sold yearlings found itself in the newspapers as a revelation.</P>
    <P>Either we do not have an exception for Bula and we do this for all the commercial transactions, which is impossible, or else we have an exception for Bula which is unjustifiable. We are caught in that fork.  If this was applied to everyone it would be patently impossible and non-workable.</P>
    <P>I would not have anything to do with trying to develop the Continental Shelf in competition with the multinational groups if every time I wanted to buy or sell I would have to come into the Oireachtas. I could not work like that.  I am not going to treat one company differently from another.  It seems to me we are caught in that.  I have never pretended that we are in a situation that is neat or, in the long-term, satisfactory.  I hope we will have much more coherent legislation like <Col N="402" /> the IDA Bill.  Indeed, if it is an IDA Bill no agreements are brought forward. They are not mentioned.  The whole category of agreements is catered for in the one piece of legislation. They never come before the Oireachtas.  If we have more comprehensive legislation this sort of thing will not arise.  I do not pretend that it is neat, but with regret, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>We should have at least a week to consider the remaining Stages of this Bill.  An attempt has been made to rush this Bill through the House with what I can only describe as indecent haste.  Yesterday we discussed the question of when the Committee Stage should be taken.  I reluctantly agreed to have the Committee Stage taken today because the Minister has some difficulty next week. My agreement was translated into a sitting at 1 o'clock today which was both unnecessary and extremely inconvenient for many people.  I cannot understand why there should be such urgency about taking all the Stages of the Bill today and I do not believe that the Members of this House would allow themselves to be treated in that way.  I must resist the proposal and oppose it in the hope the acting Leader of the House will realise that <Col N="403" /> it is outrageous to suggest that all Stages of this Bill should be taken this afternoon.  I understand the Minister has some difficulty next week.  If that is so I see no reason why it should not be deferred for another week.  I must resist the suggestion that we are going to take the remaining Stages within the next half hour.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. FitzGerald) Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. FitzGerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill before the Seanad provides for the enactment into Irish law of the treaty amending certain provisions of the treaties establishing the European Communities and of the treaty establishing a Single Council and a Single Commission of the European Communities.  When it is passed Ireland will be able to proceed to ratification of this new treaty which is, broadly speaking, designed to increase the powers of the European Parliament or Assembly, as it is called, in respect of the budget of the Communities.  It will also affect some rationalisation in auditing procedures by establishing a Court of Auditors to exercise the powers and jurisdiction at present conferred on the Audit Board of the European Communities and on the Auditor of the European Coal and Steel Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might say a few words first about the form of the legislation.  Initially it was considered that we might be able to proceed to ratification of this new treaty without the necessity for any domestic legislation to give effect to any of its provisions.  However, after consulting the Attorney General, I decided that this solution would not be desirable.  Having enacted all the existing Community treaties into Irish law under the European Communities Act 1972, it would be anomalous and illogical to treat an amendment differently. Unlike our British neighbours, we are not able to enact amendments to the Community treaties into Irish law by a statutory instrument under our existing legislation so this Bill is required.  Its effect will be to put this <Col N="405" /> new treaty in the same position in our domestic law as the other Community treaties itemised in the European Communities Act, 1972 as from the date of its entry into force; that is to say, it will be part of the domestic law of the State under the conditions laid down in the treaties governing the European Communities.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs will have power to make regulations to give effect to it, regulations which will of course be subject to the annulment procedures contained in the European Communities (Amendment) Act 1973.</P>
    <P>As Senators are no doubt aware, the treaties which established the three European Communities&mdash;that is, the European Coal and Steel Community, the European Economic Community and the European Atomic Energy Community&mdash;provided the European Parliament with very little power in relation to the budget of the Communities.  This situation came in time to be regarded as generally unsatisfactory and, in order to bring about some improvement in the position, the member states on 22nd April, 1970 signed a treaty amending certain provisions of the original treaties so as to increase the powers of the Parliament over the Community budget.  This treaty, which is generally known as the Budgetary Powers Treaty, came into operation on 1st January, 1975 and its provisions remain in force today.</P>
    <P>Although the 1970 treaty undoubtedly represented an improvement in the budgetary powers of the European Parliament, it did not, however, entirely satisfy the wishes of the Parliament itself or, indeed the wishes of a number of the member states which felt that the powers granted should have been more extensive.  Because of this, it was agreed that in due course the Commission would make further proposals in relation to the Parliament's budgetary powers which the Council would examine.</P>
    <P>The Commission submitted its proposals on 9th June, 1973.  The proposals, following some revision after the Parliament had given its opinion on them, were discussed at length by the Council during the months which followed.  In due course, the Council <Col N="406" /> agreed joint guidelines on a &ldquo;package&rdquo; of proposals at its meeting of 4th June, 1974.  Before finally committing itself, however, the Council heard further the views of the Parliament which were delivered during the course of two consultative meetings in June and October, 1974.  When the procedure was complete and after the proposals as finally agreed had been drafted into treaty form and the Parliament had been formally consulted, the Council, acting in accordance with article 236 of the EEC Treaty and article 204 of the Euratom Treaty, delivered an opinion on 22nd July, 1975 in favour of calling a Conference of Representatives of the Governments of the member states.  This conference proceeded to sign the new treaty on the same day.</P>
    <P>It is that treaty which is the subject of this Bill and whose provisions I now propose to outline in some detail. Essentially the objectives of the new treaty are twofold: to increase the powers of the European Parliament over the budget of the Communities and to establish a European Court of Auditors.</P>
    <P>I shall deal first with those provisions of the new treaty which concern the budgetary powers of the Parliament.  The most important of these provisions is undoubtedly that which recognises the right of Parliament to reject the draft budget <i>in toto.</i> Until now this particular question has been the subject of dispute between the Parliament and the Council with the Parliament holding that its power under the existing treaties to adopt the draft budget also implied a right not to adopt it&mdash;in other words to reject the draft budget.  The Council has never agreed with this view and has insisted instead that the Parliament has the right to adopt the draft budget only but not to reject it.  The new treaty will remove all sources of dispute over this matter as articles 2, 12 and 20 specifically provide that the Parliament, acting by a majority of its members and two-thirds of the votes cast, may, if there be important reasons, reject the draft budget and ask for a new draft to be submitted to it.  Should Parliament exercise this option of rejecting the draft budget outright and, <Col N="407" /> if for this or other reasons, the budget remained unadopted at the begining of the financial year, it would be necessary to fall back on the system of &ldquo;provisional twelfths&rdquo;.  This is the system whereby, under the existing treaties, if the budget is not adopted by the start of the financial year, a sum equivalent to not more than one-twelfth of the budget appropriations of the preceding financial year may be spent each month.</P>
    <P>There is also provision under the new treaty for increasing the power of the Parliament over &ldquo;obligatory expenditure&rdquo; by making it more difficult for the Council to reject changes to this type of expenditure proposed by the Parliament.  In the budget of the Communities expenditure is divided into two types: &ldquo;obligatory&rdquo; expenditure which is defined as &ldquo;expenditure necessarily resulting from the treaties or from acts adopted in accordance therewith&rdquo; and &ldquo;non-obligatory&rdquo; expenditure. Obligatory expenditure relates to matters such as the Regional Fund and expenditure of the common agricultural policy and accounts for about three-quarters of the current budget.  Non-obligatory expenditure includes sums available for staff salaries, the Social Fund and so on.  The essential difference between the two types of expenditure is that the Council has the final say over obligatory expenditure while the Parliament has the last word over non-obligatory expenditure.</P>
    <P>The Parliament, under the existing treaties, has a right to propose changes, or modifications as they are called, to the figures for obligatory expenditure established by the Council but unless the Council accepts these modifications by a qualified majority&mdash;that is by 41 votes out of 58 as laid down in the treaties&mdash;they stand rejected.  In practice, modifications proposed by the Parliament are almost invariably rejected.</P>
    <P>Under the new treaty such rejection will be made much more difficult where modifications do not increase the overall expenditure of an institution, that is in cases where a proposed increase in expenditure would be offset <Col N="408" /> by a reduction elsewhere.  This is because the new treaty provides that in such cases in future modifications by Parliament will stand accepted unless the Council votes by a qualified majority, namely 41 votes out of 58, to reject them.  The existing arrangements whereby modifications proposed by the Parliament stand rejected unless adopted by a qualified majority, will continue in all other cases.</P>
    <P>The new treaty also takes account of the fact that control over the way the budget has been implemented is an essential element of budgetary power and seeks to extend the Parliament's prerogatives in this regard by providing that in future the European Parliament alone, acting on the Council's recommendation, shall give a discharge to the Commission in respect of the implementation of the budget.  The power of discharge, which amounts in effect to a power to declare the accounts for the previous year finally and duly closed, is currently exercised jointly by the Parliament and the Council.</P>
    <P>Finally, the new treaty will make it obligatory for the Council to consult the European Parliament and to obtain the opinion of the proposed new Court of Auditors before it makes financial regulations relating to the management of the budget of the Communities.  The Council, at present, may make financial regulations without consulting either the Parliament or the Audit Board.</P>
    <P>In addition to strengthening the budgetary powers of the European Parliament, the new treaty also contains provisions designed to ensure a more effective management of Community finances through the establishment of a Court of Auditors to replace the existing Audit Board and the Auditor of the ECSC.  Although the functions of the Court of Auditors will be essentially the same as those of the Audit Board, it is hoped that by specifying the powers of the Court of Auditors in detail in the treaties rather than, as in the case of the Audit Board, mainly in a financial regulation, the new body will have a greater independence and authority and thus reinforce the financial audit of Community revenue and expenditure.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="409" /> There has in the past been a feeling that the Audit Board has not been as effective as might have been desired.  This was not due to any deficiency on the part of its members, all of whom were extremely conscientious and expert in their fields, but rather reflected some inherent defects in the conditions under which the Audit Board was expected to operate. Not only were the members of the Audit Board part-time but there were certain inhibiting ambiguities in the various texts governing its operation. The new treaty is designed to remedy this situation.</P>
    <P>In the first place, the nine members of the new Court of Auditors will be full-time and will no longer have to carry out the onerous task of combining services in their own national administrations with service on behalf of the Community.  Articles 7, 15 and 23 of the new treaty specifically forbid members of the court, during their term of office, from engaging in any other occupation, whether gainful or not.  Members of the court will thus devote all their time to the Audit of Community finances.</P>
    <P>In the second place, the new treaty will remove some important ambiguities which in the past have tended to inhibit the Community audit procedures.  The most important of these relates to on-the-spot audits. Under the existing treaties, the right of Audit Board to undertake on-the-spot audits in the member states is not specifically provided for and for a number of years certain member states&mdash;not including Ireland&mdash;were reluctant to allow such audits to take place in their territories.  In fact, because of the difference in views over this matter, the Audit Board was not able to undertake an on-the-spot audit in a member state until 1975.  Prior to this on-the-spot audits were confined to the institutions of the Communities. Since 1975 there has been a significant improvement in the situation and on-the-spot audits have been carried out freely in the member states.  The new treaty will guarantee beyond dispute this right to carry out on-the-spot audits in the member states.  Article 8, 16 and 24 provide that &ldquo;The audit shall be based on records and if <Col N="410" /> necessary shall be performed on the spot in the institutions of the Communities and in the member states&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The new treaty will also guarantee the right of the Court of Auditors to undertake audits before the accounts for a particular financial year have been closed.  Although in practice the Audit Board in recent years has been able to do this, again its rights to do so was not specified in the treaties.  This position is now to be rectified in the new treaty which provides in article 8, 16 and 24 that the &ldquo;Auditing of expenditure shall be carried out before the closure of accounts for the financial year in question&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Another purpose of the new treaty is to ensure that the Court of Auditors will have access to all the information it may require in order to carry out its task.  Under the existing treaties the powers of the Audit Board in this regard were not spelled out in detail and there was always the possibility that the board might not, in practice, have been able to obtain all the documents and other information it needed.  This is in marked contrast with the position of national audit authorities.  In Ireland, the Comptroller and Auditor General can ask for any information he needs and is given that information as a matter of right.  The new treaty will seek to ensure that the powers of the Court of Auditors will be comparable with those of national audit authorities by providing at articles 8, 16 and 24 that &ldquo;The institutions of the Communities and the national audit offices or, if those do not have the necessary powers, the competent national departments, shall forward to the Court of Auditors, at its request, any document of information necessary to carry out its task&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>A further effect of the new treaty will be to rationalise the Communities' institutional arrangements for carrying out audits.  At present the Audit Board is responsible for auditing the accounts of all revenue and expenditure except for the non-administrative revenue and expenditure of the European Coal and Steel Community which is carried out by the auditor of the ECSC.  The new treaty will abolish this duality.  All audits will in future <Col N="411" /> be carried out by the Court of Auditors.</P>
    <P>Despite their technical nature, the provisions of the new treaty have the clear purpose of ensuring a greater and more democratic control over the finances of the European Communities. This is a development which has the full support of the Government and which I also feel sure will have the full endorsement of this House.  The Bill has already been passed unopposed by the Dáil and I would hope that the Seanad will also give it a full approval. In this way Ireland will be enabled to take the necessary steps towards ratification of the new treaty and thus help to bring its provisions into operation at an early date.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the Seanad.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to say at the outset that we on this side of the House welcome this Bill.  If we had any fault to find with it it certainly would be that there seems to have been an undue delay in introducing it.  According to what we <Col N="412" /> were told the machinery for doing so was signed about July, 1975, and it has taken almost two years to bring it before the House.  Anybody looking at the Bill will see that it is very short; it does not contain many sections and it would not have taken superhuman effort on the part of the Government to have had this legislation here long ago and passed, because we on his side of the House certainly would not have opposed it.</P>
    <P>Any legislation dealing with the European Parliament is of tremendous importance to this country.  We have been in the EEC for quite a while and we are in the peripheral region; we certainly do not belong to the inner circle.  It does not require any stretch of the imagination to realise from what we read and hear that there is a very high influential lobby at the centre of affairs as far as the European Parliament is concerned. Perhaps it may not be deliberate or intentional but it is an undeniable fact that many of the countries which comprise the EEC are organised communities.  In some of them up to 80 per cent of the population live in large cities and towns. Consequently, many of these people are always considering themselves with a view to securing the cheapest food they can get.  Small blame to them.  If a policy such as that is allowed to continue and if representatives from countries such as Ireland are not on their toes in this matter we will find there will be a great lobby against us out there and we will eventually find ourselves in the unhappy position that our manufactured goods, and in particular food produced in this country, will be scaled down each time to the detriment of our workers and farmers. When we joined the EEC we had hoped to benefit from the FEOGA grants and from the various other aids that were coming from the EEC.</P>
    <P>Our situation is far removed from the centre and transport is very difficult and very dear at present with prices escalating each year.  All these things are tending to price our commodities out or put them at a very high level indeed.  This might not be properly understood by the industrial countries, <Col N="413" /> in particular Germany, Holland, Belgium, Luxembourg and, indeed, England.  It behoves our representatives in the European Parliament on every occasion and at every level to try at all times to put our point of view.  We are not going into the European Parliament as beggars or as people craving for something; we are only looking for what we feel is our just share in a Community of which we are a very important unit.</P>
    <P>The Bill sets up this Court of Auditors and I think that in any institution it is important to have auditors and people who will scrutinise and who will examine accounts.  Even the individual has now come around to that, and certainly small companies have, and it is only right that in the case of a big institution such as the European Parliament, all moneys there would be properly audited and proper accounts presented.  It can happen that discrepancies arise; we often read of financial scandals in various countries. It is important, because the European Community is still young, that there be strict supervision on the financial arrangements from the very beginning. Setting up this court of auditors is a good idea because, as the Minister has rightly said, they will now be wholetime rather than part-time as they were in the days gone by and anybody will realise that people working on a part-time basis would not be able to give the same attention to the job as if it was a wholetime occupation.</P>
    <P>Another very important feature I see in this Bill is that it increases the powers of the European Parliament. Certainly, at a time such as this when we are only 12 months away from an election to the European Parliament, it is of tremendous importance to this country.  Let me say that it is of bedrock importance that we would have the best possible team representing us when it comes to selecting representatives for the European Parliament. They should have a good back-up team and they should be people who would project the image of our country and work as a team rather than work in individual groups.  We can have our local politics here in our own Houses and in our own county councils.  It is not a bad thing but when we go abroad <Col N="414" /> it is of vital importance that we should have a united front when making decisions that effect the lives and livelihoods of our people.</P>
    <P>Quite recently they had an election in the European Parliament for President. Most of the Members here know of the dedicated service that Senator Yeats has given this House and they know of the esteem and regard in which a man of his calibre and learning is held abroad.  The name Yeats is know the length and breadth not alone of Europe but of the world, especially in literary circles.  It was a pity that certain members from our country did not vote for our nominee for that very important position.  They may not have been issued with a direction from their own party as to what they should do&mdash;I do not know.  So far as we are concerned as a country it would have been a tremendous asset to us to have a man of that calibre in Europe.  It is not often we obtain these positions.  Despite what we might think of the person who occupied a previous position as a politician, we were all glad to see the present Minister when he became for six months president some years ago presiding at a meeting held in Dublin.  Things like that bring a certain renown and give publicity to our country.  It is important that we would not lose sight of these things.</P>
    <P>I have no fault to find with the Bill. There was undue delay in presenting it to us.  Such an important piece of legislation does certain things which are very necessary and for that reason, we on this side of the House are not opposing it.</P>

      <P>As was pointed out by the Minister, this treaty was signed by the member states in July 1975 and the proposals in it were considered by the Joint Committee on EEC Secondary Legislation in May 1975 when they were still in draft.  The Joint Committee reported on 7th May, 1975 in a way which showed that it favoured the proposals in the draft treaty subsequently adopted.  It welcomed the increased powers of the European Parliament. The relevant passages are in the conclusions in paragraph 16 under the heading &ldquo;General View&rdquo; of the Joint Committee's report on the <Col N="415" /> budgetary powers of the European Parliament.  They said:</P>
      <P>In general the Joint Committee welcomes moves to extend the budgetary powers of the European Parliament and views these developments as reinforcing the case for early direct elections to that body.</P>
      <P>The report goes on at paragraph 20 under &ldquo;Other Changes&rdquo; to say:</P>
      <P>The Joint Committee supports the proposed new Conciliation Procedure, the projected establishment of a Court of Auditors and the proposed conferring of power on Parliament to give a discharge to the Commission in the implementation of the Budget.  It believes that these would be conducive to the Parliament's exercising an increasing influence on the financial affairs of the Community.</P>
      <P>It is clear that even before the final signing of this treaty in July 1975 there was an Irish parliamentary view in favour of the proposals contained in the treaty.</P>
      <P>One preliminary comment I would like to make about the treaty is that it is a very difficult document to locate! After much effort, I managed to get a copy of the treaty published by the General Secretariat of the Council of the European Communities.  The treaty contains the provisions for its ratification and for its coming into effect. Article 29 provides:</P>
      <P>This treaty shall be ratified by the High Contracting Parties in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements.  The instruments of ratification shall be deposited with the Government of the Italian Republic.</P>
      <P>Article 30 goes on:</P>
      <P>This treaty shall enter into force on the first day of the month following the deposit of the instrument of ratification by the last signatory State to take this step.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the treaty enters into force during the budgetary procedure, the Council shall, after consulting the Assembly and the Commission, adopt the measures required in order to facilitate the application of this <Col N="416" /> Treaty to the remainder of the budgetary procedure.</P>
    <P>So this treaty depended on co-operation by the various signatory states in having it ratified and adopted in order to come into effect.  It is very sad that Ireland appears to be at the tailend of this ratification process.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think we are in the middle.  In the Tenth General Report on the activities of the European Communities the Commission made reference to the ratification procedures.  At page 30 of the report it says:</P>
      <P>Ratification procedures for the Treaty to strengthen the budgetary powers of the European Parliament and set up a Court of Auditors have been completed or are nearing completion in Belgium, France, Ireland, Italy and the Netherlands.  By the end of the year instruments of ratification had been deposited by Denmark, the Federal Republic of Germany, Luxembourg and the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>I understand that certain other states who were in the process of ratification have ratified.  It is sad, because, as this Bill to ratify according to our constitutional procedures shows, ratification is not really a very difficult exercise.  Ireland should be pressing strongly for any development towards improving the democratic structure and base of the Community.  It is very important. It is a principle we talk about, and it is one we should exert ourselves to establish.  It is regrettable that this Bill is only coming before us today and that it did not come before us in September or October, 1975, when we could have shown our interest and anxiety to improve the democratic base of the European Parliament.  It is regrettable that the immediate past President of the European Parliament had to draw attention to the fact that Ireland had not set in motion the national ratification procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This treaty will make an improvement in the budgetary powers of the European Parliament.  This legislative improvement is accompanied by a considerable improvement in the Parliament's <Col N="417" /> own capacity to exert a control. This is one of the things which has been quite noticeable and quite impressive in the evolution and development of the European Parliament itself in the last year or so.  There has been much more concern about expenditure and about the budget of the Community. As I understand it, the control sub-committee of the budget committee is now exerting a considerable influence over the budget of the Communities. This is a very important priority for the Parliament and so it should be.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I welcome the amendments and the improvements in the budgetary control, particularly as regards &ldquo;obligatory&rdquo; expenditure.  But the reality of the situation is that the Parliament still has very little real power.  Having control over the budget does not give it real legislative power. It is vital, if the European Community is to evolve as a democratic Community, and to have any significance as a real Community, that this point be retained and remembered; that the Parliament still does not have a legislative voice in the instruments which create the budgetary proposals afterwards. The fact that the Parliament does not have a power of co-decision in these legislative instruments is a key factor in undermining the place of the Parliament in an institutional framework. The Parliament was set up as a consultative assembly.  It has tried&mdash;it has renamed itself the European Parliament; it is still officially called the European Assembly&mdash;it has tried to exert power through pressure for both increasing its budgetary power which has now been achieved by this second treaty following the Luxembourg treaty of 1970; and it has also pressurised for and has got a decision on direct elections which will reinforce the democratic base of the European Parliament but it still has not got anything like the powers of a real Parliament and it will not have them when this treaty is adopted by the various member states and comes into effect.</P>
    <P>This is particularly serious because I believe there has been a diminution in democratic control and accountability as the European Community has <Col N="418" /> evolved.  Member states have lost a degree of democratic control over what was decided at the national level to the European level, but the democratic control has been diluted at that level. This is a very serious development, and as more important decisions are being taken at the European Community level it is going to become less and less acceptable.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to proposals that were made as far back as 1972 by a working party established by the European Commission and of which I was a member.  The Vedel Committee, as it was called, was the report of the working party examining the problems of the enlargement of the powers of the European Parliament.  This committee, which reported in March 1972 prior to the summit in October 1972, recommended a two-fold increase in the powers of the Parliament, in particular, and with greater emphasis, the giving of a power of co-decision in legislative measures to the European Parliament and secondly, an increase in budgetary powers of the Parliament. The Vedel Committee came down very strongly on the side of the necessity to increase the legislative role by giving a power of co-decision, since otherwise the budgetary power, because of the composition and nature of the European budget, could never be a very real power.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer first, to the proposals in the Vedel Report.  The proposals were to recommend that the Parliament be given a power of co-decision in two stages, and in the first stage the Parliament would have a power of co-decision in relation to certain key areas of the Treaties.  I quote from page 39 of the Vedel Report under the heading, &ldquo;Fields and stages of extension of the powers of the Parliament&rdquo;:&mdash;</P>
    <P>In this context, the Working Party recommends that the law-making powers of the Parliament should be increased in two stages.  Apart from the problem of political timing which would be raised by the need for the consent of the Member States to a broad and very rapid expansion of the Parliament's <Col N="419" /> powers, a transitional period should be foreseen in the course of which the Community institutions would adapt steadily and by trial and error, each in its own field and in its relations to the others, to the new system which is recommended.</P>
    <P>In the first stage, Parliament would be given the power of co-decision (according to the procedures set out under S.4 below in the following matters, which, for simplicity's sake, are hereinafter called list A:</P>
    <P>&mdash;revision of the Treaties;</P>
    <P>&mdash;implementation of Article 235 of the EEC Treaty and analagous provisions in the ESCS and Euratom Treaties;</P>
    <P>&mdash;admission of new members;</P>
    <P>&mdash;ratification of international agreements concluded by the Community.</P>
    <P>Besides this and still in the first stage the European Parliament would be given a greater power of consultation consisting of the right to ask the Council to reconsider a subject and hence a suspensive veto in the following fields (called list B.</P>
    <P>List B includes the main legislative areas, the harmonisation of law, Common Agricultural Policy, Common Transport Policy, European Social Fund and so on.  It is envisaged that in the second stage this list B would give the Parliament a general power of co-decision.  It is very important to keep in mind that the present Treaty is very much a compromise which falls far short of the proposals put forward by the Vedel Committee in 1972.  It does not give a power of co-decision to the European Parliament. It proposes a very involved structure of co-operation between the council and parliament which still comes down very strongly in favour of the Council of Ministers.  It is a power which, I think, will be appreciated by the members of the European Parliament at present because it will give them a certain degree of influence in relation to the &ldquo;obligatory&rdquo; expenditure of the Community, but it is still, as I say, very limited.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="420" /> As the Parliament proceeds towards direct elections&mdash;and I am becoming pessimistic about the date when these may take place but, nevertheless, it will presumably be before 1980&mdash;it will be seen that the actual power exerted is very limited.  This could have a very bad effect on people's attitude towards the European Parliament. It could exacerbate the feeling of alienation, the feeling that the Community is not representative of their views and is not representative in the real sense that the people elected to the European Parliament do not have a real power of decision in the legislative measures of the Community. There is far too rigid a straitjacket proposed.  If the Commission can fix each year the maximum expenditure then how can the European Parliament influence, in a real way, the development of redistributive policies at the European Community level?  How can you have the European Parliament play a real role in determining the size of the regional policy, social policy, or, if there is to be an integrated common policy a unified Fund of the European Community, to prevent disparity between regions?  There is no flexibility to allow for this in the present very tight system proposed.  This is one of the major defects.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer briefly to an article in the issue of <i>New Europe</i> of Spring, 1976, entitled &ldquo;Towards a People's Budget&rdquo;.  It was an article which resulted from the work of a study group which involved certain officials working on the European Parliament staff and some academics. It criticised the proposals contained in this Treaty much along the lines I have mentioned.  It showed that it would be necessary to have much more real power and involvement of the parliament if it is to have the right to call itself a real parliament. It talked also about another aspect which I think is very important&mdash;the complexity of the budgetary procedure at the European Community level.  I do not believe it is necessary to have such a convoluted and complex budgetary procedure in order to decide on priorities and policies.  It is unnecessarily confusing, and if people are confused <Col N="421" /> they are put off by a particular procedure. It would be better to devise a system for having a Community budget which did not have this artificial distinction between &ldquo;obligatory&rdquo; and &ldquo;non-obligatory&rdquo; expenditure.  I find it very difficult to understand, for example, why aid to developing countries is classified as obligatory expenditure?  Why should there be this very legalistic and very narrow distinction?  The article that I am referring to starts on page 52 and it makes this point:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Many of the aspects of the budgetary procedure are difficult to comprehend, not least because on contentious matters like the fixing of the maximum rate of expenditure (which affects Parliament's right for increasing expenditure) and the classification between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure, there is at present no mechanism for producing a convergence of views when the institutions disagree.  Cases of disagreement are not clearly covered by the present provisions of Article 203.  To resolve this problem, &ldquo;gentlemen's agreements&rdquo; could be made which would go beyond but not in any way against the letter of the Treaties at present.  Whatever could be achieved in this way would need subsequent incorporation within the Treaty which could then apply, at the latest, to the 1979 budget.</P>
    <P>So there is a need for greater flexibility and for the Parliament to be involved in determining priorities.  In a sense, and perhaps the Minister will emphasise this point, it is fair to say that the type of budgetary power that the European Parliament has compares very favourably with the budgetary powers of a national parliament.  But the national parliament is involved in a much more real way in the processing of legislative measures than is the European Parliament.  I do not want to denigrate or to underestimate the significance of increasing further the participation of the Parliament both in the scrutiny of expenditure and also its budgetary powers, particularly in relation to &ldquo;obligatory&rdquo; expenditure, but this must not allow us to be deflected <Col N="422" /> from the fact that the European Parliament has not got real legislative powers, is not a real Parliament in that sense, and that this is a very unsatisfactory situation which will not be remedied by direct election.  It will be aggravated and will lead, I hope, to an unanswerable groundswell for participation in a democratic sense in decision making at the European Community level.</P>
    <P>The proposal for a Court of Auditors is an improvement on the old audit board procedure.  It is very important that there be a body with clear statutory&mdash;or treaty&mdash;authority now to carry out its functions.  It is necessary, in view of the attitude of certain member states, that it should have very clear treaty power.  The existence of this body will help to allay some suspicions of how certain parts of the budget are arrived at and are spent.</P>
    <P>I would be interested in the Minister's views on the possibility of the European Parliament having a full-bodied public accounts committee which could exert a useful scrutiny over the court of auditors.  This, again, would be a welcome development.  I know that the control subcommittee of the budget committee was formed as an effort at being half way towards that.  It would seem desirable that there would be a full-bodied public accounts committee somewhat analagous to the public accounts committee of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>That is all I wanted to say on this particular measure.  It is one that I obviously welcome.  I would have welcomed it 18 months ago when we might have demonstrated our conscious interest and involvement in improving the democratic structure of the European Community, when we might have bolstered the credibility of our constant calling for a more democratic Europe.</P>
    <P>Ireland is too small a country to exert very strong power or financial sway in particular areas, but we can have a very important moral role, and a very important role in insisting upon the re-enforcement of the democratic structure.  This is particularly necessary in view of the attitude, for example, of countries like France towards the <Col N="423" /> powers of the Parliament.  The French Parliament have made it clear that the powers of the European Parlimeant must not be increased, and this appears to have been given some support by the recent opinion of the Council of State in France on the question of the constitutionality there of the Treaty on Direct Elections.  So, in the face of this sort of attitude, particularly in large and powerful member states, Ireland should insist on being in the forefront in promoting any measure which will reinforce the democratic structure of the Community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset it is my pleasant task to welcome the Minister back from his recent illness and to see that he is in good form and is ready for work again.  We are all really delighted with that.</P>
      <P>Secondly, we can welcome the Bill before us as a step in strengthening the democratic structure and base of the Community.  We are all quite concerned at the apparent weak democratic structure that has been the EEC and also what seems to be the rather excessive powers at two extremes, both the Commission on the one hand, who seem to be all powerful, and the Council of Ministers on the other.  So anything that tries to strengthen the Parliamentary role is to be welcomed, although what is here appears to be a relatively small step concerning control over a certain amount of what is called non-obligatory expenditure.  It allows some slight beginnings of discretion to the European Parliament in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are concerned about the democratic structure.  What does a democratic structure mean?  What does it mean in this country?  It means that an area in rural Ireland should be able to have its voice heard in this Parliament and that the Parliament should show itself responsive to its needs.  This can be translated to European level; the whole EEC arrangement should be responsive to our needs and we should, in some way, be able to get our viewpoint across, but especially we want to ensure that we get as much help to develop as we need.  Our main problem is that <Col N="424" /> we are the least developed of the nine member states.  Anything that would help to bring that home to the EEC is to be welcomed.  That is why the parliamentary forum and its opportunities are to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>I confess to being very disappointed with the performance by the Government since our accession in strengthening in a real practical way this democratic structure in so far as it effects us.  I am not trying to reform Europe but I am concerned with our part in Europe and with our influence there.  I will take it under three headings. Firstly, we have, since we joined the EEC three years ago, the constant spectacle on television of Ministers going to and coming from Brussels.  We can sympathise with the tremendous burden that the EEC places on them.  The Government have, as yet, taken no steps to alleviate the burden on the Ministers. If a certain number of Ministers were capable of doing the national task in pre-EEC times, it is obvious that the same number are not capable of doing it today and that it is dereliction of duty on our part not to take cognisance of that simple fact and to increase the numbers accordingly. It is only by providing facilities and ample representation that we can ensure that our viewpoint is expressed to the maximum effect.  I fear that by placing such a great burden on the Ministers the home front is suffering and has suffered very considerably in that the Ministers have less time to devote to their home tasks.  Therefore, there is more and more of it passing into our bureaucracy, which of course is a small bureaucracy compared with the Eurocracy.  Yet it is creeping bureaucracy, and that, to my mind, is the wrong development for a country developing in democracy.</P>
    <P>It should mean devolution of responsibility, less bureaucracy, more to the regions rather than more centralisation. I call again for the Government to quickly actualise some of the vague hints we have got now.  This is urgent. It will require at least 50 per cent addition to take account of the EEC work.  Frankly, I do not know how the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the <Col N="425" /> Minister for Agriculture stand up to the enormous burden that is placed on them.  It is not fair that that burden should be placed on them.  Not alone is it not fair, but if they were given further assistance they would be able to do an even better job for the country than they are doing at the moment.  I mention those two Ministers in particular.</P>
    <P>I see no effort whatsoever on the part of the Government to familiarise our legislators with the European institutions. I would have thought that with accession to the EEC there would be a planned programme to get Members of both the Dáil and the Seanad to visit the European institutions, to study them, to spend periods there in order to become familiar with them and in turn to be involved in local committees at home in the areas in which they wish to specialise in European affairs. Specialisation in European affairs is required.  That should be something which parliamentarians should be encouraged to do.</P>
    <P>I endorse Senator Dolan's plea to send the best team possible to Europe. We want the best team at home also. I am sufficiently parochial to believe that we have a man-sized job in trying to run this part of Europe and that this should not suffer talent-wise from the attractions of Europe with the type of salaries that make socialists forget their socialism very easily as they become attracted by the immense salaries which are so lightly taxed as to seem to be an affront to any idea of equality. These are only some of the tasks which exist.  I would hate to think that the national scene would take second place for talent to the European scene.  I should hope that sending a team to Europe will not mean that most of our potential Ministers are carted off onto the gravy trail.</P>
    <P>Senator Dolan pleaded for a united approach.  That plea is timely.  I was listening to an interview with Mr. Burke recently when he had some strong and timely comments to make on the disgraceful conduct of our national papers in their campaign of vilification of him in the months in which the question of his appointment as commissioner was in the news.  A great disservice was done to the <Col N="426" /> country and to Mr. Burke personally by that campaign, which was totally and utterly unfounded.  One of the first developments in getting a democratic structure going here is to get a responsible press and not the type of left-wing dominated press that we are being fed with today, where the left can do no wrong and anyone who is classed by them as being on the right can do no right.  I want to avail of this opportunity to endorse Mr. Burke's protest at the treatment he received. Mr. Burke hopes that at least no Irishman would be subject to the same calculated campaign of vilification that our national press, to our national disgrace, indulged in during the winter months.  I do not think we could have got a better representative to go to Europe than Mr. Burke.  I cannot think of anyone, even the present Minister, who was a greater loss to the national scene than Mr. Burke has been.  I have not the slightest doubt that he will distinguish himself in Europe.  The work he had been doing here is now becoming recognised and is beginning to bear fruit.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to use his influence, to look at the home scene and to begin the process of broadening the democratic structure to enable us to avail of the opportunities that may be in Europe, at least the opportunities to enable us to develop the potential that we have and to enable us to play a role in Europe that will spring from a strong democratic and economic base in this country, which has agriculturally and otherwise probably the greatest potential of any comparable area in Europe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ruairí Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a couple of points and to seek some clarification on some of the Minister's speech and also some of the workings of the Parliament as outlined in his speech.  First, as a member of the Labour Party and as somebody who campaigned against our entry into the EEC I accept&mdash;one does not have much alternative but to accept&mdash;the vote of four or five to one that emerged from the referendum.  In accepting that&mdash;as far as I and my colleagues in the Labour Party are concerned&mdash;there is an over-riding obligation now for us to ensure that the loss of democracy <Col N="427" /> which was implicit in going into the EEC is somehow or other restored by the strengthening of the European Parliament.  My colleague, Senator Robinson, correctly said that it is really a misnomer to describe that assembly as a parliament.  To the extent that this measure will strengthen those powers I think nobody on any side of the House can but welcome this measure.</P>
      <P>I certainly endorse the comments that have been made both by the other Senators and by the Minister in his opening remarks.  I would, however, like to hear him reply to the request for the explanation as to why it has taken so long to bring this Bill before the Seanad.  Even if we had passed it in the autumn of 1975, as Senator Robinson suggested, we still would be depending on other countries and therefore it would not have gone ahead.  Nevertheless my view is that we have seen some of the effects of free trade in a very real and savage sort of way.  To that extent the Common Market has contributed, undoubtedly in my view, to the speeding up of the free trade process and to the subsequent closure of many industries. Dublin, contrary to the popular opinion that is around the country, has suffered extremely badly with regard to redundancies and unemployment.  The kind of unemployment problems that we have within the Dublin area are not caused directly by our accession to the Common Market&mdash;that would be a very naive and simplistic view to put forward&mdash;but they have been aggravated in a very real way by the implication of free trade.  My view would be that the European Parliament must increase its powers so that its members are free to argue for the redistribution of wealth on a proper European scale as individual Deputies representing constituencies of European electorates rather than members of national delegations, despite their party affiliations still to all intents and purposes as far as one can see, acting largely as national delegations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The kind of plea Senator Dolan made with regard to Senator Yeats, for whom we all have a lot of respect, simply reinforces this kind of nationalist <Col N="428" /> attitude towards positions in the European Parliament, without wishing in any way to be disrespectful to Senator Yeats.  Indeed, my colleagues in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament supported Senator Yeats as a second alternative after our candidate did not secure election.  I do not think that is the way we are going to get the sort of redistribution out of the European Parliament that this country, as a part of the peripheral Europe, needs.  It needs it no less than the peripheral parts of France, for example, such as Brittany, or the peripheral parts of Southern Italy who are equally distressed and disadvantaged structurally and culturally by the golden triangle of London, Paris and the Ruhr.  We must, in passing this Bill and disposing of it quickly this afternoon, urge the Minister for Foreign Affairs to exercise his considerable influence and respect within Europe to bring this measure in as quickly as possible and exercise his influence on the other member states who have not yet ratified it.</P>
    <P>My concern was with the extent of the powers the Parliament will have in precise clarification.  Perhaps the Minister could explain if it will mean a change in powers over obligatory expenditure where the Parliament cannot accept the draft from the Council.  If that obligatory expenditure, for example, caters for the Regional Fund, by deduction will the Parliament have the power to demand an increase in the size of the Regional Fund?  Will that go back to the Council of Ministers and will they, in turn, get into some direct bargaining with the Parliament?</P>
    <P>This kind of measure is only of value as far as myself and other members of the Labour Party would be concerned if it does transfer some power, however small, to directly-elected members of the European Parliament to increase or modify the size of the Regional Fund in particular.  I mention the Regional Fund because it is the most obvious area of significance as far as Ireland would be concerned in terms of redistribution of wealth within the Community generally.  It was a fund that was puffed out of all recognition <Col N="429" /> prior to the referendum, and after we had voted and the Fund came into existence, it seemed much smaller than most people had hoped for.  Similarly, the Minister might care to explain why the Regional Fund is contained within the obligatory sector and the Social Fund is not.  Similar arguments could be applied equally to the Social Fund as to the Regional Fund. That is something that I do not understand.</P>
    <P>Regarding the comments of Senator Quinlan about the current Irish Commissioner, it is fair to say that everybody in this House wishes him the best and welcomes the comments that he has recently made in trying to secure the maximum for Irish interests. My attitude is that Commissioner Burke, in his own statements and his actions so far, has given every indication of a very serious and professional intent with regard to the job of Commissioner.</P>
    <P>I do not think Senator Quinlan's comments about a left-wing dominated Press are either helpful or factual with regard to the malicious campaign.  For example, I do not regard Tony O'Reilly as a left-wing member of our society, nor indeed, do I regard Major de Valera as such. Both of them are significant shareholders of the two major newspapers. <i>The Irish Times</i> perhaps is <i>sui generis</i> but its circulation would not suggest that it is a magnificent influence to the extent Senator Quinlan regards it.</P>

      <Col N="430" /> That is an addendum to my comments on the Bill.  I wish the Bill well and I hope the Minister can go back to the Council and get the other member states to ratify it as quickly as possible.  In line with what Senator Robinson said, we should try and get some firm commitment on the date of the European elections because, obviously, the direct elections are directly involved with the taking up of these powers.</P>

      <P>I accept that the delay in bringing the Bill before the House requires some explanation.  It is not, however, the fact that our inaction has held up ratification.  The latest information I have available is that there are three other countries in respect of which we have had no notification of ratification.  That means that if they have done so they have only done so in the last couple of days. The three countries are Belgium, France and Italy.  We are far from being the last and we have certainly not held up ratification.  Having said that, I accept that it would have been preferable had we been earlier in the field.  Part of the reason for the delay was the legal doubt as to whether legislation was required.  One of the problems we had with a number of EEC Acts, Treaties and so on, has been to try to establish clearly in our minds what are the correct procedures constitutionally.</P>
      <P>There are areas of doubt here and we are anxious to act correctly in relation to the Community's Acts and in regard to the EEC and, above all, to act correctly in accordance with our own Constitution.  The grafting arm of the EEC legislative process to an Irish legislative process under a Constitution enacted decades before the EEC was thought of has given rise to some difficulties, doubts and uncertainties. These have taken the kind of time to resolve which legal matters are inclined to do.  That has been a large part of the problem in this instance. I accept that that is not sufficient justification.  It would have been better if the Bill was before the Dáil sooner, and I accept the validity of the criticisms made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="431" /> On the question of the powers of the European Parliament, one should not&mdash;and Senator Robinson made this point at the end of her remarks&mdash;play down too much the significance of the powers the Parliament has.  It has not got a legislative power&mdash;I will come back to the question of its legislative influence&mdash;but it has, in the financial area&mdash;now greatly enhanced by the Treaty we are dealing with here&mdash;very significant powers.  They are, as Senator Robinson recognised, powers which go beyond those which we are accustomed to here as far as either the Dáil or Seanad is concerned. They go beyond the powers of the British Parliament or the French Parliament.  I cannot speak for others but it may be that there are other parliaments in the EEC which have the power to increase expenditure. Under our system, and also under the British and French systems, the power to propose expenditure is uniquely exclusively that of Executive. Parliament's power is to reject it or reduce it but not to propose additions.</P>
    <P>The European Parliament has won for itself a significant function in the earlier Treaty, and in this one now, in regard to expenditure of a kind which none of the Executives in any of the three countries I mentioned would easily concede to Parliament. This is an important power not to be minimised.  The power also exists to reject the budget.  That is an important power which has not yet been used, but it is far from certain that it will not be used in the future.  If there is a major conflict between Council and Parliament on some issue it is open to the Parliament to reject the entire budget and force the Council to start the process again.</P>
    <P>I have heard it suggested by good Europeans, some of them even good Europeans in Government if one does not regard that as a contradiction in terms, that Parliament should consider more seriously the use of this power in certain cases where it wishes to assert itself.  It is, perhaps, in some ways an excessive power, and the reason it has not been used is that it is such a blockbuster just as the power <Col N="432" /> to dismiss the Commission by a two-thirds majority is such a blockbuster. Sometimes if one gives too big a power it is not going to be used because it seems disproportionate to the offence against which it is directed. These powers exist and I would not exclude the possibility of Parliament rejecting a future budget in order to assert itself against a Council of Ministers which in its view was not acting in the interests of Europe as a whole. There are those major powers.  Then there is the power to increase expenditure. Senator Quinn has understandably asked for an explanation of the distinction between &ldquo;obligatory&rdquo; and &ldquo;non-obligatory&rdquo; and how, and why, the regional and social funds are separately treated in this regard and for some indication as to how in fact the system works.  They are fair questions and ones on which whenever I am likely to be asked them I need to refresh my memory on the detail because, in fact, this is an area of some complexity.  As regards the distinction between the two it is, in fact, unclear.  The definition in regard to obligatory expenditure is one which really begs too many questions and leaves room for ambiguity.  In my speech I said that obligatory expenditure was expenditure defined as necessarily resulting from the Treaties or Acts adopted in accordance therewith.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;Treaties&rdquo; is clear enough, but &ldquo;necessarily resulting from Acts adopted in accordance therewith&rdquo; leaves a fair amount of room for doubt.  What it does not seem to me to leave much room for is putting the Regional Fund on one side and the Social Fund on the other.  Frankly, I never understood any rational basis for that distinction.  It was not a distinction we favoured.  My own view is that the Regional Fund should have been treated as non-obligatory but it was decided otherwise in accordance with the procedures of the Council of Ministers.</P>
    <P>Among the reasons given at informal discussions for treating the Regional Fund as obligatory is one which is highly significant and one we should think seriously about, that the Regional Fund, and the amount thereof, was decided at the highest level by the <Col N="433" /> European Council and this so bound the hands of everyone that it must be regarded therefore as obligatory.</P>
    <P>I find this viewpoint utterly inconsistent of a number of heads of Government in the Community that the European Council has a <i>role motor</i>, a role of pushing things along, but, of course, that it merely gives general orientations and does not take decisions. If European Council's orientations are to be so binding as to be more obligatory than a decision or a regulation of the Council, then there is some confusion of thought here.  My view is that the psychological reason for the Regional Fund being classified as obligatory was one which was not fully justified in legal terms and one which raises a basic ambiguity with regard to the role of the European Council about which certainly in this country we are concerned.  Deputies who are, indeed, familiar with the Taoiseach's memorandum which he submitted before the European Council took place in Rome in December, 1974, will be aware of some of the views of the Irish Government on the general subject of the role of the European Council and the possible problems it raises in regard to the exclusive competence of the Commission in the area of proposing initiatives within the Community.</P>
    <P>On the question of how the system works, in so far as obligatory expenditure is concerned what is open to the Parliament is to substitute for one part of obligatory expenditure proposed by the Council an equal sum of money under some other heading.  They cannot add to the total obligatory expenditure but they can switch.  It would for example, be open to the Parliament to decide that rather than spending money on some part of the Agricultural Fund for FEOGA, or some part of the Social Fund that that money would be deducted and replaced in addition to the Regional Fund.</P>
    <P>There is no limit to the amount of substitution that can be proposed but it is substitution, not an addition to the total amount of obligatory expenditure. If that is done then that comes back to the Council of Ministers and, under the new procedure as distinct from the old one, it will be necessary <Col N="434" /> for a significant majority of the order of 70 per cent of the Council of Ministers to reject that proposal.  In other words, supposing we have a situation where in the Council of Ministers two large countries, or one large and two medium sized, or one large and three small, to give three examples, took a viewpoint as a minority as to what the pattern of expenditure should be in the budget and were defeated in the Council of Ministers on that issue, on a qualified majority vote on the budget in respect of which qualified majority voting does and always has taken place, it would be open to those countries to drop a few hints in the European Parliament&mdash;that is that if their defeated proposals could be endorsed by the Parliament and come back again, they could use their minority power to enforce them by voting against an attempt to turn down what Parliament has proposed.  This does open up real possibilities in certain areas.  From our point of view, unfortunately perhaps, all these three Funds are of such importance to us that it is not easy to see circumstances in which it would be in our interest to take something off one and put it on another, because we tend to benefit to a significant degree from all three.</P>
    <P>It is possible to conceive circumstances in which we, and some other countries, might find certain aspects of expenditure less helpful to us and, though a minority, would be able, having failed in the Council of Ministers, to suggest that the Parliament should take action on it, and then to use our minority power to block a qualified majority decision against that in the Council.  This is now a real possibility under the new proceedings.  In so far as the non-obligatory expenditure is concerned, in so far as one can distinguish between them, and the distinction, as I have said, is highly artificial and dubious, there the Parliament's power is a real power to increase expenditure.  What happens is that each year the Commission fixes what it regards as an appropriate maximum increase in expenditure, taking into account increase in GNP, rates of inflation and needs of the Community.  The Council of Ministers then fixes a budget which <Col N="435" /> can be up to that figure, not more if I understand correctly, but will very often, and if not normally, be less because the Council of Ministers tend to be less generous to the Commission where the Community budget is concerned.</P>
    <P>In so far as there is a difference between the two that difference can be bridged, and, indeed, even exceeded, because in those circumstances it is open to Parliament to add the equivalent of one-half of the maximum expenditure as additional expenditure. For example, if the figure fixed by the Commission for maximum expenditure is a 20 per cent increase and the Council of Ministers, with its customary lack of generosity, voted 15 per cent, Parliament can come along and add 10 per cent to the 15 per cent making it 25 per cent.  That is, add half of the Commission's proposed 20 per cent increase.</P>
    <P>That power is exercised effectively and I believe usefully from this country's point of view.  The additions to expenditure the Parliament has proposed are ones which we on the whole have welcomed and from which we have benefited.  At the moment the position is somewhat clouded and obscured by the fact that the Parliament never accepted the definition by the Council of Ministers of the Regional Fund as obligatory expenditure. This means that the base on which one is working in adding on each year to expenditure, calculating maximum expenditure, is itself disagreed. For the moment what has had to happen is that each year a pragmatic solution has to be found in which the Council of Ministers and the Parliament try and arrive at some agreement which is more than the Council of Ministers think proper of its interpretation of the Regional Fund as obligatory and less than what the Parliament thinks proper on the base of its definition of the Regional Fund as non-obligatory.  It is untidy and unsatisfactory, but it is the compromise that was worked out during our presidency.  It at least enabled the system to proceed and prevented it breaking down.  I, as President, had the somewhat unhappy <Col N="436" /> task of defending to the Parliament in repeated consultations which went on a number of occasions and for long hours, the viewpoint of the Council of Ministers, with which I found myself in disagreement, and trying to arrive at some compromise which was eventually arrived at.</P>
    <P>The Parliament recognised that, while I hope doing my duty loyally by my colleagues on the Council of Ministers and not letting the side down at any point, nonetheless I did endeavour to find a solution satisfactory to Parliament.  Recently, the European Parliament was good enough to recognise this by awarding a gold medal to me in the light of this presidency.  Considering all the trouble I caused them when fighting the battle for the Council of Ministers that showed great tolerance of their part.  That then is roughly speaking the way the system works.  It is somewhat complex and, at the moment, confused by this dispute, which continues and has not been finally resolved, about the status of Regional Fund expenditure.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Robinson and others about the need for the Parliament to gain a legislative role, and I think that the Videl Report proposals, while they clearly went far beyond what many Governments would accept at that time, were on the right lines and the whole idea of a gradual process of moving towards co-decisions is the right kind of approach to this.  We have to be realistic about this.  It is not accepted by other Governments and we have the constitutional decision, as I understand it, in France under which direct elections were found to be constitutional but so long as no additional powers were given to Parliament.  This is a decision which obviously makes difficult an expansion of the powers of the European Parliament in future, certainly there are difficulties in giving it legislative powers because that would require that the French Government, if I understand the French Constitution correctly, would initiate a referendum and get it through the French electorate.</P>

      <P>The Senator is entitled to his view, but I am afraid that in France lack of enthusiasm for the EEC is to be found on both sides of the political spectrum, at the Left and at the Right, and those in the middle find themselves at times somewhat constricted in their freedom of action as a result.</P>
      <P>Our own position was made clear in the Taoiseach's memorandum of November, 1974, in which he said the Irish Government believe that in addition to having the roles suggested earlier in approving the appointment of the European Commission, Parliament should have powers conferred on it in a legislative sphere without which the process of direct elections in 1978 may fail to evoke an appropriate interest amongst the peoples of the Community.  We stand quite clearly on that issue, but we cannot be too optimistic about the speed of progress in this particular area.</P>
      <P>On the question of the date of the direct elections which has been raised, we are hopeful that the deadline will be maintained.  Certainly we will do out part in that respect.  Difficulties may arise in other countries.  I am not familiar with what has been happening during the course of the day in London and cannot therefore make any predictions as to whether one possible obstacle has been removed or aggravated during the course of the negotiations carried on between parties there today.  It could be that arising out of what is happening in London today a possible obstacle could be overcome, and if that were the case it seems to be unlikely that serious obstacles would arise elsewhere.  I think we should therefore gird our loins for European elections some time around the second half of May, 1978.  We have a certain amount of preliminary loin-girding to do in the domestic sphere in the interval between now and then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of working as a team nationally within the European Parliament which Senator Dolan raised, I agree with what has been said by Senator Quinn on this.  If, in fact, it <Col N="438" /> were the practice of the Irish Parliamentarians simply to work as a national team in the sole interests of Ireland rather than seeking to join in the whole exercise of creating a democratic European legislative system, they would simply succeed in being out-voted by something like 40 to one, whatever the proportion is, or 20 to one at present. Such a procedure would be a great mistake.  The correct thing for us to do, and what largely speaking we have done, is for the parties here to associate themselves with like-minded groups in the Parliament and to seek within each of these groups, among other things, to advance the interests of Ireland and to explain why certain proposals which these groups may favour need to be modified in order to protect the interests of this country, and in that way through the groups in Parliament who are relevant bodies to influence the decisions of Parliament.  I think all the Irish representatives have in varying degrees sought to do this and in varying degrees have succeeded in doing this on different occasions.  That is the only effective way in which we can, in so far as it is proper and suitable&mdash;and it is proper and suitable at times&mdash; seek through the Parliament to advance the national interest.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dolan's party has associated itself with another party, strictly with two other parties, as there is one representative from Denmark, but mainly with another party in the European Parliament, the party which in its country represents an expression of nationalism in a very pure form. This has given rise to some difficulties, because while it is one thing to associate in a group with people of a similar broad socio-economic ideology. Christian Democrat or Social Democrat, or&mdash;though we have not such a group in Ireland&mdash;Liberal Democrat, there is an obvious difficulty&mdash;clearly observable even at this distance from Strasbourg&mdash;in two groups associating who are concerned with their respective national interests, and it has to be said that on occasions like the vote on fish the impact of this on the way in which members of Deputy's Dolan's party have had to act, has not necessarily worked out to our <Col N="439" /> advantage.  Where there is a divergence of national interests as between Ireland and France in the case of fish it is too much to hope, with all the efforts made, I am sure, by Deputy Dolan's Party, that they could persuade the much larger number of French nationalists to accept a view which is in the Irish national interest. That particular team do not seem to find it as easy to work in harness with other groups possibly.  I do not want to become controversial, but as he raised the question I thought I was entitled at least to make those comments.</P>
    <P>On the question of the audit board, I am particularly pleased that we have reached this stage.  The very first meeting I attended of the Council of Ministers was one at which something came up as having been agreed already in respect of the powers of the auditors.  The agreement which had been reached was one which seemed to leave them with so little power that I sought to reopen the issue which had up to that point been agreed, but with reluctance, may I say, on the part of Britain and Germany.  Although it was too late then in reopening it to effect a change and to give the then auditors effective powers, I think that in reopening the matter at that stage and raising it, it contributed to the development of thinking in this area, so that we now have this body&mdash;court of auditors&mdash; with more effective powers.  Among the defects in the old system was that the part-time auditors could not, in fact, employ staff except <i>ad hoc</i> and for a stated period, and if the staff they employed for three weeks to go and do a job found that the job took three weeks and three days they simply had to stop and not complete the job and the audit would not be done at all.  This was an absurdity in the old system which I identified and denounced today at that first meeting.  We now have full-time auditors with real powers and there is no longer any obstacle to their examining the accounts within the nation states.  This is very important, because a very large part of Community funds are disbursed by <Col N="440" /> national Governments as agents of the Community.  If abuse occurs, because of the sheer volume of funds involved being distributed in that way, it is more likely to occur within a national system than in Brussels, and any system of control that does not enable the court of auditors to examine thoroughly the disbursal of funds by national Governments as agents of the Commission is ineffective. The changes made there are, I think, of considerable importance and ones that we can strongly support.</P>
    <P>I think that covers all the points that were raised.  If there is anything I have overlooked, perhaps Deputies will remind me of it when I sit down. The mood of the discussion here is one which the Government must take account of, and I am sure that the Taoiseach at the European Council which we will be attending on Friday and Saturday will bear in mind the general mood of the House in its approach to the development of the European Community.</P>

      <P>I very much regret that.  I take the point that we must wherever possible try to ensure that European legislation is brought in at a time when Parliament is not in session. I will make no promise about this because there are obvious constraints on both sides.  It is something that we should take very seriously in the future.</P>

      <P>I welcome this opportunity of drawing the attention of the House to the fact that, although the Supreme Court gave judgment in the McGee case in December, 1973, the effects of that judgment have not been fully implemented, particularly as regards notices issued by the Revenue Commissioners about what goods can be imported.  I refer to two notices which are published by the Revenue Commissioners and are available at ports of entry into this country, for example at airports.  One of them covers the position of Irish residents and the other is a notice for visitors coming here.  The notice for residents is entitled: &ldquo;Ireland&mdash;Notice by the Revenue Commissioners, Customs Guide for Residents.&rdquo;  This notice is operative as from 1st January, 1973, and it is notice No. 962 (revised).  That notice contains a section headed: &ldquo;Prohibitive or Restricted Goods&rdquo; and it goes on:</P>
      <P>Arms, ammunitions, explosives, budgerigars and other birds of the parrot species, contraceptives, dogs and cats from places other than Great Britain, Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, fireworks,...</P>
      <P>The separate customs guide for visitors contains a similar list of prohibitive or restricted goods and includes, again, the prohibition on importing contraceptives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the circumstances it is necessary to recall to the attention of the Members of the House the precise effect of the Supreme Court judgment in the McGee case.  It will be recalled that Mrs. McGee had brought a constitutional action to challenge section 17 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1935, and in particular the prohibition on importation by her of contraceptives into Ireland so that she <Col N="443" /> could use these contraceptives within marriage and avoid the considerable health hazards which would otherwise have caused problems for her, her husband and their family.  In the course of the judgment of the Supreme Court Mr. Justice Henchy said on this issue:</P>
    <P>In my opinion, s.17 violates the guarantee by the State in Art. 40, s. 3, subs. (1), by its laws to protect her personal rights, not only by violating her personal right to privacy in regard to her marital relations but in a wider way by frustrating and making criminal any efforts by her to effectuate the decision of her husband and herself, made responsibly, conscientiously and on medical advice, to avail themselves of a particular contraceptive method so as to ensure her life and health as well as the integrity, security and well-being of her marriage and her family.  Because of the clear unconstitutionality of the section in this respect, I do not find it necessary to deal with the submissions made in support of the claim that the section violates other provisions of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>What stands between Mrs. McGee and the exercise of any constitutional right claimed by her in this case is subs. (3) s. 17.  With that subsection out of the way, her cause of complaint would disappear, because what she wishes to do, namely, to import the required contraceptive by post, would then be legal, for the import, not being for sale, would not be forbidden by subs. (1).  Since s. 17 without subs. (3) can stand as a self-contained entity, independently operable and representing the legislative intent, subs. (3) is capable of being severed and declared unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>The precise wording of section 17 (3) of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1935, is as follows:</P>
    <P>Contraceptives shall be deemed to be included among the goods enumerated and described in the Table of Prohibitions and Restrictions Inwards contained in section <Col N="444" /> 42 of the Customs Consolidation Act, 1876, and the provisions of that Act (as amended or extended by subsequent Acts) relating to the importation of prohibited goods shall apply accordingly.</P>
    <P>This was the legislative provision which entitled&mdash;and indeed required&mdash; the Revenue authorities to list contraceptives as being among prohibited goods.  This was the section expressly struck down by the Supreme Court in the McGee case as not being in conformity with the Constitution, as infringing constitutional rights including the right to marital privacy and as not being part of our law.</P>
    <P>I would draw attention to a brief passage from the judgment of Mr. Justice Walsh in the McGee case where he said as follows:</P>
    <P>As this particular case arose primarily out of the ban on importation, I think in so far as Article 41 is concerned the declaration sought should only go in respect of subsection (3) of section 17 of the Act of 1935.  That does not necessarily mean that the provisions as to sale in subsection (1) cannot be impugned. If, in the result, notwithstanding the deletion of subsection (3), the prohibition on sale had the effect of leaving a position where contraceptives were not reasonably available for use within marriage then that particular prohibition must also fall.  However, for the moment I do not think it is necessary to make any declaration in respect of that.</P>
    <P>I would submit that when the highest court in our land makes such a clear and unambiguous ruling about the unconstitutionality of a section of our law and strikes down that provision as contravening basic constitutional rights, then there is a clear duty on the Government and in this instance on the Revenue Commissioners to ensure that all steps are taken to make the necessary changes or amendments to any notices in order to make it clear what the rights of the citizens are.  This, indeed, is required by Article 40, Section 3 of the Constitution which imposes on the State a duty to defend and vindicate the personal <Col N="445" /> rights of the citizen.  One of these personal rights is the right to marital privacy.</P>
    <P>I should like, first of all, to consider the implications of the fact that the notice which is produced for residents was not amended.  The effect could be that people who are not very well informed on the law could believe that they would be stopped if they tried to import contraceptives for their private use, and this could give rise to unnecessary tension.  It could give rise to confusion.  It could create or perpetrate a climate of fear and apprehension in this regard.</P>
    <P>Secondly, as regard visitors, this notice may be picked up by them when they arrive in this country or, indeed, sought by them before they come here because they want to know what kind of goods they can bring into the country. This must have a deterrent effect. It must continue the idea that Ireland is still a State whose laws are dominated by a Catholic Church influence which still prohibits the importation of contraceptives.  Foreign visitors might feel that they would be searched and embarrassed and have their own sense of privacy invaded by having these items confiscated on coming to Ireland.</P>
    <P>This is, I think, a matter which shows a lack of endeavour by the Government to ensure that the full impact of the Supreme Court decision is reflected in an administrative way by amending these particular notices. I hope that this was only an oversight. It is hard to understand how an oversight can have lasted from December, 1973, until March, 1977.  But if one takes a kind view, then one has to regard it as an oversight or, alternatively, as an economic measure in using up old notices.  There must have been a lot of notices to use up if, as I say, they were using them up over a period of more than three years.  I would not regard this as a justification, because we are talking about basic constitutional rights, about the need for people to be properly and carefully informed about their rights, of the need for the Government to clarify, defend and vindicate these personal rights.</P>
    <P>There is another possible view, that is, that the Government did not want <Col N="446" /> to fully implement the decision in the McGee case and in the absence of success in changing the legislation through the Oireachtas to amend the law there was an attempt just to leave things as they were and not to implement fully the result of the McGee case.  If one examines the debates on both sides of the House in the Dáil when the Government measure was introduced in 1974 to amend the law &mdash;a measure which was subsequently defeated&mdash;there were expressions of concern about the situation following the McGee case.  There were calls on all sides of the House for the necessity to change the law following the McGee case; and yet, as we know, the law was not changed.  In the absence of a legislative capacity to change the law, was there a sort of collusion in not fully implementing the law?  If so, I would find that particularly regrettable because it would be evidence of a Government which was not subscribing in a full sense to the implementation and upholding of the rule of law, evidence of a Government which was not championing, defending and vindicating the personal rights of the citizen which the Government are constitutionally obliged to do.</P>
    <P>I have stated that of yesterday these two notices were picked up in Dublin Airport, a notice for visitors and a notice for residents.  Clearly they do not conform to the judgment of the Supreme Court in the McGee case, because they do not advise Irish residents properly that they are, in fact, legally entitled to import contraceptives for their private use and that visitors are similarly entitled to bring contraceptives into this country for their own use.  Indeed, they can also bring them in to distribute freely.</P>
    <P>One of the loopholes following the McGee case is that, although it is still prohibited to import for sale under section 17 (1) of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1935, it is not prohibited to import for distribution and therefore any quantity of contraceptives can be imported for distribution.  This may very well cause certain fears and alarms from people who feel that this would be an undesirable situation.  I wish those people would examine the <Col N="447" /> law carefully and see that there is, even from that perspective, a very strong reason to sit down and amend the law and bring in a rational and reasonable proposal.  The Supreme Court cannot legislate.  It cannot cover all different contingencies when it makes a decision; it must address itself to the particular problem before it.</P>
    <P>In the McGee case in December, 1973, the problem was a married woman who could not import contraceptives for her private use within marriage, but the effect of the Supreme Court judgment is not to confine importation to married people.  The Supreme Court cannot do that.  It is not a legislative body.  Married or unmarried and of any age, any person coming into Ireland can import contraceptives. They cannot import them for sale, but they can import them for private use or they can import them for distribution in whatever quantities they like and as often as they like.  Perhaps a realisation of this situation may increase the support for the rationalisation in a legislative sense of the whole position relating to the availability of contraceptives and to family planning in this country.  I await with interest the explanation of the Minister for Finance of the situation whereby these notices are still distributed at ports of entry into this country more than three years after the McGee case itself.</P>

      <P>I am sorry to say that Senator Robinson is wrong on two grounds in relation to the implications which she had made&mdash;one a legal ground and the other a factual one.  As a lawyer, Senator Robinson is surely aware that the Minister for Finance bears no responsibility for the administration of the customs law.  By statute that function is vested in the Revenue Commissioners. The Minister for Finance, for very good and valid reasons, may not interfere with the Revenue Commissioners in their administration of the law&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which must be neutral.  The factual error is that, in <Col N="448" /> fact, the Revenue Commissioners have amended this notice and I should be glad to give an amended version to Senator Robinson and she will see that the word &ldquo;contraceptive&rdquo; does not appear under the list of prohibited or restricted goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>These two notices were picked up at Dublin Airport yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that.  To reassure Senator Robinson, I should like her to know that the Revenue Commissioners have available pamphlets which are more up to date than those which she received yesterday in Dublin Airport.  These pamphlets are not, of course, statements of the law&mdash; they do not purport to be.  They are pamphlets that are issued to assist the general public, and travellers in particular, in relation to the operation of Customs laws.  Hundreds of thousands of them are, in fact, printed.</P>
      <P>With reference to the document to which Senator Robinson has taken exception, I understand that the number printed before the McGee case was 500,000.  These are then distributed to air lines, shipping lines, travel agents, to innumerable outlets; and the Customs officers of various stations have them for distribution.  I am sure that it will be readily appreciated that once these are distributed the Revenue Commissioners have little practical control over either their further distribution, their retention or, indeed, their amendment if, as can happen from time to time, there is an alteration in the law while stocks of previously printed documents are still in existence.  The Revenue Commissioners make the changes in the guide as soon as is practicable after changes are made in the law and they then distribute the most up-to-date pamphlets to the agencies which I have mentioned.  That is as much as they can do in the circumstances in relation to the informal guides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Customs officers, apart from the informal guide, are fully aware of the legal position.  There is another document which is a much weightier document and much less readable, <Col N="449" /> called the Customs Tariff, which is an exceedingly heavy volume.  I do not think many travellers would thank us for distributing this to them&mdash;in many cases it would be much heavier than their personal luggage.  That is automatically amended as soon as changes are made in the law.  Therefore all Customs officers who are supervising the entry of goods at certain points of entry are fully advised and, having been fully advised, would not seize any article the importation of which was permitted.</P>
    <P>Once again, I should like to assure Senator Robinson that so far as it is practicable to do so the Revenue Commissioners take steps to advise the public as to what their rights are, but we have no absolute control over the documents which have already been issued.  The Revenue Commissioners would, as best they could, take care to ensure that no out-of-date document was issued by them.  Of course, <Col N="450" /> as the documents look very much alike&mdash;Senator Robinson and others will see that at a glance&mdash;there is always the possibility that somebody would hand out a document which is out of date.  That should not happen. I have no doubt that Senator Robinson in bringing up this matter in the House today will help to alert all those involved to the necessity of ensuring that documents which are possibly out of date are not issued.  Somehow or other, I think that the question&mdash; it was involved in the McGee case&mdash;of principle and people's rights under the law are pretty well known, and it does not require a little piece of paper from a Customs officer or an airline to let people, certainly residents, know their rights in the matter. It has been hitting the headlines for rather a long time.</P>
