      <P>I have notice from Senator Kennedy that on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for immediate arrangements to be put in hands to rebuild the Model Schools, Limerick.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken from 8 p.m. to 8.30 p.m., or earlier if the business ordered is concluded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 1 to 9 and No. 11.  It is not proposed to take No. 10 this week.  Items Nos. 1 to 7 are all concerned in one way or another, with the establishment of Joint Committees. It is necessary for us to dispose of this question and pass it back to the Dáil before the Dáil rises, which it is anticipated will be at the end of next week.  It is a matter for the House to decide the manner in which to discuss motions 1 to 7, whether it will give us a better scope for debate to discuss them separately or whether we can discuss the question of committees and their establishment as one debate.  I do not wish to impose either view on the House but I should be glad <Col N="220" /> to know what the wishes of the House are.</P>
      <P>In regard to No. 8, the Postal and Telecommunications Services Bill, I understand that there will be Government amendments to it and also possibly amendments from the Opposition.  While I have no desire to make undue haste I should like to point out to the House that if amendments are to be made it would be necessary to return them to the Dáil before the Dáil rises.</P>

      <P>Senator Lanigan is experienced enough to know that the Minister would wish to have all Stages today but I do not want in any way to inhibit the discussion by the House of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Bill.  There is the need to get it back to the Dáil.  I might suggest that perhaps it would be sufficient to take the Committee Stage tomorrow morning to give time for the tabling of amendments rather than take all Stages today.</P>

      <P>Firstly, as regards the setting up of the Joint Committees, naturally we have all been pressing for the setting up of these committees and I am very glad to see that a large number of them have come on the Order Paper today.  I notice that one not mentioned on the Order Paper today is the proposed Joint Committee on marriage law and matrimonial and family law matters to which attention was drawn in the recent debate on the question of divorce a couple of weeks ago.  I am very anxious to know when it is proposed to set up this committee as it is very important and the sooner it gets off the ground the better. I am not decrying the importance of the other committees, but this one should not be left out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the Postal and Telecommunications Services Bill, I would be anxious to have an opportunity, if possible, to put down an amendment and at least to discuss it in some detail.  All <Col N="221" /> Stages should not be rushed through the House today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnRobb" hpid="Mr. Robb Mr. Robb">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>

      <P>I noted the Leader of the House left open for the views of Members of this House how we might discuss the motions to set up the committees before us.  I welcome and appreciate his openness in that regard.  Personally, I would hope that we might adopt a slightly different approach from the other House and not just have one debate and then, as would be necessary, have separate decisions on the motions.  I would prefer and indeed urge upon the House that we should discuss each of these committees, not necessarily at any great length, but separately because there are separate issues that arise in relation to them.  Some of us, as members of the committees previously, have had separate experiences that we might wish to refer to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We did not have in this House the opportunity for a full discussion on committees and reform of the House which the other House did as a substantive motion at an earlier stage.  Therefore, there is a good reason for us to depart from the procedure adopted in the other House and to focus discussions on each of the committees in turn.  On the question of establishment of the committees, I should like to join very strongly with the views expressed by Senator McGuinness and Senator Robb and express my unhappiness at the fact that the major Joint Committee on Marital Reform has not been brought before us.  I join with them in asking the Leader of the House to ensure that this is done as a matter of urgency because this committee must get under way well before Deputies depart which, presumably, most Deputies will do in one way or the other for the month of August.  I hope the committee will be well established and have got into their <Col N="222" /> workload before then and could resume early in September.</P>
    <P>The Postal and Telecommunications Services Bill which was raised on the Order of Business is a very substantial measure which affects more employees than any other measure which has come before the Seanad in my parliamentary experience.  It is a Bill which we should not rush, we should consider it very carefully and not put any pre-emptive time on it, but rather let the debate develop. Bearing in mind the view of the Leader of the House and the reality that if we want to have amendments accepted here approved by the Dáil we must complete our discussion of the Bill before the Dáil rises, nevertheless it would be better to sit additional days if necessary to have a full discussion because in the other House the Bill did not receive a full discussion on Committee Stage.  Certain important sections were not considered on Committee Stage because of the way in which the Business in that House was ordered. It is important that we take enough time to discuss it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of what has been said, would it be possible for the House to sit next Tuesday because with the business ordered for today, the Postal and Telecommunications Services Bill might not get the full reading necessary for it? If we did sit next Tuesday to deal with that legislation, it might suit the House.</P>

      <P>With reference to the Postal and Telecommunications Services Bill, my party are extremely concerned that all the necessary time should be given to have it properly debated.  If possible, agreement should be reached either in the House or outside it with the Minister about amendments.  The Labour Party group at the moment are sitting in conclave discussing their various attitudes to various sections of this Bill.  We have commitments to certain people in the Post Office service to which we will give the fullest possible consideration. My party are in favour of sitting on Tuesday of next week to try to facilitate the widest possible debate on the Postal and Telecommunications Services Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the points raised on the Order of Business, I would like to reply as follows.  Firstly, in regard to the committee on marital breakdown, I am conscious of the recent debate in this House on the problem of divorce and of the amendment which was carried unanimously in which this House urged the early setting up and the early reporting by a committee of marriage breakdown.  I am anxious that this should be implemented as soon as possible. However, there are discussions going on between the Government Chief Whip and the Opposition Chief Whip and while I would hope that those discussions would end in agreement, I do not think that we should do anything precipitate here that might prevent such an agreement. It will certainly be open to us here in the House and I do not think, on the other hand, that we should do anything to delay it.  It has been the custom that the expediency motions in regard to committees are usually initiated in another place and then dealt with here.  The present case is one in which, if there was undue delay in another place in regard to the passing of the expediency motions, we would have to give very serious consideration to the question of introducing the expediency motions here and then sending the message to the Dáil asking it to concur with us.  That will certainly be kept in mind within the next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Bill, I note the interest of Senators in having a thorough discussion on Committee Stage. Senator Robinson said that it is necessary to recognise the constraint that if the Committee Stage is to be meaningful, if the Seanad is to be able to amend this Bill, it is necessary for Committee Stage to conclude in time for the matter to be reconsidered by the Dáil.  While we could certainly consider the question of sitting next Tuesday, I would be a little anxious if we decided not to take advantage of time available tomorrow in order to get on to Committee Stage if Second Stage is completed.  I might point out that it is not necessary for us to make that decision now.  The decision with regard to when Committee Stage of this Bill will be taken <Col N="224" /> will be made at the conclusion of Second Stage.  We will know then how much time we have used on Second Stage and we will be in a better position to make the decision.</P>
    <P>In regard to the discussion of items Nos. 1 to 7 &mdash; which are all concerned with the establishment of committees &mdash; Senator Robinson has expressed a wish for separate debates.  Nobody has made a plea for a unified debate.  I have certainly no objection to acceding to this request but I take it that everybody will take a firm pledge to avoid repetition and that we will not find the same general points made on each of the seven motions.</P>

    <P>(3)  That members of Seanad Éireann who are representatives in the Assembly of the European Communities be notified of meetings and be allowed to attend and take part in proceedings without having a right to vote;</P>

    <P>(8)  That five members of the Joint Committee shall form a quorum of whom at least one shall be a member of Dáil Éireann and at least one shall be a member of Seanad Éireann.</P>
    <P>Items Nos. 1 to 7 are concerned with the establishment of Joint Committees and in some cases with the re-establishment of committees already agreed.  In others there are important new departures.  The first thing I should like to say in regard to this general question relates to the fact that there is no Minister present today.  It is customary with regard to matters of this sort for the Leader of the House formally to move the motion and then for a Minister to make a speech outlining what is proposed and for a Minister ultimately to reply to the debate.  The view has been taken that the question of the Joint Committees, the question of joint structure as it affects the Seanad, is a matter for the Seanad and, accordingly, with regard to these motions I will be making the proposition to the House; I will reply to the debate and deal with any points raised.  The absence of a Minister on these items is not a slight on the Seanad.  It is a compliment to the Seanad, recognising that the Seanad itself is best qualified to discuss these matters.</P>
    <P>Motion No. 1 is concerned with the standing committee for secondary legislation under the EEC.  This, by now, might well be considered a permanent committee, as permanent in its effect as the Committee on Procedure and Privileges or any other of our permanent committees. In this particular instance it has a two-fold mandate, to examine all secondary legislation originating from the <Col N="229" /> European Economic Community and, secondly, to examine the question of the dual mandate.  Both of these are important. Senators will note from the terms of the motion that they are being asked to agree to here, that the motion does allow for members who are not formally appointed to the committee by the Seanad to attend as observers.  This is a reflection of the fact that Senators may have a particular interest and also of the fact that the proceedings of a committee such as this are a highly educational process. Those who are members of the committee or who attend as observers are thereby in a position to learn a great deal about the working of the EEC and of the effects that decisions made in Brussels and in other centres of Community activity have on us here.  I recommend the motion that asks that seven Senators should join with 18 Deputies to form this committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamRyan" hpid="Mr. W. Ryan Mr. W. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the setting up of these committees.  Although a number of them have been in existence for a good many years there are a few new committees. Some committees have been changed.  The Library Committee and the Restaurant Committee now come under a Joint Services Committee and it is high time that that committee was set up because we must have a great restaurant management here who are able to operate for so long without a committee.  I hope that the committees will be a success but from my experience here over the years I have my doubts.  We are all very keen on being appointed to the different committees but after one or two meetings it is very hard to get a quorum for most of them.  I hope that does not happen in this case.  As Senator Robinson said, with both Houses going into recess in the next few weeks, the committees should get down to work right through the month of July and get something done before they go on holidays in August.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Based on my experience of committees that have already been set up I am worried that our party, the main Opposition party, are not getting the representation which we should get.  If we go strictly according to numbers, which we have <Col N="230" /> been doing for the Committee of Selection, the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and the Land Committee, we have not the membership that we should have.  Most of these committees will consist of seven Senators, two of which will belong to the main Opposition party against five others.  I am not saying this is the fault of the Fine Gael or Labour Parties but that is the rule.  Unless we get three Senators out of seven, to which we are well entitled, we will be very slow to accept anything on these committees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the motion to re-establish this Joint Committee on EEC secondary legislation.  It is a sobering thought for all of us that the last report issued by the Joint Committee on EEC secondary legislation was dated 13 May 1981.  Therefore it is more than two years since the Irish parliamentary watchdog committee on EEC legislation examined and reported to both Houses on EEC draft legislation and draft proposals which affect every aspect of our economic and social life at present.</P>
      <P>There have been the unusual circumstances of three general elections in quick succession but they merely highlight a weakness that was there anyway, the difficulty after any general election and reconstitution of the two Houses of ensuring that committees are re-established not within a matter of, at the earliest, six months but rather within a matter of weeks.  Without wanting to push this point too far we can look at the comparable situation in the Westminster Parliament where they had a recent general election and yet both Houses are busy re-establishing their main committees already or have already done so, a comparable experience at least of another relatively similar legislative Chamber and its approach to the establishment of committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the establishment of the first Joint Committee in 1973 there has been an inordinate delay in re-establishing the Joint Committee after each general election. Although I take the point that the Leader of the House, Senator Dooge, was making, that this committee has now become a permanent committee, I would <Col N="231" /> reinforce that point by saying it has not just become a permanent parliamentary committee, it has a statutory function under the European Communities (Amendment) Act, 1973.  We must establish it and it should be doing its job of examining and reporting on the implementation here of EEC legislation by Statutory Instrument.  We give Irish Ministers very wide powers, much wider powers than they had hitherto to implement and therefore we should also be examining the manner in which they exercise those powers.</P>
    <P>The main points that I want to make on the re-establishment of this Joint Committee are on a broader political front.  We can ill afford to neglect the decision making and the legislative process in Brussels.  If we do not have an active, political Joint Committee on EEC Legislation we are failing to have a really democratic impact on the legislative process because we all know that although the European Parliament is now directly elected and although it has increased its budgetary power it does not have legislative powers or decision making as such.  Therefore, the burden is on national parliaments, particularly on a country like Ireland which is very substantially affected by the decisions taken at EEC level.  We must be much more conscious of the importance of having a parliamentary input into the activities of the Joint Committee.  I hope, as Senator Willie Ryan has said, that this committee, once the motions are through both Houses and the Members have been or are already selected by the groupings to participate, would get under way, have a number of meetings before the end of July and come back in early September in order to catch up on a substantial backlog.</P>
    <P>There are hundreds of draft regulations and draft directives, or regulations and directives, which have been passed without any scrutiny which are at least, technically, on the agenda of the Joint Committee.  There are, as every Member knows, extremely important decisions or proposals for decision within the European Community context.  I do not want <Col N="232" /> to get into those because I would be getting into the substance of the committee's work.  They are of vital political interest and the time that has passed without the Joint Committee meeting perhaps undermined its significance to some extent.  I recall the debates prior to the establishment of the first Joint Committee.  We all felt at that time that it was absolutely vital to have an Irish parliamentary committee scrutinising EEC legislation or otherwise the structures of the Community were, first of all, not fully democratic and, secondly, potentially of considerable danger to us and likely to overlook the special development needs, the particular aspects of the Irish economy and agriculture, which a parliamentary committee is in a very good position to comment and report on.</P>
    <P>Turning to the actual terms of reference themselves.  I welcome a number of changes that have been made in the terms of reference.  In particular, I welcome a new provision referred to by Senator Dooge under paragraph (2) that in the absence from a particular meeting of a member of the Joint Committee that an alternative can be there, to use the new language which was used to some extent in the New Ireland Forum, a person can take the place of an absent member.  That new provision for alternate membership is important and should allow fuller participation for Members of this House whether they are formally appointed as members of the committee or by showing an interest can regularly sit in and vote as alternate members.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the continuing provision to notify and involve the members of the European Parliament who happen to be Members of this House at any time.  It is very important to have that institutional link, particularly as one of the terms of reference of the committee is to look at the dual mandate.  In particular I welcome paragraph (4) which is another new provision in the terms of reference:</P>
    <P>That the Joint Committee shall, subject to the consent of the Minister for the Public Service, have power to engage the services of persons with <Col N="233" /> specialist or technical knowledge to assist it for the purpose of particular enquiries;</P>
    <P>The experience of Members who served on that Committee has been that it is most important that the committee have available to them expertise in the areas being studied.  Whether it is a matter of a common transport policy and there is the possibility of engaging an expert to work for the committee and report to them, whether it is a particularly technical legal issue that arises such as the draft directive on product liability, whatever issue it is, the committee must be able to draw on the resource of specialist backup. It is a more flexible and I hope, a more positive provision enabling the committee to select their experts rather than being tied to one full-time expert on everything and to commission the expertise by having the resources to do so.</P>
    <P>Since the Leader of the House has taken upon himself the burden of replying to this debate I would like to ask how it is envisaged this will work.  Is it envisaged that the Joint Committee will have a sufficient budget to ensure that during the year members of the committee can decide to commission reports and studies and expert work by individuals who have this expertise and can put it at the disposal of the Joint Committee?  If every individual decision had to go for the consent of the Minister for the Public Service the time lag might be so substantial between the decision of the committee to examine something and the need to get the consent on every single decision of that kind if expertise was to be commissioned, it might mean the committee could not examine the matter within a relevant time.  One of the important political functions of the Joint Committee is to separate some of the technical and less strategic measures and to concentrate on the key political proposals and ensure in that context that their reports are available well in time before the relevant decision of the Council of Ministers or whatever.</P>
    <P>I would like the Leader of the House in his reply to explain why the membership <Col N="234" /> has been reduced by a factor of one. Previously the committee had 26 members, I think I am correct in saying 18 Members of the Dáil and eight Members of this House.  We have now reduced the number to seven Members of this House, and I bear in mind with considerable sympathy the viewpoint expressed by Senator Ryan.  It is important that the main Opposition party be substantially, not just mathematically, represented on a working committee of this House.  That has a very important value and I would prefer to see the committee enlarged to allow that very full representation by the Opposition.  There may be some virtue in an odd number &mdash; 25 instead of 26 &mdash; but I just note that the committee membership has been reduced by one.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to ask the Leader of the House whether it is his intention before the Seanad rises at the end of our parliamentary session this summer to ensure the tabling of the necessary amendment to our Standing Orders so that if the Joint Committee, faced with this very substantial and important back-log of work, reports that certain proposals at Community level should be debated in this House we would resume the position of ensuring that within a set period, eight days after the tabling of a motion noting the report and calling for a debate, the debate itself will take place. Can the proposal to amend our Standing Orders in that regard be tabled, unless this matter is dealt with in a permanent fashion which is just possible?</P>
    <P>It is important that we have the capacity which we had in the past to debate on the floor of the House whatever reports members of the Joint Committee are highlighting and seeking a debate on in the Chamber because this reinforces the political role of the Joint Committee. The one qualified criticism I have of the Joint Committee since their establishment is that they have not played a sufficient political role despite the fact that the measures that they have been considering have enormous impact on the economic and social lives of citizens of this country.  Therefore, it would be helpful to ensure that we will have a number of opportunities throughout the year to discuss, <Col N="235" /> in this House, the reports of the Joint Committee when adopted and published.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Robinson on the last point she made, that is the reintroduction of the procedure we have had previously which provided that when a Joint Committee specifically recommended or asked for a debate on a report the House would accept that recommendation and provide time for the report to be debated.  One thing that has been commented upon on many occasions about various reports that have been made by Joint Committees is the fact that they were not debated by either House.  It will be unhelpful and will demoralise members of Joint Committees if they feel that their good work is never going to have any effect, is never going to be debated by the House.  The best way of ensuring that it will be so debated is to have the procedure which we had previously, which provided that the House must debate it within a certain length of time.  On the other hand, that procedure should be used with discretion because it would defeat the purpose if every Joint Committee asked for every report to be debated by the House.  In that case we would spend most of our time debating reports, some of which might not be very important.  My experience was mainly with the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies and we asked on a number of occasions that particular reports be debated because we felt they were of considerable importance.  On the other hand, we examined other State-sponsored bodies and found that they were doing their work quite well and we did not feel it necessary for the House to debate the report so we did not make the recommendation.  It must be used with discretion, or otherwise its purpose would be defeated.  I support the suggestion of Senator Robinson that we should have the same procedure in this House as we had in the past.</P>

      <P>It is not before its time that this committee were set up because <Col N="236" /> it is of vital importance that they get down to the work which is extremely necessary because that is the only opportunity that the national Parliament has to deal with proposed legislation which might come before the European Parliament. One of the problems that we have had over the years because this committee have not been meeting is that legislation has gone through the European Parliament but we have had no input and the members of the European Parliament themselves have only debated the Bills once they were presented to them.  In other words, they had no input into the legislation as it was going through the Parliament.  It is essential that this committee be set up.  I am not too sure how the committee when set up will be able to catch up with the workload that is likely to be put before them.  I would hate to be the civil servants or whoever would have to go through the many tons of materials from the European Parliament that must have built up over the last 18 months and try and take from the great bulk of paper the draft legislation that will be of vital importance to Ireland. The suggestion is that the committee be set up and that the work start at the beginning of the new session, but that might be too far in the distance.  Once this committee are set up &mdash; we hope before the Dáil and Seanad go into recess &mdash; they should meet immediately to find out the workload they face.  They might have to sit throughout the summer to catch up on the workload so that by the time the new session starts in September or October they will be reasonably up to date and then will at least be starting to deal with legislation which might be forthcoming in the near future in the European Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Senator Willie Ryan that the representation of our party as the main party in Opposition has been cut down.  I am not too sure why the numbers on the committee have been cut.  I can see on a percentage basis technically why our representation has been cut but I do not agree that it should have been because I cannot see what difference it makes whether Fianna Fáil have one seat extra or fewer on the committee.  The <Col N="237" /> committee would operate better with a reasonable level of membership from the Opposition party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnRobb" hpid="Mr. Robb Mr. Robb">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to raise the point that was made by Senator Willie Ryan in relation to the effectiveness of Joint Committees.  In the short time I have been here it seems there is a great deal of difficulty in apportioning time and energy appropriately with regard to the work that must be done by Deputies and Senators.</P>
      <P>I happen to be in a particularly privileged position, not representing anyone and therefore with no re-entry problems. For those who have re-entry problems one must be realistic and practical and understand the tremendous pressure. This needs to be emphasised.  The public at large do not appreciate enough the tremendous pressures under which Deputies and Senators who have to seek re-election are under at constituency level.  If one makes a contribution from the floor of the Seanad or the floor of the Dáil then there is some feed-back in relation to the political prospects in one's own constituency.  The sort of work about which one is talking in relation to Joint Committees such as this involves a great deal of time-consuming effort and much hidden effort which does not result in a response at local level which is easily measured.  Therefore, I would suggest that Senator Ryan may have been indirectly indicating once again the need to look at the whole Irish electoral system, the effect of clienteleism and even having a fresh look at proportional representation.</P>
      <P>The work that is done in committees is vitally important and yet one must ask in relation to that work to make it effective whether our system at the moment militates in favour of or against its success in terms of constructive contribution.  In that context I would be very concerned about what will happen to the Joint Committee on family law and marital breakdown. I take the reassurances we have received from the Leader of the House, but I am anxious that we do not put the setting up of that Joint Committee on the long finger.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="238" /> Paragraph (4) bears out the appeal made by Senator Robinson last autumn about the need for this House to consider more imaginative use of its time.  I think at that stage she alluded to the need for select committees and for them to be able to draw in evidence from people who are outside this House.  In that respect I suggest that whenever this committee are set up very strong consideration should be given to the implications of the EEC legislation in as far as it affects Northern Ireland and in as far as this island is one island with at present one Legislature and one Assembly.  I would like to see the committee addressing themselves to the need to engage the services of persons from the North of Ireland as well as from the Irish Republic in order to put the European dimension of our parliamentary and political thinking into its proper perspective.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Eoin Ryan about the need for the accountability of this committee to the Seanad and the Dáil and also the need for the Seanad and the Dáil to ensure that the committee make their reports on a regular basis so that we will know what is going on and we will begin to understand better the European legislation as it affects us.</P>
    <P>I summarise by saying that there is a need to ask ourselves why the Joint Committees have not been effective in the past.  Is there something inherent in the political system which militates against their effectiveness?  Secondly, there is the need to consider Northern Ireland as well as the Irish Republic in relation to the problems under discussion and, thirdly, we must emphasise the need for accountability and also the right of reporting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very grateful to those Members who have contributed to the debate on this particular committee established by motion No. 1 on the Order Paper.  There are a number of points on which I should comment in concluding. A number of Senators have raised the general question of the difficulties in regard to committees.  Senator Willie Ryan and Senator Robb both raised the question of quorum difficulties, the diftee' <Col N="239" /> ficulty of establishing a large number of committees and the difficulty of getting a quorum, and not just a quorum but getting sufficient Members to take an interest and put in the hard, slogging work required.  This underlines the fact that when we in this House and those in the other House make these decisions and say, &ldquo;Oh yes, we are going to have Dáil reform and we are going to have Seanad reform.  We are going to set up a committee on this and a committee on that&rdquo;, we have to realise the implications of what we are taking on when we do this, because nothing could be more harmful to the working of the Houses of the Oireachtas than to change towards a system which is more committee-oriented and then not to operate the committees effectively.</P>
      <P>There is a second difficulty we have had with regard to committees in the past which we will probably have in a more intensive fashion in regard to committees in the future.  This is the question of the staffing of committees.  A great deal of the problems of the operation of the committees which we have had in the past has arisen from the fact that these committees and their chairmen have been unable to obtain the staffing that was required. Senator Robinson in particular raised the question of staffing by experts as is allowed for under paragraph (4), of this motion and expressed the hope that perhaps arrangements could be made so that they would not have to get in each case the authority of the Minister for the Public Service.  She was very anxious about the delay that was concerned here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to all matters like this, there are certain steps to be followed.  There must be the authority for the hiring of these experts.  We can ensure that that authority exists by passing this motion today.  Secondly, the finance must be made available and finally there must be authority for the individual appointment. Under present circumstances, the delay is much more likely to occur with regard to getting a line in the budget rather than in the appointment of an individual.  I suggest that this difficulty can best be avoided if the members of the committee <Col N="240" /> as soon as they assemble consider not just the question of what expert they want for this, or what expert they want for that, but making an estimate of the amount of money that would be required for the hiring of experts in order to carry out their work efficiently, and they should despatch whatever is the result of that particular calculation to the Minister for the Public Service and to the Minister for Finance as quickly as possible.  The time that it takes to get a reply will give them ample time for going into the question of what particular experts are required. That is the essential point rather than the point that is mentioned in the motion about the authority for individuals.</P>
    <P>A general point that arose with regard to committees is the question of the debating of the reports of these committees. I join with Senator Robinson in deploring the fact that this has been inadequate in the past.  Senator Eoin Ryan also adverted to this point.  He joined with Senator Robinson in hoping that there would be an early debate when a recommendation for a debate was made. He indicated that we have to avoid the unreasonable position that debates are called for with such frequency that it interferes unduly with the other business of the House.  There is a point that there has not been a report since 1981.  Let us get a report from the committee and let us see how we will succeed in getting a debate on the floor of the House on that report, whether it has a specific recommendation or not, and see if we can get a <i>modus vivendi.</i>  I do not think we should rush immediately to amend Standing Orders on this point.  We might give our informal procedures a chance first.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of the numbers on this committee, the numbers are 18 members from the Dáil and seven members from the Seanad.  I do not know on what basis that distribution was drawn up but it does, I think, allow the Seanad marginally more members relative to the size of the Seanad than it gives the Dáil relative to the size of the Dáil.  I do not know how the fractions turn out.  I have put forward the point repeatedly and I put it to the present Taoiseach since he <Col N="241" /> took office that some of the difficulties that we have already been discussing in regard to the question of the difficulties of a quorum, difficulties in regard to the availability of people for committee work, might perhaps be mitigated if Senators were used more in regard to committee work.  I have put that point forward and I will put that point forward again, but I hope my fellow Senators do not let me down in this campaign by not turning up when they are appointed to various Joint Committees.  The best thing we can do is to prepare for the question of numbers when this question comes round next of trying to get an increased Seanad representation.  I am talking about representation for the whole Seanad now.  The Senators who are appointed to the large number of committees that are going to be set up should go in and do such a good job that the Ministers will say &ldquo;Let us have more people like this and our committee system will work.&rdquo;  I put the House on notice in regard to that.</P>
    <P>Senator Willie Ryan has made the point that the choice of the number seven has created a particular difficulty in regard to the way in which we assign numbers among the groupings in this House.  The way in which this has operated in the past is that it is normal for the Clerk Assistant of the House to take the number of the committee and work out what the appropriate numbers should be and discuss this with the leaders of the various groupings and with the Whips.  It is customary that on any committee where there is an odd number the Government should have a majority. That has been the case down through the years.  We have suffered from that in Opposition.  In the last Seanad the numbers in this house were virtually equal as Senator Willie Ryan, as Whip, knows. Yet we assented to the fact that on a committee of seven the Government should have four and the Opposition had three on every committee &mdash; and not to just chair them.  This was accepted.  This leaves the position that the Opposition in the case of a Joint Committee of seven are entitled to three members.  This is where the arithmetic is most unfortunate <Col N="242" /> because if you work out how to divide three seats proportionately you find that the Fianna Fáil Party are entitled to 2.48 seats and the Independent grouping are entitled to 0.52 seats.  These, I understand, are the figures.  This is a real difficulty, and I agree with Senator Willie Ryan that it would be unfair under these circumstances if on every particular committee, that just because Fianna Fáil do not have that little .02 that brings them from 1.48 to 1.50 they cannot get three Senators on every single committee.  In the discussions on this it will be necessary to take the committees as a whole.  The difficulty here is that if we take each committee and make the decision on each committee it certainly would be unfair to the Fianna Fáil group.  What should be done is that the committee should be taken as a whole and that we would see that justice is done overall.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned that point because it was raised in the debate and we can attempt to satisfy justice without causing the complete demise of Senator Brendan Ryan.</P>
      <P>A couple of other points were raised in the discussion.  Senator Robb raised the point that there was the difficulty that it may be that people would respond to this call of mine to go into the committees and work very hard.  What happens to them as politicians then?  Does this mean that they will tend to work themselves out of their seats in the Seanad?  This may be a very real difficulty.  If we do what we should do in regard to the debating of reports of committees, in this House, then they will be the best informed and they should at least shine in these debates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to mention another point. We have already given permission in this House for the broadcasting of our proceedings. In any decisions we make in <Col N="243" /> regard to the broadcasting we should not merely confine it to the floor of the House.  In regard to major committees and particularly major debates in major committees the arrangements which are made with RTE in regard to broadcasting should extend to these also.  This might help to mitigate this difficulty.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan raised the question that this committee is an extremely important one and there are the difficulties of keeping the exchange of information between the Houses of the Oireachtas here, between the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers. This is an extremely important point and something we must keep in mind.</P>
    <P>Senator Robb mentioned that in all our deliberations whether in this committee or the Council of Ministers or the European Parliament, we should not think too narrowly, that we should think also of Northern Ireland.  I can assure him that that is being done.  It was my own experience while taking part in the Council of Ministers in regard to certain discussions where in fact we were acting as the Legislature for the Community that I found myself on a number of points in sharp division with my British colleague but in complete unity with Mr. Ian Paisley's point of view as expressed at Strasbourg.  For example, in regard to so many matters of agriculture, the Northern Ireland farmer makes his representations to Westminster where they are completely lost amongst the greater interest of British agriculture.  In the European Parliament, and in the Council of Ministers, in regard to agriculture and many other points, it is the Irish representatives who are fighting the Ulster cause and that cause is not forgotten.</P>
    <P>If there are any other points that I omitted in this reply I will be happy to be reminded of them but I hope I have dealt with the points raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamRyan" hpid="Mr. W. Ryan Mr. W. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>While I appreciate that the Government must have a majority on committees of the Seanad a Joint Committee is slightly different because I am sure the Government will make certain they have a majority of Deputies.  If there <Col N="244" /> is a majority of Deputies the Leader of the House might then consider giving us an extra seat.  I do not know the number of Fianna Fáil TDs who will be on the committees but I am sure it will be fewer than the number from the Government side.  There may be a big gap between both sides and I do not think that should happen.  There should not be more than one of a majority for the Government on those committees in the interests of the committees.  This is a different situation from a Bill going through the House and I do not see why any one party should be trying to score over the other party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree completely with Senator Ryan and I certainly will discuss the matter with the Government Chief Whip.  It may well be that a solution can be arrived at here.  Instead of using the fraction that applies to each House we can add the membership of the different groupings in the two Houses and see if we can get a fairer distribution in that way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure what the definitions of fairness are around here because Senator Dooge used the word &ldquo;unfortunate&rdquo; when he was talking about the breakdown percentagewise between Fianna Fáil and the Independent Members of the House and I am not sure whether it was unfortunate for Fianna Fáil or unfortunate for the Independents or unfortunate that the Independents had unfortunately got above .5.  If there are to be further discussions about the composition of committees it is because we had the wit to organise a group on this occasion that we actually have the entitlement, according to well established precedent, to one Member on these committees.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed in the Leas-Chathaoirleach.  There has been a fairly well established precedent in this matter.  I have some sympathies with a party as large as Fianna Fáil but I believe it is to those who have the capacity to give to be generous rather than those of us who have the option of having one or none.  Those who have the major representation on these committees are the ones from whom one would expect the generosity.  One cannot expect a small group like ourselves to concede what would be our single seat on an entire committee.  I would not be entirely happy, therefore, with Senator Dooge's proposal to talk about joint proportions between both Houses because the proportion of Independent, or small party Members between the two Houses would obviously be even smaller.  It would solve the problem between the two major parties but I can assure him it would create another problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Leader of the House comes back on that point could I just come back to something I raised but did not fully question the Leader of the House on in my contribution, and that is how the new provision in paragraph (2) of the motion, a provision for alternate Members and also for access by any Member of this House to meetings of the committee will, work?  First of all, I would like it clarified, as I would hope this would be the case, that this would include not just the full meetings of the Joint Committee which are relatively irregular to consider reports, but also meetings of the sub-committees where the real work gets done and where the quorum is very often more badly needed. I hope that this means that if a member of the Joint Committee is not able to attend a sub-committee meeting that that member can arrange for an alternate member and if it came to the rare occasion of a vote the alternate member could vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, if we are to make a real sense of the open invitation to other Members of this House to come to any meetings of the committee or sub-committee, how <Col N="246" /> are they to know and how are they to be briefed as to what is coming up?  Is it intended that they be circulated with the fairly substantial documentation of the Joint Committee and the sub-committees?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry I omitted to reply to that point.  My understanding is that this is not a new provision.  This provision was in the motion which established the last committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that Senator Robinson welcomes it now reflects the fact that it has not been used so what we are concerned with here is the question of making sure that this committee gets going properly, that this provision is actually used.  Since it has not been used in the past, even though it was there, there probably is not an established procedure. I certainly do not think Members of the House would welcome the distribution of all the material that goes to the main members of the committee.  Perhaps the distribution of the agenda which would indicate the points that are going to be raised would suffice.  If a Member recognises something of particular interest he can attend that meeting and, if necessary, obtain by request the documentation in regard to that item on the agenda.  That is how I imagine it would work.</P>

      <P>With regard to the recommendation that Senator Dooge made about giving notice in advance of what funds would be required to get specialists' advice and so on, that each committee give an estimate at the beginning of their work as to what would be required so as to obviate difficulties later on, it is not quite that easy because we had the experience on one committee where we did give an estimate each year of what was required and we did get what seemed to be approval of the global figure but, nevertheless, at a later stage when we requested permission to spend a certain number of pounds for having the service <Col N="247" /> of a particular expert we sometimes found it was not forthcoming even though the amount required was well within the estimate we had put forward at the beginning of the year.  We found ourselves on a number of occasions, although well within our estimate, still having long delays and sometimes failing to get the permission we required.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>1.  That a Select Committee consisting of 4 members of Seanad Éireann (none of whom shall be a member of the Government or a Minister of State) be appointed to be joined with a Select Committee to be appointed by Dáil Éireann to form a Joint Committee (which shall be called the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies) to examine the Reports and Accounts and overall operational results of State-sponsored Bodies engaged in trading or commercial activities referred to in the Schedule hereto and to report thereon to both Houses of the Oireachtas and to make recommendations where appropriate.</P>
      <P>2.  That, after consultation with the Joint Committee, the Minister for the Public Service with the agreement of the Minister for Finance may include from time to time the names of further State-sponsored Bodies in the Schedule and, with the consent of the Joint Committee and the Minister for Finance, may delete from the Schedule the names of any bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>3.  That, if so requested by a State-sponsored Body, the Joint Committee <Col N="250" /> shall refrain from publishing confidential information regarding the Body's activities and plans.</P>
    <P>4.  That the Joint Committee shall have power to send for persons, papers and records and, subject to the consent of the Minister for the Public Service, to engage the services of persons with specialist or technical knowledge to assist it for the purpose of particular inquiries;</P>
    <P>5.  That the Joint Committee, previous to the commencement of business, shall elect one of its members to be Chairman, who shall have only one vote.</P>
    <P>6.  That all questions in the Joint Committee shall be determined by a majority of votes of the members present and voting and in the event of there being an equality of votes the question shall be decided in the negative.</P>
    <P>7.  That the Joint Committee shall have power to print and publish from time to time minutes of evidence taken before it together with such related documents as it thinks fit.</P>
    <P>8.  That every report which the Joint Committee proposes to make shall on adoption by the Joint Committee be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas forthwith whereupon the Joint Committee shall be empowered to print and publish such report together with such related documents as it thinks fit.</P>
    <P>9.  That 4 members of the Joint Committee shall form a Quorum of whom at least 1 shall be a member of Dáil Éireann and at least 1 shall be a member of Seanad Éireann.</P>

    <P>This concerns the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies.  Here we have seven Members of the Dáil and four Members of the Seanad.  Indeed, I do not know why this committee tends to be smaller than the others but these are the numbers that were agreed in discussion. This committee has been in operation since 1976.  It has done very valuable work in regard to our commercial State-sponsored bodies.  I understand the committee has reported on 18 of the State-sponsored bodies.  It is well down the list which appears in the Schedule at the bottom of page 127 and the top of page 128 of the Order Paper.</P>
    <P>Members might like to ask, &ldquo;What is going to happen?  Is this committee going to run out of work mid-stream?&rdquo;  I do not think so.  I think it will be like the painting of the Forth Bridge.  There are always a gang of painters on the Forth Bridge and when they come to one end they go back to the other end and start over again. This should be the way this committee should operate.  When they reach the end of the Schedule of these commercial State-sponsored bodies they will find that there will be among those they have already dealt with at least one whose <Col N="252" /> circumstances have changed, or whose problems are of such particular difficulty that in fact they will have ample work to do in regard to them.  I would like to take the opportunity of congratulating those who were members of this committee in previous sessions on the very excellent work they produced.  They have set a high standard for the new committee to live up to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">

      <P>I would like to comment on the question of the number on this committee.  When this was raised a few weeks ago I made the point that it was a particularly small committee.  My apprehension was that it would be extremely difficult to get a quorum to keep this committee going.  It is difficult to understand why it is so small compared to several of the other committees which are at least twice as big.  From my own experience I know this committee could not have kept going as it did were it not for the fact that we were lucky enough to have three or four very dedicated members who attended almost every meeting. They included the Ministers for Defence and Health who attended almost every meeting at that time.  I can only hope that we will have similar members on this occasion.  It is doubtful whether this committee will be successful from that point of view.  I echo Senator Dooge's question of why it was decided to have this so small compared to the other committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree, on the other hand, that it is going to be very hard to provide members for all of these committees.  I could have seen the argument if all the committees were in the region of 11 to 15 members so as to enable sufficient members to be found for meetings of all those committees. Why some of the committees should be so big and this one so small is difficult to understand.  Moving away from this committee, it is going to be very hard to find enough Members to provide membership for all of these committee.  By that I mean Members who will attend them with reasonable dilligence.  I am doubtful whether it is going to be possible to find sufficient Members who will attend.  I was a member of the EEC Committee for a while and even though there <Col N="253" /> were 25 or 26 members we very often did not succeed in getting a quorum.  I was there on a number of occasions when meetings had to be abandoned because of a lack of a quorum.  In a sense I am arguing against myself because that big committee was abandoned on many occasions and the small committee always managed to carry on.  I hope that we will find sufficient members and that they will be sufficiently diligent to ensure that the meetings can always proceed.</P>
    <P>To add to this difficulty in regard to the committee we are discussing now, the position in regard to several of the other committees is that there is the provision that if a member cannot attend somebody else can act as a substitute for him, but for this committee which is so small and which will have difficulty in getting an attendance, there is no such provision. That adds to the mystery as to why this committee has been singled out for making it as difficult as possible to provide a quorum for it.  Certainly the EEC committee, the Legislation committee and the Third World committee all have provision for Members to take the place of those who cannot attend, but not the Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies.</P>

      <P>I should like to support the points made in some detail by Senator Ryan on the small size of the committee which has such an important task to accomplish.  This point was also made by the Leader of the House, Senator Dooge. He referred to the fact that this was done by agreement.  Who are the agreeing people?  It is interesting to note the imbalance in size and also the lack of any provision for alternate members in the strict sense and for ordinary Members of this House or the other House to attend meetings of this Joint Committee.  This is particularly interesting and questionable at the moment in view of the importance of the role of the committee.  At this stage of our economic development some of the most major policy decisions and considerations are ones which affect State-sponsored bodies.  I would imagine that if Members of this House knew that a particular subject was being discussed before the Joint Committee there would <Col N="254" /> be a considerable interest possibly in attending a particular meeting.  It might be because of the geographical location of the State-sponsored body or because of some problem that had arisen that Members would wish to go along to it.</P>
      <P>To what extent do we have flexibility? Would it be possible now in this House to propose an amendment to insert an equivalent paragraph to No. 2 relating to the EEC committee providing that in the absence of a member at a meeting, who is a Member of Seanad Éireann, another Member of Seanad Éireann, may with the authority of the absent member take part in the proceedings and vote in his stead and that Members of Seanad Éireann not being members of the Joint Committee may attend meetings and take part in the proceedings without having a right to vote?  If we have the possibility of introducing that amendment it would allow greater participation than is strictly allowed by the terms of reference. Eleven members out of a potential pool of 200, if one omits Ministers and Ministers of State, seems to be a very small number.  I wonder whether four members allows any Independent participation.  I do not know what the intended composition of this committee will be but it would be regrettable if the size of the committee excluded any participation by any Independent Senator who might wish to participate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find that this committee has a remarkably small membership in comparison to the Joint Services Committee.  Why should the committee dealing with the restaurant and other facilities be so much larger than a committee dealing with one of the most vital areas of our economic and commercial lives?  I share the general experience of Members who served on committees of the difficulty of getting a quorum at many of these meetings.  Yet, this is a broader criticism of priorities for Members of the House.  I calculate, taking the committees we are establishing this afternoon by these motions, on their present membership there will be a total membership of 41.  Obviously one individual might be a member of more than one committee but given that the Seanad sits for less than an average of 50 days in <Col N="255" /> the year and that a number of the committee meetings coincide with days when the Seanad is meeting, it does not seem to be an intolerable or undue burden on legislators that they would participate in at least one of these working committees if they have an interest in and are prepared to be involved in that work. Although the experience has not been a very happy one that is part of an overall criticism of the priorities in the legislative area which have dominated the political experience in both Houses.  Those priorities should be changed and more attention focussed on the important work that can be done in these substantive committees. Even at this late stage serious consideration should be given to expanding the membership and, in particular, expanding participation by Members of this House in such an important committee.</P>

      <P>In connection with the suggestion made by Senator Robinson that it would be desirable to have such an amendment, the House should have notice of such a suggestion or such an amendment.  If it is agreed by the House Senator Dooge might like to deal with it later.</P>

      <P>If it is of any assistance to the House I would be pleased to second Senator Robinson's proposal that we should amend the motion in this way because I, too, share her feelings and those of Senator Eoin Ryan.  This committee is of particular importance because I remember well, at the stage when I was working on the staff of Leinster House some years ago drafting parliamentary questions, that one of the great frustrations of Members of the Oireachtas was that they could exercise so little control over and had so little information about the workings of State and semi-State bodies.  These, are after all, meant to be in public ownership, the commercial and other types of bodies which, theoretically, are owned by the people, and yet the people's representatives in the form of Members of the Dáil and Seanad had virtually no access to <Col N="256" /> information or participation in the control of these bodies.  The reply most frequently obtained to any request for information, whether important or trivial, was that the Minister had no responsibility in that area.  There were a great many people working on policy creation at the time who were extremely anxious to set up a committee of the Houses like this which would give the Houses the important principle of being able to look into the affairs of the State and semi-State bodies and give them, not a means of interfering in the day-to-day running of them, but a means of overseeing what was going on and participating in what was in fact the public side of our industry and commerce.  That is a most important principle.</P>
      <P>There is no point in saying that a particular body is in public ownership if the public through their representatives have no part in or information about the running of it, if it is simply a matter of handing it over to a sort of sub-bureaucracy however virtuous those persons may be.  I would be most anxious to see this committee continuing to be as effective as it has been in the past.  It has been an effective committee and one which has played a very important part in the whole area of the companies it oversees.  It is because of that that I would agree with the Senators who have already spoken that it seems a pity that this committee should be so small.  For instance, as Senator Robinson said, we appear to be putting the importance of our restaurant as a greater priority than the importance of a committee such as this.  After all, the restaurant no doubt exists for the convenience of Members of the Oireachtas but we can hardly say that it is of major importance to the nation that we should just be comfortable in our restaurant.  I would very much agree about that and also about the business of the substitution of other Members and the ability of other Members to attend which would be covered by the proposal made by Senator Robinson to include in the motion on the Joint EEC Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The size of the committee is of great relevance to the Independent Members. It appears that if the Seanad is to nominate <Col N="257" /> only four Members on some of the committees there may be half an Independent, or the leg of an Independent Member from the knee down.  That may be sufficient to enable us to kick some of the semi-State bodies but would hardly be very useful otherwise as the kick could not be directed by any brain.  That is another disability of having the committee so small.  Senator Dooge is correct in putting forward what he described as the Forth Bridge principle, that these committees do not come to an end of their work.  Obviously, it takes a long time to go through the various bodies that have to be investigated and it would be desirable that the committee should start to look at the first ones again when they have completed the list.  There is certainly nothing that would suggest that it would be desirable that the committee should stop their work and say they have looked at all these bodies, produce the results of their investigation and cease.  Obviously, conditions and economic policies change and so on and we need to have a continuing look at them rather than a simply once-for-all look.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnRobb" hpid="Mr. Robb Mr. Robb">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like again to draw the attention of Senators to paragraph 4 of the motion.  That is a very important paragraph because it empowers the Joint Committee to send for persons, papers and records.  In relation to the whole democratic process there has not been enough consideration given as to what we mean by persons.  The implication behind that paragraph seems to be more concentrated on the expert or the specialist, the man with the special technical knowledge as being the person appropriate to be called before the Joint Committee.  It has certainly been my experience in the working of a hospital that this is where we get ourselves into trouble.  When we are considering drawing up evidence, obtaining information or ideas, we should see it as a tripartite matter, there is the consumer, the operative and the institutions.  In that respect if we take hospitals the last person to be consulted about the workings of a hospital is usually the person for whom the building was built in the first place and the person who <Col N="258" /> pays the salaries and wages of those who work in it.  I should like to emphasise that we should in consideration of what has been incorporated into paragraph 4 be clear that we are not just considering experts but also the sort of submissions that can be made by the consumer through his representative, by the operatives who work in the semi-State bodies as well as the institutional men who run them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, I am thankful to Senators who have expressed views in regard to this committee.  There are a few themes that ran through this short debate.  One of them was the question of the size of this committee.  Senator Ryan, towards the end of his contribution, began to realise that he was driven by his usual good logic to provide the answer to the points he had raised in his opening sentences.  The main fact about this committee is that they have worked well and have not had the difficulties of quorum of the larger committees.  I do not want to make too much of that but the Seanad should realise that this is a particular type of committee.  It takes up, two or three State bodies and seeks to examine their operations.  Unlike the EEC Committee that we were talking about in the last motion, when Senator Robinson said that the Members who will be nominated next week will find 100 documents on 100 topics waiting for them.  The work of this committee is very concentrated.  It does appear that this has been one of the most efficient of our committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might suggest that whereas the contrast that has been made here as regards the size of this committee and the other committee may not be arguments that this committee is too small but arguments that the other committees are too large. It may well be that the difficulties of these other committees have arisen from their very size.  This may well apply to this question of alternates and substitutes.  I would like to say, firstly, in regard to Members of the Seanad attending meetings, I do not think there is any difficulty whatsoever in this.  In regard to any committee of this type the presumption is that <Col N="259" /> it can meet in public if it wants to or can decide that it will meet in private.  The committee itself, as I understand it, can under Standing Orders provide by its own resolution that any Member of either House can attend.  There is no need to amend Standing Orders in regard to the question of observers.  Perhaps this question of observers could go a bit too far. This committee is trying to deal with things on a narrow basis.  It is not like the case of taking an EEC regulation and saying, &ldquo;Let us have as many minds as possible because we do not know what the various possible secondary ramifications are&rdquo;.  Here we have a committee that focuses on a particular topic.  If there were to be a large, or even a medium-sized fluctuating attendance the success of the meetings of this committee would be in jeopardy.  It would alter the nature of the committee and might indeed impair the efficiency of which there is evidence.  This also applies to the question of alternates.  I believe this is a question that could well be considered but I would ask those who make the presumption that it is necessarily better that there should be a system of alternates in every committee to consider that this is not necessarily so.  The question of alternates is good if we have difficulties in regard to a quorum, if we have the position of people who are being overloaded.  Senator Robinson is a practising lawyer and well acquainted with the system of alternates that occurs in the Four Courts.</P>
    <P>The position is that this is not necessarily good for all of our committees because if we are to have a system of alternates, there should be a system of nominated alternates who are nominated at the beginning and you have a single substitute for an individual and no more. We certainly would not add to the efficiency of this committee and might endanger the efficiency of other committees if we have a system whereby somebody decides he has too much constituency correspondence to go to a meeting and he looks around for somebody to attend on his behalf at the committee.</P>
    <P>A committee like this that takes up a particular semi-State body and makes a <Col N="260" /> deep study of that over a matter of six to nine months is a committee that needs continuity above all.  If we have a change in personnel from meeting to meeting this might impair its work.  I would suggest that we establish the committee. Those Senators who are members of this committee can keep in mind what has been said in this debate and that the committee should experiment in regard to the question of involving others.  If the committee even wanted to have a very limited system of alternates I do not think the lack of power here would impede that committee.  If it does, and the committee is agreed that its efficiency would be increased let it come and look to this House and look to the other House for an amendment of the terms on which it is established.</P>
    <P>I would hesitate at this stage to say that the case for alternates and the case for putting in a provision like the provision in the EEC Committee is one that is so compelling that we should make the change now rather than let this committee get on with the work.  The main thing about this committee is the fact that the committee has substantially worked. Senator Robinson mentioned the difficulties in regard to the numbers.  She has forgotten, of course, that we still have to establish our committee on women's rights and we still have to establish&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not forgotten that, I assure the Senator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the committee that was mentioned earlier in regard to marriage breakdown.  I have been informed, since this point was raised earlier in this House, that agreement has been reached on the terms of reference of that committee and it is hoped that the expediency motion will be introduced in Dáil Éireann tomorrow.  We hope it is on the way.  On the point of this wide membership of committees, I think this is another indication that we may well find ourselves in six months time coming back to the Houses of the Oireachtas to reduce the membership of committees such as the Joint Services Committee and others rather than increasing the membership of this particular committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="261" /> I take the point that Senator Robb made about the operations of this committee and its use of this ancient privilege of sending for persons and papers, that they should not be narrow in regard to the scope.  I do not think the committee will be.  The best guarantee we have for the success of this committee is to set it up on the same terms as before and hope it will do as good a job as it did before. After all, 18 first class reports since 1976, in spite of the interruptions of elections is a substantial achievement.  We should indicate to the members of the committee that if they wish to have their terms of reference amended in any way they should not be slow to come back here to the House.</P>
    <P>I agree also with Senator McGuinness in regard to the argument that is appropriate that these commercial State companies, which are in a sense in public ownership, should be subject to some scrutiny.  We want to be careful here that no system of committee that we set up would nullify the very purpose of these bodies.  The purpose of these bodies was to leave them free in regard to their day-to-day operations.  It is right that we should inquire into what they are doing, but we must be very careful as to the exact meaning we attach to the word &ldquo;inquisition&rdquo;.  This word can have a number of different meanings.</P>
    <P>I urge the House to adopt this Motion No. 2 in the form it is in on the Order Paper and ask the committee, after it has been working for six months or so, to report back to the Seanad in regard to its operations and to any changes that might be made.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="264" /> This motion relates to the Joint Services Committee.  Far from elevating our restaurant committee, it will be no longer an individual committee in this House.  The purpose of the motion here is to amalgamate our pre-existing Library Committee and the Restaurant Committee into a new Joint Services Committee. These were two standing committees that existed for a long time.  They are committees in which the equal rights of the Seanad and the Dáil are allowed for.</P>
    <P>The proposal now is that this new committee should be nine Members of the Dáil and nine Members of the Seanad. One of the reasons why that number of 18 is somewhat larger than the number of 11 for the State-sponsored bodies is that it is specifically envisaged that sub-committees would be set up under the Joint Services Committee.  The provision is to allow the committee to split itself up into sub-committees for the purpose of dealing with certain aspects of its work.</P>
    <P>In regard to the terms of reference under paragraph (1), I would like to say that there is one point which would not have appeared in this particular form, or should I say in this particular order, if this had been drafted in the Seanad.  It is inappropriate for the public image of Oireachtas Éireann and inappropriate for its purpose that the motion should list the direction and control of the Oireachtas Restaurant ahead of the Oireachtas Library and ahead of the Information Service, ahead of the Research Service. I do not think this difference of emphasis is of sufficient importance that we should amend it in the Seanad to reverse the order and send it back to the Dáil.  However, I want to put it on record that if the Seanad had had the initiation of the motion the order here would have been reversed.</P>

      <P>I would like in this connection to pay a tribute to the Information Service and the Research Service which is provided in this House.  I think Senators will agree that the small number <Col N="265" /> of staff under the direction of the Librarian with the limited resources they have, have shown a willingness and competence to assist Members in the discharge of their legislative duties to which we should pay a tribute on an occasion such as this. I do not have any other points I wish to make on introducing this motion but, again, would be happy to answer questions.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>(1)  That a Select Committee consisting of 7 members of Seanad Éireann (none of whom shall be a member of the Government or a Minister of State) be appointed to be joined with a Select Committee to be appointed by Dáil Éireann to form the Joint Committee on Co-operation with Developing Countries to examine:</P>

    <P>This is concerned with the Committee on Development and Co-operation.  It is again a committee which we have had on a previous occasion.  It is not a permanent committee.  It is sometimes regarded as being an <i>ad hoc</i> committee.  Certainly, under Standing Orders we have to make the decision whether to establish this committee following each general election. However, I am very glad that it has been re-established.  I would like to think that among all our concern about our conditions here at home, the establishment of this committee would be an indication that we do not forget our concern or indeed our responsibilities towards the Third World.  This again is a committee on which the Seanad is represented more than proportionately compared to the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference are broad <Col N="268" /> enough.  That particular committee is not operating long enough for us to know if the terms of reference are completely adequate.  The provision is a good one which requires this committee to present a report each year on one particular topic so that this will mean that the committee's work will be brought to the notice of the Seanad every year and will give us an opportunity at least once a year for debating the problems of the Third World.  I note that in this committee substitutes are allowed.</P>

      <P>On the last occasion when we had the expediency motion to set up this joint committee when I spoke I ended up being accused of having expressed very similar sentiments to those of the Minister for Defence, Deputy Paddy Cooney.  The irony of that will not escape Members of this House in the light of recent events.  I would like to put it clearly, first of all, that, of course, the principle of this committee, and I am sure the intentions behind it, are most welcome.  Therefore, I would not dream of opposing it.</P>
      <P>There are a number of questions and implications involved in it that deserve at least, to be put on the record.  The first is the term &ldquo;developing countries&rdquo;.  It is a term which enables us in the rich minority of the world to get away with something close to murder, because it enables us to carry on the pretence that everybody is really getting better; it is only a question of a different degree, yet, some of the facts need to be put clearly on the record. In recent years the price of cotton has fallen by 37 per cent; the price of sugar has fallen by 54 per cent and the price of rubber has fallen by 78 per cent.  That is probably true of almost every raw material and basic commodity being produced by what are probably more honestly called the poor countries of the world and probably more correctly called the oppressed countries of the world.  It is not an accident that they are the way they are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is what has happened to every commodity and that has been the state of their industrial development.  They are not developing.  They are going backwards. <Col N="269" /> That is the first thing that needs to be said.  The use of the word &ldquo;developing&rdquo;, in terms of what a lot of people working in the whole area of development would understand to be the case, for these countries is in fact a misnomer. It is probably even offensive to many people working in the area but I accept that it is done with the best of intentions.</P>
    <P>The other thing that needs to be reiterated at a time like this &mdash; and I am glad the Leader of the House mentioned it; other than to mention a few things I will not go into it at any length &mdash; is the fact that we are a rich country.  We are a rich country because in every basic and fundamental issue which divides the rich from the poor we side with the rich. Whatever about political and military neutrality, we have no moral right to be neutral on the fundamental issue of justice and injustice.  In fact we are not even pretending to be neutral.</P>
    <P>We talk neutral but we act very expediently in our own interests almost entirely in terms of our deliberations on international agencies.  We tend, qualitatively and marginally, to take slightly different positions, but on the fundamental issue of the imbalance in terms of trade, in terms of tariff structures and many things like that, we have clearly identified our interests and our needs as being those of the rich and powerful.  In no area is that more evident than in our very unflinching development of the Common Agricultural Policy which effectively discriminates against poor countries who cannot buy our produce because of its prices and cannot export their produce to the EEC because of our tariff barriers.  That is a fundamental fact.</P>
    <P>This is true of a number of areas.  I would mention our sugar industry, for instance.  We can talk forever about our aid and our concern but when our total overseas development aid in the last year for which I have figures was £17 million &mdash; that is a few years ago &mdash; the actual earnings by various State agencies in Third World countries amounted to 50 per cent more than that.  We would not want in this House to over-state the significance of this committee.  The one welcome <Col N="270" /> thing about this committee is that, as the Leader of the House said, the terms of reference are extremely wide.  I would just like to make a couple of comments on them in case they would be interpreted too narrowly.  &ldquo;Ireland's relations with developing countries in the field of development co-operation&rdquo; is fine, but it could be taken to be just ourselves and that small number of countries where we are actually doing something, whereas in fact it must include our relationship with the whole issue of structural injustice in the world at large and the whole issue of, dare I say it again, armaments expenditure which is the greatest single obscenity in the whole area of world development.  All those issues need to be confronted.</P>
    <P>I do not know how this committee can avoid considering our political neutrality because it is fundamentally linked to the future of our relationship with Third World countries.  We are not in a position to separate one issue from another unless we perpetuate the idea that development aid is our form of charity to keep our otherwise somewhat guilty conscience reasonably silent.  If that is what we are at then we are doing not only ourselves an injustice but we are doing the two-thirds of the world who are poor a great injustice because we are actually pretending to do something when in fact we are doing nothing.  It appears to me that a major function of a committee such as this is to elaborate on and develop public opinion and public awareness of the structural injustices on which our own prosperity is currently based.  I am more and more convinced, as are many people working in aid of development, that not only is it not possible for the rich countries of the first world to develop at the rate at which they have developed in the past but it may be necessary that many of us get used to simpler living standards if those who have nothing are ever to have the basics of life.</P>
    <P>Whatever has been the past record of this committee &mdash; I do not think it has met on a sufficient number of occasions to have a detailed record &mdash; it will have to take a broad and generous interpretation of its terms of reference.  It has to <Col N="271" /> move well beyond the idea of just supervising the minuscule amount of official aid that we give.  It has to move beyond a limited perception of a limited number of countries.  For instance, it would be a very useful exercise to investigate the role of Irish companies in the South African apartheid regime.  If we are talking about aid to developing countries then the whole apartheid regime in South Africa is a major obstacle to development in the whole of Southern Africa.  It would be very interesting to look at the activities of Irish missionaries in central America and look at the activities of one country that we have very friendly relations with in the context of Irish aid.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference of this committee need to be interpreted in the broadest possible basis.  It is, in some ways, a committee which could and should fundamentally alter Irish thinking and should fundamentally reflect within the Oireachtas the widely-held views of the public at large in this country about development, views which have been contributed to and formed to a great extent by Trócaire, which deserves to have its record and its activities commended in this House.  The views of the Irish people on Third World development have changed profoundly over the last ten years.  There is no agency more effective in achieving that change than Trócaire through its work at home. In the context of Trócaire and its recent seminar it needs to be said that what Trócaire did is only a minuscule example of what is expected from us by both Irish people working overseas and Irish people at home who have worked overseas.</P>
    <P>It needs to be reiterated that this is not and should not be a committee to look at how our minuscule aid is handed out.  It is not a committee just to look at a couple of selected countries.  It must look at Ireland's role within the EEC as a rich country, as a country within a bloc which is a major arms exporter, as a country within a bloc which has a vested interest in preserving certain tariff barriers that discriminate against poor countries.  It must tackle fundamental and basic questions about justice in the world, structural <Col N="272" /> injustice and the built-in oppression which is part of the way the market economy operates in the world at large. If it does less it will be doing no more than paying lip service to development, paying lip service to justice and, at the same time, enabling us to avoid the difficult issue and the difficult fact, which is that we are rich, they are poor; we are powerful, they are powerless; we are the powerful, they are the oppressed, and in the words of Tolstoy, if we are on a man's back and we offer to do everything to help him except get off his back then we are simply liars and cheats.  Our job is to get the rich world off the backs of the poor world so that they can develop themselves.  That is the fundamental change which is required.  It is the task of that committee to contribute to Irish public opinion.  If it gives us a lesser task it is wasting its time and is probably holding back development.</P>

      <P>Senator Ryan has welcomed the establishment of the committee and the wide terms of reference. I do not know if all the Members to be appointed would agree with him in regard to what he considers as being the main function of the committee.  There are a few points on which I certainly would agree.  In regard to the naming of the committee he says that the term &ldquo;developing countries&rdquo; is an unsuitable one and that it might be considered by some such countries as being insulting.  There is great difficulty in regard to these terms. We find ourselves talking about undeveloped countries which, as Senator Ryan said, may well be the truth, but many countries do not like to be called such. We talk about developing countries and I think it is the countries themselves that like to be called developing countries. We have talk of the less-developed countries and we have talk of the group of 31 who are the least developed countries. The title is not important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that this committee should not be inhibited in what it does. With regard to the question of whether this committee should be concerned with countries in the Third World other <Col N="273" /> than our countries of concentration, this is, of course, true.  On the other hand we should not delude ourselves, no matter how good our intentions are, the actual material aid which can be given by this country can affect no more than a few countries.  The policy of having countries of concentration but not treating this limitation as an iron rule by which we are bound is a proper approach.</P>
    <P>Senator Brendan Ryan mentioned that there has been a change in public awareness in regard to the Third World.  I agree with him and I welcome this but there is a great deal still to be done with regard to the question of public awareness.  The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, considers that one of his more important functions in that office is the question of educating the public and making them aware of the reality of the gap between ourselves and the people of the Third World and of the fact that Senator Brendan Ryan mentioned that that gap is not a shrinking gap.  Over the past decade it is a widening gap.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with Senator Ryan that this is a committee that might find itself very much concerned with the question of neutrality or problems of that sort. They can be discussed in another committee, in other fora.  I would not join with Senator Ryan in referring to arms expenditure as necessarily being an obscenity but whether or not it is an obscenity I would like to say that too many countries of the Third World indulge in that obscenity.  This is one of their problems.  I hope the role that we play in our general foreign policy in regard to the peaceful settlement of disputes throughout the world helps to change the minds of the emerging nations about the utter foolishness that they indulge in in this regard.  Some of the non-material aid that we could give to them would be that in the various fora in the United Nations and in other fora we would help them to throw off their attitudes in this regard which are hampering them in their struggle for development.</P>

      <P>This committee represents the first important move towards the reform of the procedure of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It has been brought forward by Minister John Bruton, who has been charged with Oireachtas reform as being such.  This House should pay careful attention to what is being proposed here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is proposed that this committee of 18 Deputies and seven Senators should be charged with a number of functions.  The first of these is that this committee should be responsible for the introduction of <Col N="280" /> hearings on legislation in the Irish legislative system.  It means under this particular motion that any matter, any proposal for legislation, can be referred by motion to the Joint Committee on Legislation.  It might be the heads of a Bill or a draft Bill and this can be initiated by or with the consent of a member of the Government. Deputy Bruton in introducing this in the other House thought it was appropriate that this should be the manner in which this should be done on the establishment of the committee, that it might well be that as the committee develops its own procedures alternative ways of referral will be tried.  The committee itself may play some role in selecting what it thought were appropriate matters.  After an initial period this is going to be reconsidered.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other matters which are also referred to this committee &mdash; such as dealing with Consolidation Bills.  There was a special Joint Committee on the two Houses dealing with Consolidation Bills and its functions are now to be taken over by the new Committee. The question of private Bills is not being brought under the new Committee on Legislation.  Private Bills occur very rarely indeed.  They have their own special procedures, their own methods for hearing, and an undue number of complications would have been involved if they had been brought under the Committee on Legislation.  Their function is not that of general legislation.  Their function is that of providing for private matters &mdash; not so much nowadays for individuals but mainly for organisations, the amendment of charters and matters of this sort.  While it was considered that it might have been cleaner to have it all together, it was ultimately decided that this was not so.</P>
    <P>Another responsibility that is being given to this committee is in regard to law reform.  It has been given a positive role in regard to the Law Reform Commission itself.  That commission was established under the 1975 Act and it has since produced ten working papers and four reports.  Like many other commission reports, these reports have received insufficient discussion in the Houses of <Col N="281" /> the Oireachtas.  They have had insufficient impact in general on legislation.  By feeding the results of the work of the Law Reform Commission directly into the Committee on Legislation it is hoped that it will have its greatest input there.  Also there is provision for this committee not only to examine the reports of the Law Reform Commission but, in fact, to initiate law reform studies under paragraph 1 (a), to keep the law under review and to formulate proposals for law reform and to report thereon to each House. That is another very important function.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned considering legislation at a very early stage which appears under paragraph 1 (a).  That is a very important development.  I just want to stress that point for a moment before I go on to deal with how Bills will ultimately be dealt with.</P>
    <P>One of the problems of our system is that as far as we Members of the Oireachtas are concerned legislation is too far advanced on its assembly line before we have any notion whatsoever of what is going on.  This has been a great difficulty in the operation of our system.  The result is that all the discussions in regard to important legislation before it becomes congealed as a draft Bill are between members of pressure groups, members of the civil service with, at quite a late stage, Minister being involved.  One of the main functions of this committee on legislation will be that at a very early stage there will he the input from the ordinary Member of the Legislature; that he or she will have an opportunity here through this committee, or through Seanad representatives on this committee, to help in the shaping of legislation at a very early stage.  This is a reform of the highest importance.</P>
    <P>Once a proposal, has reached the stage of a Bill, there is a provision here for the consideration of Bills in Committee in this Joint Committee.  Instead of having a Committee Stage on the floor of the Dáil and Seanad, there will be a Committee Stage in Joint Committee which will allow for all the flexibility of the select committee procedure.  When we were discussing the Courts-Martial Bill <Col N="282" /> last week, tributes were paid to the Defence Act, 1952, which was considered for a long period in select committee and tributes were paid to the value of the work that was done in Committee in that case.  I want to emphasise that none of the rights of the Seanad in regard to legislation are going to be impaired in any way by the new procedure.  I want to follow through what will happen.</P>
    <P>Let us assume, as is usually the case, that the Bill is initiated in the Dáil.  The Bill will then go through its First Stage, that is its circulation, and a Second Stage debate in Dáil Éireann.  A proposal is made in Dáil Éireann to send that legislation to the select committee and Seanad Éireann must concur.  In other words, Dáil Éireann cannot by resolution deprive Seanad Éireann of its right to have that Bill dealt with as a normal Bill. This is very important.  It is not just a question of a motion coming up and the Leader of the House bobbing up and saying &ldquo;I move&rdquo; and the Minister gabbling a few words and that is that.  There can be a full Second Stage debate on that concurrence motion and if it happened to be the view of the Seanad that that Bill should not go to select committee the Seanad can debate it and there can be any broad amendment equivalent to the present Second Stage amendment denying a Second Reading because of a particular stated reason.  It will be possible to put down to that concurrence motion an amendment denying the request to send it to this committee on the same grounds.  There is no difficulty here in regard to the rights of the Seanad.</P>
    <P>If the Bill is then sent to be considered in committee by this new Joint Committee on Legislation, the Senators will be represented there.  It is almost certain that in the beginning the legislation that will be dealt with in this way will be technical, specialist legislation.  This House is entitled to appoint seven Members to this particular committee and if there was a case that there was a Bill coming up which was a highly technical Bill it would be open to this House to vary its membership of that committee. The Seanad would be entitled to receive a report from the committee of selection <Col N="283" /> discharging the present members and substituting others, so that we could ensure in regard to legislation of particular importance that the best team were assembled to represent the Seanad. Under what is proposed here, we have a great deal of flexibility and we have our own powers.</P>
    <P>When a Bill has been considered in this new committee it will then be sent back to the House in which it was initiated.  If that was in the Dáil, there would then be a Report Stage and a Final Stage in the Dáil and the Bill would then come to the Seanad.  Since the Committee Stage had been dealt with in Joint Committee, it would come into the Seanad on Report Stage.  It would be possible for Members of the Seanad to put down amendments on Report Stage.  Though it is unlikely to happen after such serious consideration if in the course of a debate on Report Stage the Seanad could recommit the Bill in order that it could avoid the restriction of Report Stage debate to just one contribution. At the moment we have the power to recommit either a whole Bill or a section of a Bill into Committee and if it appears that the committee work has not been thoroughly done, that power would still rest with the Seanad.  I draw the attention of the House to these very important new developments.</P>
    <P>I pass on to some of the other functions of this joint committee on legislation.  It is also proposed that the Joint Committee should exercise the functions presently exercised by the Seanad Committee on Statutory Instruments.  I would like on this occasion to pay tribute to those Members of Seanad Éireann who since 1948 have contributed to the work of this Committee on Statutory Instruments.  The committee was established on the proposal of the late Senator Luke Duffy who was then Secretary of the Labour Party and a Member of this House.  It was reestablished after every general election since.  The Seanad committee was set up to take a look at the maze of secondary legislation and it examines statutory instruments under six headings.  First, it examined whether there was any charge on the public revenue.  It also checked <Col N="284" /> secondary legislation for any unusual or unexpected use of powers.  It examines secondary legislation to ensure that there is no retrospective effects.  It examined secondary legislation to ensure there was no unjustifiable delay in the making of orders or regulations under statute.  It was entitled to report to Seanad Éireann seeking the elucidation of the form or the purport of any statutory instrument. Finally, it could draw the attention of the House to any defective drafting of statutory instruments.</P>
    <P>I say that we should pay tribute on this occasion to the work that was done by this committee but I would also like to point out that it did suffer from the difficulties that we discussed earlier in regard to committees generally.  It did suffer from the fact that adequate staff was not available in order to enable it to carry out its work.  The chairman of the Seanad Committee on Statutory Instruments has had occasion to report back repeatedly to the Seanad in regard to this difficulty on staffing.  If we look back over the record of the committee we will find there were times of great activity and times of lesser activity.  Here again, we can notice a committee suffering at times because of lack of interest of members. That committee did an excellent job not just by what it reported here to Seanad Éireann but the existence of that committee and the work that it did in the early years had the effect of raising very considerably the standards of the implementation of statutes.  Many times it drew attention to irregularities and it proposed improvements.  These were gradually adopted and the whole of our system of secondary legislation has benefited.</P>
    <P>There is one change in regard to this particular activity and that is that the new committee is not only entitled to recommend the annulment of a statute but it is also given the very valuable power of recommending the amendment of a statutory instrument to the House so that the House could say that it would recommend in turn that a statutory instrument should take the different form.  This is a very interesting improvement.</P>
    <P>In summary, the Joint Committee on Legislation is a new departure.  It is going <Col N="285" /> to be a committee whose members will have to put in a great deal of work.  We want to change our system here in the Houses of the Oireachtas, to try to bring it more into line with the system in other countries, who have adapted to modern conditions by an increasing use of legislative committees, of hearings in regard to legislation, hearings in advance of legislation, of select committees examining legislation line by line off the floor of the House.  If this is to be a success, then we are going to have to look for seven very capable, very hard-working Senators to play our part in this particular committee. I recommend the establishment of the committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CatherineMcGuinness" hpid="Mrs. McGuinness Mrs. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the setting up of this committee which will deal with quite a number of things which hitherto there has been no committee of the Oireachtas to deal with and which, in fact, have not been dealt with at all.  It is quite a significant step in the improvement of our procedures that we should deal with the matters which are set out to be dealt with by this committee.  In particular, I feel it is essential, if the Law Reform Commission is to be of any use, to set up a mechanism of some sort like this which would deal with examining its reports and with making recommendations as to what legislation should be brought in on account of the reports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I see it at present, it simply depends on the taste and fancy of whatever Minister happens to be dealing with the area that the Law Reform Commission dealt with in a particular working paper or report, whether any notice is taken of it. Members of the Law Reform Commission with whom I have spoken about this issue feel a considerable degree of bitterness about the amount of work that is put into some of their reports and the little notice that has been taken of it.  There have been exceptions.  For instance, in the recent report on illegitimacy a major seminar was organised by the Minister of State, Deputy Nuala Fennell, about this and it was a welcome break in the attitude to Law Reform Commission reports. While one may not always agree with what the Law Reform Commission says, there is very little point in setting it up, in staffing it, in paying for it and so on <Col N="286" /> and then simply allowing its reports to gather dust.  I hope that this new committee will deal effectively with this area.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (1), sub-paragraph (d) states: &ldquo;to keep the law under review and to formulate proposals for law reform and report thereon to the House&rdquo;.  That seems to me to be of crucial importance, that it would give an opportunity to Members of the Oireachtas to have an official channel rather than simply putting down Private Members' motions in this House which may or may not ever be reached, and in any case may only be reached after a very long time.  To have an official channel to bring forward proposals for law reform could be useful to Members of the House.  It is very important that paragraph (7) provides that any Member of the House may attend and be heard so that some opportunity may be given to Members who are not necessarily members of this committee to put in their contribution on this kind of subject.</P>
    <P>Like Senator Dooge I was struck by the importance of the work of the committee that reviewed statutory instruments. We very often underestimate the importance and the scope of legislation which was brought before this House and the other House by statutory instrument rather than through means of Bills and Acts.  The fact that such a large amount of important legislation comes in through the ministerial power to bring in statutory instruments and is laid on the Table of the Oireachtas but, at the same time, very often does not receive any particular consideration from Members unless special attention is drawn to it means that the work of the Committee on Statutory Instruments was very important indeed. They carried out that work extremely well.  That kind of task fits in very well with the sort of proposals that are being made about this committee.</P>
    <P>As far as dealing with complicated Bills by committee system is concerned, again this is something which all of us probably will welcome.  So long as it does not take away from the ordinary powers of the House it is obviously a convenient and suitable method of dealing with legislation which very often is of such a technical nature that only very few Members of the <Col N="287" /> House can make a proper contribution to it in an ordinary debate though they have not had a great deal of time to study it.</P>
    <P>What Senator Dooge has said is true, that legislation by the time it reaches the House is too far advanced in its formulation for it to be changed in any material aspect.  Again and again we have the spectacle of Bills going through the other House and this House where amendments are proposed by various Members, by the Government and by Opposition parties, by individual Members and so on.  While Government amendments, generally speaking, get included in the legislation, it is comparatively rare for other Members to see one of their amendments actually accepted.  It does happen but it is comparatively rare.  Very often one feels that if only a point could have been made when the Bill was being drafted or when it was being considered, it could very well have changed the minds of the drafters and could have affected the Bill as it turned out in its final form.</P>
    <P>This applies, too, to many of the bodies and groups of one sort or another who get in touch with us as Members of the Oireachtas asking us to put forward ideas or amendments on particular Bills.  One need think only of the Bill with which we are going to deal later on today, the Telecommunications Bill.  I am sure all of us have received various documents from different groups looking for the proposing of amendments to this Bill and yet most of us know in our hearts that many of them are unlikely to be accepted, whereas they might well have affected the original drafting of the Bill if they were put in at an earlier stage.</P>
    <P>I am very anxious that this committee should start its work at an early stage and that it should be regarded as a committee of very great importance, one that would keep going, that would meet on fairly frequent occasions and would be prepared to receive suggestions from Members of the House who were not, in fact members of the committee so that it could carry on its work as effectively as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the establishment of this committee and the <Col N="288" /> very substantial advance in the general legislative work which can be done by Members of both Houses.  I agree with the points that have been made, in particular by Senator McGuinness in her contribution.  I am aware that time is passing and that there are other major proposals coming before this House, as always together at this time of the year, so I want to be as brief as possible in my contribution.  I want to ask a number of questions with which the Leader of the House might deal in his response.</P>
      <P>In looking at the terms of reference of the committee I endorse what was said about the importance of the work it will do.  What is the difference between sub-paragraph (a) and subparagraph (e)? Under subparagraph (e) there seems to be a simpler provision to consider any Bill referred to it by either House with the concurrence of the other.  Does the committee have the same powers to invite submissions in writing and orally, if necessary, if a Bill is referred to it under subparagraph (e)?  It seems to me that there may be some difficulty in understanding just how those two subparagraphs knit together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to this joint committee, and indeed this is a general comment, why is there express reference to its power to appoint sub-committees when that is not referred to, for example, in the terms of reference of the joint EEC committee which has always established and has four standing sub-committees?  I merely make this comment because it seems to me there is not much standardisation of the procedure in relation to the setting up of these joint committees.  That may be a good thing.  Standardisation might, in fact, be a rather inflexible approach.  It may be better that each of the joint committees has different terms and a slightly different shape in relation even to the motions establishing it.  I notice the express power there.  I notice the express power that any Member may attend and be heard and this goes back to what we were discussing earlier in relation to the State-sponsored Bodies Committee. Why is it expressed here and why are we merely implying it in the manner that the Leader of the House mentioned in relation <Col N="289" /> to the other committee?  Paragraph (6) states that the joint committee has power to report to each House from time to time any memoranda submitted or other evidence given to it or to the relevant sub-committee in explanation of a statutory instrument.  Is it that the committee would annex to its own report the material submitted to it so that it could be considered by both Houses?</P>
    <P>I end on one substantive comment on which I would agree very much with Senator McGuinness, that it is very much to be welcomed that we have at last a structured parliamentary forum to consider the report of the Law Reform Commission established by Act in 1975.  The Law Reform Commission have suffered from acting very much in isolation from the parliamentary and legislative process and it is hoped that the power to examine the reports of the Law Reform Commission will increase the work output of that commission and perhaps the broad based relevance of some of the areas examined will have a beneficial influence on the work of the Law Reform Commission as well as highlighting the need for reform. I recommend that this committee, when established, set up close working links with the legislative committee of the Incorporated Law Society and also with the Bar Council in relation to measures of reform because I know that both bodies have had frustrating experiences in the past in trying to get reforms in areas which were not perhaps of top political priority but which were urgently needed as measures which had either been partially struck down by the courts or a case had revealed a defect in the legislation. This is a matter in which there would be available considerable expertise in the two professional bodies and indeed elsewhere in the community which can be drawn on by the committee.  I welcome its establishment and I would like clarification of those points.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the points raised, I will try to respond as best I can.  If what I say here is not satisfactory, I will endeavour to get more detailed information for the Senators.  Senator <Col N="290" /> McGuinness and Senator Robinson both referred to this question of the right of other Senators to attend at this particular committee.  Once again, this is a reflection of the fact that the matters which will be of concern to this committee at any one time will have a very broad scope particularly if under paragraph (1) (a) it is concerning itself with possible draft legislation. Also in regard to this, it will give an opportunity to Senators, as I indicated in regard to the EEC committee where there is an item of particular interest to them to attend and, with the permission of the chairman of the committee, to contribute to the discussion but not to vote.  Senator McGuinness, echoing what I said, spoke of the importance of Members of the Oireachtas being able to influence legislation at an early stage and not being faced with proposals for legislation which are difficult to change after they have congealed.</P>
      <P>I would say though, regardless of what Senator McGuinness said, in tribute to Ministers from all parties who have held office, that the acceptance of Opposition amendments is not that rare a phenomenon in Senate Éireann.  It certainly does vary from Minister to Minister and from topic to topic or from Bill to Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to place on record that on the first occasion I handled a Bill for the Opposition that the Minister in charge, who was a member of the Fianna Fáil Party and well known for being irascible, accepted nine of my ten amendments. We may all deplore the fact that business in the House is often too rushed to allow for the acceptance of Opposition amendments and this is certainly something that happens all too frequently.  We hope that the provisions for these early hearings may help in this regard.  It has been said to me in the past that it must really be frustrating in Opposition in the Seanad to find yourself often faced with Bills when the Dáil has gone home, with no real hope of getting amendments through.  That was my experience down through the years but some of those really good amendments did not die.  They came up two years later in the next Bill but this time they were part of the Minister's proposals and they went through. <Col N="291" /> We could well do without this time lag. Particularly those of us who are advancing in years have not as much time to wait for our good ideas to be implemented in the next round of legislation rather than the one that is before us at present.  I agree with Senator McGuinness that this idea of getting our input earlier is indeed a very important one.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson asked about the differences between paragraph (1) (a) and paragraph (1) (b) and the difference in practice here.  The position is that paragraph (1) (a) provides for oral hearings on proposals for legislation.  This is the early stage process.  It provides for oral hearings and it is specifically given the task of reporting to the House and providing a record of the evidence that is made before it.  Its report will not merely be recommendations but under (1) (a) the evidence which has been submitted, whether in writing or a record of the oral hearing, will be reported.  It may not be an absolutely complete verbatim record but all important evidence will be attached in the report to the House.  In regard to paragraphs (1) (e), the position is that this corresponds to the select committee operation at the moment.  As I understand it, the provision in regard to the furnishing of memoranda to the House is, as it were, a re-enactment here of the present provision in regard to select committees.</P>
    <P>This committee on legislation is a new departure; it will have to establish its own precedents, and its own modes of operation. It would be quite appropriate if this committee after, say, a lapse of 12 months to allow itself to become quite familiar with the operations that have been given to it by Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann, were to report back to the House in regard to these terms of reference that we are now considering as to whether they are appropriate.  They could also consider whether their scope is correct, whether the procedures are appropriate or whether the powers should be modified in any way.  In our charge to the legislative committee we give some details, but the essential charge is to carry out this pilot experiment and <Col N="292" /> make a success of it.  That is the charge Seanad Éireann is giving to this committee. If this committee feels it could do a better job by any variation in the terms of this motion then it should, having given adequate trial to the procedures that are suggested here, it certainly should come back to us with a recommendation.</P>
    <P>There is another point in regard to sub-committees.  The position is that any committee of the Oireachtas can informally set up sub-committees for its own purpose.  The specific provision here is to indicate to the committee that there may be certain areas in which it may wish to make a permanent or quasi-permanent delegation of one of its functions I repeat what I said earlier, it is very important that law reform will now have a home inside the legislative system.  It may well be that this committee would set up a sub-committee on law reform and the fact that it is highlighted here, though I do not think it really makes all that difference as to how it operates in practice, it does increase support for it.</P>

    <P>(5)  That the quorum of the Joint Committee shall be four of whom at least one shall be a member of Dáil Éireann and one shall be a member of Seanad Éireann and that the quorum of each sub-committee shall be three at least one of whom shall be a member of Dáil Éireann and one a member of Seanad Éireann.</P>
    <P>(6)  That every report which the Joint Committee proposes to make under this Resolution shall on adoption by the Joint Committee be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas forthwith whereupon the Joint Committee shall be empowered to print and publish such report together with such related documents as it thinks fit.</P>
    <P>This is essentially an <i>ad hoc</i> committee. We already set up one <i>ad hoc</i> committee earlier in this session in regard to building land.  It is proposed that we should set up this other <i>ad hoc</i> committee to report to Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann in regard to the particular problems of small industries.  We have had, since 1967, a special programme under the IDA in regard to small industries.  In 1968 SFADCo initiated a similar scheme in the mid-west region.  Small industries have particular problems.  It is appropriate that the Oireachtas should examine this.  After all, if it is going to examine our giant semi-State bodies, why does it not examine the problem of these <Col N="298" /> 50,000-odd small firms who have particular difficulties at all times but very severe difficulties at present?  It is particularly appropriate that we should establish this committee because the European Parliament have designated 1983 as the year of small medium sized enterprises. If we are to have this <i>ad hoc</i> committee it is an appropriate year in which to do this job.  The terms of reference are very wide.  They have been deliberately drawn wide so that, having been given these terms of reference, the committee can settle down and take whatever part of the terms of reference it thinks will serve the most useful purpose.  I am glad to say that in this instance the representations that I and other people made in regard to more use of the Seanad have been acceded to because it is proposed to be a committee on nine Deputies and seven Senators.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few comments I should like to make on this committee. One of the problems I have with it is that section (1) (i) which deals with the definition of a small business, states:</P>
      <P>A common definition of small businesses having regard to the criteria applied by State agencies, the Small Firms Association of the CII and definitions used in other EEC countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To me for many years it has appeared that the definition that somebody down the country would give to the small business and what the EEC would consider to be a small business are two totally separate things.  A small business in EEC terms is a company which employs fewer than 500 people; under no circumstances would that be considered a small firm in Irish terms.  With regard to the Small Firms Association of the CII, I suggest that 90 per cent of small businesses in this country have nothing to do with the CII because they could not afford to pay the fees that the CII ask to become members of that institute.  That is not running down the institution but it is a fact that 90 per cent of smaller business are not members of the Confederation of Irish Industry or members of any confederation.  The criister' <Col N="299" /> teria applied by State agencies, such as the IDA, do not seem to be the criteria that we should be looking at in terms of small businesses.  Many small businesses which are supportive of larger industries are one-man businesses or businesses which are run by families of one, two or three people.  In country areas there are supportive industries for the agricultural sector which are being run on a one man basis in small villages.  They go out in the middle of the night to help in fixing a breakdown on a machine that might be worth a lot to a farmer and is necessary in getting his crops ready for market.</P>
    <P>Many single person industries are operating in servicing many factories.  We have also smaller businesses which serve the transport industry.  These people work at night and have nothing to do with a confederation.  For that reason I sincerely hope that a common definition of small businesses will be brought in but that it would not have regard to the criteria applied by State agencies such as the IDA, the CII or the EEC.</P>
    <P>The motion mentions the problems of financing for small businesses and loan schemes with particular reference to existing loan schemes.  There is no existing loan scheme for small businesses in this country.  Small industries in Ireland, whether in the servicing or manufacturing area, are not given any loan scheme other than the rate of interest which is applicable to any normal customer in a bank.  If they go to the ICC or the IDA for a loan it seems to be still the situation that you have to prove that you do not need money to get it from many of the State agencies who are involved in the small industrial sector.</P>
    <P>A small businessman sets up on his own because he has the capabilities of running a business technically but he has not got the exact know-how or the financial background to allow him to get financial help from any of the State agencies or the public banking sector agencies. The only person that he might have a hope of getting a loan from without having to produce his financial background and his projections is the best service sector in the banking area at present, the <Col N="300" /> credit union, who will allow a very small businessman to get a loan to set him up in business and maintain him until such time as he can prove to the IDA and the ICC that he does not need them.</P>
    <P>This whole question of small businesses and the facilities that are available to small businesses needs to be gone into in very great detail.  Not alone can they not get the finance they need, they cannot get the expertise either but largely in debates in both Houses of the Oireachtas these people are being castigated as self-employed people who are not contributing to the economy and are continuously under pressure in both Houses and in the media.  The benefits that have been derived from a very viable small industry sector, whether they are self-employed or family businesses, have contributed greatly to the development of this State and, without them, we would not be here discussing the setting up of a committee which will have as its criteria the State agencies, Small Firms Association of the CII and the EEC.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I too welcome this committee.  I concur with Senator Lanigan on the importance of this area for our economy and the relevance of having it examined by a Joint Committee.  I am puzzled once more by the detail of the terms of reference; it is the lawyer in me. Why, given the quite difficult task allocated to this committee under the various subheadings is it denied the power to look for specialist help which other committees are given?  Why is it not empowered to seek the services of persons with specialist or technical know-how to assist it in performing its tasks?  This is something we have enabled the EEC Committee and State Sponsored Bodies Committee and so on to have.  It would seem to be particularly appropriate in relation to the tasks which we are allocating to this committee because a number of them are innovatory and may give rise to particular difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am interested in looking through the list setting out the terms of reference of the committee to note no express reference to the potential for expanding employment in the small business sector. <Col N="301" /> It may be implied in some of the subheadings but if a parliamentary committee is examining this area it will be particularly important to examine the possibilities of expanding employment opportunities through the development of small businesses and whether our own tax provisions or other aspects of our laws inhibit this at the moment is an aspect that the committee could well examine and make recommendations on.  I certainly believe that we must examine very closely the possibilities for increasing employment in these small Irish-owned firms which are a very important part of our economic and social development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Lanigan raised the question of the difficulties of definition, that one person says 50, another says 100 and another says 500.  In fact these terms of reference are drawn so that the first task of the committee will be to work out what is the definition most suitable for a discussion of the place of the small business in the Irish economy. It may well be that this use of numbers of employees does not give a good reflection of the problem.  Even if we say it is not suitable to use the EEC figure for Ireland, it should be this, that or the other figure, we may still find ourselves in trouble and end up using a different figure for east of the Shannon and west of the Shannon. There have been suggestions that we look at the definition in another way.  One suggestion, with all due deference to my colleague on my left, is to define a small firm as a firm that cannot afford an accountant on a full time basis.  It would be wrong of us in the establishment of the committee to put in a definition plucked from this report of the EEC or that report of the IDA.  Let the committee do that as their first job and come back and tell us from the point of view of the development of the Irish economy, from the point of view of employment and of developing innovation in the Irish economy what is the appropriate definition to use.  This task will certainly be covered by the committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the difficulties of financing is adequately covered here <Col N="302" /> under (1) (iii), which covers the means of facilitating the financing of small businesses with particular reference to existing loan schemes.  What are they like? Let us have a report on this.</P>
    <P>In regard to the point made by Senator Robinson that there is no mention here of expert advice, of people who could come in as experts and provide a memorandum or a report.  That is a deliberate omission because it is considered we had enough memoranda and reports by experts and that what essentially is wanted here is to set up a committee of politicians who will look at the reports that are available in the IDA, SFADCo and from the EEC and apply their political commonsense to these particular reports.  If one of their conclusions is that there is a particular gap in regard to information there will be no difficulty in getting that information through some of the existing facilities and agencies.</P>
    <P>We all agree that employment is a vital factor.  I feel that employment is adequately covered under paragraph (1) (ii), which asks the committee to make recommendations in regard to the development of the small sector business of the economy.  Certainly any report on that which did not deal with the employment aspect would not be a worthwhile report. While the concerns of this House would perhaps have been better represented if employment has been mentioned here, it is certainly adequately provided for. Equally, the question of whether the effects of tax incentives or tax disincentives are hampering the development of the small business sector of the economy is covered here.  We are concerned here with setting up a committee of Deputies and Senators to look at this whole problem which, as Senator Lanigan and Senator Robinson said, is of vital importance to us and to give us back a report, not another report full of statistics or graphs but one which has a good deal of political commonsense.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Professor Dooge has dealt very fully with the points raised but if we are deliberately denying this Joint Committee expertise in looking at particular areas of the committee report could <Col N="303" /> we have some indication of what the staffing of this committee will be because it is very important to have adequate staff?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a point well made.  I have repeatedly said in regard to committees that one of the difficulties that was encountered in the past was the lack of proper staffing of committees.  If we fail to staff the committees that we are setting up today adequately we are asking for trouble.  The point is very well made by Senator Robinson that if we are saying that we do not need an expert because there are so many reports then we certainly do need adequate staff to service the committee so that they can go through those reports, filter them and organise them for the benefit of the members. I will see that that view which, I take it, is shared by the House, is conveyed to the proper quarters.</P>

      <P>I sincerely hope that this committee will bring a sense of realism to our attitude towards small businesses and business in general.  It was put into perspective recently when a new industry was coming into Kilkenny to take over the Fieldcrest enterprise.  When Mr. Luc Santens, the new managing director of the firm was asked how many people he was going to employ he gave the simple answer that in the beginning they would employ one person.</P>

I do not begrudge that time, it was well worth having the discussion but it does lead us into difficulty in regard to the remaining business.  I am anxious that the House should not sit unduly late tomorrow and that we should avoid that by sitting slightly later this evening.  I would suggest that, in order to get on as far as possible with the Second Stage of the Bill, that the House should sit now until 6 o'clock adjourn from 6 o'clock to <Col N="304" /> 7 o'clock and then sit to finish Second Stage but not later than 10 o'clock.</P>

    <Title>Postal and Telecommunications Services Bill, 1982: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. J. Mitchell) Jim Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. J. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill provides for the setting up of two separate State-owned companies, An Post and Bord Telecom Éireann, to take over the operation of the national postal and telecommunications services from the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  The basic purpose of this reorganisation is to give the public better postal and telecommunications services nationwide.</P>
      <P>The Bill is by far the most significant reform of the public service to be undertaken since the foundation of the State. It involves the transfer of almost 30,000 staff &mdash; one-half of the civil service &mdash; to the State-sponsored sector.  The reorganisation of the Department has been on the stocks now for a considerable time. The Posts and Telegraphs Review Group, who recommended the change, reported as long ago as May 1979.  The original text of the present Bill was initiated in Dáil Éireann over a year ago. Unfortunately, successive changes of Government delayed the legislation.</P>
      <P>The Bill is designed to implement the 1981 White Paper <i>Reorganisation of Postal and Telecommunications Services</i> which was published after the Government had considered comments on proposals in a Green Paper published in 1980.  As a detailed explanatory memorandum has been published, and as the House's time is limited, I do not propose to comment in detail on each section. Many of the Bill's provisions are, of course, standard provisions which feature in legislation for State-sponsored bodies generally.  I propose to concentrate my comments on the most significant areas of the Bill and, in particular, on the amended provisions inserted by Dáil Éireann on Committee and Report Stages on my recommendation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In considering the details of the legislation <Col N="305" /> and of the reorganisation it entails, important as they are, I suggest that we need to keep constantly in mind the basic purpose of the whole exercise.  This is to improve and develop the national communications services.  There is no hint in these proposals of pessimism about the future, or any question of opting out. The thrust is in precisely the other direction. What we are about is the reshaping of the organisation of a major part of our public sector so as to facilitate growth and development, to take advantage of new opportunities and, in general, to meet public needs better.</P>
    <P>The postal and telecommunications services are major businesses in their own right.  After full and careful consideration, what the review group concluded was that the civil service environment was no longer the most suitable for two such commercially oriented businesses and that a change to State-sponsored status would enable them better to develop and to overcome the challenges facing them in the future.  Those conclusions gained widespread acceptance.  Since my own appointment as Minister, I have become even more convinced that the change will bring significant benefits.  In saying this, I should emphasise that I have nothing but appreciation for the past achievements of the Department.  I do not think there is a Senator on any side of the House who would question the contribution which the services and the staff operating them have made to the national life over a long period.  By showing openess to change and by thereby taking advantage of the opportunities which the reorganisation will offer, services and staff can maintain and strengthen that contribution in the future.</P>
    <P>The choice of form of organisation for a State-sponsored body is between the statutory corporation such as the ESB and CIE on the one hand and the statutory company such as Aer Lingus and Irish Shipping Ltd. on the other.  The Posts and Telegraphs Review Group in their report dealt with this matter, and came down in favour of statutory companies. The basic argument in favour of the statutory company is that potentially it offers scope for greater flexibility.  This <Col N="306" /> is important in the case of the two new bodies.  They will be expected to operate along commercial lines.  The more flexibility they have, the greater prospect there is of their achieving maximum efficiency.</P>
    <P>It should be stressed that the postal and telecommunications services will remain firmly within the public sector and there is no possibility of privatisation of the companies without further legislation. In this respect then there is no difference between the statutory company and statutory corporation form of organisation for the new bodies.</P>
    <P>So far as the legislative provisions affecting staff are concerned, the decision to set up companies rather than corporations makes no difference because the provisions being made to protect the interests of staff are the same as would have been made if corporations were being established.  Indeed, many of these provisions are taken from legislation establishing statutory corporations.</P>
    <P>The objects and responsibilities of An Post are set out in sections 12 and 13 and the exclusive privilege, or monopoly, is set out in section 63.  In essence An Post will be required to provide a national postal service to meet the business and household needs of the State, and also money remittance and counter services. The company's financial duties are set out in section 13, the fundamental requirement being that they shall operate on commercial lines.  The exclusive privilege which is provided for under section 63 is granted explicitly in recognition of the obligation to provide a national postal service and of the general financial duty imposed by section 13, and because a viable national postal system involves subsidisation of some loss-making services by profit-making services.</P>
    <P>The objects and responsibilities of Bord Telecom Éireann are set out in sections 14 and 15 and the exclusive privilege at section 87.  They are on the same basis as for An Post except that, in accordance with a recommendation of the review group, the telecommunications monopoly will apply up to a connecting point in the subscriber's premises. In essence BTE will be required to <Col N="307" /> provide a national telecommunications service to meet the business and household needs of the State.  The exclusive privilege is granted on the same general basis as that of An Post.</P>
    <P>In effect, therefore, both companies are being granted very extensive monopolies for explicit reasons of general public interest.  The ultimate justification for the monopolies will be the performance of the companies in meeting their operating objectives and their general financial duties.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains many important safeguards for the staff who will be transferred to An Post and Bord Telecom Éireann.  Section 45 protects their position in regard to pay and conditions and continuity and security of employment. Section 46 protects the staff fully in regard to the superannuation benefits which they will have earned up to vesting day, and it also provides that payment of benefits, whether earned before or after the vesting day, will have the same security as applies to payment of civil service pensions.  Section 16 requires that each company set up machinery, in consultation and agreement with recognised trade unions and staff associations, for the purposes of negotiations concerned with the pay and conditions of service of their staff.  An Post are required to set up similar machinery for postmasters at sub-post offices.  Section 34 provides for election of employee directors to the boards of An Post and Bord Telecom Éireann and section 81 provides for the election of a postmaster director to the board of An Post.  I would hope that the provisions in the Bill affecting staff will be seen as comprehensively reassuring to the staff who are faced with this major change of status.  I am most anxious that the companies should commence operations with staff who believe that they have been fairly treated and who will, consequently, give their full co-operation to both companies from the outset in the difficult tasks facing them.</P>
    <P>I propose to comment briefly on the proposed financial arrangements for the two companies.  Taking the postal company first, it is proposed that the assets <Col N="308" /> appropriate to the service which are valued at about £32.5 million will be assigned to the company in exchange for shares.  As provided for in section 18, the initial capital structure of the company will accordingly consist of 100 per cent equity capital.  This does not involve a draw on the Exchequer because investment in the postal services was met from the Vote of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and the assets are, therefore, debt-free.  Under section 31 of the Bill, it is also proposed to provide working capital not exceeding £10 million for the company in exchange for shares.  This is the estimated working capital required by the postal service in 1983.</P>
    <P>Section 29 provides enabling power for the Minister for Finance to make an amount not exceeding £20 million available from the Exchequer as current expenditure grants over a period of three years.  This is in recognition of the potentially difficult financial situation which the company will face in their early years.</P>
    <P>Section 29 also contains enabling power to make available not more than £50 million from the Exchequer for postal development, either in exchange for shares or by loan or a combination of these.  In this connection, it is likely that the position set out in the 1981 White Paper will obtain in the years immediately ahead, that is that there is need for relatively heavy capital investment in the postal service during the next five years, that the scale of the programme is large by reference to the fixed assets appropriate to the service, and that it is likely to be some time before the financial position of the company would enable them to contribute in any significant way towards financing a development programme.</P>
    <P>To sum up, the Government recognise that there is a strong case for providing assistance for the postal service during its initial development period.  The enabling provision in section 29 of the Bill will be activated in the light of the development plan produced by the company.</P>
    <P>In contrast with the postal service, telecommunications is a highly capital-intensive service.  By the end of 1983 the current value of the fixed assets is <Col N="309" /> expected to reach about £1,500 million. About £275 million of the assets will be debt-free.  Of the remaining £1,225 million, £725 million represents Exchequer loans and £500 million represents assets financed by leasing arrangements with Irish Telecommunications Investments Limited.  If the debt-free assets only were assigned to Bord Telecom Éireann in exchange for shares in the company, the debt-equity ratio at the end of this year would be over 4: 1.</P>
    <P>Continued heavy capital investment will be needed for development of telecommunications services within the foreseeable future and charges on the £1,225 million loan capital would be a continuing heavy drain on current income.  Having considered the position, it was decided that it would be undesirable to set up the company under such arrangements.  It is accordingly proposed to transfer £355 million worth of assets covered by Exchequer loans plus a further amount, estimated at about £80 million, in respect of leasing charges outstanding to ITI Ltd., in exchange for shares in the company. This is dealt with in sections 10 and 18 of the Bill.  The debt-free assets will also be transferred in exchange for shares.  This will give Bord Telecom Éireann a debt-equity ratio of about 1: 1.1 at the end of 1983.  This is considered to be a satisfactory debt-equity ratio for a public sector company providing, in the main, services which are protected by a statutory monopoly.  Bord Telecom Éireann will be making their own arrangements for the financing of their investment programme in the future.</P>
    <P>As in the case of An Post, working capital will be provided under section 31 of the Bill for Bord Telecom Éireann in exchange for shares.  The value of the net current assets of the telecommunications service at vesting date will be made available to the company as working capital in exchange for shares up to a maximum amount of £150 million, which represents the estimated working capital requirements in 1983.</P>
    <P>The Bill sets out in some detail the powers and functions of the Minister in regard to public policy related to postal and telecommunications services.  It provides <Col N="310" /> for the setting of financial targets for the two companies by the Minister following consultation with the companies and the Minister for Finance and for the publishing by the companies of particulars of the cost-effectiveness of their operations as determined by criteria to be settled by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Broadly, the principle that has been followed has been to allow the companies the maximum freedoms and flexibilities to operate and develop the services while reserving to the Minister the necessary powers of monitoring and control in the public interest.</P>
    <P>I would like to direct Senators' attention to the amendments which have been made to the Bill as initiated.  In all, the Dáil made nearly 150 amendments on my recommendation.  In a debate that went on before this Bill I was interested to hear Senator McGuinness talk about the reluctance sometimes of Ministers to accept amendments.  In tabling the 150 amendments I took very fully into account the views expressed by the trade unions and by Deputies in the Dáil, particularly Deputy O'Sullivan who has contributed massively to this Bill, and also to proposals by Members in the House.  Indeed, I have been criticised for being so open in that respect.</P>
    <P>Since taking office, I have undertaken extensive consultations about the legislation with various concerned Members of the Oireachtas, with the recognised staff organisations and with the two Interim Boards for Posts and Telecommunications. In the course of these consultations, a large number of points were put to me in regard to possible amendments to the Bill.  As I think Senators will appreciate from the number of amendments I moved in the Dáil, the approach I adopted was to do everything that was possible and reasonable to meet the legitimate concerns of Deputies and Senators and of the staff and the interim boards. However, I would stress that the basic form and purpose of the Bill remains unchanged and I am very glad to note that the principle of reorganisation and the legislation generally continues to enjoy bipartisan support.</P>
    <P>The amendments which have been <Col N="311" /> incorporated in the Bill as passed by the Dáil fall fairly naturally into a small number of categories.  An important category comprises those amendments which are designed to meet staff concerns by improving and copperfastening the guarantees and protections for staff who will be transferring to the new bodies.  I will be returning to this subject later but perhaps it suffices for me to say at this stage that I have done everything humanly possible to meet fully and fairly the reasonable concerns and entitlements of staff.</P>
    <P>A second group of amendments is concerned with strengthening the exclusive privileges of the new companies in the provision of postal and telecommunications services.  In particular, there was general agreement that the penalties for breaches of the exclusive privileges, which date back to the 1869 Telegraph Act and the 1908 Post Office Act, were badly in need of review.  Another set of amendments is designed to underline the point that, while the new companies will be given the necessary powers and flexibilities to operate and develop the services to best advantage, the postal and telecommunications services will remain, under the reorganisation, firmly within the public sector.  Amendments have been incorporated to provide that shares in the new companies could not be disposed of by the Ministers concerned without fresh legislation and that the essential reserve powers of the Minister to issue licences for the provision of services within the exclusive privileges of the new companies could only be activated by statutory order and in accordance with specified standards.  Before I came into the House this afternoon my attention was drawn to omissions in two other sections of the Bill which I will be correcting on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Finally, I took the opportunity to propose amendments to the Bill designed to further the interests of consumers, for example, by including an enabling provision to permit me to assign additional functions to the new statutory users' councils.  I am also proposing to protect users of the postal and telecommunications services from interference with their <Col N="312" /> mail and their telephone communications. Two new sections have been incorporated, one to prohibit the unauthorised opening etc. of postal packets, the other to prohibit the unauthorised interception, etc. of telecommunications messages and to regulate the use of overhearing devices.  Breaches of the provisions would constitute offences and would be subject to the penalties provided for in the Bill.  The Government intend these new provisions as important contributions to the privacy and general civil rights of the public who are users of the services.</P>
    <P>In the course of the Dáil Report Stage debate on section 45 of the Bill, which contains provisions relating to the staff to be transferred to the new companies, I undertook to have another look at the section to see whether anything further could be done to strengthen it, and so to allay any residual anxieties of staff who will be entering the employment of the new companies.  I made it clear at the time that I could not see scope for further improvement because the parliamentary draftsman, it seems to me, had done all that he had been asked to do.  The section as amended in the Dáil is designed to ensure that staff will be guaranteed employment in the new State-sponsored companies on terms no less favourable than they have now, and that they will have the same degree of security of tenure in the new companies as applies in the civil service.  I confess that it has been very difficult to see what further amendments could be made to improve the section. However, I will be proposing on Committee Stage two amendments to section 45 which I sincerely hope will remove any remaining doubts and apprehensions.</P>
    <P>I may say that the purpose of the various amendments made and proposed in regard to security of tenure is to ensure by legislation what successive Ministers, including myself, have stated would be the practical situation, that is that the staff's tenure of employment will not be worsened by the reorganisation.  I am satisfied that section 45 as amended will fulfil the solemn undertakings given by me and by my predecessors, and I am <Col N="313" /> satisfied that the boards of the new companies will be scrupulous in ensuring adherence to the expressed intent of the legislation regarding security of tenure. In the unlikely event that it is needed, there is provision for appropriate appeal to the Minister for the Public Serice.</P>
    <P>I am fully aware that this is a vital and sensitive issue for the staff and that is how I have approached it.  I am happy to put it on the record of the House that I am satisfied that the provisions in regard to security of tenure will provide all the assurances and protections that any reasonable person could require and, in particular, that they ensure that the security of tenure of transferred staff will be not one whit less than it would have been if the staff had remained civil servants.  I am sure that that is what the House would wish.  In the section as amended &mdash; assuming the House agrees &mdash; we will not only be giving assurances but we will be repeating and reiterating the assurances three times at least in the same section.</P>
    <P>I would like to say a few words about the services which the new board will be taking over.  The nature and range of the mail services have not changed substantially over the years.  Because of the developed nature of the service, its progress in general has been one of modest growth.  In the past few years, no doubt because of the economic recession and the substantial increases in charges necessitated by inflation, traffic volumes have been stagnant at best although this year there is some indication of renewed growth.  That is not unconnected with the fact that there has been no price increase this year, something I have insisted on since I became Minister.  The quality of service is very good by international standards although we are still somewhat short of attaining our main service objective of delivering 90 per cent of letter mail by the working day after posting.</P>
    <P>An efficient and reliable postal service will enhance public confidence in the service and, when economic activity picks up, enable it to recover lost traffic.  One of the primary tasks of the new postal company will be to continue the efforts of the Department to improve the quality and reliability of the service.  In coming <Col N="314" /> years, the postal business will have to meet increasing competition from alternative means of communications, arising especially from telecommunications developments.  The service does, however, have its own inbuilt advantages. For example, it is unique in its coverage of every home and business in the country. By utilising its advantages and exploiting the opportunities which the new environment will offer, I believe that the service can make steady progress.</P>
    <P>On the telecommunications side, we are now in the fourth year of the five-year development programme which was admitted by everyone when it was undertaken to be ambitious and far-reaching. The programme set six main objectives:</P>
    <P>&mdash;to wipe out the waiting list for telephones,</P>
    <P>&mdash;to convert all manual exchanges to automatic working,</P>
    <P>&mdash;to extend STD to all areas of Northern Ireland and Britain,</P>
    <P>&mdash;to reduce call failure on the automatic system to 2 per cent on local calls and 4 per cent on internal trunk calls,</P>
    <P>&mdash;to answer 90 per cent of calls made via operators within ten seconds,</P>
    <P>&mdash;to provide an acceptable repair service.</P>
    <P>At the beginning of the programme in 1980, the waiting list for telephones was over 90,000 and represented the equivalent of over two years' capacity.  The waiting list at the end of this year will be about 50,000 or the equivalent of eight to nine months output.  That is substantial progress.  Over all, the position is that the target of being able to meet applications for telephones promptly by the end of next year over the country generally is in prospect.</P>
    <P>At the beginning of the programme, about 10 per cent of telephone subscribers had only a manual service provided by over 500 manual telephone exchanges. The programme for completing the conversion of these exchanges to automatic working is on target and should be completed by the end of next year or very largely so.</P>
    <P>STD was extended to all areas in Northern Ireland late last year and to all <Col N="315" /> of Britain in April and June of this year. The overall position now is that some 70 per cent of subscribers here have international dialling to over 70 countries.</P>
    <P>The failure rate on trunk calls within the country at the beginning of 1980 was at the altogether unacceptable level of over 40 per cent.  The present trunk failure rate on routes out of Dublin is now below 20 per cent while the failure rate in the reverse direction is about 16 per cent.  The target this year is to reduce the rate to 12 per cent or so, and a failure rate of 4 per cent by the end of next year is in prospect.</P>
    <P>The speed of answer by telephone operators in many places has been quite unacceptable, due to no fault, I should add, of the operators.  With the extension of automatic service and improvements in the network, however, the way is now being paved for giving a first class service. Already, in Dublin, where the service had been quite poor, the improvement has been dramatic and for long periods all calls, not just 90 per cent, are now answered within ten seconds.  Similar improvements should be possible at other major exchanges throughout the country by the end of this year.</P>
    <P>The standard of repair service when telephone lines go faulty is a critical factor and in certain areas the time taken to carry out repairs has been excessive, in some cases very considerably so.  This will come right over the next year or so although I am afraid that, in some instances, the improvement may be gradual.</P>
    <P>This then is a thumbnail sketch of the service as the board of the new company will find it.  There are undoubtedly plenty of improvements to be made but I think it can fairly be said that the groundwork for a first class service has been well and truly laid by the current development programme.</P>
    <P>The legislation is enabling legislation and, under section 9 (2) of the Bill, it will be the responsibility of the Minister to fix the vesting date for the two companies. A number of detailed transitional matters relating, for example, to staff transfer arrangements, accounts, files and records <Col N="316" /> will have to be dealt with.  In particular, consultations with staff organisations about matters affecting staff will continue following the enactment of the legislation by the Oireachtas because many of these matters would not appropriately be covered by the legislation.  In determining a vesting date, the position in regard to consultations with the staff organisations will be an important factor to be taken into account.</P>
    <P>As I said in my introduction, this matter has been on the stocks for a long time now, and it is in the interests of the services and of all concerned in them that the uncertainty involved should be ended as soon as possible.  My aim, therefore, is to vest the new companies at the earliest practicable date.  For practical reasons, it is desirable that vesting should be on the first day of a quarter, and, at this stage, a reasonable target would seem to be 1 January next.  Vesting will, of course, be sooner if we can manage it.</P>
    <P>In conclusion it would, I think, be appropriate to look to the future.  I know that the interim boards, An Bord Poist and An Bord Telecom, have been drawing up plans for the improvement and development of the services.  I have been most impressed with the commitment of the two boards to the reorganisation, a commitment which, to the credit of the boards and their chief executives, has survived the unplanned delays to the legislation. The period of the interim boards' existence has also been one of continued economic difficulty and the resources which it has been possible to make available to them for planning and for preparing to take over the operation of the services have quite frankly been very restricted and much less than successive Ministers would have wished. Their commitment has survived these difficulties also but, nevertheless, in our early expectations of the boards, we must recognise these realities.  To a degree, the boards have had a thankless task waiting for so long in the wings and I would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere appreciation of the services of Fergal Quinn and Michael Smurfit and the members of their respective boards.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the opportunities <Col N="317" /> and the exciting prospects which are opening up for both companies.  But let there by no doubt about it that the challenges facing the boards are most formidable. No one should expect instant solutions to our communications problem. The new companies will need time to make themselves felt and will need the particular understanding of Government and public in their early days.  I have no doubt, however, that we can look to the future, in the medium and long term, with every confidence that the public and national needs for first-class communications services will be fully met and I confidently commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>The Bill is one that we face with a tremendous amount of trepidation as we have the feeling that it is one of the most important pieces of legislation that has ever been introduced in this House or the other House in terms of numbers of people involved.  It has been said in the region of 30,000 people will be involved.  The amount of money involved is enormous.  The change-over from the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to two separate companies is an enormous operation which will have tremendous implications not alone for the people involved in this service but for the future development of telecommunications and the postal system here.  It is significant that this is being brought in at a time when tremendous changes are being made in particular in the telecommunications area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We welcome the introduction of the Bill to the Seanad.  It is long overdue having been introduced first by former Minister Wilson in May 1982.  The introduction of the Bill at that stage had been held up for quite some time because of the tardiness of the 1981 Coalition Government when there was very little co-operation between the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, Deputy Cooney, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Bruton.  It took some time before the difficulties between those Departments were resolved and but for the intervention <Col N="318" /> of the then Taoiseach in August 1981 the Bill would not have got to the stage it was at in January 1982.  At that stage very little progress was made because the Coalition Government fell.  Negotiations on the introduction of the Bill were cut short by virtue of that.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Wilson became Minister for Posts and Telegraphs he did not let the grass grow under his feet and with the co-operation of the Government the Bill, a major scheme of re-organisation of our communication and postal services, was introduced in May 1982.  The two services encompass two major elements of our national infrastructure serving as they do the economic and social needs of our community.  The transfer of control to the new State-sponsored companies has major implications for the future of the services.  Equally, there are major implications to be considered for the present and future needs of the staff of the proposed State-sponsored companies. Indeed, when Fianna Fáil laid this Bill before the House the preservation of the status of the staff, and the guarantee that they would maintain at least civil service status, was taken into account.</P>
    <P>It would be remiss of me at this time not to praise the work done by Deputy Padraig Faulkner in the preliminary work on the Bill.  In 1979, as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, he announced the decision to launch the accelerated telecommunications development programme covering 1980 to 1984 and in 1979 the Posts and Telegraphs Review Group described the telephone service as being in a state of crisis.  There was a shortage of spare capacity due to underinvestment over a long period and there were growing demands for a service as the economy recovered from the recession of the mid-seventies.  By mid-1979 the service was at an all time low and public awareness of the importance for the country's economy of a high quality communication service was sharpened.</P>
    <P>At the same time there was a huge sense of frustration experienced by workers within the system because they felt the brunt of the public demands which they could not fulfil.  The excellent staff of the Department of Posts and <Col N="319" /> Telegraphs have always worked extremely well and were at all time highly efficient within the very antiquated working conditions which they had to endure. The recognition by the staff at all levels that they could not do their job properly in these outdated conditions was noticeable. It was heartening that they were interested in developing the service they were providing under these outdated conditions and were prepared at all times to work so that a proper means of communication could be given to the Irish people and that the postal service would be as good as it should be.  It is only natural that they should have reservations about a change of employer and a change of working conditions as any worker placed in a similar position would have.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party in their letter of 10 June 1981 from Senator Flor O'Mahony to a member of the engineering union, Mr. Andrew Coleman, and Fine Gael in a letter of 8 June 1981 from Peter Pren-dergast, the secretary of that party, promised to stand over guarantees of employment.  Those guarantees stated that their status as workers within the civil service would not be undermined. The Minister in his opening speech said he is bringing in two more amendments to the Bill which will copperfasten the rights of the workers.  We should not comment until Committee Stage as to the efficacy of those proposed amendments. The workers within the Department of Posts and Telegraphs at all levels are genuine in their hopes for the future of the services that will be provided by An Post and Bord Telecom and they wish to see these services brought up to the highest standard that could be aspired to.</P>
    <P>Since the workers have this commitment it is up to the legislators to take from them the grave worries they have from the point of view of their future employment prospects.  It must be said that since the report of 1979 considerable progress has been made in the telecommunications field.  We must compliment former Minister Reynolds for his diligence in that field.  It could be said that from 1981 backwards we had a cinderella <Col N="320" /> type of operation but since then we have headed towards the &ldquo;speedy gonzales&rdquo; type of change.  It has been very fast indeed.</P>
    <P>It must be recognised by everybody that it would be impossible to bring the service up to international standards overnight but the setting up of two dynamic boards under very excellent chairmen is a good start.  I must congratulate Mr. Smurfit and Mr. Quinn on the excellent preliminary work they have done.  The fine work of the two chief executives must not be forgotten.  I do not think we can forget that when the Bill was introduced first it was opposed by the Labour Party.  The result of the vote on 7 July 1982 was 74 votes for the Bill and 15 against, the 15 being the Labour Party Members.  At that time Fine Gael abstained and they must at least be embarrassed by virtue of the fact that the Bill is being introduced in a form as close as possible to the proposed legislation of May 1982.</P>
    <P>The legislation has wide ranging implications encompassing as it does the restructuring of terms of employment for more than 30,000 people, the greatest number of people ever affected by a piece of legislation.</P>
    <P>It is essential that the greatest possible consideration is given to the provisions regarding conditions of change of employment status, also continuity of service within the new boards and guarantees regarding continuity of employment. The Department of Posts and Telegraphs has been most visible to the public in the past and it will remain in this position when the two boards are set up.</P>
    <P>The boards must get sufficient capital at the outset to ensure as rapid a movement as possible towards viability.  I am glad the Minister in his speech placed emphasis on the need to structure the boards so that they would not be burdened by a liquidity problem in the beginning. Indeed, when one looks at the figures quoted by the Minister in terms of the needs of the two boards one sees that it is essential that they do not run into liquidity problems in the beginning.  Mention was made of £1,250,000,000 of equity being required by Bord Telecom of which £755 million was borrowed <Col N="321" /> from the Exchequer and some of the remainder put up by the investment board set up in 1981.  It is right that the board be set up on an independent basis although I am sure that the workers within the postal end of the business must be worried lest they be overshadowed by the Telecom element.  There is great potential business waiting for both boards.</P>
    <P>The work of An Post can be made viable by the proper use of the excellent staff working in this area and also by the board grasping the nettle and developing the services currently on offer from the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  I believe, with the Post Office Workers' Union, that there is tremendous potential in the extension of the Post Office Savings Bank.  We have witnessed in the past few years the massive benefits which have accrued to the small investor, the wage earner and the small borrower through the extension of both the Credit Union movement and the extension of services being provided by the Trustee Savings Bank.  I firmly believe that there is further room for expansion in this area.  This is an area that must be looked into as a matter of priority by An Post.</P>
    <P>The extension of our excellent telex services is another area that could be expanded.  We have seen a growth of courier services in both letter and parcel fields and it is about time the expertise of the postal workers was harnessed to provide courier services on a continuous and professional basis.  We have seen in the past that people who work behind the counters in post offices have to have a broad range of talents in banking and the postal service.  Social contact is an area that is often forgotten.  Very often the only contact under-privileged people have with public servants is through the Post Office when they go to collect their old age pension, unemployment benefit, children's allowance or deserted wife's allowance.  The people who work in the post offices have to have expertise in the broad range of subjects.  They must also be salespeople.  In the past their expertise as salespeople has been overshadowed to a large degree by the fact that 90 per cent of the places where they work are totally <Col N="322" /> outdated and a throwback to a system which should be done away with. Because they have to have so many talents they are occasionally taken for granted.  With proper organisation of time and resources there is tremendous potential for development of the postal side of that business.  There is also potential, as I have pointed out, for the extension of our mail service.</P>
    <P>On the telecommunications side we, as the Minister said, are in the fourth year of a five-year programme.  Tremendous strides have been made in this area although there are still gaps to be filled. The scope for development in this area is exciting and challenging.  We have within the Department of Posts and Telegraphs the capabilities to develop with the very fast changing technological world.  The world of telecommunications is undergoing immense change and we must grasp the opportunities offered.  I have confidence that a dynamic board with a satisfied workforce working in modem conditions and with modem equipment can work for the good of the community with job satisfaction for the worker going hand in hand with service to the public.  The Minister referred to changes he is going to make on Committee Stage to copperfasten the workers' rights and we will not comment on them until we hear what they are.</P>
    <P>We are looking for the growth of an efficient postal and telecommunications network with maximum protection for the workers who have served the State with distinction for so long.  There are so many facets to be encompassed in the Bill that one would have to be an expert in many fields.  There are many headings in the Bill and a lot of land to be transferred. I hope that this transfer will go through without the legal profession getting a hand on too much of the transfer negotiations and that the cost will not be prohibitive because of the land changes from the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to both boards.  The shareholding element and the proper control of where the shares in the companies go are extremely important.</P>
    <P>The fact that we are getting a properly developed users' council will give great <Col N="323" /> satisfaction to the many people who have been fighting for this for years.  One of the biggest problems any telephone user has had over the past number of years is how to decipher his telephone bill and the answer he gets from the Department of Posts and Telegraphs when he queries the bill.  I hope that with a properly constituted users council it will be easier for the public to find out exactly how much each call costs, how they are monitored and how to find out where calls are made to.  That is an integral part of the operation of telephone services in almost every other country.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope that the board will have a look at the cost of providing a telephone service, the rental charged and the deposits.  From my discussions with many people I am aware that while there was a big demand for telephones which could not be met because of a shortage of lines the situation now is reversed, more telephones are being returned to the engineering branch than there are applications for telephones.  On Committee Stage I will have many questions to put on every section.</P>

      <P>Tá áthas orm go bhfuil an Bille seo os ár gcomhair, mar de réir dealramh tá sé ag teacht leis na blianta. Faoi mar a éiríonn fíon níos fearr le haois tá súil agam go bhfuil an Bille seo níos fearr toisc go bhfuil aois aige faoi láthair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suspect, apart from the fact that it has grown old, that the Bill must have benefitted from the fact that so many Ministers had so much time to check over the Bill. I am sure Senator Lanigan is right in giving credit to some of the past Ministers for the work they have done but, equally, it has fallen to Deputy Mitchell, and his able assistant Deputy Donnellan, to bring the Bill through to us.  The mere fact that they accepted 150 amendments in the Dáil means that the Bill must be pretty accurate in what it is supposed to do.  I should like to compliment them on meeting the problems that have arisen. We have all got letters asking us to solve some of the problems from the people involved in the Post Office.  The fact that <Col N="324" /> we have 150 amendments already means that the problems were listened to and are being tackled.</P>
    <P>This Bill must lead to greater efficiency. Its aim is to improve the national telecommunications services and this is important as an integral function of our country.  We are in the EEC now and we must have a system of communicating with Europe so that business people will not be put off by the fact that they may have difficulty in contacting their competitors or customers.  It is important that protection for the user is in the Bill.  In this day and age of advanced technology it is important that there is protection for the individual whether it is phone-tapping or any other device.  I am glad to see that letters will be protected and the only way to protect them is to make sure that those who are caught interfering with them are punished severely.</P>
    <P>The cost of the installation of telephones seems to be a problem judging by the communications I have got from some of my constituents.  They get a bill for £400 or £500 and no matter how much one needs a phone or how long one is waiting for a phone this demand can be a problem.  I hope the Minister in the future will be lenient especially where there does not appear to be any great need for high charges if the line is within a few feet of the house.  I know it is necessary to pay rental in advance but I do not think people get in a phone to have it taken out immediately.  The idea that the rental has to be paid in advance to make sure that people do not get in a phone for the sake of status and then remove it within a few weeks has gone out the door, in my view.</P>
    <P>The Post Office has given a good service.  I wonder if business has fallen in investments in the Post Office because of a lack of privacy in dealings there.  The same may be said about the banks where there are queues but the banks have developed the art of keeping a few feet between the customer at the counter and the next customer.  The post offices are very open and do not encourage people to do private business in financial affairs. I am glad that the staff have been looked after and the fact that their position will <Col N="325" /> be no less favourable than at the moment is very important.  If the staff are not happy there is no way we will have a good service.  Apart from any change in working conditions and worries they may have, the staff in post offices and telephone exchanges are in the firing line for a lot of abuse because people do not get what they think they are entitled to. I should like to pay tribute to the post office staff who have given such good service often under difficult conditions and working in post offices that have grown away beyond what they were meant to be or in small exchanges that could not cope with the lines they had.  It is good that those who are being transferred&mdash;there was a lot of worry about their working conditions&mdash;will not be worse off than they were.  The Minister is bringing in a further amendment that will make this better.  The Minister has told us that the amended section is designed to ensure that the staff will be guaranteed employment in the new State-sponsored companies on terms no less favourable than they have now.</P>
    <P>I hope the Bill when it is passed will mean we will get a better service and greater efficiency and that it will help everybody to a better way of doing business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to compliment the Clerk of the Seanad, Mr. Tobin, for supplying us with new speakers.  We complained in the first two or three weeks about the speakers and I am delighted to see he has had good ones installed.  They are to our satisfaction and he should be complimented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a former employee of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs I know the staff have given us a good service over the years.  Everything changes and now these services are going their separate ways.  The Bill was brought in under three different Fianna Fáil Ministers, Deputies Pádraig Faulkner, Albert Reynolds and John Wilson.  Deputy Mitchell is the fourth Minister to have this Bill so it is fair to say that probably both sides of the House welcome this Bill were it not for a few very serious problems in it that have to be ironed out before this side of <Col N="326" /> the House will agree to put it through.  We all know that Posts and Telegraphs have 30,000 people.  It is the biggest transfer that has ever taken place in the history of the State and it probably affects over 120,000 people when you take into consideration their families and all the usual different problems there are in dividing a Department of this size.</P>
    <P>I want to stress the importance of the staff involvement in this.  Fianna Fáil made it very clear from the start that we were not going about any political election promises and we made it very clear that when you are a civil servant you cannot be a member of a semi-State body but two people, one from Labour and one from Fine Gael, saw fit to write letters when it was opportune for them at election time.  Maybe they did not think they would get into power, but it happened. They very wisely are coming back to the stance that we took when we were in Government.  At the same time, I do not think that we can underline enough the security that will have to be given to the staff in this change.  I am awaiting the amendments that will come in on Committee State.</P>
    <P>We should have a look, too, at the telephone system for old people.  People who have worked hard and given a life of service to the State who are now 66 years old are entitled to telephones when they are on their own.  We find very often that not alone are they a year or two years waiting but I know one person who is four years waiting for that service.  I would like to ask the Minister of State to have a look into that matter and try to give them a better service in the autumn of their lives.</P>
    <P>I also think that something will have to be done about the way the telephone bills are compiled at the moment.  You do not really know until the bill comes through your letterbox what amount of money you will have to pay for your quarterly bill.  I would like to suggest that whether you are a firm or a business or family that the meter system the ESB have is the fairest system.  The Department should have a look at that system.  I think they have very little option but to provide a fairer system where people can assess <Col N="327" /> their bills and see what is going wrong.  It is very important that the Minister and the Department are seen to be doing something about it because it is the greatest single problem that the telephone section of the Department have at the moment.</P>
    <P>I would also like to stress that they should connect these meters free of charge, as the ESB do.  You know what you are getting when you see it clocking up.  Very often people owe the bills but they are not convinced.  It seems to me that the demand will soon be met because the cost of the demand &mdash; it is not just for the postal services &mdash; will be greater than the need.  If it is to come to that we have then to start looking for customers. When you are looking for customers you can put everything right but when there is a queue you are inclined to give a lesser service.  That is one thing that I wanted to stress.  Probably 15 per cent of the workload of any public representative is querying telephone bills.</P>
    <P>I would like to make another point.  Is it true that all the poles for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs are imported.  If this is the case I want to condemn it and put it on record that I think it is a disgrace if all these poles are imported.  I come from the fastest growing timber area in Europe, the boglands of north-west Meath and we have a lot of suitable timber now maturing.  I wonder if the Department would have a look at the situation and see if something can be done, especially in this time of recession &mdash; we all know we are nearing a depression &mdash; so that we could at least be seen to be making an effort.  I could not believe it when I was told that we were importing timber for the poles for the Post Office.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister to look into the matter of collecting TV licences. This is another area where there is total misuse of a system.  It is being exploited by every person in the country and there is no point in saying that it is not.  The number of people who are evading paying colour television licences in this country is roughly in the region of 150,000. The estimated number paying for black and white licences when they should be <Col N="328" /> paying for colour is 140,000.  When you tot them ail up the estimated cost is £8 million.  If that money was collected there would be no need for an increase in a television licence here for two to three years.  It would also give RTE the very much needed capital that they need to keep their high standards at the moment. They are in real danger because of lack of money.  I want to compliment RTE for having given the Irish people a great service since the foundation of the State. For the last while, due to the economic climate, there are restrictions on any sort of an increase.  We in this House are politicians with the exception of a few. We know that we can do a door-to-door canvass, call practically to every house in a county in a period of six weeks to two months.  I do not see any problem if the Post Office or RTE in conjunction with the Post Office, were to call to every house once every year.  The system we have at the moment is not working.  If it is not working there has to be some way to correct it.  I would like the Minister of State to ask his Department to try to formulate some new system whereby a better effort will be made to collect these outstanding fees.  As far as I am aware, the Post Office are not answerable to anyone if the licences are not taken up. I want to know if that is true.  If it is true we will have to take measures to correct it.  I also want to know if there is a computer in the Post Office to keep a list of names for the purpose of collecting television licences.  RTE, as far as I know, have a computer system in the station. That is one way I suggest to the Minister that would help him and his Department in this difficult task.  It seems to be a very difficult task not only for this year or for last year.  It has been going on for a long number of years.  At this stage that is my contribution.  I hope we will be coming in again on the Committee Stage when we will have more to contribute.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to begin my contribution on this Bill by declaring an interest.  Members of the House should know that I have given professional legal advice to the Post Office Workers' Union on the implications of this Bill and, in particular, on how it might affect the <Col N="329" /> status of the members of the union who at present hold the position of established civil servants.  It is customary to make such a declaration of interest in the circumstances although I would also make it clear that my contribution to this debate is now a contribution as a Senator and I will be concerned in a balanced way with all aspects of the Bill before us.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that the Bill is a most significant measure and a very far-reaching one.  As he mentioned in his opening speech it involves the statutory transfer of almost 30,000 people from the civil service to the semi-State sector.  He refers to that as being approximately half the civil servants in the public service. This is a very major undertaking with far-reaching implications and with obvious implications for those who are being transferred.  Apart from that dimension, which is extremely important, the subject matter of the Bill, the postal and telecommunications service that we will have as a community is clearly of vital interest to us in our economic and social life.</P>
      <P>Therefore, it is worth reflecting, even at this relatively late stage in the legislative process, on some of the basic functions behind the measure.  As the Minister said in his speech introducing the Bill the legislative process and the prior process of consultation has been rather a long one.  He referred to the Green Paper published in 1980 and to the White Paper in 1981 on re-organisation of the postal and telecommunication services and the recommendation that there be a dividing of the services and that they be organised under two separate State companies.  He referred to the fact that it was this company model which was favoured by the review group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of institutional and other issues are raised by that approach.  First of all, it is worth asking whether we are satisfied that is the best approach to the postal and telecommunications services which we wish to have and need as a rapidly developing country and as a social community.  To some extent there is a very basic ideological underlying principle in the approach which can be adopted on this measure.  It is perhaps for this <Col N="330" /> reason, given the political structure of the parties in this country, that there is no great divide between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael on this issue.</P>
    <P>If we look at the experience in other countries we can see this in a very interesting way.  If we look at the experience in the United Kingdom, where they adopted this approach of dividing up the two sectors and transferring them out of the civil service and into the semi-State sector, we are now witnessing, as I understand it, a considerable drive to privatise parts of the telecom sector, the advanced technological sector and there are companies very interested in getting in on that particular sector in a very profitable way.</P>
    <P>The approach in France to this issue is quite different.  The French Government and President Mitterand are not persuaded that it would be in principle a desirable economic and social objective to divide up these two areas and to create separate institutional structures for them. This issue has been debated in a number of other countries, as to what is the desirable way of approaching the matter.</P>
    <P>Apart from that substantive question of whether it is desirable to hive-off telecommunications services and postal services and create separate institutional frameworks for them another serious question is the whole approach to rationalising and avoiding unnecessary duplication. It is inevitable, in the divide of these two areas of services, that there will be a duplication which does not exist at the moment, even a physical duplication in relation to certain premises and certain counter services in premises etc.  It may well be that additional administrative and other overheads will be taken on precisely because of the division of the services.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the framework adopted for doing it.  The recommendation was that the two bodies would be established in the form of companies. This Bill proposes that they would be companies which the Minister would register under the Companies Act. The counter view and the other possible model was that they should be statutory corporations, as the Minister has mentioned, <Col N="331" /> which form the basis of what could be considered to be very similar type of semi-State bodies; the ESB and CIE are two examples.  The advantages of the statutory corporation model for some of the problems that have arisen here is that the Act itself would spell out a considerable number of the issues and the areas to be covered and would then confer on the Minister power by way of statutory instrument to implement in further areas, but the basic framework would be in the legislation.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties in this Bill, detailed as it may be, is that it does not reveal some of the vital areas in relation to two bodies because we do not have copies of the memoranda and articles of association of these two companies.  We do not know in specific detail what will be contained in those memoranda and articles of association.  They can be amended, though not without the prior consent of the Minister but this House will not be told if there is an amendment, to the memorandum or articles of association. It will not necessarily come back to us whereas if the structure was that of a statutory corporation there would be the necessity to come back by requiring a change in legislation or indeed if the Minister exercised his powers by Ministerial Order than the House would be able to see what was in the statutory instrument and consider it.  I wish to place my doubts on record about this, doubts that are fundamental to what kind of approach we should adopt to an essential public service which I regard this as being.  Should we move in the direction of the company model and the ultimate risk of privatisation of the profitable aspects of that company model or should we retain a much greater and structured state corporation involvement which would be less likely to move in that direction? Are we really sure that it is an advance in the provision of the services in question to hive them off and divide them up?  I remain unconvinced of that but perhaps we can come back to this in more detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I noted the Minister's reference to the fact that because of the delay involved <Col N="332" /> since this Bill was intitiated and because of the many representations made to him publicly and privately that he has accepted and introduced in all approximately 150 amendments to the text of the Bill.  I would agree with him that he has been very open in his approach to amendments. I was particularly pleased that he is prepared in this House to table amendments in some key sections particularly in relation to the security of tenure of staff who are transferred under section 45 of the Bill.  I welcome this because it means that our debate will be a much more relevant one on Committee Stage than it might otherwise be.  At this time of the year, in the dying week or two of the Dail, unless a Minister is prepared to state at the start of the debate that he is going to introduce an amendment or amendments and is open to it, then we have lost a great deal of our possible thrust and leverage and although we may be eloquent we cannot really be very effective.</P>
    <P>I do not intend at this stage to speak at any great length on Second Stage because I think the real work on this Bill can be done and should be done by us on Committee Stage.  It is important that we examine this Bill in considerable detail, all sections of the Bill on Committee Stage because unfortunately the Bill ran out of time in the other House and very substantial sections of it were not considered in detail on Committee Stage.  We have an opportunity to influence the final shape of this Bill.  We have a responsibility in that whole sections of it did not get the kind of consideration which the measure warrants on the two main grounds that I was talking about because so many people's livelihoods and futures are affected by it and the subject matter itself is of such vital importance to the economic and social life of the State and as a social service to ordinary people in the country and to consumers of the postal and telecommunication services.</P>
    <P>The kind of questions which I hope we can deal with in considerable detail on Committee Stage would be, for example, the question of the provision by the companies of lossmaking services and the fact that both companies may be required by <Col N="333" /> the Minister to provide services in the manner he prescribes but that there is no spelling out in the Bill of how these are in fact to be funded expressly.  There is no provision for payment for these lossmaking services.  It is interesting to reflect on the present discussions which the Minister is having with another State-sponsored body in a somewhat similar area, with CIE in relation to the form of accounting for services provided.  I hope that we will have an opportunity for some discussion on the aspects of the services to be provided by these two companies, particularly of the postal company, which may be regarded as effectively lossmaking services and how that is to be regulated.</P>
    <P>I also hope that it will be possible on Committee Stage to have a full discussion on the provisions of the Bill which provide for licensing.  I hope the Minister will be open to consideration of further amendment of the Bill in relation to the powers which the Minister has to grant licences directly or on an appeal where a person has been refused by the company. Under section 89 of the Bill there is a provision where a company have been refused a licence where the licence would he within the exclusive privilege granted to the company under section 87 that an applicant may appeal to the Minister against the refusal and the Minister may then grant the appeal and his decision on that would be final.</P>
    <P>In the section dealing with the direct application to the Minister, section 111, where the matter is not within the exclusive privilege of the company and the Minister may decide to grant a licence to a private company the manner of doing so is by order which would then be laid before both Houses and could be the subject of a motion to annul by either House.  It seems to me that there should be a standard protection in both cases for the granting of licences but, in particular, perhaps where the Minister would be granting a licence which had been refused by the company for whatever reason the company advanced at the time.  It would seem to me that it would be more accountable and more in the public interest that the Minister would act by way of <Col N="334" /> order which would be tabled and come from debate if necessary before both Houses.</P>
    <P>I hope that when we discuss the whole question of licensing the Minister will be able to clarify his approach to licensing. It is worrying to see what is at present happening in Britain in relation to British Telecom where there is great deal of economic clout and power behind some of the companies competing for some of the very profitable new technologies in the area of telecommunications.  I would be very concerned at the possibility here that we would see pressure for privatisation of these profitable areas, pressure which we should anticipate at this stage and towards which we should clarify our attitudes and ensure that it does not mean that the Minister's assurance in his speech that there is no possibility of privatisation of a company without further legislation is not undermined.  I am interested that in his opening speech he specifically stressed this when he said:</P>
    <P>It should be stressed that the postal and telecommunication services will remain firmly within the public sector and there is no possibility of privatisation of the company without further legislation.</P>
    <P>As I understand the structure of the Bill, it seems to me that there are two possible routes where there can be some privatisation.  One of them is through licensing.  If there is a licensing to private companies, that fits within my political understanding of what we mean by privatisation here.  The other way in which it would appear to be possible would be by the issue of shares.  It will be important, when we get to the Committee Stage, for the Minister to clarify in a very particular way his understanding of the way in which the provision in relation to the issue of shares would work.  At one reading the issue of shares appears to be very tightly controlled.  For example, in section 21 it is provided that:</P>
    <P>No issue of share capital shall be made other than those referred to in sections 18, 19, 20, 29 and 31, unless the Minister with the consent of the <Col N="335" /> Minister for Finance, has authorised such issue.</P>
    <P>All those sections tightly control the issuing of shares to the Minister who is putting the Bill through or a share to the Minister for Finance or a share to the subscribers in the memorandum of association.</P>
    <P>The holding of those shares is very tightly controlled.  What does it mean that there should be no other issue of share capital unless the Minister has authorised it?  Is he going to authorise very substantial issuing of share capital other than that?  If so, perhaps the memorandum and articles of association would tell us more about that but it is not spelt out at all clearly in the Bill itself.  Of course, a substantial issue of share capital to private subscribers would be a dilution of the State holdings and, to that extent, would be an indirect form of privatisation.</P>
    <P>It is relevant that in section 10 which deals with the names and capital formation of the two companies there is subsection (3) (d) which provides that:</P>
    <P>Each company may, with the consent of the Minister and the Minister for Finance, divide the shares in its share capital into several classes and attach thereto respectively any preferential, deferred, qualified or special rights, privileges or conditions.</P>
    <P>There is a power to divide the share capital into these classes.  Presumably that too is tied into the whole question of the conditions under which there can be further issues of share capital and how this is to work in practice.  We do need to know a good deal more about that area.</P>
    <P>Amendments were tabled recently by the Minister in relation to the creation of new offences, for interfering with postal packages and interfering with telecommunications messages.  Again, these are matters for Committee Stage &mdash; and they are amendments which were introduced at quite a late stage in the debate in the other House &mdash; but it seems they are matters which could have very wide-reaching <Col N="336" /> implications and could possibly extend the Minister's power in the area of telephone tapping.  They can be considered carefully on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Also on Committee Stage it would be useful to discuss an aspect of the activities of the postal company which has not received sufficient attention and which would warrant very clear understanding by Members of the House of the way in which this will be developed, that is, the possible banking-type services which may be developed, as has already been referred to by Senator Cassidy, and the whole role of the savings bank and the extent to which this has not developed in as productive and high-powered a way as would make it of substantial service to a broad section of the community.  For example, the Japanese have developed their savings bank services through a somewhat similar structure.  I mention this because at the end of his speech the Minister specifically suggested that it would be appropriate to look to the future but he did not say anything specific in this area.  The speech is full of very woolly phrases, that he is impressed with the commitment of the two boards, that there are opportunities and exciting prospects but also that the challenges facing the boards are most formidable.  This really does not give us any true indication of the real situation which these two new State companies will be facing.  We need to know that.</P>
    <P>Most of us have some idea of a fairly realistic nature of some of the problems. For example, what is the position of the telephonists who at the moment are finding that advances in technology are in fact effectively depriving them of their present position?  What is their position if they are transferred to a State company? What is their future development within that company?  What is their security of tenure within that company?</P>
    <P>It is these economic realities which we should not disguise or run away from which are in the background of the deep concern of the staff affected in their security of tenure.  I have already welcomed the fact that the Minister has committed himself to bringing in amendments to section 45 and we can look into this in a <Col N="337" /> much more detailed way on Committee Stage.  Apart from the copperfastening of the guarantee that there would be no worsening or that the provisions in relation to security of tenure would be no less favourable, we will have to have a very full understanding of section 45 (5).  What is meant by the express reference there to the minimum notice in terms of the Employment Act, 1973?  That Act excludes people who are in the civil service from its application by expressly referring to it here, given that it is a measure requiring a certain period of notice for lawful dismissal.  How is that reconcilable with the full security of tenure which is at present held by the staff in question as established civil servants? That is a very important question which will have to be fully discussed and thrashed out.</P>
    <P>Another dimension of this Bill which must be further discussed on Committee Stage is the protection of consumers. Again, I accept that the Minister has brought in an amendment which has strengthened to some extent the users' councils but I would submit that the Bill does not, as yet, adequately protect consumers of postal and telecommunications services.  We should be aware of the vulnerable position of some consumers &mdash; I agree with Senator Cassidy here &mdash; particularly of elderly consumers or those who need a telephone as a life-line or as an essential part of their lives within the community.  The users' councils are not, as yet, enabled to voice the criticisms or concerns of consumers and there are not the kind of safeguards which would take into account such worries and criticisms as consumers have had in the past and have been unable to express.</P>
    <P>It is a more efficient deployment of time to reserve any detailed discussion of the points I have raised until we are looking at the sections on Committee Stage because we have got an open door on amendments in view of the Minister's openness and attitudes on this.  Therefore, we have a real possibility in this House of making a constructive and effective contribution on the terms of this Bill.  I look forward to taking up the points on Committee Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>This legislation has been described as far-reaching and significant and I certainly agree with that description. Clearly it has massive implications for many people and the Bill is one we will have to consider in great depth.  As has been suggested by other speakers, many of the problems in the Bill will be dealt with on Committee Stage.  I would like to refer briefly to a number of the points in a general way.</P>
      <P>The first one which seems to be very important in this particular context is the users' councils that are mentioned in the Bill.  These are badly needed.  I do not have to mention that questions dealing with telephone accounts, telephone bills, repairs and telephone tapping take up as much as 20 per cent of the politicians' time.  There is a great deal of disquiet among consumers in regard to the matters I have mentioned.  There are as many as 20,000 queries at the moment regarding telephone accounts.  This seems a very high number but it has been suggested that it may be correct.  I have the personal experience of querying an account, of receiving an answer saying that the account was right and then two days later receiving another letter saying that there had been a clerical error of £400.  I will always remember the case of a colleague of mine on the Athlone Urban District Council, Councillor Frank Waters, who received a bill for £5,800 when he thought that the bill should have been in the region of £14. After months of querying, the matter was finally sorted out.  So that type of situation does exist and the need for competent users' councils is clear.  The full rights of the users' councils should be established at the outset.  It should certainly be a function of each council to encourage the board to develop the most efficient service possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Post Office Savings Bank has been referred to.  We all know that their share of the market has dropped from 15 per cent to 3 per cent.  This situation should not exist.  The Irish people should support this group but there must be very good reasons for their lack of support.  The attitude of successive Governments to <Col N="339" /> savings has not helped the situation. There is no reason whatever why the Giro system could not be introduced in the Post Office system.  They have a nationwide outlet and it is something which could be implemented with some degree of ease.  The present Minister in his recent Finance Bill has not given people any incentive to save.  It seems to me that if this attitude continues, anything connected with the State or a semi-State organisation in this area will be avoided by the people.</P>
    <P>While there are more than 100 sections in the Bill, obviously the most important of all is that dealing with the human Element, the staff of the present organisation. A previous speaker referred to the telephonists.  They must certainly be worried as to what their role will be having regard to modern technology and equipment which will continue to be a feature of life for them.  We have a clear responsibility to allay the fears of the very large workforce which will enter into these two semi-State bodies.  The fear and suspicion is very deep-rooted.  Security of tenure is something which these people worry about.  While the previous speaker, Senator Robinson, rightly declared her interest at the outset in saying that she had a vested interest, it is a very great pity that she did not talk to her colleague, the National Director of Elections for the Labour Party, Senator Flor O'Mahoney, about a letter he wrote on 10 June 1981 or to Mr. Prendergast of the Fine Gael Party about his letter dated 8 June 1981. In the letter written by Peter Prendergast he stated; &ldquo;In addition, such moves will not involve loss of civil service status&rdquo;. Senator Flor O'Mahoney in his letter stated &ldquo;We also confirm that any reorganisation must take into account the present status of workers within the civil service.  That status will not be undermined&rdquo;. These letters, more than anything else, caused all the problems.  These promises &mdash; election promises as they were &mdash; are now causing more concern and trouble for the people concerned than anything else.  That is why these people were protesting outside the gates of Leinster House last week because the <Col N="340" /> election promises could not be implemented, as they were told by the then Minister, Deputy Reynolds.  Yet letters were written indicating that these promises would be fulfilled.  That was wrong. It was an election gimmick that caused, and will continue to cause, problems in this area.</P>
    <P>As other speakers have said, we will have a further opportunity on Committee Stage to tease out the problems in greater detail.  This is a huge undertaking.  The implications for the people concerned are enormous.  I hope that when the two semi-State bodies come into being we will have what we have at present, a happy and content workforce.  That should be the aim of any administration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a most complex piece of legislation.  The staff of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs get, to put it mildly, lambasted for alleged inefficiencies.  I would say we have come a long way.  Looking at the enormous list of Bills referred to, the enormous amount of legislation which has to be repealed, the enormous complexity of its operation nationally it can be seen that the employees of the Post Office have come a long way.  I am sure this was not achieved with 100 per cent enthusiasm but they have not put forward spurious claims, the sort of thing that sections of our media like to focus on when trade unions are involved, but claims born out of very legitimate concern for their own welfare.  In the whole discussion about the future of the telecommunications area it is important to remember that central to that will be the obvious willingness of the employees of both the putative companies to work in a new environment and to seek what are quite reasonable concessions to protect their own future.  In all the discussions credit should be given to the unions and their members for what seems to me to be the very progressive and reasonable way in which they have approached this entire proposal.  I hope, therefore, that their very reasonable concern for their security will be well met by the Minister's proposed amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When people are concerned about <Col N="341" /> their own security it is also important that the definition of the work should be clearly laid out.  Concern has been expressed to me, for example, about the absence of a precise definition of what constitutes a postal packet and the enormous commercial gains to be derived if private companies can concentrate on a small section of that market where there is high demand and low cost and, therefore, make a fortune and leave the loss-making enterprises to An Post.  It is regrettable, therefore, that there appears still to be some ambivalence in the Bill about that.  I hope we can discuss that aspect at some length on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>If these companies are not commercially viable, no amount of legislative guarantees can give people the security of a decent job.  They may have a job but if the companies are not commercially viable this whole great undertaking may be undermined and we may have further legislation.  For companies to be commercially viable in an area where there are considerable legislative constraints and impositions on those companies to meet what could be described as social needs, it is important that in the areas of commercial activity their monopoly should be protected.  There is nothing wrong or shameful about public service monopolies.  There is a tendency developing in this country, probably an over-spill from our nearest neighbour, where anything in the public service that is a monopoly in inherently assumed to be worse than any other possible model. This is not the experience in this country. There have been problems with, for instance, the telecommunications service, but it is fairly well known that those problems did not arise from a lack of planning within the telecommunications service but from a lack of response to those plans by successive Governments. When we say &ldquo;typical public service&rdquo; because there is something wrong with our telephone service, in fact it is not typical public service: it is typical Irish politician who, because there was not any immediate response or demand for extensions in the telecommunications service five or six years ago put that large <Col N="342" /> and major capital investment on the long finger until the crisis hit us straight between the eyes.  Now we have a crash programme to try to catch up with the losses of the past ten years.</P>
    <P>It has been consistent, in public and in the media, to attribute the inadequacies of the telecommunications service to the fact it is in the public service.  The real reasons for the inadequacy is lack of capital, lack of planning and lack of technical expertise.  The lack of capital is directly linked to the fact that the plans that were produced were ignored and the lack of technical expertise is related to fairly insensitive embargoes on recruitment which often made it difficult to recruit highly skilled, highly specialised, and inevitably highly expensive, staff who were needed at various stages of development. The whole mythology behind this, that there will be a transformation just because it is being moved from the public service to being a semi-State corporation, is simplistic and almost the product of ideology than of any realistic assessment of what is going on.</P>
    <P>If these proposals are to be successful &mdash; and I hope they will be &mdash; they will be successful because the new companies will be properly managed and properly capitalised.  If they are properly managed they will have a responsive, organised, hard-working staff with high morale. That is the function of the management of these companies: to produce staff who work hard and whose morale is very high. It is not the function of the staff to provide management with the rewards, the incentives and the plans which are management's duty to produce.  We have a tendency, again in the public service, when things do not go right to point the finger at the employees who fail to carry out a job and take the responsibility away from management whose job is to plan and operate the four functions of management, namely, staffing, organising, planning and controlling.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I hope that when these companies are reorganised we will have a proper management structure, where accountability and responsibility are delegated to the maximum possible extent, and not have a centralised organisation. <Col N="343" /> I do not know the details of the management structure, and I doubt if they are being thought about yet.  What we do need is to avoid any attempt to wait and see and blame the staff.  What I am coming back to is that we have obviously had considerable goodwill from the staff of these organisations.  It is extremely important that this goodwill should be sustained and, therefore, it is extremely important that the structures and decision-making should reflect their concerns, their interests and their priorities. Their obvious priority in this day and age is their own security and I hope that the amendment promised by the Minister will do that.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other areas in these proposals that are welcome.  One is the facility to set up a national banking service through the Post Office.  It is a pity that we will still have to wait for Ministerial orders which will be inhibited by the lobby of the private banking sector. It would be a very welcome development in this country if there was a public banking service with the full facilities of the banks and the full range of banking services.  It would be an interesting and ironic fact that there would then be a public sector banking service open five and-a-half or six days a week from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. providing a full banking service and the allegedly high efficient, allegedly highly competitive private capitalist banking service closing at 3 o'clock in the afternoon, closing for lunch and providing a much less adequate service. Perhaps the apologists of the private sector and the critics of the public sector could explain that to me.  I await with interest the ministerial orders which would enable An Post to set up a full and comprehensive banking service. It is badly needed.  What is badly lacking in this country is any banking competition in the banking services.  Once we get a Giro bank system within the Post Office there will be an enormous new flexibility in opening hours and various other services in the private banking sector. Whatever is wrong with a public sector monopoly, it is not half as bad as a private sector monopoly.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="344" /> I wish the Minister well.  This is a huge undertaking.  I am confident, because I know the trade union movement well enough to know the capacity to respond to new situations.  I am confident that, given goodwill and given sensitivity to people's very serious worries, these major concerns can be a success.  I must reiterate that I wish half as much notice had been given to the flexibility and capacity to respond to change of the employees of these companies as is usually given to the occasional displays of stubbornness and unwillingness to change on the part of the trade union movement.  The fact that we have come so far is a tribute to the Minister's staff but also to the employees of both these companies.</P>

      <P>I wish to thank the Senators who made contributions to the debate on this Bill.  It is my intention to try to reply in some detail to what they have said.  First, I wish to make a few general remarks in relation to the Second Stage of this Bill.  It is approximately five years since the Post and Telegraphs Review Group were set up and four years since they submitted their report.  The period since then has been one of uncertainty for all concerned, for the staff, for departmental management and for the interim boards. It is in the interests of the services and all the parties I have mentioned that the prolonged period of uncertainty be brought to an early end.  I am, therefore, anxious to have the new companies vested at the earliest practicable date, certainly not later than 1 January 1984.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to avail of the opportunity once again to place on public record my appreciation of the services of the interim postal board chaired by Fergal Quinn and the interim telecommunications board chaired by Michael Smurfit.  They have given more than generously of their time and energy and have displayed an extraordinary sense of commitment to the task they have undertaken.  I know they are ready and anxious to move from planning to the implementation of their plans.  I am more than anxious to be able <Col N="345" /> to permit them to do so as soon as possible. We are fortunate to be able to command the services at nominal cost of men and women of the calibre of those serving on the interim boards.</P>
    <P>The new companies will commence operations at a time of continuing economic difficulty.  It would be futile to believe that reorganisation will result in overnight solutions to the problems of our telecommunications services.  We are providing many new freedoms and opportunities for the companies, but we cannot by legislation provide them with the magic wand which would be necessary to achieve instant solutions to all problems.  Patience and understanding will be necessary in the short term but in the medium- and long-term future, I believe that we can be confident that the public and national need for efficient postal and telecommunications services will be met by the new companies.</P>
    <P>The postal company, An Post, faces a particularly difficult financial situation in its early years.  Postal charges were increased very substantially in recent years to overcome the losses being incurred.  Charges were not increased this year and I know that the new company would wish, for marketing reasons, to hold prices at or somewhat below the rate of inflation.  This is likely to result in losses until such time as the marketing strategy results in the necessary growth of mail volume.  That is one of the reasons why section 29 provides enabling power for the Minister for Finance to make an allowance not exceeding £20 million available as current expenditure grants over the first three years.  The telecommunications company, Bord Telecom Éireann, should attain profitability quite quickly.  As time goes on a major investment programme should yield very significant benefits.  For example, when it is completed it should be possible to double the number of subscribers without a further major increase in infrastructural investment.  The company will be in a position, and will be expected, to remunerate State equity investment.  In short, the financial future of the telecommunications services looks quite bright.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Donnellan)</NameTxt>
      <P>On Committee Stage I will be proposing amendments to sections 73 and 89, in addition to those to section 45 to which I referred in my opening remarks.  The amendments to section 73 and 89 are designed to remove any inconsistency between these sections and section 111 (1) wherein the grant of licences by the Minister to permit persons to provide postal or telecommunication services which are within the exclusive privilege of the companies must be done by order.  The amendments will require that any licences granted by the Minister following appeal under the provisions of sections 73 and 89 must also be by order.  It is my intention to appoint a statutory interim board provided for in section 50 as soon as possible after the passing of the legislation. It has not been possible, in the absence of statutory authority, to delegate functions to the existing non-statutory interim board.  Section 50 will provide express statutory authority for the delegation to each of the interim boards of any of the functions to be assigned under the Act to the relevant company.  This will give flexibility to permit various transitional matters to be dealt with effectively and so facilitate the smooth change-over on the vesting day of the new companies.  There are many transitional matters to be attended to arising out of the separation of the services from the civil service, for example accounting and organisational matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said in my opening speech, I am particularly concerned that staff should be fairly treated and that they should believe they have been fairly treated. Only if this is so can they be expected to give their wholehearted co-operation to both companies in overcoming the difficult job which they are undertaking.  My approach has been to do everything within reason to provide statutory guarantees which will remove the natural anxiety of staff facing such a major change. I believe that the Bill as it stands should <Col N="347" /> remove any cause for apprehension regarding pay and conditions, including superannuation and security of tenure. However, in deference to further representations I will introduce amendments to section 45.  I trust that this will put any remaining fears at rest.</P>
    <P>Senators Lanigan, Browne, Cassidy and Fallon referred to the telephone billing system.  There is undoubtedly some public perception that the telephone accounts system was unsound and as a result the tendency has been for a high proportion of subscribers to question their bills.  The telephone billing system is basically sound.  The metering and other equipment used are highly reliable and are the same as those used in many other administrations.  The great majority of inquiries into telephone accounts queries give no reason to alter bills issued.  What must be borne in mind is that increases in charges in recent years have resulted in higher bills and in subscribers being more conscious of the cost.</P>
    <P>Action has been taken in a number of ways in recent months to try to improve the public perception of the billing system and to make the public more aware of how bills are made up.  These include showing the number of automatic local call STD units charged on a bill and the issue of a leaflet to all subscribers explaining how the account is prepared, rental, automatic call charges and calls made through the operator.  In addition, a series of open days have been held at several exchanges throughout the country where customers are shown how calls, manual and automatic, are recorded. These will be held at the other main centres as the opportunity presents itself. Every care is taken in dealing with bills and queries.  When a subscriber questions his bills and calls are out of pattern the meter readings are checked and the meter and associated equipment are tested.  If a subscriber continues to be dissatisfied and the case is serious, arrangements are made in agreement with the subscriber to place a printed meter check on the line which records the calls that were made and to where but not the content of the call.  This record is <Col N="348" /> then compared with the subscriber's own record.  Meters are now available for renting to subscribers who want them for installation in their own premises.  The meters are in effect replicas of the meters in the Exchange.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to introduce detailed billing of trunk calls experimentally in the Naas area in the last quarter of this year.  The extension of this to other exchanges where the capacity to do so exists, or can be provided, will be considered in the light of the trial.  There will be a charge for detailed billing to cover the cost of the equipment and processing involved for those who opt for detailed billing.  The billing system will continue to be given close and continuous attention to improve it in every way possible to restore public confidence in it.</P>
    <P>Senator Cassidy asked me to consider what could be done to provide telephones more quickly for old people.  Naturally enough I share his sentiments but I would say that the general idea is to eliminate longer delays in providing telephone service for people generally.  As the Minister pointed out in his opening speech, our expectation is that telephones will be available on demand by the end of next year in most parts of the country.  Senator Cassidy also wanted to know where the Department purchase telephone poles.  I cannot give him an answer off the cuff, but I can say that wherever it is practical and economic to do so the Department buy all their equipment within the country.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson raised the fundamental question of the appropriateness of making the change of splitting the services between post and telecommunications. All I can say at this stage is that the review group and the interim boards as well as successive Ministers have been convinced that the best way forward is to remove the services to the State-sponsored sector and to set up separate companies to run the postal and telecommunications services Senator Robinson seemed to associate the company form of organisation with the risk of privatisation. There is no such association and indeed the example quoted by the Senator in Britain demonstrates this.  The <Col N="349" /> organisations being privatised there were set up as statutory corporations rather than statutory companies.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson also raised the question of whether the Minister could issue additional shares.  The formula for calculating the authorised share capital of the company is expressly confined to not exceeding the value of three specific items arising under the Bill subject to rounding odd sums to the nearest half million or million as appropriate.  These items are the property to be transferred to the companies, the working capital to be made available to them and any money up to a maximum of £50 million which the Exchequer may make available to An Post for capital purposes in return for shares.  An increase in the companies' authorised capital share would, therefore, require amending legislation in order to provide for the issue of shares to the public.  Sections 19 and 23 of the Bill preclude the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs respectively from selling or otherwise disposing of their shares in the companies.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan referred to opportunities for the development of existing postal services and the Post Office Savings Bank.  The Bill provides ample scope for development of existing services. There is nothing to stop them from developing a strong marketing function and I know the interim board have plans which are well advanced.  With regard to the banking services, the Bill removes obstacles to the development of the Post Office Savings Bank.  This is dealt with in section 104.  Section 67 provides enabling power for the provision of banking services generally including the Giro system.</P>
    <P>Senator Cassidy referred to the evasion of television licence fees both on the part of those not paying at all and those paying a fee for black and white instead of colour television sets.  Campaigns are mounted regularly to detect evaders with considerable success.  Legislation exists requiring dealers in sets to register with the Department and to supply particulars of persons to whom sets are sold or rented.  A computerised system relating to collection of TV licence fees is also being introduced. The campaign which is now in operation <Col N="350" /> also has yielded quite an amount of revenue.</P>
    <P>Finally, I will refer to a point made by Senator Lanigan, who is not here at the moment.  He seemed to pay tribute to almost every ex-Minister for Posts and Telegraphs who belong to a certain political party and who were responsible for bringing forward this legislation.  To be fair about it, the present Minister has brought in 150 amendments to this legislation, therefore it would be fair to say that he has a particular input into it in that direction, and it was Deputy Cooney who cleared the heads of the Bill in Government.  I would like to pay tribute to all the people who contributed in any way and I do not think it is the particular property of any party.  Amendments are for the purpose of securing a better Bill for the benefit of all concerned, for the services of consumers and for the employees.  I would like to thank all Senators for their contributions.</P>

      <P>I indicated today that it is necessary for this Bill to be returned to the Dáil if we are to make amendments to it on Committee Stage.  In the course of the present debate there have been indications from some Senators that they wished to move amendments.  Senator Robinson in the course of her address indicated that she would not deal with a number of points in detail because it would be more appropriate to go into them on Committee Stage.  The House must face the fact that there is liable to be a substantial debate on Committee Stage of this Bill.  I would wish to see that debate held without any restrictions but of course if we are in an effective amending House it must be done before the other House rises.  My own preference certainly would be that we should take up Committee Stage when we meet tomorrow morning.  I understand that there are Senators wishing to offer amendments who feel that to ask for that is to put undue pressure on them in <Col N="351" /> regard to considerations of Committee Stage.  I have no desire to press them unduly in this regard and I would suggest, therefore, that Committee Stage be taken on next Tuesday and that the House would meet on Tuesday morning rather than Tuesday afternoon.  I make this proposition in the hope that Committee Stage would not only be commenced on Tuesday but concluded on Tuesday.</P>

      <P>That Bill has been with us for some time.  I had indeed hoped that we might take it either today or tomorrow but with the amount of business which we have I see little hope of it <Col N="352" /> being taken tomorrow.  Equally I see little prospect of legislation coming through the Dáil this week so that I have a firm hope that we can take the Community Service Bill next week.  We should sit on Tuesday for the Postal and Telecommunications Services Bill and I would hope that we would continue then on Wednesday to take the Committee Stage of the Local Government Bill and take the Criminal Justice (Community Service) Bill and possibly the EEC motion.  We have lots of work to do.</P>

      <P>Ar dtús, tá an-áthas ormsa an deis seo a bheith agam ceist na modh-scoileanna i Luimneach a chur os comhair an Tí seo agus os comhair an Aire.  Iarraim ar an Aire tosach láithreach a dhéanamh maidir le atógáil na Modhscoileanna i Luimneach.</P>
      <P>I am very grateful indeed for the opportunity of raising in this House the important question of the immediate rebuilding of the Model Schools in Limerick and of highlighting the totally unsatisfactory and unacceptable conditions endured by the pupils and teachers of the Limerick Model Schools for the past six years.</P>
      <P>The model schools were burnt down on 3 September 1977 and since then all the children have been taught in pre-fabricated classrooms, now amounting to 16 units in all.  It is interesting to note that when planning permission was given by Limerick Corporation regarding the erection of these units it was given on the clear understanding that it would be for a three-year period and on a temporary basis in order to allow the Department of Education and the Board of Works to commence the permanent redevelopment of these schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must say that all the public representatives in Limerick and myself in particular are very disappointed that there has been a six-year delay in the rebuilding of this very important school.  At the time of the fire in 1977 the pupil enrolment in the model schools stood at 350 pupils, <Col N="353" /> 175 boys and 175 girls.  Now in 1983 the pupil enrolment stands at 463, 239 boys and 224 girls.  This considerable increase in the student population of the school clearly points out the urgent need for its immediate rebuilding.  An increase in six years of 33 per cent, or 113 pupils, indicates the commitment of the people of Limerick to the Irish language and using it as a medium for teaching other subjects. The model schools were opened officially as far back as 1855 and have operated since 1931 as all-Irish schools. They are the only scoileanna lán Ghaeilge in the whole Limerick area.</P>
    <P>The increase in enrolment clearly indicates the great demand for this type of education in Limerick and its environs. I would like to point out to the House that the schools serve not only Limerick city but over 20 parishes in Limerick and its environs.  What I have said so far indicates the unique, significant and special role of the model schools in the education of the Limerick school children. The schools have carved out a special niche for themselves in the history of education.  As a teacher, I readily acknowledge the expertise and wonderful dedication and commitment of the teachers.  These pupils are excellently prepared and have won distinctions for themselves at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>In addition, I want to refer to the significant fact that the Minister for Education herself is in fact the patron of the schools and a departmental inspector is the manager of the schools.  That is very important at a time when we are talking about changes in the curriculum and pilot projects in the whole area of education.</P>
    <P>Finally, I am aware that the Minister of Education has approved grants amounting to over £925,000 and that these will be adjusted and obviously will come to one million pounds or so eventually. The full cost of this project will be met by the Department of Education. This will include the incorporation of the existing facade of this excellent building. The Board of Works gave us an assurance late last year and again earlier this year that it was expected that the bill of quantities and working drawings would be <Col N="354" /> ready by August of this year.  I am still hoping that tenders will be invited at an early date.  For all those reasons I appeal to the Minister of State on behalf of the pupils, teachers, parents and past pupils to put in hand the immediate rebuilding of the model school and, if possible, to indicate an approximate date for the commencement of the work.</P>
    <P>I should like to thank the Cathaoirleach for giving me the opportunity of raising this serious matter and I look forward to hearing the Minister of State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. J. Bermingham)</NameTxt>
      <P>Limerick Model School which is the property of the State was severely damaged by fire in September 1977 and the major part of it is a burnt out shell with walls and chimneys standing.  The school children are at present being housed in prefabricated classrooms on the site.  We accept that the accommodation in the prefabs is not satisfactory.  Careful consideration was given to the restoration of the damaged building in the proposals for a new school and it was considered that it would not be feasible to provide classroom facilities up to current educational standards in the restored building and the restored area would be under utilised.  Our original proposal was to demolish the remains of the building and build a completely new school.</P>
      <P>In October 1980 the Department of Education informed the Office of Public Works that it had decided that a new co-educational school containing 12 classrooms and offices for inspectors should be erected on the site independent of the old building.</P>
      <P>In December 1980 the Office of Public Works wrote to Limerick Corporation saying that restoration of the burnt out structure would not be a viable proposition and asked for its observations on our desire to demolish the old structure and build a completely new school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In March 1981 Limerick Corporation indicated to the Office of Public Works that complete demolition would not be acceptable and insisted that the facade and central block be retained because of strong local interest in the building.  In <Col N="355" /> deference to the views of Limerick Corporation, and we presume Limerick people in general, the Office of Public Works engaged the services of a structural engineer to advise on the stability of the structure and the feasibility of retaining the front section of the building including the facade.  In July 1981 the engineer confirmed that the front walls were structurally sound and could be reutilised.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works then agreed to prepare sketch plans for the reconstruction of the front portion of the building to provide offices for the Department of Education inspectors and ancillary facilities for the school and the erection of a new school block at the rere. The sketch plans were completed in October 1981 and had then to be sent to the quantity surveyor for costings.</P>
    <P>In February 1982 the quantity surveyor submitted a cost plan for the proposals. The period of time was unusually long because of the complex nature of the proposals.</P>
    <P>In June 1982 the Department of Education approved the proposals.  In July 1982 the Office of Public Works sent the plans to Limerick Corporation for their observations under section 84 of the Planning Acts.  In September 1982 the corporation approved the proposals subject to some minor amendments.  In October 1982 the Department of Education sanctioned a full-cost grant towards the cost of the project.</P>
    <P>Before advanced planning could be progressed the Office of Public Works <Col N="356" /> learned of a change in the school accommodation and sought clarification of this from the Department of Education in February 1983.  In April 1983 the Department indicated that 16 classrooms would be required.  Working drawings for the new block are virtually completed and advanced plans for the restoration work are in hands.</P>
    <P>The next step is the completion of a cost plan by the quantity surveyor and then the preparation of bills of quantities. It is hoped to have all the contract documents completed in about five to six months time.  The time required for the preparation of contract documents may seem long but this is a very large undertaking made difficult by the need to restore the damaged building.</P>
    <P>When the contract documents are completed, the Office of Public Works will be in a position to invite tenders subject to the approval of the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the Office of Public Works have met the reasonable requirements of the various local interested parties. I am also satisfied that there has been no delay on the part of the Office of Public Works in handling this matter. Having regard to the fact that a revised brief was received in April of this year, good progress has been made.  All concerned may rest assured that the matter will be brought to a conclusion as soon as is possible.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 9.35 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 30 June 1983.</P>
