      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 in that order.  I do not want to curtail discussion on No. 3 in any way but it is hoped to get to No. 4, which is a Private Member's Bill, shortly after 4 o'clock and certainly not later than 5 o'clock, so that we can give the proper three hours to the debate on it.  For the information of the House I should like to say in regard to No. 4 that, following strong representations from the Labour Party group before lunch, and in consultation with my colleagues in Fine Gael, we have agreed not to move the amendment to No. 4.  I take it that there will be agreement in the House on that.  We will continue the discussion on the Second Stage of No. 4.</P>

      <P>Senator Ferris said that the Housing (Homeless Persons) Bill will be debated for three hours.  That applies <Col N="356" /> to a motion.  This is a Bill.  Is the debate on the Bill confined to three hours also?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer to a matter which was raised the last time the Seanad met.  Senator Lanigan asked about the position of the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities.  On that occasion the Leader of the House, Senator Dooge, said he would inquire into it as a matter of urgency.  Although it has its own staff and has a prior record of meeting, that Committee has not yet come together.  I do not know whether the acting leader of the House would be able to inform the House as to whether there is any further development.  That committee potentially could be dealing with one of the most important problems facing this country, the whole question of the super-levy and the financing of the budget of the Community.  It has not met although the motion was passed in July last, together with the motions establishing the other committees.  This is a very serious issue indeed because it has staff. It is one committee that has staff and it has not been able to meet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>To go back to the previous subject, I am delighted to welcome the decision of the Government not to proceed with the amendment to No. 4.  This matter should be fully discussed and should be given a full Second Stage debate.  Whatever about taking three hours, does this mean that we necessarily have to vote on Second Stage today, or can it carry on to next week?  I was not aware of a three hour rule for a Bill.  I just want to know whether there will necessarily be a vote on it this evening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>It would probably take me three hours to say all I have to say. Obviously there will be difficulties.  What I really want to ask is about a person from Northern Ireland whose only crime that I could see was that he happened to wear a uniform.  Last week he was pumped full of lead and brought to his death.  We live next door to the police station in Bally-money. That man left at 8.30 p.m. and before he could get home he was dead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="357" /> I want to ask are the participants in these Anglo-Irish talks aware of the great urgency there should be in dealing with the Northern problem.  If you lived in Northern Ireland you would realise that society is disintegrating around us.  When I attend funerals of people I have known, when I see innocent people lifted from the streets, when I see total disintegration all around us, I indict both the London and Dublin political establishments for not giving this matter the urgency it deserves after 15 years &mdash; longer than the first and second World Wars, the Anglo-Irish war and the Civil War.</P>

      <P>I wanted to ask the same question as Senator McGuinness.  We will not necessarily have a vote on item No. 4 this afternoon, or do I misunderstand the acting leader of the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to get this clarified. The Order of Business is: Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.  On the question of timing, the acting leader said he hoped to have Nos. 1, 2 and 3 finished before 4 o'clock.  Is that right?  I thought we had at least two hours left for the motion on the action plan for Irish.  Then we have No. 4.  I cannot see that we can confine No. 4 to three hours or any length of time.  If we start Second Stage we will have to continue until Second Stage is finished.  Then we have to take No. 5.  Is it intended that we will finish at 8.30 or will we go on after 8.30?  We agree with the Order of Business as it is, but the timing of that order is distinctly peculiar.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather confusing and, subject to the reply from the acting leader of the House, you may have to allow further discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with Senator Robinson's point first because it is a different point from the other subject.  I know that the Leader of the House, Senator Dooge, has been trying to resolve the problem raised by Senator Robinson <Col N="358" /> at the previous sitting.  Up to today the matter has not been resolved.  I am sorry I cannot be more helpful.  It is certainly the desire of the Leader of the House to meet the wishes of the Seanad in regard to the EEC Committee.  I know he is using his good offices to that effect.  I am sorry that I cannot be more positive about it but certainly it is not our fault.  Our office has been trying to have this matter dealt with speedily.</P>
      <P>With regard to the other questions raised by Senator McGuinness, Senator Ryan, Senator Lanigan and other Senators, it was agreed with the mover of the Bill that today three hours would be allocated to the Bill.  It does not necessarily mean that the Second Stage will conclude today.  There is no intention on our part to curtail the discussion to three hours. There will be a three-hour debate today on the Second Stage.  We will adjourn the debate after three hours and continue it on another day by agreement.  On the question of whether we will have Nos.  1, 2 and 3 completed by 4 o'clock, I said that I did not want to curtail any speeches.  It depends on who is offering to speak on No. 3.  If we have not concluded the motion on the Irish language by 5 o'clock, in fairness to Senator Ryan we will take his Bill then and we can reorder No. 3.  I had hoped from discussions I have had with various Senators that it could be completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is agreement that there is no particular problem about No. 1.  Because of my anxiety to clear the Order of Business today I have not mentioned anything about adjourning for tea.  We will decide that later with the Whips and the leaders of the groups.  I want to try to arrange the business in an orderly fashion so that Minister who will be responding to the Bills will have some idea of when I will want them to be available to the House and the movers of the motions will also have some idea about when their business will be taken.  That was the only reason I suggested times.  I hope there will be agreement that we will get to No. 4 on the Order Paper by 5 o'clock so that we can have a full three hour debate &mdash; with due regard to what Senator Ryan wants <Col N="359" /> about which many of us are concerned. We want to try to facilitate this in every way possible on this side of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. W. Ryan</NameTxt>

We will have gone on to 9 o'clock then.  We have another Bill coming up later, No. 5 on the Order Paper. I suggest that we conclude the housing Bill not later than 8 o'clock.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Senator that I do not intend to ram any legislation or any motion through this House.  I have always been liberal in my attitude to people.  It is my intention to finish the Order of Business today.  If that means sitting late, I hope I will have the cooperation of all the Senators in doing so.</P>

    <Title>Dentists (Amendment) Bill, 1983: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>
      <Col N="360" /> Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. F. O'Brien) Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. F. O'Brien)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. F. O'Brien)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Dental Board was set up under the provisions of the Dentists Act, 1928.  Its principal functions are to maintain and publish the dental register every year and to investigate allegations of professional misconduct by members of the profession. The board has nine members: one nominated by the Government, three nominated by the Medical Council and five, who must be registered dentists resident in the State, elected by the registered dentists so resident.  Elections of registered dentists to the board are held by the board itself.</P>
      <P>The Government recently approved the preparation of new legislation for the regulation of the dental profession by way of a Bill to replace the Dentists Act, 1928.  This legislation will provide for the abolition of the Dental Board and its replacement by a body to be known as the Dental Council.  Until such time as the Dental Council is established it will be necessary for the Dental Board to continue in existence.</P>
      <P>In the normal way a new membership of the Dental Board would be appointed for a period of five years from 14 November 1983 and this would involve holding an election of registered dentists.  In view of the proposed new legislation which will abolish the board, the new membership would have a very limited life.  The setting up of a Dental Council under the proposed new legislation would involve a further election of registered dentists. As the new legislation is expected to be introduced in the Dáil in the current session there would be no great interval between these two elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dental Board feel that an election of members to a new Dental Council, if it were to follow shortly on one for the board, might generate only a limited response from the profession.  This would obviously be an undesirable beginning for the new council.  The board have also <Col N="361" /> drawn my attention to the financial implications of holding two elections of registered dentists within a short period.  For their income the board rely on registration fees from dentists and their current financial situation is not entirely satisfactory. They must meet the costs of holding elections of registered dentists from their own funds.  Since the new council would take over the assets and liabilities of the Dental Board these funds would have to bear the costs of the two elections, thus worsening an already unsatisfactory financial situation.</P>
    <P>In view of the circumstances outlined, the board asked me to examine the possibility of extending the term of office of the current membership until such time as the new council has been established. The Dentists Act, 1928, provides no mechanism by which the current term of office can be extended beyond the specified five years.  I am satisfied that it would not be appropriate to proceed with the appointment of a new membership to the Dental Board now, so I am proposing to provide, by way of this Bill, for a two-year extension of the term of office of the current membership.  I would expect that the proposed new legislation to replace the Dentists Act, 1928, which will, <i>inter alia,</i> provide for the setting up of the Dental Council, will be enacted well before the expiry of this extended period of office so that the members will not necessarily serve out the full two-year period.</P>
    <P>I hope I have made it clear why this legislation is necessary and I ask for the co-operation of Senators in its passage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>It goes without saying that we agree with the purpose of this Bill. The Minister said he is seeking an extension of the period from five to seven years.  He has given us the reasons why this is necessary.  The Minister told us we will soon be having legislation to deal with this problem which will incorporate the existing Dental Board into a new Dental Council.  This presumably will be enacted within six or nine months.  Why the two year extension?  While the Minister has given reasons for that, the fear <Col N="362" /> would be that after two years the other Bill which the Minister proposes to introduce might drag on for a further two years.  I would have preferred a ministerial order, if that were possible, extending the life of the present board to June, or even for 12 months.  That would be giltedged in that the legislation the Minister refers to would be compieted by then.  I have that little fear and perhaps the Minister will comment on it and guarantee that the legislation will be introduced as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>The Bill is quite simple but nonetheless there are aspects of it that should be referred to.  Before I move on to those aspects which I hope will be incorporated in any new Bill it is only right to say that the Dental Board are a respected and well-regarded group of people.  The dental profession see them as a very worthwhile watchdog and fly-by-nights and people coming in from other countries are watched carefully.  I think the board are to be congratulated for their efforts. It is important not just from the dentist's point of view but from the ordinary patient's point of view that this should be the case.  That is the case and, as I said, congratulations should be given to the board.  It is important to say that when we talk about this problem and the problems of dentistry, we must stress the importance of educating young children about the prevention of dental decay. This is vital and I hope full emphasis will be placed on it when the new Bill is being drafted.</P>
      <P>There are certain criticisms one can make of the existing scheme.  For example, 50 per cent of the children of Ireland who are eligible for treatment are denied that treatment.  To me that is scandalous. I am not attacking any particular Government for that, but all Governments over the years.  The fact that 12 year old to 16 year old children are not catered for in some way is also wrong. The other thing that we all know is totally wrong, and hopefully will be rectified in the new Bill, is the fact that the wives of social welfare contributors are not eligible for treatment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is not controversial. One point is relevant to this Bill and to any future legislation and I would be very anxious to hear the Minister's comments on it.  If I were a dentist I would be annoyed about the fact that dentistry in Ireland is under the umbrella of the Department of Social Welfare.  To me it is clearly a matter for the Department of Health and it should be seen as such. Particularly in the field of dental surgery there are medical matters that must be dealt with.  The ordinary dentists in the various towns must have a knowledge of all aspects of medicine.  Their very training is medical.</P>
      <P>The British Association of Oral Surgeons stated recently that to be members of that organisation people must have a clear medical qualification.  The training embraces very many medical aspects and these people have to deal with medical problems in dental surgery.  The ordinary dentist in any town in Ireland might have to know all about the drugs a heart patient is taking, or a kidney patient, or a person who has had a heart operation. The dentist must know these things.  It is totally acceptable that this area should be under the umbrella of the Department of Health.</P>
      <P>To conclude, this is a non-controversial Bill.  We are all waiting with interest for the Dental Council Bill that will be with us in the near future, we hope.  We have no objection to this and we look forward to a worthwhile debate on the next important piece of legislation in this area.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to join with Senator Fallon in welcoming the proposal by the Minister of State to extend the term of office of the existing Dental Board until such time as the new Dental Council comes into existence.  It does not mean that the lifetime of the existing Dental Board will last for two years, but it will last until the new Dental Council comes <Col N="364" /> into existence.  I hope the Minister of State will indicate to the House when he will be in a position to introduce the new Dental Bill to replace the Dentists Act, 1928.  Those of us who are members of health boards will agree that the existing dental service provided by the boards is unsatisfactory and inadequate at the moment.  As has rightly been said in the Dáil and by Senator Fallon, 50 per cent of the children who are entitled to the services at the moment do not receive them.  That is a matter of serious concern. The ratio of dentists is a matter that deserves special consideration.  There is a 25 per cent dentist vacancy rate in a number of health boards.  Also the important role of the orthodontic service deserves recognition in the new Bill.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil the Minister indicated that he was concerned to look after the housewife who has to remain at home.  He pointed out that the introduction of a new scheme would cost in the region of £5½ million.  I have no doubt that the Minister of State is the type of man who will see that justice is done to the housewife who remains at home and who currently is not entitled to dental care arising from her husband's contributions.</P>
    <P>I agree also that the question of extending dental service to the 12 to 16 age group should be examined.  It is very important that there should be positive consumer representation on the new Dental Council because that is the best way to protect the patient.  In all matters of medical and dental care the patient must be of paramount concern.  I appeal to the Minister to give earnest consideration to having the consumer represented on the new Dental Council.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister every good luck in his work.  As Senator Fallon has said, it is a non-controversial Bill and I am sure it will have the full support of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with Senator Fallon and Senator Kennedy.  I am deeply disappointed that the Minister sees fit to give this board another two years to serve.  In the crazy situation out there the new Dental Council should be appointed now.  Quite a number of dentists are upset at the fact that we are <Col N="365" /> passing a Bill which will leave us with a chaotic situation for another two years. Under the Dentists Act, 1928, we have a dentist working for a health board for £15,000, and his colleague down the street is making £40,000 and paying less tax.</P>
      <P>I am interested to note the change in attitude of the Coalition Government here this evening.  They are leaving one board intact.  To date they have removed any board that was there when they took office ten months ago.  The Dental Board must be all the right colour.  The Minister is leaving them there for another two years.  I have not actually looked at their credentials but they must be right because that board is being left while other boards were shoved aside because they were Fianna Fáil-orientated.</P>
      <P>Leaving the dreadful situation of the care of children's and adult's teeth as it is, the Minister of State says he does not want somebody to be involved in a second election in a short period.  It was a pity the Government did not adopt that attitude before.  If they had we would not have had three elections in 18 months, but we are not worried because we know we will be back.  The World Health Organisation said that every dentist should look after 1,500 children only. The situation is so bad here that we have 3,500 to 4,000 children being looked after by one dentist.</P>
      <P>I am asking that the Dental Council be set up straight away because of the dreadful conditions that exist and the long waiting lists.  Senator Kennedy is a member of the Mid-Western Health Board and he is well aware of the situation.  Yet he stands up here this evening and says the right thing to do is to allow this service to go on for another two years.  At the next meeting of the Mid-Western Health Board he should look at the figures on the two to three years waiting list in Clare, not to mention the other services that are required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Minister will note kindly my remarks.  What I am concerned about is the service being provided for children. It is no use telling them in two years time <Col N="366" /> that we will have a new council and they will cure all their dental problems.  The system is crazy.  I am amazed at my colleague's warm welcome to leaving this board for another two years instead of bringing in this council and getting this whole mess cleaned up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe I am very naive, but I look on this legislation in a totally different light from Senator Honan.  This is just an enabling piece of legislation to ensure that the Dental Board are legally functioning so that dentists will be registered until the new Bill is introduced. There is nothing sinister in it.  If there was an ulterior motive we would not be putting the council in for two years.  We would be putting them in for five years if we were worried about their affiliations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather unfair to pass a remark like that.  Senator Honan is so intelligent and so involved in the health care world that she knows the legality of what we are trying to do.  She certainly is concerned about the service being given. As a member of a health board, I am ashamed at times of the service given by boards in the area of dental treatment. People legally entitled to free treatment on a medical card cannot get dental treatment simply because the health boards cannot recruit sufficient dentists to do the job properly.  That is a pity.  We are confining our service to schoolchildren and children in that age group.  All the adults are being left without care or attention, except if they have social welfare contributions, which only entitles men and not their dependants to the dental service. That has nothing to do with this Bill.  I share the concern about the lack of service given to medical card holders by health boards in the dental area.</P>
      <P>This is an enabling piece of legislation and if we do not pass it, the Dental Board would be illegal and would not be able to register more dentists.  Then the situation would be twice as bad.</P>
      <P>I commend the Bill to the House for the reasons the Minister stated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>While I appreciate what Senator Ferris says about the necessity for measures to make the Dental Board legal in the interim period, I would on the other hand have a great deal of sympathy with what Senator Honan has said because if we give a period of two years, human nature is such that nothing will be done during that period.  If, for instance, the Minister would agree to cut the period to six months, it would concentrate the minds of those who have to produce the new Dental Council and the legislation to cover it, and they would produce it within six months.  I am a great believer in the use of the severe deadline. I know perfectly well from my own experience, and from experiences of all sorts of organisations, that if you say a thing has to be done within two years they will not actually start being serious about it for about 18 months, whereas if you say it has to be done in six months they have to concentrate from the very beginning.  I support Senator Honan in that.</P>
      <P>I agree with other Senators &mdash; while it does not arise directly from the Bill &mdash; in their criticisms of the present service. This matter is very urgent.  I would draw particular attention to the question of orthodontic treatment which was mentioned by Senator Kennedy.  As I understand it, at present when national schoolchildren who are entitled to free dental treatment get it, the dentists do not even mention the fact that their teeth need straightening or that they need orthodontic treatment, because the same dentist knows perfectly well they do not have a hope of getting that treatment before they leave the national school.  This means their teeth are neglected until they get into the secondary school and their parents have to pay a private dentist maybe £500, £700 or £800 to have this orthodontic treatment carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also agree with Senator Kennedy about consumer representation.  We all have teeth and some of us as consumers might like to bite with them.  I would like to see consumer representation, and consumer representation with teeth, on the new Dental Council.  All professions need some regulating from <Col N="368" /> the outside and from the consumers' point of view, I admit that straight away, and this would be an ideal opportunity to introduce this.</P>
    <P>There is one other old chestnut of a question which I would ask the Minister, but old as it is it is still an urgent one: what has happened to all the plans for a new dental hospital in St. James', because as far as I know the Dental Hospital is still practising in Lincoln Place?</P>

      <P>This is very important to the dental profession.  They are still struggling away in that indescribable building in Lincoln Place.  Perhaps out of courtesy the Minister would give us some reassurance that some progress is being made because anyone who has been in that place with children knows what it is like and how urgent it is to replace it. Many years have passed since the new dental hospital was promised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnRobb" hpid="Mr. Robb Mr. Robb">

      <P>I noticed when reading through the Dáil debate that the Minister at a meeting with the Irish Dental Association in Galway stated that the new Bill would be introduced in the Dáil in the current session.  As a person who is extremely suspicious of institutional power, the covert power of institutions &mdash; to reinforce what Senator Honan and Senator McGuinness have already asked &mdash; I want to know, why two years?  Being a member of a profession, I have some justification for being suspicious.  When I took up my present post in a non-prestigious hospital and I was left with only one supportive staff, I wrote to the appropriate institutional body and I was told that the only answer to my problems was to arrange to have two of the three hospitals to which I was attached blown up to force the people to accept centralisation of the services.  You can see I have some feeling about the way in which central institutional management works.  I am reminded &mdash; and I am sure this applies to the dental profession as well as to the medical profession &mdash; what Ivan Illich who wrote the book <i>The Appropriation of Health by the Professions from the</i><Col N="369" /><i>People</i> said in the first line of that book &ldquo;the medical establishment has become a major threat to health.&rdquo;  I cannot speak for the dental establishment but I suspect from some of the things I have heard, that there are vested interests which at a time of an increasing number of graduates, increasing third level education, prevent Ireland from having enough dental graduates to meet its needs.  There is no reason why our universities cannot produce enough dentists.  Senator Honan mentioned the World Health Organisation recomendations, one dentist to 1,500 children and one dentist to approximately 3,000 adults and the fact that Ireland has only one dentist to 6,000-odd, but the question arises: why are there not enough dentists?  I think the Minister must address himself to that point in the preparation of this Bill.  How are the people who cannot afford private treatment going to get the treatment they need?  Somewhere in the legislation there must be an obligation on the professions to provide the service to meet the needs of the ordinary people and only then should they be allowed to indulge in private practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to consumer representation with teeth, as somebody said, it is easy to have representation which is a sop to consumer frustration.  It is easy to put a few tame consumers on boards and have them making decisions remote from where the action takes place.  In his contribution in the Dáil debate, Deputy Mac Giolla brought up the whole area of the operative in dental surgery, the payment to the operative, the conditions of the operative, the knowledge of the operative and the insights of the operative into the dangers of what he is doing. I suggest here, as I have suggested elsewhere with regard to my own profession, that, when we spoke about representation it was time we brought the three legs together &mdash; the professional, the operative and the consumer.  I would like to see in the statute an obligation to bring together once a year the people who use that particular practice &mdash; the people who work in that practice and the professionals who have their unique contribution to make.  They would discuss the problems <Col N="370" /> of dental health so that they would become aware of the needs at local level, and then they could pressure on the institutions as well as on the Government to respond to that need.</P>

      <P>One small point on the Bill which will be before us very shortly. When will we have the new legislation? Obviously it is overdue.  So far we have not had a replacement of the 1928 Act although there have been many changes in all areas of medicine.  I think it is disgraceful.  I would like to ask the Minister a straight question: when will we have that legislation before the House?</P>

      <P>Firstly, I want to thank Senators for their contributions. They were all very helpful and any points that dealt with dentistry will be taken into account.  Concern has been voiced by many Senators, particularly Senator Fallon, with regard to the two years.  I want to emphasise that I was talking about one year but legal advice said it would be better to make it two years.  The board remains only until the new legislation is passed.  Once it is passed the new Dental Council will be constituted.  I do not think people should read the two year situation as being procastination. There is no intention of doing that.  I am very anxious that this Bill would be enacted as soon as possible. It is long overdue, as Members said, and it is important that we do something about it.</P>
      <P>Senator Honan mentioned the necessity for having the Dental Council because of the lack of services.  I would like to point out that the Dental Board have no say whatsoever with regard to the functions of the services provided. Their function is basically to deal with the regulation of the profession, and not to services provided by the dental profession.  A number of people asked when the Bill will be introduced.  All I can say is that it will be introduced in the current session; it is still with the parliamentary draftsman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators raised the point about consumer <Col N="371" /> representation.  It would be my desire that we cater for that in the new Dental Council.  People should have a contribution in any consumer service that affects them.  I want to assure the House that that will happen.</P>
    <P>Senator Fallon raised the question about transferring dental services from the Department of Social Welfare to the Department of Health.  That is my ambition as well.  There are reviews going on with the dental profession at present and when they are completed we will be in a better position to make moves in that direction.  I agree with the Senator that this should be in the health area because it is about health.  Senator McGuinness said we should have a six months time limit because that is the only way to get things done.  We are in the business of legislation and once one starts introducing embargos and time schedules on any kind of legislation it is a recipe for bad legislation because everyone is under pressure.  If we allowed that to happen it would not be in our best interests.  I would not want to see that happen.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan raised the question about the World Health Organisation making a statement and giving numbers on the dentist-patient ratio.  I do not know where she got that information. The World Health Organisation have made no such statement on dentist-patient ratio.  I accept the point that there should be ratios&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is not a question that this board is appointed for two years and that it must stay for that period.  This is not so. As soon as the Bill is passed, the council will be appointed and the board will fall. I want to make that quite clear.  In other words, if we can get the legislation through by Christmas and appoint a council, the board goes.</P>

      <P>In relation to the point the Minister made &mdash; and which I understand <Col N="373" /> is a difficulty many countries have had, not so much today as they had 15 or 20 years ago &mdash; at a time of shortage and when so much of the national wealth is involved in training dentists, is there no way one could impose an obligation that there would be some return in terms of years' service for training received?  One cannot oblige people to stay &mdash; and one would not want to live in a country where one was obliged to stay forever &mdash; but I feel that in a privileged profession, like dentistry or medicine, where there is a shortage and where the country has gone to the trouble of training people, there should be some obligation for a return on that investment.  People should have to agree to serve a short period to help when there is a shortage of professional help.</P>

      <P>I would not disagree with the Senator's sentiments. I believe considerable sums of money are spent not only in the dental profession but in every profession.  All we can do is appeal to these people who owe society a debt and say that the best way to repay it would be by making a contribution of their profession for, say, a year.  As a professional, the Senator's voice could carry in this area.  All professions could make this contribution because of the money spent on training. It would, in my view, engender a new spirit in our society, a spirit of wanting to give on a voluntary basis and not giving because they had to sign a contract.  That is not the kind of society anyone wants to live in.</P>

      <P>Senator Robb has made a good point which the Minister or the Government might consider.  We should insist that these people give some service to the nation that educated them. In the teaching profession, as students we had to pay a certain share of the money towards the course and the rest was subsidised. Some fees are very high in comparison to others and we had to give a commitment to give ten years service or buy our way out of the service as is done, for example, in the Army.  It should be <Col N="374" /> insisted upon within the educational sphere when taking places at university that in return they will give service to the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  If the Government feel it is not possible to bring in the recommendations we have heard, surely the other alternative must be to train more dentists.  If they are not prepared to do that, then the consumer representation if it is to have &ldquo;teeth&rdquo; will have something to say about the matter.  If the Government are not going to take more interest, or if they cannot get people to give some service to the nation in return for education received, then if we set up a council and various committees at local level with consumer bite, the consumer will insist that he gets proper dental care for his children.</P>

    <P>Early signature by the President is necessary in this case because in the normal way the Bill would not be signed by him until 14 November 1983 at the very earliest. <Col N="375" /> The term of office of the Dental Board expires on 13 November so that in that event the board would not be in existence at the time of the signing of the Bill.  The Government have had legal advice that the provisions of the Dentists (Amendment) Bill, 1983, would in fact have no effect if the Bill failed to be enacted before the expiry of the term of office of the Dental Board.  In the circumstances early signature by the President is essential to give effect to the provisions of the Bill.</P>

      <P>Bhí mé ag caint an lá deireannach faoi thábhacht na Gaeilge le féin-mheas a chothú sa tír i measc muintir na tíre.  Ba mhaith liom sula dté mé ar aghaidh, comhgháirdeas a dhéanamh le Bord na Gaeilge as ucht an phlean ghníomhaíochta seo atá curtha romhainn. Is plean réadúil agus praicticiúil é, plean gur féidir é a mheasúnú agus leoga tá sé curtha romhainn ag an mbord gur cóir é a mheasúnú.  Tá na costais aimsithe go cruinn agus tá spriocanna leagtha amach.  Is plean é gur féidir é a ghníomhú agus ní plean, mar adéarfá, ar bharr na gaoithe é.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom focal a rá faoi chostas. Tá géarchéim airgid sa tír ins an am atá i láthair, deirtear linn, agus tá eagla orm ó thaobh costais de go mbeidh an chontúirt ann go ndéarfadh daoine nach bhfuil an Ghaeilge &mdash; cé go bhfuil sí <Col N="376" /> tábhachtach &mdash; nach bhfuil sí tábhachtach go leor agus b'fhéidir go dtiocfaidh linn an plean seo a chur ar an mhéar fhada. Tá an dainséar sin ann.  Ach tá sé tuigthe san am atá i láthair, fiú amháin san Eoraip, chomh tábhachtach agus atá na mionteangacha agus caomhnú na mion-teangacha agus tá sé tábhachtach go dtuigfimís nach dtig linn an rud seo a chur ar an mhéar fhada.  Tá sé ráite sa chaipéis, ar leathanach 7 &mdash; agus béarfaidh mé an píosa díbh atá mé ag caint faoi &mdash;&ldquo;Ní chuirfear an athbheochaint i gcrích ach de thoradh mór-ghníomhaíocht diongbhálta. Ar an luas a bhfuil an teanga ag meath sa Ghaeltacht seans go mbeidh uain na pleanála caillte laistigh de 10 mbliana eile.  Is léir go mba tuar báis don athbheochaint ar fad an Ghaeltacht a bheith imithe i léig níos mó ná mar atá.&rdquo; Is é sin le rá muna ndéantar gníomh anois beidh sé ro-mhall faoi cheann cúig nó 10 mbliana agus ní dóigh liom go dtabharfaidh na glúnta atá le teacht maithiúnas dúinn má ligimid don seód atá againn bás a fháil.  Tá sé sa nádúr ag daoine nach dtuigeann siad chomh tábhachtach a bhíos rud go dtí go mbíonn sé caillte agus ó thaobh na Gaeilge de bhéadh sé rómhall an tábhacht a aithint dá mbéadh sé caillte againn.</P>
    <P>Ag caint arís ar chostas agus caitheamh airgid de, ba chóir a chinntiú go bhfuil an t-airgead atá á chaitheamh le caomhnú na Gaeilge á chaitheamh go héifeachtúil agus tá rud amháin ba mhaith liom a rá anseo ó thaobh na gcoláistí samhraidh de.  Is maith an rud ar fad na coláistí samhraidh agus ní dóigh liom go bhfuil dóigh níos fearr leis an Ghaeilge a fhoghlaim ach a bheith sa Ghaeltacht ag na coláistí samhraidh agus an Ghaeilge thar timpeall ar na daoine agus sna títhe.  Molaim go mór an obair atá déanta ag coláistí samhraidh ach ba mhaith liom a rá gur chóir measúnú a dhéanamh ar na coláistí sin.  B'fhéidir go bhfuil cuid acu ag cur níos mó béime ar Mhammon ná mar atá ar mheas na teangan.  Chím i gcáipéis Ghael-Linn polasaí a chuir siad amach faoi oideachas i nGaeilge i 1981 go bhfuil sé molta fosta go ndéanfaí measúnú ar choláistí na Gaeilge: is é sin le rá a chinntiú gurab í an teanga agus caomhnú na <Col N="377" /> teangan an rud is tábhachtaí agus nach é Mammon mar atá ráite agam.</P>
    <P>Anois tá roinnt gnéithe tábhachtacha ba mhaith liom a lua agus ní féidir liom achan rud atá sa cháipéis seo a lua.  Tá trí rud déarfainn is tábhachtaí má tá an teanga le caomhnú, agus an chéad rud an Ghaeltacht.  Mar adeir an cháipéis, tá staid na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht ag dul i léig.  Níl dabht ar bith faoi sin.  Is ón Ghaeltacht mé féin.  Caithim cuid mhór ama i nGaeltacht Thír Chonaill i nGaoth Dobhair agus cluinim anois na páistí féin le roinnt blianta ag caint Béarla i gclós na scoile.  Tá an Béarla ag teacht isteach i ngach gné de shaol na ndaoine sa Ghaeltach. Cad chuige sin.  Tá roinnt réasún. Tá mé ag déanamh gurab é an chéad rud ná an forbairt tionsclaíoch atá déanta sa Ghaeltacht le blianta anuas, agus is maith an rud an forbairt tionsclaíochta. Ar ndóigh, thug sé daoine ar ais go dtí an Ghaeltacht agus choinnigh sé daoine sa Ghaeltacht a chaithfeadh imeacht thar sáile gan na monarchana a bheith ann, ach tá eagla orm go raibh, mar atá i gcuid mhór rudaí sa tír, easpa pleanála ag dul i bhfeidhm anseo.  Is é an rud a thárla nuair a tugadh na monarchana isteach sa Ghaeltacht nach raibh pleanáil fadtéarmach déanta agus, mar shampla, ní raibh oibrithe ar bith sa Ghaeltacht a raibh an Ghaeilge acu agus a raibh na scileanna acu le dul ag obair sna monarachana sin.  Ní raibh bainisteoirí ar bith ón Ghaeltacht; ní raibh ceardaithe ar bith ón Ghaeltacht.  Is é sin ní raibh plean fadtéarmach leagtha amach agus nuair a cuireadh na monarchana ar bun b'eigean daoine a thabhairt isteach nach raibh Gaeilge acu agus bhí droch thioncur ag sin sin ar an Ghaeltacht mar a thuigfidh daoine go furasta.</P>
    <P>Nuair a bhí Béarla agus Gaeilge ag muintir na Gaeltachta ba é an rud is fusa i bhfad ná go dtosnódh muintir na Gaeltachta ag caint Béarla sa dóigh go dtuigfeadh na daoine a tháinig isteach iad, agus mar sin d'éirigh an nós imeasc muintir na Gaeltachta a bheith ag caint Béarla. Tá sé tábhachtach, dá bhrí sin, go mbeadh monarchana sa Ghaeltacht ach tá sé thar a bheith tábhachtach go mbeadh oiliúint ar siúl do bhunú na Gaeltachta sa dóigh go mbeadh siad ábalta <Col N="378" /> jobanna a ghlacadh ag gach leibhéal sna monarchana, is é sin sa bhainistíocht agus in obair go bhfuil scileanna ar leith de dhíth faoin a choinne.  Mar adeir an cháipéis, má théann an Ghaeltacht i léig níos mó nó an Ghaeilge sa Ghaeltacht i léig níos mó níl seans ar bith ag athbheochaint na Gaeilge.  An dara rud tábhachtach ná an media.  Tá tionchar, is dócha, níos mó ag an media ar shaol na daoine anois ná rud ar bith eile go mórmhór an teilifís agus an raidio. Ba mhaith liom ar dtús cúpla focal a rá faoi Radio na Gaeltachta.  Tá sárobair déanta ag Raidio na Gaeltachta i gcaomhnú na teangan.  Ar an gcéad dul síos, tá caidreamh curtha ar siúl acu idir na Gaeltachtaí agus idir muintir na Gaeltachta ar fud na tíre agus is rud maith é sin.  Mothaíonn muintir na Gaeltachta i Tír Chonaill anois nach bhfuil siad leo féin, go bhfuil Gaeltachtaí eile, agus an caidreamh sin ar siúl eatarthu.  Chothaigh sé fosta agus tá sé ag cothú meas agus bród as an Ghaeilge i measc muintir na Gaeltachta.  Rud eile ba mhaith liom a lua faoi Raidio na Gaeltachta tá se ag freastal ar phobal Gaelach Thuaisceart na hÉireann agus sin rud an-tábhachtach. Tá a fhios agaibh nach bhfuil na háiseanna céanna i dTuaisceart na hÉireann agus atá sa taobh seo tíre ó thaobh na Gaeilge de agus is mór an rud Raidio na Gaeltachta a bheith ar fáil do Ghaeilgeoirí an Tuaiscirt agus tá a fhios agam féin go n-éisteann cuid mhór leis agus da bhrí sin ba mhaith an rud é a leathnú amach agus b'fhéidir é bheith ar siúl i rith an lae.  Rud eile tá mé ag déanamh gu féidir a dhéanamh le cuidiú le Gaeilgeoirí an Tuaiscirt ó thaobh Raidio na Gaeltachta de ná iriseoir lánaimseartha a chur ar fáil sa Tuaisceart sóisialta, cúrsaí polaitíochta an Tuaiscirt fá choinne Raidio na Gaeltachta.  Chuideodh sé sin leis an Ghaeilge a chothú imeasc muintir an Tuaiscirt.</P>
    <P>Rud eile faoin media ba mhaith liom a rá: bíonn cuid mhór béime ó am go h-am ar theilifís agus nach bhfuil go leor Gaeilge ar siúl ar an teilifís agus gídh gur mhaith an rud é níos mó cláracha Gaeilge a chur ar fáil, im thuairimse tá sé níos tábhachtaí cláracha fiúntacha agus <Col N="379" /> cláracha suimiúla a chur ar siúl is é sin na h-áiseanna a bheith ann in RTÉ agus béim a chur ar fhiúntas; ní hé amháin an líon cláracha a bheadh ar siúl ach caighdeán na gclár sin.  Tá a fhios againn uilig dá mbeadh 10 gclár ar siúl agus iad uilig neamh-shuimiúil ní dhéanfadh sé sin rud ar bith ar son na Gaeilge ach dá mbeadh cláracha suimiúla, caighdéan árd acu agus na háiseanna acu le cláracha fiúntacha a chur amach, is mó go mór lucht éisteachta a bheadh ar fáil chun a leithéid sin cláracha.  An tríú rud ba mhaith liom a lua ná an t-aos óg agus is dóigh gur seo b'fheídir an rud is tábhachtaí uilig, is é sin meas na Gaeilge agus seans foghlaim na Gaeilge a thabhairt do aos óg na tíre seo. Is dócha an chuid is mó againn den ghlúin seo anois go bhfuil roinnt mhaith Gaeilge againn.  Tá sin ins an cháipéis atá léite againn, agus tá sé tábhachtach ó thaobh an aosa óig ní hé amháin go mbeadh áiseanna acu le Gaeilge a fhoghlaim ach go mbeadh oideachas ar siúl fá na gcoinne, go dtuigfeadh siad tábhach na Ghaeilge a fhoghlaim agus gur rud é mar sin nach raibh dúil acu ann ach tá sé tábhachtach a mhíniú do pháistí trí oideachas, trí chláracha teilifíse, trí gach dóigh is féidir an tábhacht atá ag baint lena dteanga féin.  Is dóigh ó mo thaobh féin go bhfuil an t-ádh orm go raibh an Ghaeilge liom ón gcliabhán agus ó thaobh oideachais de go raibh mé ar scoil i gClochar Louis, Mhuineacháin áit gur cothaíodh meas na Gaeilge ionainn agus gur thuigeamar tábhacht na Gaeilge ach tá eagle orm go bhfuil cuid mhór pháistí agus iad óg sa tír seo anois agus gur sort nuisance, má thiocfaidh liom an focal Béarla a rá &mdash; an Ghaeilge agus nach maith leo éigin dóibh &mdash; a fhoghlaim agus tá sé tábhachtach go dtuigfidh siad agus go gcuirfí sin rompu sna scoileanna an tábhacht atá le caomhnú na Gaeilge sa dóigh gur mhaith leo í a fhoghlaim. Má thuigeann siad tábhacht na Gaeilge beidh fonn orthu í a fhoghlaim agus tá sé ráite fosta ag an Coirnéal Ó Néill sa mheamram a chuir sé roimh Forum Nua Éireann faoi thábhact na Gaeilge ó thaobh seasmhacht na tíre, agus ba <Col N="380" /> mhaith liom díreach an abairt seo a léamh amach agus seo rud eile gur chóir dúinn uilig meabhrú air:</P>
    <P>Where a community is ignorant of its culture, under-values it or where its culture is denied or treated with disdain, this promotes the situation where the community is denied its foundations, its basis and its stability.  The culture of a community however can only be an effective force for stability in a community when the community is aware of its distinctive culture, knows it and values it.</P>
    <P>Is dóigh liom gur rud an-tábhachtach é sin.  Ó thaobh Thuaisceart na hÉireann, ba mhaith liom cúpla focal a rá.  Is dóigh liom go bhfuil sampla i dTuaisceart na hÉireann den méid is féidir a dhéanamh i gcothu na teanga má tá meas againn air agus má thuigimid a thábhacht.  Tá a fhios agaibh ar ndóigh nach bhfuil sé de iachall ar scoíleanna an Tuaiscirt an Ghaeilge a theagasc.  San am chéanna feicimid cothú agus caomhnú na Gaeilge i mBéal Feirste, i lár Uladh agus in áiteacha eile sa Tuaisceart ag daoine a thuigeann tábhacht na Gaeilge.  Tá bunscoileanna Gaeilge i mBéal Feirste chomh maith agus i nDoire.</P>
    <P>Caithfidh mé rá gur chuir sé pléisiúr mór orm féin roinnt blianta ó shin in mo bhaile féin i Lurgan éisteacht le díospóireacht i nGaeilge ó pháistí an Tuaiscirt agus gasúr amháin a thuig mé a tháinig as Béal Feirste agus gan é ach 12 no 13 de bhlianta d'aois agus an Ghaeilge chomh líofa aige agus dá dtógfaí i nGaoth Dobhair é.  Sin gasúr b'fhéidir nach raibh taobh amuigh de Bhóthar ar bhFál ón lá ar rugadh é agus bhí an Ghaeilge ar a thoil aige.</P>
    <P>Tá mé ag déanamh gur chóir don Rialtas anseo an méid is féidir a dhéanamh le cuidiú le Gaeilgeoirí an Tuaiscirt.  Mar dúirt mé cheana féin ba mhór an rud é dá mbeadh iriseoir faoi leith ó Raidio na Gaeltachta lonnaithe sa Tuaisceart ag freastal ar Ghaeilgeoirí an Tuaiscirt.  Ba mhaith an rud é dá mbeadh RTE le fáil againn sa Tuaisceart.  Tá áiteacha sa Tuaisceart nach féidir RTE a fháil agus tá mé ag smaoineamh ar <Col N="381" /> chláracha go bhfuil rinncí Gaelacha ann agus cláracha cosúil le &ldquo;Féach&rdquo; agus &ldquo;Trom agus Eadrom&rdquo;, áit a bhfuil meascán Gaeilge agus Béarla, gur féidir le daoine nach bhfuil mórán Gaeilge acu iad a leanúint.  Cláracha mar sin ba mhaith an rud iad a bheith le feiceáil ag muintir an Tuaiscirt, ní hé amháin na Caitlicigh ach na Protastúnaigh fosta.  Mar sin, dá mbeadh beam níos fearr de RTE againn sa Tuaisceart chuideodh sé sin.  Fosta, thiocfadh linn, dá mbeadh RTE ag dul isteach sa Tuaisceart, oideachais a thabhairt do dhaoine nach le Caitlicigh na hÉireann an Ghaeilge ach gur le Caitlicigh agus Protastúnaigh na hÉireann an Ghaeilge. Síleann cuid mhór daoine gur le Poblachtánaigh agus gur le Caitlicigh í ach smaoinimís i ndeireadh na 18ú aois gurab iad na Protastúnaigh i dTuaisceart na hÉireann is mó a thosaigh athbeochan na Gaeilge agus go bhfuil cuid mhór le foghlaim againn uathu agus gur olc an rud an dearcadh cúng seo den Ghaeilge gur le dream amháin é.  Ba chóir di cuidiú linn muintir na hÉireann Protastúnaigh agus Caitlicigh a thabhairt le chéile.  Ba chóir don Ghaeilge i n-áit a bheith ina dheighilt eadrainn go mbéimis ábalta úsáid a bhaint aisti le muid a thabhairt le chéile.  Mar adúirt mé cheana féin, is linn uilig é.  Ní le dream amháin ar bith sa tír é.</P>
    <P>I should like briefly in English to mention a few important points.  I regret that Senator Robb has left because he asked me specifically to do this for him but perhaps he is listening in some other part of the House.  I have a fear that because of the financial stringencies at the moment Irish may well be regarded as something which can be put on the long finger.  We were discussing the Dentists (Amendment) Bill a minute ago and it struck me that there is an analogy because having a toothache cured is something that you cannot put off either because if you do you will lose the tooth and that is the end of it whereas it you look after it now you may save the tooth. Irish is very much like that.  It is not something that we can say is too expensive to spend the money on now and we will wait until times are better.  If we wait until times are better, as the Bord na Gaeilge plan says, it will be too late.  We <Col N="382" /> will have lost something that is very precious and it is only when we lose something that we appreciate it.  Therefore, I do not accept the argument that when money is scarce Irish is something which is no longer a priority.</P>
    <P>The efforts which have been made to save the Gaeltacht and to enlarge it have in some manner succeeded but on the other hand have had a bad effect on the Gaeltacht and on Irish.  The reason for this is the sort of <i>ad hoc</i> approach that has been adopted &mdash; a response to pressure to do something without a proper long-term planned approach or thinking through of what is being done, with the result that the industrialisation of the Gaeltacht has led to a situation where the Gaeltacht is becoming anglicised.  Should that situation continue, it will sound the death knell of Irish.  I suggest that attention be paid to providing the facilities for educating the people of the Gaeltacht to be able to take up jobs in management and skilled jobs in factories so as to obviate the need to bring in people who have no Irish and therefore to defeat the original purpose of industrialising the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>The other important aspect with regard to the language is the media.  Those of us who have young families, particularly, know that young people are very much influenced by television.  There should be more Irish on RTE television, not just more and more Irish but more in terms of quality rather than quantity.  The same applies to local radio.  I am not suggesting that the quality is not there at the moment.  The programmes we have are excellent but I expect that the Authority would welcome more facilities so that they could enlarge their programmes and deal with subjects which at the moment they may not be able to deal with.  It is not good enough for Irish language programmes to deal simply with the Gaeltacht. There are other aspects of Irish life which are of interest to people and which could be dealt with.  There should be an attempt to improve the quality of output in Irish on our radio and television networks, particularly with reference to Radio na Gaeltachta which I have already mentioned in Irish.  That service <Col N="383" /> should be enlarged.  In order to facilitate the Irish-speaking population in the North, which is substantial.  A full-time person from Radio na Gaeltachta should be in Northern Ireland reporting and discussing Northern issues &mdash; social issues and all the various issues which are of importance to the people of the North &mdash; because Radio na Gaeltachta has quite an audience in Northern Ireland.  I know that from people who come and tell me about it.  Even, believe it or not, a person from the Northern Ireland office told me recently that he listens regularly to Radio na Gaeltachta.  I do not know how much of it he understands but he says he listens to it.</P>
    <P>I should like to make the point before finishing that Irish has come to be seen as a divisive force.  We seem to have a capacity for finding divisiveness in issues which really should unite us.  Irish is one of those issues.  I would remind the House that Irish is not the property of Catholic Ireland or indeed of Nationalist Ireland or of Republican Ireland.  Irish is the property of all Irish people, Unionists as well, and there are Unionists who do appreciate that, but it is for us who really love the language to get across in all the ways that we can to those people that Irish is something which enriches them as well as us.  Let us also remind ourselves that if it had not been for a number of Protestants, and I am not referring only to Douglas Hyde and people like that of more recent times, Irish might have been lost.  In the late eighteenth century when the policy of the British Government was to try to finish Irish in Ireland, the Protestants were the ones who recognised the danger signals and who began the Gaelic revival.  It is a pity that it has now come to a stage, certainly in Northern Ireland, where Irish is equated with Republicanism, even, might I say, with Provo-ism.  That is a terrible pity. The organisations who have done so much for the Irish language on a voluntary basis ought to bear that in mind and ought to be very careful to separate the Irish language and its restoration from party political points of view because, for goodness sake, when we do find something <Col N="384" /> which is common to both our traditions let us please work on that and use it as a unifying force rather than as a divisive force.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>So many fine contributions have been made on this topic that much of what I had intended to say by way of addition can now be regarded as superfluous.  It is indicative of the anxiety that people have in relation to the present status and position of Irish, the manner in which it is currently under threat of extinction, that so many people thought it worth their while to contribute in both languages, and may I say very meritoriously and at <Col N="385" /> some considerable length, on the subject. Senator Rogers in her very fine contribution in both languages made the very accurate point, a point worth deliberating on, that Irish is not the preserve or the monopoly of any one party, of any one group, of any one ethnic group or of any one religious group.  Too often in the past one of the great militating factors against the language was that it was associated with certain groups and that certain people have tended to monopolise it.</P>
    <P>A true indicator of the present serious position of the Irish language is the position of the ever-shrinking perimeter of the Gaeltacht.  The Gaeltacht that was three miles beyond Galway just ten years ago has now gone out beyond Furbo, beyond Barna and beyond Spiddal and is gradually being pushed into the sea.  That is a fact of life and we are as well to face up to it.  The Minister in his very fine address did face up to it.  He was very pragmatic and realistic that this is a rescue attempt that we are about, that we really are at the eleventh hour and that if this plan does not succeed we are in fact indicted because the language will die.  The position is that serious.</P>
    <P>A further point made by Senator Rogers is well worth dwelling on also. That is that we should look on Irish as being the primary distinguishing cultural value we have.  We can mobilise our energies for a display of nationalism to the language, to a revival of the language and do it in a practical way rather than in the misguided way some thugs and criminals masquerading as patriots have chosen to do, that is by way of force of arms.  One of the great scourges in relation to the Irish language for which I am very grateful to a former Minister for Education, Mr. Dick Burke, for removing, was the requirement of having Irish in the leaving certificate.  That compulsory element led to many generations having an innate grudge against the language.  It is not that statistically many people failed their leaving certificate examination as a result but there was the fear that if you did fail your leaving certificate as a result of Irish, Irish was to blame.  That is why the removal of the compulsory aspect of Irish was a very positive step indeed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="386" /> Another reason why Irish finds itself in the troubled state it is in, is the overemphasis on grammar.  This is a point that was well made by Senator O'Brien in his contribution.  I would make the point that when the English came to this country to anglicise it, they did not worry about English grammar.  They did not worry about syntax.  Their concern was the implanting of English in the minds of people.  This they did with the result that today we have reached a level of oral proficiency and competence in the English language so that people actually come here to learn it from us.</P>
    <P>With regard to Irish, we would do well to bear in mind that other countries and other languages adopt more modern methodology than we employ in this country.  I consider the spoken word as being of primary importance and the written word as being of secondary importance.</P>
    <P>Language is a vehicle of oral communication. If one relegates it to the written word only, one gives it the same status as Latin and Greek, dead languages which are now being phased out, though not in all cases, and rightly so, from our curricula.  We must achieve an oral proficiency first and I see the oral expression of language as then being the window to written competence.</P>
    <P>The real secret is that we have to strive to win the young people on to the side of Irish.  We have to re-implant in them a genuine love of the language.  I have read through the reports of the two previous days on which this topic was debated.  On both days there was heavy emphasis laid on the need for more money, that there would have to be greater resources. There will have to be greater resources. but all the resources and money in the world cannot substitute for a re-awakening of a genuine desire, love, care, concern and affection for the language. How we do this is the real challenge facing us today.</P>
    <P>I want to commend the Minister for his pragmatic address through the other medium earlier.  He made the point &mdash; one worth bearing in mind &mdash; that we are not out to evict, reject or kill the English <Col N="387" /> language and replace it with Irish.  What we want to do is arrive at a situation in which the two languages can peacefully co-exist, live side by side.  Surely if it can be done in continental countries&mdash;where there is a fair degree of bilingualism &mdash; certainly we should be able to do it here.</P>
    <P>I agree with many of the contributions that have been made.  I do not wish to be repetitive, particularly with regard to remarks made in relation to the role of the media, television and so on.  The plan is a good one.  The motion was a very worthwhile one.  I wish the Minister, his Department, the plan and Bord na Gaeilge well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Auliffe-Ennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome the report published by Bord na Gaeilge.  I see this report as a serious step in halting the decline or the demise of the Irish language.  I welcome also this all-party motion which calls for the setting up of an all-party Oireachtas committee to consider the plan and to review the present position.  I would recommend that the teaching profession be represented on that proposed committee. They are the people who will be &mdash; to a great degree &mdash; the promoters of the language.</P>
      <P>The various aspects of this report have been well discussed by Senators over a number of weeks.  It was in my capacity as a qualified primary teacher that I studied the report.  Therefore, I will confine most of my comments to the area which deals specifically with the primary school system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is strong and repeated reference in this report to the use of pilot schemes. In my experience the pilot scheme used in relation to the Irish language &mdash; which resulted in the Buntús scheme in primary schools &mdash; holds no joy or happiness for me.  I have good reason to believe that that pilot scheme was given extra special attention in schools in which it was implemented. Its failure was somehow overlooked in an anxiety to come up with an alternative to the old system of teaching Irish.  It did fail and there is evidence to prove it.  The standard of Irish has fallen considerably.  In my opinion it failed <Col N="388" /> because the scheme was based on the conviction that children of school-going age could be taught for a short period, and not in a bilingual environment, to think in Irish while living in an English-speaking environment.  It is not possible to implement the Buntús scheme as was not only suggested but insisted upon by Department inspectors in particular.  The direct method, along with the fact that the teacher was not allowed to translate any of the dialogue, can only succeed when operating or working with the child's first language.  Therefore, when one says to a child: &ldquo;sin bórd&rdquo; or &ldquo;sin urlár&rdquo; the child thinks in his or her mind &mdash; it is a silent translation &mdash; that is a table, floor and so on, and then repeats the translation that he has made in his mind.</P>
    <P>I welcome also the move by the Department of Education away from this method, as presented in the Buntús, to direct dialogue, with more emphasis on bilingualism, as now presented in the infant classes.  I regret, however, that the move away from the exclusivity of teaching Irish through the medium of Irish, in an English-speaking environment, has as yet not been brought forward into the first, second and third classes, and so on.</P>
    <P>I might now advance some of the reasons why the Irish language has reached this critical stage.  There are various and many reasons.  It is my belief that the most serious one was the compulsion element; secondly, the preferential treatment given to the language, indeed right up to this day.  If one failed Irish one failed one's examinations. Thankfully that situation has now ceased. But was it costly?  Not only did it foster indifference to the language, it fostered an active aversion.  This is going to be the biggest hurdle in the promotion or renewal of Irish.  I have no doubt that this hurdle can be surmounted provided careful action is taken, and I deliberately use the word &ldquo;careful&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>At this point I must refer to other proposals in the report and to the situation obtaining which causes resentment and still suggests compulsion.  In relation to school transport.  Near the Gaeltacht area, not far from my home, there are <Col N="389" /> two primary schools, one Gaeltacht and one Galltacht.  Close to the Galltacht school are families who wish to travel to the Gaeltacht school and <i>vice versa.</i> However, the Gaeltacht children wishing to go to the Galltacht school have to comply with the Department of Education rules on distance and so on to qualify for free transport.  However, the same provisions do not apply to children who wish to travel to the Gaeltacht school &mdash; they have free transport and naturally an element of resentment exists.</P>
    <P>To say the least, there are quite a number of aspects which are unfair to teachers; they are unfair not by way of criticism but rather by way of omission.  For example, there is reference &mdash; quite correctly &mdash; to a drop in the standard of Irish.  Yet the report omitted to say that the Buntús scheme as presented in the primary school was and is frustrating and counter-productive to both teachers and children with no clear definition of its objective, the basic principle of good teaching being to have an objective. The report refers to the aim of having Irish taught for a minimum of one hour per day.  That is being done, and more. For example, there is the Buntús scheme, there is Irish reading and writing.  From my experience these involved anything up to two hours per day.  But this suggestion that Irish be taught for a minimum of one hour per day implies otherwise and more resentment may follow.</P>
    <P>I revert now to my use of the word &ldquo;careful&rdquo;.  If we are to have the teaching profession working fully behind this report we must not say anything which would seem to imply that they are not doing their work or spending their time on the language.  Furthermore, consultation is constantly mentioned as being important.  Yet according to my information the teaching union with which I am most familiar, the INTO, were asked for a submission.  The report was presented but they had not been consulted.  I am talking about sitting down, going through the suggestions as they relate to the primary school and saying: &ldquo;What about this, that or the other?&rdquo;  That has not been done.  Yet the Minister has accepted that this report be implemented throughout <Col N="390" /> the educational system without consultation. I really regret this having happened.</P>
    <P>The proposals concerning &ldquo;in-service&rdquo; courses under present circumstances are just simply not feasible.  The majority of the funds over the years have been allocated to Irish &ldquo;in-service&rdquo; courses.  When more are required it is a serious omission not to refer also to the fact that &ldquo;in-service&rdquo; courses funding must be made across the board.</P>
    <P>I have spoken to teachers about the implementation of the plan.  The consensus is that, if they are to spend more time than they are already giving to the Irish language within the ridiculous scheme called the Buntús it will be at the expense of environmental studies.</P>
    <P>Teaching resource centres also need to be extended, not only for Irish but across the board and not on an exclusive basis, as is implied by the report.  Another matter which causes grave resentment is the fact that all-Irish schools have much greater advantages.  They have almost twice the funding, preferential pupil/teacher ratios and exceptional grants for buildings and sites.  These are, of course, the scoileanna teanga Gaeilge. To achieve the required aim &mdash; an easy and comfortable acceptance of the language &mdash; a balance must be achieved in the interests of equity and co-operation. It is also important to point out that all teachers leaving teacher-training colleges at present are deemed to be qualified to teach in Galltacht and Gaeltacht and scoileanna lán Ghaelacha.</P>
    <P>I make these points because I want to see a successful renewal of the Irish language.  I do not want to see this report lie on the bottom of a shelf gathering dust.  Having seen the way the &ldquo;buntús&rdquo; was literally jumped at and then definitely ignored by the pupil element in the classroom quite likely it could happen or, even worse, be accepted at face value because nobody else will come up with an alternative.  I want to see good active debate, improvement and implementation of the basic aim of this report, that is the concept of Irish as a living vibrant language.</P>

      <P>I am just getting an elementary lesson on my right here.  Perhaps the observations of someone who could only count to ten in the language&mdash;áon, dó, trí, ceathar, cúig, sé, seacht, ocht, naoí, deich &mdash; might be of interest to the Minister if not to the rest of the assembly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to start by making the point that about three years ago I took my four children to the western Hebrides.  Having crossed the Minch, with not altogether complete success, we arrived in Lewes and Harris.  They were quite surprised to find that, first of all, they were in an area of Scotland which was staunchly Protestant and yet who were clinging on to the Gaelic &mdash; if I may use that word &mdash; language as their first language.  So I asked them to think about it.  I also asked them to think what did the Minch have that the Irish Sea did not have.  I then confused them completely by telling them that their ancestors had arrived in Down and Antrim &mdash; I think pre-plantation if I may say so &mdash; with this language and that three generations back there was a Presbyterian minister who gave his sermons in Belfast in Gaelic. What had happened that the language had been lost?  The first thing one must say is that the Hebrides cannot have posed the same threat to the English crown as did the people of Ireland. Therefore there may not have been the same necessity, or even the same reason, for going there to beat the language out of them.  That is one side of it.  The other side of it is that, if you consider what happened to the language in the last century, I come to the same conclusion as David Hammond, who comes out of the same tradition as myself and who is a well-known authority on the folk scene in Northern Ireland, that in one sense language is an expression of power.  In that sense it is also an expression of imperialism associated with power.  One could think of the Russian language, of the English language, indeed one could have thought of the French language in this respect.  One could ask what happened to the lanque d'oc in the south of France, what has happened to the Breton language: how did they manage to hold on to it when so many other regions have <Col N="392" /> not held on to their local language?  It is interesting in this respect to consider what Daniel O'Connell did with the language, and why he did it.  Presumably there was feeling in the last century that you were a disadvantaged person, that you were a diminished person, if you sought to conduct your affairs through the medium of the native Gaelic language because the English language was associated with power and those who lived cheek by jowl with their lords and masters in the towns and cities felt that, in order, to survive, they would have to adopt this language style.  Recently I was speaking to a surgeon who has returned home to Northern Ireland from Zambia. We were discussing this problem of local languages and the elimination of so many in the last century.  He told me he had actually witnessed African teachers in Zambia beating the children for speaking in school in their native language and not speaking through the medium of English. While, in one sense, we could say that language is an expression of imperialism or power, on the other side, we have to say to ourselves: what does the language have to offer?  Why are we anxious to preserve a particular language?  Perhaps it is only in the language that we can preserve the things that are unique in our inheritance in relation to the ethnicity of the people that we belong to and, if we lose a language, we lose a whole set of values, a whole set of ways of looking at things which are essential if we wish to have a global society in which variety is preserved so that we have biological, psychological and social health.  It is uniqueness versus uniformity that I think we are talking about.  It is particularly important at this time in the development of European man and man in general.</P>
    <P>Language is a way of storing, in a unique way, the heritage of the people. So I make an appeal for the preservation of the language, perhaps not for reasons which may be commonplace here but because I believe that diversity is vitally important to mankind's survival.  Let us look at the effects of centralism and consumerism and the product of this, which is uniformity throughout western society. Pollution and plunder go unabated.  We <Col N="393" /> have lost 300 mammal species, we have lost 350 bird species, we have lost 20,000 plant species and we are in the process of losing many hundreds of languages millennia old which have disappeared in the course of the last 100 years.  Yet any ecologist will tell you that, for survival, it is vital that the ecosystems are as complex &mdash; not as simple &mdash; as possible so that the built-in regulating systems which go with variety, with diversity, are preserved and so we ensure our survival rather than our destruction.</P>
    <P>Now one can look upon it in relation to the power game at present being played.  The preservation of language gives us a tool whereby we can challenge all-pervading centralism and try to preserve what is good, what makes us what we are, where we live.  Therefore, on the one hand I would say global language is an expression of power and, on the other hand, local language is one means of challenging that power.  And I would emphasise the point already made: we need both.</P>
    <P>Now what happened to the loyalists of the North of Ireland who came from Scotland? I have mentioned that they came with the Gaelic language.  In fact, some still speak it, and certainly in the last century in the Glens of Antrim it was spoken.  As Members who have travelled in County Antrim will know broad Scots, in the English style, is still spoken.  In fact some people would say that the dialect in North Antrim is more of the old Scots than is spoken in many parts of Scotland today.</P>
    <P>On the one hand I feel that we sold out on our cultural inheritance because of the way in which we felt threatened by &mdash; for want of a better expression &mdash; Catholic nationalism in Ireland: we slipped in under the British umbrella and the British umbrella meant speaking the British language.  On the other hand, I would suggest also that, at the time of the language revival, the culture itself was also hi-jacked by that tradition.  Therefore we have this conflict which was developed over the first part of this century and which we are now trying to resolve.  Supposing we did understand the language of which as I explained at the start I have <Col N="394" /> a very limited knowledge, we might know the significance of such a thing as &ldquo;Tír Fergus&rdquo; when we stand at what was once known as Port Brittas in the old chronicles, near Ballycastle, and look across to Machrihanish Bay in Scotland, the Land of Fergus.  Very few people in the North of Ireland actually know the story of Fergus McGuirk, leaving the ancient Kingdom of Dalriada &mdash; my pronunciation may not be perfect &mdash; and sailing across there with the Lia Fáil about the early part of the seventh century.  What is the Lia Fáil I asked an audience in Northern Ireland recently.  I said, &ldquo;Hands up here all who know what the Lia Fáil is&rdquo;.  Nobody could tell me.  Then somebody said it was the Stone of Destiny. I was able to tell him that it is the stone of strength &mdash; with which I am sure Senators will agree &mdash; and that of course that stone sings when the right man is crowned upon it.</P>
    <P>But there are other aspects of language. We have the significance of place names, the association of place names, the significance of the old Irish stories, the names that are used in them being denied to those who do not know the language.  In my opinion, not only for an understanding of Ireland but also for an understanding of the relationship between Ireland and Scotland, there is much to be said for a loving and inquisitive development of the language.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the significance was lost on many people &mdash; I am sure not by those who speak the language well &mdash; but I was very impressed when I learned on the day of the opening of the New Ireland Forum that its Chairman had addressed the meeting in Scottish Gaelic.  Its significance might have received more publicity than it did.</P>
    <P>The point I should like to make is that we who have grown apart from the language cannot be browbeaten or beaten back into it.  One of the encouraging things about the little part of the discussion I have heard and understood is that that is not the intention: it is quite the reverse.  It is important for us to think in terms of our roots.  If we think globally we act locally and, in terms of language while we must have global outreach, <Col N="395" /> global outreach means nothing if it is not rooted locally.  I would appeal to those interested in the language to see it as a means of redressing the balance between the power that is implied by the use of English and the weakness which that gave in the context of the use of Irish and to establish balance.  We need to acknowledge that while the Irish language was in fact beaten out of the Irish people we do not want to fall into the same trap and use it as a political tool to diminish those who do not, as yet, have it and to make those who do have it feel that they are superior beings.  Anyone who travels in South Africa will be well aware of the dangers into which the Afrikaans language falls in that respect.  By the same token, I would say two things.  Senator J. Higgins mentioned the need to use it as a spoken language.  I never learned the written Afrikaans but when I went to South Africa the first thing I did was to go to a language laboratory and learn the spoken Afrikaans.  If the South African would not have opened up to you because of his feeling that his language was something superior he certainly opened up not only himself but his heart and his home if you made an effort to address him in his language, even if you did not know how to spell the words that you were pronouncing.  Senator J. Higgins made the point &mdash; which I would like to emphasise &mdash; that long before anybody could write a word of any of the languages we speak they had been speaking them for millennia.</P>
    <P>If there is to be a revival of the language I hope it will grow out of the ground freely, that it will become a growing symbol of our challenge to global centralism rather than an assertion of Gaelic imperialism, that it will become something that will be cherished rather than imposed and that it will become something that beckons us because it has a fascination for us.  In that context I would ask Members of the Seanad to ask themselves seriously if the language is being done a service or a disservice by retaining Article 8.1. of the Constitution. As a person &mdash; again I emphasise this as somebody who does not speak the language <Col N="396" />&mdash; it seems to me that it runs the danger of holding up the language to ridicule because here it claims that the Gaelic language is the first official language. Everybody knows that in general parlance or general perception it is certainly not used as the first official language. If it was ever to become the first official language it might be much more natural for us to encourage it so to become and then recognise it rather than to pretend that it is when it is not.</P>
    <P>The House may be interested if I summarise some points that our New Ireland Group made in our submission to the New Ireland Forum in relation to the language question.  Firstly, we made that point, that to claim it as the first official language was to run the risk of holding something precious up to ridicule.  Secondly, to insist on a knowledge of it outside the Gaeltacht without ensuring that every child has had an opportunity in his schooling to learn it would be unfair.  I am thinking now in particular of Northern Ireland.  But I was very interested to read in this Action Plan for Irish 1983-1986, that there are plans to try to introduce it into the Northern schools.  I hope those plans do not just include the maintained schools.  I hope they will include the so-called State schools also. Thirdly, we urged the removal of all disabilities based on knowledge of the Irish language against Northerners &mdash; at this very difficult time &mdash; who might be applying for jobs in the Republic as teachers, civil servants and so on, in all areas outside the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>If we are interested in reconciliation in Ireland, in growing in unity, we have to start by acknowledging that the most vulnerable people, the people who feel most threatened and most confused, are the Loyalist community who are at present thoroughly demoralised.  If we are trying to be positive, if we are trying to awaken a new awareness of Irishness in them, within reason special arrangements must be made for their particular predicament. Fourthly, we urged that everything possible be done to interest those of the Loyalist tradition in the Gaelic tongue of their forbears and, in particular, to work gently towards the day when it will be <Col N="397" /> taught in all primary schools throughout Ireland.  I might say this submission was written before we had read the action plan.</P>
    <P>Fifthly, in the meantime &mdash; outside the Gaeltacht &mdash; a personal option for English or Irish should be respected throughout the country and for the foreseeable future it should be clearly understood that English would remain the first language in Northern Ireland.  By the same token, it should be considered offensive to enter the Gaeltacht, where an attempt is being made to preserve one of the world's most threatened languages, without making some concession toward it, even by those who at present do not speak any of it, as it would be to enter the Orange Free State in South Africa without making some concession towards Afrikaans; or as it would be for a white doctor to enter a ward of Zulus in Qwazulu without indicating respect for the language, by making a gesture of communicating it.  Sixthly, we urged that it is necessary to affirm that if the Gaelic language is to have a unifying effect it must not be used as a tool to discriminate in the way in which it was, in its own time, discriminated against.</P>
    <P>With those thoughts I wish the Minister well in his attempts to implement the Action Plan for Irish 1983-1986.  I believe it is a very precious part of our heritage, not only of those who at present speak it but also of those who, perhaps through the misfortune of history, have lost it.  It is also vitally important in terms of the challenge to centralism.  I hope that he will be aware of the need in the future to interest the people of Northern Ireland who do not speak the language in it and to give them every encouragement without using it as a means of threatening them.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom i dtosach mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis na daoine a chuir a n-aimneacha le tairiscint an tSeanaid, is é sin na Seanadóirí Flor O'Mahony, Andy O'Brien, Brendan Ryan agus Mick Lanigan. Thug sé deis dúinn ar fad éisteacht leis na ráitis a bhí le tabhairt ag na daoine seo agus go deimhin ag suas le 15 ar fad. <Col N="398" /> Ba iontach an diospóireacht a bhí againn, agus ceann de na rúdaí a tháinig treasna chugamsa i mo shuí anseo don dara huair ná go raibh pointí comórta le cloisteáil ó a lán daoine.  Glacadh leis, cur i gcás, go bhfuil an Ghaeilge i mbaol.  Glacadh leis go bhfuil deis againn anois rud éigin a dhéanamh faoin Ghaeilge má táimid ndáiríre faoi shabháilt na Gaeilge.  Glacadh leis cur i gcás nach raibh daoine sásta leis an méid Gaeilge a bhí le cloisteál ar na meáinhcumarsáide, is é sin RTE go háirithe agus go deimhin na páipéirí nuachta.  Cuireadh imní in iúl comh maith ag a lán daoine faoi staid na Gaeilge sna scoileanna.</P>
      <P>Ní bheidh mórán ama agam.  Maidir leis an Seanadóir Flor O'Mahony, dúirt sé nach raibh a gcearta á fháil ag muintir na tíre seo ó RTE, go raibh seirbhís teilifíse Stáit ansin agus nach raibh a ndualgas á dhéanamh acu.  Mhol sé chomh maith go gcuirfí ar bun coistí le cur ina luí ar an chóras rialtais aitiúil agus ar na boird sláinte go mbainfidís usáid as an nGaeilge.  Tá sé sin ar siúl.  Bhí cruinniú speisialta ag lucht na mbord sláinte ar fud na tíre tamall ó shin agus tá oifigigh i ngach bord ceaptha le súil a choinneáil ar chur chun cinn na Gaeilge.  Dúirt sé a lán rudaí eile ach ní bheidh am agam tagairt a dhéanamh dóibh.</P>
      <P>Ghlac an Seanadóir Lanigan leis go raibh an Ghaeilge i gcruachás.  Mhol sé Radio na Gaeltachta.  Cháin sé RTE i ngeall ar a laghad Gaeilge a bhí á cur ar fáil acu agus chuir sé milleán ar an Roinn Oideachais maidir le múinteoirí.  Mhínigh sé nach raibh aon mhilleán ar na múinteoirí ach go raibh milleán ar an gcóras a lig amach múinteoirí i measc an phobail nach raibh Gaeilge ar a mian acu. Dúirt an Seanadóir Robb agus an Seanadóir Jim Higgins go raibh an comarca béime ar an Ghaeilge scríofa, ar ghramadach agus ar sinta agus rudaí eile agus nach raibh go leor béime ar an teanga labharta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dúirt Senator Jack Harte nach raibh Gaeilge aige.  Dúirt sé go raibh taithí aige ar an gcóras oideachais bunscoile, ach mhol sé nach n-éireodh leis an bheartas seo fhad is a bheidh éinne ag iarraidh Gaeilge a bhrú síos scornaí mhuintir na tíre seo, go gcaithfear é a dhéanamh trí <Col N="399" /> mhealladh agus nach ceart é a dhéanamh ar bhealach éigeantach.  Ghlac sé leis go raibh meon don fábharach Ghaeilge le fáil go forleathan ar fud na tíre agus nach mbeadh aon rath ar a bheartas dá mbeadh brú ar éinne.</P>
    <P>Chruthaigh an Seanadóir Catherine McGuinness an tionchar a bhí ag teilifís ar mheon na ndaoine agus go mba cheart go mbeadh níos mó Gaeilge le cloisteáil ar an teilifís, go raibh ghettoism á bhunú i ngeall ar an chaoi a raibh an Ghaeilge agus feachtas athbheochana na teanga á láimhseáil.  Dúirt sí go raibh cineál élitism, ag baint le seo agus éinne nach raibh Gaeilge aige nó aici nár cheart dó nó di Gael a thabhairt air nó uirthi.  Ní ghlacaim le sin.  Thagair sí do thábhacht na h-amharclainne chomh maith agus do thábhacht na scoileanna lán-Ghaelacha.</P>
    <P>Dúirt an Seanadóir Séamus De Brún go raibh droch-bhail ar an nGaeilge agus muna gcuirfí chuige go luath go mbeadh sé níos measa agus go deimhin nach mbeadh teacht ar ais air.</P>
    <P>Mhol Seanadóir Andy O'Brien, ceann des na daoine a chuir a ainm leis an tairiscint seo, go raibh prionsabal siceolaíochta anseo maidir le education, psychology and methodology.  Dúirt sé nár cheart agus nár chóir de réir rialacha siceolaíochta teanga a bhrú ar pháiste óg murabh é sin teanga an chliabháin ag an bpáiste sin.  Níl a fhios agam an bhfuil aon bhunús eolaíochta leis an ráiteas sin. Má tá, glacaim leis.  Ba mhaith liom a fháil amach an bhfuil nó nach bhfuil. Dúirt sé chomh maith go raibh béim rómhór á leagan ar ghramadach agus ar an fhocal scríofa.</P>
    <P>Mhol an Seanadóir Brendan Ryan obair a bhí ar siúl ag na Gael-scoileanna agus na naí-scoileanna agus chuir sé ceist orm faoi neodracht an Rialtais.  Tá an Rialtas taobh thiar de phlean na Gaeilge, ghlac siad leis an phlean seo agus go dtabharfaidh siad aon chúnamh is féidir le féachaint chuige go gcuirfear an plean i gcrích.</P>
    <P>Cheap An Seanadóir Michael D. Higgins go raibh dearcadh caol-aigeanta ag baint len a lán daoine i leith na Gaeilge, go raibh dearcadh spioradálta ag cuid eile de na daoine agus gur bhain <Col N="400" /> an Ghaeilge le seo, go raibh brú ar dhaoine gan an Ghaeilge a úsáid.  Ó thaobh na húdaráis áitiúla agus ó thaobh boird sláinte go raibh Gaeltachtaí mar chuid dá gceantair thug sé dúinn samplaí de áit a raibh siceolaithe ag iarraidh a fháil amach faoi dul chun cinn daoine go raibh máchail intinne orthu agus go raibh ceisteanna á chur orthu trí Bhéarla agus gan an Béarla acu mar theanga teallaigh, agus ó thaobh na siceolaíochta fiú amháin, ní amháin ó thaobh na teanga de, go raibh sé seo seafóideach.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an Seanadóir Fitzsimons, ceann de na rudaí a dúirt sé a bhí tábhachtach agus go raibh áthas air a bheith sa phlean ná go raibh súil á choinneáil ar dul chun cinn an phlean, go raibh monitoring i gceist.  Chuir sé ceist maidir leis an seirbhís teilifíse atá molta sa phlean agus críochnaigh sé by saying &ldquo;has it any hope?&rdquo;  Beidh mé ag freagairt sin i gceann cúpla nóiméad má bhíonn am agam.</P>
    <P>Dúirt an Seanadóir Seán de Brún go raibh an iomarca béime leagtha ar chúrsaí airgid agus cúrsaí airgeadais agus go raibh sé i bhfad níos tábhachtaí meon mhuintir na tíre seo a bheith fábharach don Ghaeilge, agus dá mbeadh an meon sin le feiceáil fábharach don Ghaeilge go mbeadh rath ar iarrachtaí athbheochain na teanga níos fearr ná mar dá mbeadh £1 milliún againn a chaitheamh.  Ní haon mhaith caitheamh airgid ann féin.</P>
    <P>Aontaím go hiomlán leis an Seanadóir Bríd Rogers go bhfuil deis anois á fháil againn ar an Ghaeilge a shábháil.  Muna nglacaimid leis an deis sin táimid i dtrioblóid agus tá an Ghaeilge i dtrioblóid.  Rinne sí tagairt do thábhacht na gcoláistí Gaeilge.  Anuraidh, cuir i gcás, bhí suas le 20,000 páistí ag freastal ar choláistí Gaeilge agus chomh fada agus a bhaineann liomsa mar Aire &mdash; agus bhí mé ag teagasc i gcoláistí Gaeilge le mo linn &mdash; sin ceann de na rúdaí is tábhachtaí dá bhfeicim i leith shábháilt na Gaeilge toisc agus ar an gcúis seo: tá a lán gasúr óga, cáilíní agus buachaillí go bhfuil Gaeilge á foghlaim acu mar ábhar scoile, ábhar teibí, nach dtuigeann nó nach bhfacha ariamh go bhfuil daoine ag caitheamh a saoil ó lá ag baint úsáid as an nGaeilge mar theange nó mar mheán <Col N="401" /> chumarsáide.  Féachann siad iad seo don chéad uair san nGaeltacht dóibh agus iad ag freastal ar choláistí samhraidh do Ghaeilge.  Thiocfainn leis an Seanadóir go gcuireann forbairt eacnamaíochta na Gaeltachta isteach ar an Ghaeilge mar theanga sa Ghaeltacht.  Tá deacracht anseo: muna bhfuil daoine agat ní bheidh teanga agat.</P>
    <P>Ghlacfainn leis an moladh a rinne sí go mbeadh pleanáil agus gurb í easpa pleanála an chúis gur thárla sé seo nuair nach raibh daoine cáilithe nó oilte leis na jobanna go raibh oiliúint ag teastáil uatha le fáil sa Ghaeltacht, agus bhí ar na húdaráis na daoine sin a thabhairt isteach ón taobh amuigh.  Mhol sí Raidio na Gaeltachta, rud go dtiocfainn léithi ann.  Maidir le iriseoir a chur ar fáil sa Tuaisceart, sin rud go deimhim go bhfuil an-ghá leis agus ba mhaith liom a rá go bhfuil iriseoir againn sa Tuaisceart &mdash; Póilín Ní Chiaráin a bhfuil Gaeilge ar a mian aici agus go mbaintear úsáid mhaith aisti i leith tuarascálacha a chur ar fáil do RTE.  Ba mhaith liom mo bhufochas a ghabháil le Senator Jim Higgins as ucht a dhea-mhéin a chur in iúl dom mar Aire agus Airí eile as Mhaigh Eo a tháinig romham.  Ghlacfainn leis go hiomlán maidir leis an Ghaeilge éigeantach a bhí againn leis an scéim sin gur chuir an tAire Dick Burke deireadh leis.</P>
    <P>Ghlacfainn leis chomh maith go bhfuil trí Ghaeilge náisiúnachas á chur in iúl, anois ní náisiúnachas caoleagantach, gur féidir linn maoímh as an Ghaeilge mar theanga ársa a bhfuil cultúir agus fealsúnacht ag baint léi mar theanga. Dúirt sé go raibh béim ró mhór á leagan ar ghramadach agus bhí an ceart aige. Arís labhair sé faoi polasaí dhá-theangach agus sin ceann de na rudaí atá le fáil anseo, go bhfuil aghaidh á thabhairt i ndeireadh na dála ar gur cheart a rá go bhfuil sé in am scrios an Bhéarla a chaitheamh i leataobh.  Tá áit don Bhéarla.  Tá aít don Ghaeilge i saol mhuintir na tíre seo.  Tá an Béarla á labhairt agus sí an aidhm a bheadh agamsa agus go deimhin is é aidhm an phlean go mbeadh úsáid na Gaeilge chomh láidir lá éigin le úsáid an Bhéarla agus go bhféadfaí iad a úsáid <Col N="402" /> taobh le taobh go nádúrtha.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an Seanadóir McAuliffe-Ennis mar mhúinteoir agus mise mar iar-mhúinteoir agus b'fhéidir mar mhúinteoir arís &mdash; níl a fhios agam, braitheann sé sin ar mhuintir Mhaigh Eo Thoir, is cosúil &mdash; duirt sí go raibh amhras uirthi faoi scéim phíolóta toisc an taithí a bhí aici féin mar mhúinteoir ar scéim phíolóta An &ldquo;Bhuntús Cainte&rdquo;. D'fhoghlamar agus do deimhin bhí mé féin ag gabháil do Bhuntús Cainte mar scéim phíolóta na blianta ó shin nuair bhí mé ag múineadh agus tá a lán foghlamtha againn ó thaobh na teanga cheapfainn ó thaithí an &ldquo;Bhuntus Cainte&rdquo;.  Bhí sí ag clamhsán nár pléadh na moltaí atá sa phlean leis na múinteoirí.  Ba mhaith liom a chur in iúl di agus do na Seanadóirí eile go bhfuil aon rud atá sa phlean maidir le oideachas aontaithe roimh ré leis an Roinn Oideachais, agus ghlac mise agus ghlac an bord go riabh cibé moltaí a aontaíodh ó thaobh an oideachais de, go raibh sé pléite leis na heagrais go raibh baint acu leis, is é sin eagrais na múinteoirí, leis an Roinn, sular aontaigh an Roinn leis an mbord iad.  Ach ní raibh an Roinn i dteangmháil leis na heagrais go díreach.</P>
    <P>Senator Robb's contribution was most interesting in relation to Lewis and Harris and the fact that Gaelic is still very prevalent there, probably because, as he said, it did not create any threat to the authorities of the day.  Therefore people were left quietly alone, perhaps out of the motivation of contempt.  I do not know what the reason was, but they were left there and they are still there today.  That is probably a very good basis for the hypothesis.</P>
    <P>He also mentioned the Protestant ethic, and that the survival of the language today in places in the North has sprung from the enthusiasm and the determination of many people who could not be termed either nationalistic in outlook or Catholic in religion.  I accept that and, indeed, the terrible thing is &mdash; and it has been referred to by many Senators and in particular by Senator Rogers and Senator Robb &mdash; that the connection between the Irish language and what I would regard as so-called republicanism <Col N="403" /> is doing the language no good.  We all accept that.  As Senator Robb said, in the past language has been an expression of strength and power.  It shows pride in our roots, our traditions and our culture.  If that could be got across to our people as a whole on this island, it would be accepted.  I was delighted to hear the proposals made to the Forum, of which I was aware prior to the publication of the plan, and which are very closely aligned to the proposals in the Action Plan in many cases.  Again the emphasis on the spoken word was referred to and the futility of trying to browbeat people into doing anything apart from learning a language.  Definitely the idea of trying to impose a language is just not workable. It has not worked in the past and it has even less chance of success in the future.</P>
    <P>Níl mórán ama fágtha agam ach ba mhaith liom a rá go bhfuil an mhaoin co-ordaithe a luaitear faoi mhír 1.1 den phlean i mbun oibre cheana féin agus scrúdú á dhéanamh acu ar na scéimeanna éagsúla atá i bhfeidhm sa Ghaeltacht.  Tá an mhaoin sin ag tabhairt tosaíochta do na spriocanna atá leagtha síos sa phlean don bliain 1983, is é sin leathnú a dhéanamh ar sheirbhís ghairmtheoireach Údaráis na Gaeltachta agus comórtas spreagadh i gcóir Raidio na Gaeltachta chun suim i ndaoine óga a fhuascailt i ngnéithe do shaibhreas na teanga agus sa chultúr.</P>
    <P>Baineann an Ghaeilge féin agus an plean leis an bpobal ar fad agus rinneadh tagairt do seo sna hóráidí a rinneadh.  Is don riachtanas é mar sin go mbeadh a fhios ag gach duine go bhfuil suim aige i gcur chun cinn na Gaeilge céard iad na spriocanna atá le baint amach.  Is féidir a rá go bhfuil tús curtha leis an dá scéim phobail a luaitear in alt 2 (1) den phlean agus go bhfuil réamh-scrúdú á dhéanamh chun spriocanna áirithe don óige a bhaint amach.  Beidh páirt mhór le plé ag na heagrais Ghaeilge sa bheartas seo, agus ná ceapadh éinne go bhfuil na heagrais atá ar an talamh faoi láthair go bhfuil siad le caitheamh i leataobh agus gan aon áird a thabhairt orthu, ach ba cheart domsa a rá agus tá sé de dhualgais orm a rá go mbeifí ag súil go mbeídh comh-oibriú <Col N="404" /> iomlán idir na heagrais atá ann le fada agus na daoine atá ag dul don phlean nua seo Boird na Ghaeilge.  Tá tábhacht ar leith á baint le réimse an oideachais agus tá tagairt déanta do sin ag a lán daoine nuair a bhí siad ag dul dá gcuid óráidí agus ní abróidh mé a thuilleadh faoi ag an bpointe seo.  Tá tús curtha le hathbhreithniú ar shiollabus Gaeilge na Meán Teistiméireachta chun leanúnachas i dteagasc na Gaeilge a chinntiú.  Tá fógraithe ag an Aire Oideachais go bhfuil beartuithe aice bord curriculeam agus scrúduithe a bhunú agus tá a fhios agaibh féin céard atá ag tárlú ansin.

      <P>Rather than having the debate drag over to another day, since we are due to finish this item at 5 o'clock today, I will make a very few brief remarks in conclusion so that hopefully we can then agree the motion.  First of all, may I apologise to the House again for the fact that my own Irish is not sufficiently fluent to enable me to speak easily in it, although I understand it very well, and am taking steps so that perhaps before very long I will be able to contribute as fluently in Irish as others did in some of the magnificent speeches we have heard during the debate?</P>
      <P>May I also take the opportunity to apologise to Senator Rogers for the fact that, in getting signatures from all political groupings in the Seanad for this motion, we inadvertently left out the SDLP.  That was a genuine oversight which occurred because we were trying to collect signatures during one afternoon and had not conditioned ourselves to the fact that the SDLP are here in the Seanad in a very real way through the present representative of the party here.  So I do apologise to her.</P>
      <P>The notion behind the motion was that we wanted to regenerate a commitment to the Irish language among the political parties and within the Oireachtas.  We set about it deliberately on an all-party basis because the view of the four signatories was that, in so far as the role of political institutions in the revival of Irish was concerned, the best way forward would be on an all-party basis.  We sought to achieve consensus on the issues and to move forward together, not least because Governments change but also because through the development of an all-party approach hopefully you will get continuity of policy over time.  That is why we approached it in this way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We felt, too, that the matter was one of urgency, that the Irish language is, as all speakers have said, in a precarious position and we felt the time had come to take a political initiative to demonstrate the political will existing in the <Col N="406" /> Oireachtas to act, and to begin the process of generating new momentum.</P>
    <P>I should like at this point to thank the Minister for agreeing to listen to the debate and for agreeing that this motion should be adopted as a first step.  May I just say a few brief words about the proposed all-party committee?  I am assuming that the motion will be adopted unanimously here today.  It is essential that we continue this momentum now.  I ask the Minister to use his good offices to have a similar motion put through the Dáil at the earliest opportunity so that hopefully we can set up the all-party committee within a matter of months and can then begin the task of reviewing in more detail the many issues raised during this debate, and the many issues and proposals contained in the Bord na Gaeilge plan.  I hope the Dáil can act expeditiously on this and that we can perhaps have the relevant motions through both Houses of the Oireachtas before Christmas.</P>
    <P>In relation to the membership of the committee, I believe that all parties should seek out members who have a genuine commitment to the language, irrespective of whether they actually speak it fluently, people who have a genuine commitment to it and are prepared to put aside party political attitudes and to act in the most committed way possible in identifying priorities for action and generating continuity of policy over time. If we go about the business of selecting members not on the basis of who is available, or who is on what other committees and therefore is not available for this one, but on the basis of genuine commitment, we can get in the Oireachtas here an institutional arrangement which will not just monitor policy, but which will act as a pressure group on all governments to continue to make progress.</P>
    <P>I do not for a minute suggest that this Minister needs any pressure put on him, but the point remains that we need to have a pressure group of interested people in the Oireachtas who will continue to press for development in this vitally important area.  As to the composition of the committee, we should not be too concerned about the size of it.  The <Col N="407" /> Government side will obviously have to have a majority but, if there are sufficiently large numbers of people who would like to participate in this work, then we should not be too strict about the numbers involved.  We should also consider the notion of alternate members to act in this case.</P>
    <P>Finally, since the time is up a Leas-Chathaoirligh. I should like to emphasise again that it seems to me that we must, above all else, act in the future in the context of this all-party committee on a consensus basis.  We have shown we are able to do that during this debate.  We have shown that we do not wish to score points against each other.  Each of us in our parties is too vulnerable for that, given the record of State activity in relation to Irish over the years.  If we can continue this consensus-based approach then together we can support the Minister and successive Ministers and, at least at the political level, real action will be undertaken in relation to the language.</P>
    <P>This will be only one part of what needs to be done.  The people themselves ultimately will have to make the decision whether they want it to be revived or not, or whether they wish to let it die.  The politicians have now got to make their commitment so that people at least will be given leadership.  They can decide on the basis of that leadership whether they want to do it or not.  May I thank the Members of the Seanad on behalf of the four signatories and thank the Minister for the support for this motion?</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In beginning, may I say on my own behalf, I suspect on behalf of many Members of the House, and on behalf of around 30 or 40 voluntary organisations and individuals involved in working with the homeless who have <Col N="408" /> indicated very strongly their support for this Bill, particularly for the fundamental principles involved if not for all the details, my gratitude and my appreciation of the fact that the Government have decided not to pre-empt this debate by moving the amendment on the Order Paper.  It is an indication of their shared concern with me on the issues in question that we can now have a broad ranging debate on this matter without the unnecessary entrammelment of it by what would have been in my view a very narrow and restrictive amendment.  I am grateful to the members of the Government party, and indeed to the Minister of State, for their decision on that matter. I do appreciate it, and I would like to put my appreciation on record.</P>
      <P>I am also grateful to the large number of voluntary organisations who have indicated their support for this Bill.  It is almost unprecedented to have so many voluntary groups take a very specific stand on what was becoming a very controversial political issue, groups ranging from those directly dealing with the homeless to trade unions whose members had dealings with the homeless, to individuals who had worked with the homeless and to individuals who were prominent in the area of poverty.  To all those I am very grateful.  I suspect the Minister is as aware as I am of the large number of those groups who have strong views on this matter.</P>
      <P>This Bill must rate as probably the first attempt by legislators in this country to redress the historical wrongs inflicted on homeless people in Ireland.  Back in the reign of Henry VIII in 1531, 450 years ago, legislation was passed which categorised people who were abroad without any means of supporting themselves as vagabonds to be locked up at the first possible opportunity.  Until quite recently that attitude persisted and was supported by most legislatures and by most State legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is necessary, it is essential, it is vital, if we as a society are to make any serious attempt to come to terms with the needs of one of the most oppressed groups of our citizens.  I deliberately use the word &ldquo;oppressed&rdquo; as distinct from <Col N="409" /> the more fashionable terms like &ldquo;underprivileged&rdquo;, &ldquo;deprived&rdquo;, &ldquo;socially disadvantaged&rdquo; etc., because I think groups who are outside our society are there as a consequence of the way we as a majority choose to organise ourselves, not because of some accident of history but in many cases it is necessary to have losers if the rest of us are to feel that we are successful.  Most of us would deny this, but we all like to feel we are that much better off than somebody else.  Therefore, people who are on the margin are, by my definition, oppressed.  They are in many cases the victims of our collective success.  This Bill is not introduced lightly.  Those who support me have conducted what could be legitimately described as years of research, consultation and discussion with many groups, such as the Department of the Environment, many voluntary groups, groups overseas, statutory agents overseas, etc. It was the basis on which I sought election to this House and on which I was elected.</P>
    <P>The Bill is designed to do very definite things and to achieve very specific results. It is, criticisms to the contrary notwithstanding, a practical Bill designed to have a quantifiable effect on the situation on the ground.  It is up to the Government to decide ultimately whether the homeless are to be granted this small measure of reform or indeed a similar measure of reform integrated into their own housing legislation.  I am not an unreasonable man.  I do not expect to take over the Government of the country.  Therefore legislation from the Government side which meets the requirements of my Bill would obviously be equally welcome.  It is up to the Government to decide whether the homeless are to continue to be abandoned to a limbo of confusion and indecision.  Rejection of the principles in this Bill, rejection of the priorities in this Bill, and rejection of the groups referred to in this Bill, effectively amount to abandoning the people referred to in this Bill.  One has to live with the consequences of rejecting a Bill like this, and I do not think anybody wants to.  The large measure of support I have received from Members on all sides of this House indicates the broadly <Col N="410" /> based nature of the concern.  Anyone who thinks that we can help the homeless without legislation to protect and defend their marginal position is, in my view, engaging in a fundamental self-deception because all the other methods have been attempted.</P>
    <P>I want to show in some detail why this Bill is necessary.  I want to show how the failure of present policies creates a legal gap and a legal problem which can only be met by legislation.  I want to talk in that context about how other countries legislate for their homeless.  I will show what the effects will be if the Bill is passed and if it fails.  I will isolate some of the needs of the homeless and how I believe this Bill meets those needs.</P>
    <P>Because it is an important occasion, I will place this Bill in its historical context. Firstly, to the extent that we have at our disposal some facts about homelessness, there are about 3,000 homeless people in this country, excluding the travelling community.  Nobody knows precisely, because the Central Statistics Office until recently kept no information on homeless people, though our data on cattle herds, pig output etc. are not hard to come by. This is not to criticise the areas in which there are detailed data available.  It is more an indication of our social priorities that in the area of homelessness we have no data, even though the US Bureau of Census has always managed to produce data on this although I do not know how reliable it is.  In that context, I would like to say that the Central Statistics Office intend to introduce a homeless category into future censuses and for that particular change I am particularly grateful to the Taoiseach, whose intervention persuaded the Central Statistics Office to take that enlightened view.  I am grateful for that.</P>
    <P>So, what do we know?  We know that there are 1,646 beds for homeless people throughout the country as a whole, 1,155 of these are in Dublin and the rest are in other parts of the country.  There are ten in the North-Western Health Board area and 163 in the Southern Health Board area, for example.  In Dublin the beds are provided mainly in the 11 hostels and night shelters in the city.  In rural areas <Col N="411" /> the bulk are provided in county homes which are&mdash;and I mean no disrespect to the people who work in these places&mdash; descendants of the nineteenth century workhouses.</P>
    <P>Some more modern hostels have been provided by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  The one in Cork is a model of a hostel.  I have said on occasions before that I am not sure whether it is proper to call it a hostel, because it is closer to decent accommodation than any hostel I have ever seen.  Of these 1,646 beds, 116 are provided by health boards and the balance, 93 per cent, by voluntary organisations. It is an interesting model of the partnership that is supposed to exist between statutory and voluntary organisations that 93 per cent of the beds available in hostels and night shelters for homeless people are provided by voluntary organisations.  Indeed, the funding in most cases would be close to 93 per cent by voluntary organisations as well.</P>
    <P>These figures are only crude indications of the number of homeless people and they are only the statistical bedrock. Many other homeless people sleep rough.  It is very difficult to provide an estimate of that.  I will try later to provide what figures are available and perhaps to extrapolate them.  Many are in psychiatric institutions, not because they have serious psychiatric illnesses but because quite literally there is nowhere else for them to go.  Many others are in what can only be described as private rented sector dosshouses, or in a very marginal and insecure part of the private rented sector. A further group would be in prison, often as a result of problems associated and consequential on their homelessness, such as, alcoholism or pure simple petty theft.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the data particularly in the area of the psychiatric services.  In 1974 there were 489 admissions to the psychiatric services which were categorised as being persons of no fixed abode. I think 1974 is the last year for which we have data.  The programme for the homeless in St. Brendan's Hospital, Dublin&mdash; which is incidentally a programme to be commended, and which has some limited <Col N="412" /> statutory assistance, and is the only such specialised service in the State&mdash;had 99 admissions in 1982 and 136 people attending its day centre.  That number is more an indication of the limit of capacity of the programme rather than a limit of demand.</P>
    <P>In terms of those sleeping rough, we know that in the period from September 1982 to June 1983, 94 people were identified as sleeping rough in Dublin.  That figure emerges from a survey carried out by the Dublin Simon Community in consultation with the Economic and Social Research Institute.  Of the 94, 78 were male and 16 female.  Most stayed in the same place all the time.  Fifty-seven had slept rough for more than 12 months, seven were aged 14 to 18 and all seven under 18 were girls.  Fifty were aged 18 to 40 and 37 were over 40.  With respect to the Dublin Simon Community&mdash;and I know the survey is the best that has been conducted&mdash;there is some evidence to suggest that that is just the tip of the iceberg.  We have evidence that, for instance in Carlow, a small town of 20,000 people, there are somewhere between eight and ten people sleeping rough on average.</P>
    <P>If one were to extrapolate that to a city the size of Dublin, one would be talking about 500 or 600 people sleeping rough. It would not be conceivable that there were that many people sleeping rough in Dublin without anybody knowing of their existence, because Dublin is such a huge place that no survey conducted by a small voluntary organisation could claim to have identified them all.  Cork Simon Community, for example, spend over £110 a week bringing food to people who do not come to their shelter, that is, about £5,500 a year to bring food to people who are sleeping rough.</P>
    <P>The Galway Simon Community night shelter is chronically overcrowded, has 15 beds but an average nightly occupancy of 21.  During the day, groups of children call looking for food and shelter.  It is important to underline that.  We have children calling to a night shelter for homeless men looking for food during the day in Galway in 1983.  Dublin's Simon night shelter has 39 beds, but a <Col N="413" /> nightly occupancy of between 55 and 81. In other words, the homeless problem is arguably far larger than the limited statistics indicate.  The last year for which we have official statistics on homelessness come from the last two official reports on homelessness in Ireland.  These are the 1906 Vice Regal Commission on Poor Law Reform and the Department of Health Report on Vagrancy, also of 1906. Those reports indicated that there were some 4,700 people homeless in the 32 counties &mdash; we have not made much progress in the last 75 years &mdash; plus 2,000 sleeping out and a further 1,800 demobilised soldiers needing relief.</P>
    <P>To concentrate too much on statistics would be to fail to convey the full horror of the conditions of people, in particular of people sleeping rough, and those facing the dreary rounds of night shelters and hostels.  There is a fashion to talk of the solution to homelessness in terms of hostels and night shelters for reasons that are as much historical as anything to do with proper social analysis.  The literature of the homeless tells more than the figures of deprivation I have just quoted. Much of the literature on the subject is excellent because it requires writers of sense and sensitivity.  I could quote from George Orwell's <i>The Road to Wigan Pier</i> or <i>Down and Out in London and Paris,</i> but I will not.  Not because they are dated &mdash; although they are many years old they are still topical &mdash; but because more modern sources are available.  The following was written by some members of the Cork Simon Community, with which I am associated, and describes the conditions of those enduring hardship.  It was written in 1983.  I have changed the names only for obvious reasons.</P>
    <P>Peter is in very bad condition, he has a constant itch and tells us there are a few rats around the caravan.  They get through the floor and have eaten their way through the floorboards in many places.  We suspect lice but Peter is not very willing to get himself cleaned up.</P>
    <P>Susan and Dermot live in a formal Corporation house with no cooking facility and very sparsely furnished. The chimney is blocked, the toilet is <Col N="414" /> constantly out of order.  The garden is overgrown.  There is no ESB and no glass in the windows for the past few years.</P>
    <P>Eddie is living in a derelict garage. There is no water, no toilet, no cooking facilities and the garage is constantly damp.</P>
    <P>Mary lives in a derelict garage. There is no toilet, no cooking facilities and no water.</P>
    <P>Pat and Brian live in a derelict caravan. There is no toilet, water or cooking facilities.  It is rat infested and vermin infested, and they share their caravan with a dog.</P>
    <P>Liam lives in a plastic and timber camp, has cooking facilities with an open fire, no toilet and the water is three-quarters of a mile away.</P>
    <P>I emphasise this case:</P>
    <P>Joe lives in a private flat with a toilet, water and cooking facilities.  He is unable to eat for two to three days per week in order to pay his rent.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that this report was not compiled initially for publication, but for an internal meeting of the Cork Simon Community. Therefore the statistics are not being overly stated; the horror is not being emphasised for publicity purposes. This is a verbatim report &mdash; except for the change of names &mdash; of what was produced at that meeting.  Notwithstanding the appalling conditions there, each of those people had some form of accommodation. Therefore, if we were able and willing to provide them with proper accommodation there could be no argument that they would be unable to maintain such accommodation.  Obviously if somebody is prepared to survive in the appalling conditions I have described, there is every reason to believe they would survive, and indeed flourish, if they were provided with proper and decent accommodation.</P>
    <P>That last case I mentioned of the person who goes hungry for two or three days is worth emphasising.  Many homeless people go hungry for reasons like this.  We are talking about £15 to £25 a <Col N="415" /> week for the rent, on average, of a small flat in either Dublin or Cork, and a maximum supplementary welfare rent allowance of £5 a week.  In spite of indications to the contrary, my experience and knowledge show that people do not get in excess of £5 a week.  I know there are exceptions, but in spite of the provisions people rarely get more than the official maximum of £5 per week.  In Cork city charities distribute 300 free or low cost dinners each day.</P>
    <P>The statistics still hide the human face behind the numbers.  Bare categorised facts conceal the hurt feelings, the physical and mental perceptions and the anger of oppressed and deprived people.  How can a person who has a home to go to and a bed to sleep in imagine what it is like for someone who has neither?  I do not think we can, and I do not think there is any legislator in either House who can really claim to get inside the experience of homelessness.  I would not claim to be able to share the experience of homelessness.</P>
    <P>I remember on one occasion I was stuck when I was hitchhiking through Scotland.  I had money but I had no place to stay one night.  The experience of potentially sleeping one night on my own on the side of the road was quite upsetting. None of us can understand the scale of alienation in a person who is compelled to sleep on the side of the road, or in a derelict car, for limitless periods.</P>
    <P>To attempt to get inside the mind of a homeless person I want to quote at some length from a day in the life of a homeless Dubliner, a publication compiled by the Dublin Simon Community and published in October 1983:</P>
    <P>Imagine a cold wet morning.  It is about 6 o'clock and dawn changes the black of night to a dull cloudy grey.  In the Phoenix Park, John, a man who was out all night, is waking up.  The rain has soaked through the few blankets and cardboard sheets covering him and the icy wind cuts through him, through his damp clothes.  The hard ground provided no cushion for him but served to add to his discomfort.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="416" /> John has a groggy throbbing head from drinking wine or some other stronger spirit.  Knowing what he faces and unable to do so he seeks refuge in the bottle.  He believes, as I believe do most homeless people, that his homelessness is temporary, still clutching to the belief that he is not entirely an outcast from society.  It is an early time to awake.  It was not until the early hours that sleep came to bring a bit of peace.  But then there is a whole day to fill.  What shall I do for the day?</P>
    <P>I make no apologies for emphasising this because the emptiness of the life of a homeless person is one of the things that is most difficult for people who have homes to experience or to share.</P>
    <P>Go to Simon, Basin Lane, or maybe Brother Sebastian's?  I wish I had a job, but without an address and a decent set of clothes, I have little hope of getting one.  Homelessness can often be caused by the loss of a job, the sudden deprivation of earnings which paid for a flat or lodgings.  As the rush to work on a Monday morning begins and people are refreshed after the weekend, with a day's work ahead, I am faced with nothing to do except seek a meal with no money in my pockets.</P>
    <P>The queues for breakfast at the eating houses can be fairly robust.  The extrovert men are used to the system and shout to one another across the room.  The quiet, the lost, the confused, the old, eat without speaking, perhaps only communicating with the Sister who hands out the tea.  A brief smile, perhaps a bitter smile, and I remember the days when the egg and tea did not have to be sought from charity.  Well, it's eight o'clock and there is nothing to do until dinner at midday, a different dinner house, different and familiar faces, but only faces.  Can you imagine four-and-a-half hours of boredom, tiresome waiting, monotonous walking around the city, meaningless hours wasted away?</P>
    <P>Some will understandably resort to begging and then to drinking wine. Others will walk for miles around the <Col N="417" /> city.  Many will just hang around, unless it's dole day.  Then there are a few brief hours in the pub and back to the same life.  There is no freedom in having no choice other than doing nothing.  With no home and few friends, it is being condemned to conditions of life which society should not tolerate for any of its citizens.</P>
    <P>Indeed, I heard a prominent member of the Nicaraguan civil service define poverty as the absence of choice.  What I am saying here underlines the poverty of homelessness.</P>
    <P>Begging is another blow to the emotional life of a person.  Christian theologians are now writing that the essential dignity of each individual is important.  The loss of dignity and self-esteem is at its worst when a man or woman is begging for money for drink or food.  Is it any surprise that drink provides some measure of consolation, or forgetfulness, for the homeless?  Dinnertime provides a brief interlude in the day.  The dinners given out are good and nourishing.  Some charge a few pence.  There is some dignity to be gained in paying a small price for a meal.  A word might be exchanged, but often many are sitting in silence, afraid to share their feelings, unable to communicate.</P>
    <P>After lunch, John may go to the bookies but with no money to spend there, or maybe he will hunt around the convents to see if a kind heart will give a ticket to one of the hostels for a bed for the night.  The cost of the Iveagh is prohibitive at £4.35.  The Model, at 50p per night is full, but maybe a ticket for the Morning Star, at £1.40 per night, and the despairing search starts.</P>
    <P>These figures sound very small to the rest of us but to somebody on £28 per week, £1.40p per night is an enormous sum of money.</P>
    <P>It's raining all afternoon.  The GPO provides shelter, under the watchful eyes of a garda.  Again, it is long and monotonous.  Perhaps the boredom is <Col N="418" /> broken by tea at an eating house.</P>
    <P>The churches are open, clean, dry and warm.  But you may be thrown out. Many people who profess Christianity as a way of life seem to think it is their duty to protect Christ in his tabernacle from blokes like John.</P>
    <P>Dublin is full of evening entertainment ... But when you are homeless, Dublin has no entertainment &mdash; it is drudgery and pain.  The outlook is bleak and there is a despair created by hopelessness.  The evening is long and boring.  Boredom is one of the main characteristics of being homeless, shared with other unemployed people, but emphasised more by the lack of relationships and loss of respect, together with real and awful physical deprivation.</P>
    <P>Imagine being faced with an evening with only a few blankets for a bed, the same clothes day in day out, with no change.  The loneliness ... or can we really imagine it and do we look at our city and see these oppressed men and women, or are they just statistics to be shrugged off with trite platitudes?</P>
    <P>I do not think that can enable anybody really to get inside the experience of the alienation of homelessness.</P>
    <P>Being homeless is also about death. It is about people who die before their time, after years of unending struggle against the elements and against an unsympathetic society.  It is about the suicide of those who can fight on no longer.</P>
    <P>An acquaintance of mine committed suicide at 21 years of age and I would attribute the cause of the suicide unquestionably to his homelessness and to his sense of being lost.</P>
    <P>It is about men aged 50 whose faces make them look 70 or more.  It is about people dying of cold in derelict huts and alleyways in the winter wilderness.</P>
    <P>The unpublished diary of a Dublin Simon Community worker records the following:</P>
    <P>Richard B, slept rough from 1969 to 1982.  He froze to death during the <Col N="419" /> snow of January 1982 in a skipper.  Age 58.  Did not get public housing.</P>
    <P>Tom P &mdash; age 60.  Died January 5, 1982.  Evicted the previous day by a landlord who found him troublesome. Died of cold on North Circular Road. Did not get public housing, living in insecure private rented sector.</P>
    <P>What has been the response of our society to this catalogue of misery and isolation?  As far as legislation is concerned, the dominant answer to that question is that we criminalise such people.  We made being homeless a crime, and it still is.  Being homeless is a crime under section 4 of the Vagrancy Act, 1824, a law which was extended to Ireland in 1871.</P>
    <P>In 1982, 842 people were prosecuted by the Garda for vagrancy, mainly for begging and sleeping rough.  That was a 100 per cent increase on the previous year.  Perhaps one of the manifestations of the crime wave people are talking about, is the 100 per cent increase in the prosecutions under the Vagrancy Act. Incidentally, if this Bill ever gets beyond the Second Stage, I would be hoping to introduce an amendment to remove that provision from the Vagrancy Act.  It would be entirely inconsistent to have legislation protecting the rights of homeless people, and at the same time maintain on the Statute Book a provision which made it a crime to be homeless. From my experience of the gardaí, they would dearly like to hand over vagrants, as they are called, to any caring agency they could find.  Since I have often in the past been critical of the gardaí, it is proper that I should say that the forces of law and order, by taking a man in and giving him a dry cell for the night, are probably doing more for him than many of the caring agencies ever did, particularly the statutory caring agencies.  I have said this often before but that is not the real point.  The point is that under a statute still in force and in use, nearly three times a day:</P>
    <P>Any person wandering abroad without visible means of support ... shall <Col N="420" /> be deemed a rogue and a vagabond and imprisoned for up to three months.</P>
    <P>Rarely are people imprisoned but often &mdash; as I said, on a frequency of three times a day &mdash; people are charged under that section of the Vagrancy Act.</P>
    <P>The second response of society was to provide institutionalised care for the homeless.  After 1837 when the Imperial Parliament took up the poor law philosophy of nineteenth century liberalism, workhouses were established. They were designed to deter, not to support. They were designed to be bad.  The Victorian literature thrived, as indeed do many of our contemporary philosophers, journalists and economists, on methods to separate the deserving and unfortunate from the undeserving vagabond with a view to caring for the former and punishing the latter.  By definition in those times, the homeless always fell into the latter category.  Their homelessness was understood to be the product of their sinfulness, their laziness and their bad habits.  Each workhouse had a casual ward and just as each county home did up to 1969, the Poor Law Board complained in 1848 that:</P>
    <P>The roughness of the lodging and the coarseness of the fare provided are not sufficient to deter the honest vagrant.</P>
    <P>As a result, new regulations were then issued to relieve vagrants of their possessions when they came in and to restrict their food to bread and gruel.  Men were obliged to wash, which they disliked, and women were forbidden to wash because it was known that they would like to.  In 1871 the rules were tightened up again and tramps who stayed in the same workhouse more than once a month got a day's hard labour.</P>
    <P>This, then, was the traditional image of the tramp and the vagrant.  Unfortunately such attitudes have not disappeared entirely, because this year the Director of the Economic and Social Research Institute who of all people, should know better, made a speech demanding that those who got the dole should be made to work for it.  It might <Col N="421" /> have been couched in modern sociological jargon and economic theory but it amounts to the same thing as the 19th century poor law philosophy.</P>
    <P>But even at the turn of the century, some people suspected that some humanity could be found at the other side of the casual's ward door.  James Greenwood wrote in the <i>Pall Mall Gazette:</i></P>
    <P>Eight or ten were so enjoying themselves ... tousled, dirty and villainous, they squatted up in their beds and smoked foul pipes and sang snatches of horrible songs and bandied jokes so obscene as to be absolutely appalling.</P>
    <P>In 1909, a campaigning journalist, Everard Wyvall, stayed in some casual wards, or spikes as they were called then and are called now in some cases.  In one he had to spend the day stone breaking and at night was shut up 13 hours in a small unlighted room with ten other men.  From our records and our surveys some of the conditions and some of the existing casual wards in county homes are not that far from those conditions.  So matters rested until 1953.</P>
    <P>Under section 54 of the 1953 Health Act, health boards were obliged to provide institutional assistance to those unable to provide shelter for themselves. That is the present law, which until recently was one that was quoted in ministerial responses to questions about single homeless in particular.  The 1953 Bill was the occasion of a lengthy debate on homelessness.  Under the Bill, casuals were to be obliged to do labour in return for a night's shelter.  The then Minister agreed to remove that clause after strong representations from Dr. Noel Browne. That is probably one of Dr. Browne's less well-known contributions to the alleviation of misery.  The Minister for Health said that the continuation of the county home arrangement for the homeless was a temporary one.  He said on 15 July, 1953 that:</P>
    <P>the aim was to try to get the county homes divided up: to get the various categories of people taken there to separate institutions.</P>
    <P>Mr. Kyne of Waterford supported the <Col N="422" /> idea.  A couple of years turned out to be 16, when a departmental report recommended a change of role for the county home.  The 1969 report stated that casuals were a social problem but that</P>
    <P>the committee did not regard it as necessary to make recommendations in regard to casuals.</P>
    <P>As a result, Ireland's rural homeless were written out of history.  That report recommended the closure of casual wards and recommended that other agencies look after the consequences of that closure. The rural homeless simply began to cease to exist.  The Simon Community became very concerned about this change in policy and the consequential increase in the numbers of people demanding accommodation in the voluntary sector. A survey was conducted.  This indicated that subsequent to 1969, 53 per cent of the county homes closed their casual wards or reduced their provisions for casuals. I have argued that the saving to the State resulting from that extraordinary reduction in capacity to cater for the homeless exceeds the total state assistance to voluntary organisations working for the homeless.  By comparison with 1969 I would argue that the total volume of State expenditure in the area of provision for the homeless has decreased rather than increased when one considers the reduction in county home provision.</P>
    <P>The process of closure is still going on. In 1980, as a punishment for bad behaviour, the county home in Carlow which sheltered 14 to 20 homeless each night, closed its doors for a week.  I do not attribute any blame for the long term problem here to individual citizens.  It was a matter of public policy.  It never reopened and the men have been sleeping rough in Carlow ever since.  The South Eastern Health Board and the Minister for Health have stated that these people who were made homeless by a deliberate decision of public policy are now the responsibility of voluntary organisations.  Therefore, we have got ourselves into the position when homelessness which is created by a deliberate act of public policy must now be solved and remedied by voluntary organisations <Col N="423" /> who discovered the problem which was caused by public policy.</P>
    <P>I hope this underlines the fact that homelessness is not a city phenomenon alone.  The extreme manifestations such as the down-and-out alcoholic in the gutter who is associated with big cities, is often proud of the fact that homelessness is not just a city phenomenon.  I apologise for quoting the Simon Community so often, but it has to be acknowledged that the vast majority of the research and information and statistics that have been compiled in this area have been compiled by the community.  This report showed how overcrowded the existing rural facilities were.  The researcher found &ldquo;seven beds in a separate building&rdquo; in the small Kilkenny town of Thomastown.  Some of the county homes provide a first-class service.  Others, however, are still very much at one with the Victorian poor law tradition.  I have here a report provided, not by a researcher or an observer, but by an articulate and literate resident of the Simon Community in Cork.  He has this to say:</P>
    <P>Some County Homes are clean and the food is good and you can stay in if you're sick.  But others aren't good. One of them will only give you floor space in the day room and if you have a medical docket.  In one town, you have to be in by 5 p.m. &mdash; a minute late and it's tough, even if there's empty beds.  In one County Home it's unbelievably cold and they try to deter you. There are no blankets, only covers. There's no heating.  Only cold water, no towels.  In the day, it's so dark you can't read, though the lighting is due in this year some time.  You used to be locked in at night.  When one of the six beds broke it was never replaced.  And when the windows were broken, no new glass appeared for 3 months.  The wind just came in.</P>
    <P>Just as in the country the homeless were institutionalised in the county homes; so too were the homeless institutionalised in the hostels.  There is a tradition in Dublin of the working men's hostel going back to the turn of the century.  This was <Col N="424" /> designed for single working-class men dependent on casual labour in the docks and the brewery.  These are not the type of people using that kind of accommodation any more, and have not been using it for at least a generation.  The people using hostels and night shelters now do so because they are homeless.</P>
    <P>In the light of questions I have been asked recently and of suggestions from the media and other sources, generally homeless people do not like hostels and night shelters.  There is no reason why they should.  They have to be out during the day in the vast majority of hostels and night shelters.  There is no privacy.  There is no place to put belongings.  The conditions are often bad.  In the Dublin Simon Community night shelter there are four toilets, one bath and one shower for 80 people.  Some hostels are expensive. The largest one in this city charges £21 a week.  This leaves a homeless man only £7 on present welfare rates for food, soap, clothes, shoes, personal hygiene and so on.  I would not dare mention a pint because some of the self-righteous would object to the idea of a homeless man being entitled to a pint.  That would be regarded as a disgraceful luxury, whereas I would regard a little bit of ordinary decent recreation as part of one of the necessities of life.</P>
    <P>Most shelters are in dormitory or cubicle systems.  The dormitory produces its own pressures with no privacy and obviously all sorts of other problems.  The latter without giving any advantages isolates people from each other.  There are not the advantages of separate rooms or anything like that.  Like everything else, there are good and bad shelters.  Some are strict, some are clinical and some are easy going.  But survey after survey in this country and indeed in Britain have shown that the vast majority of homeless people do not like or enjoy hostel life.  One such survey by the Glasgow Council for Single Homeless, a body which could well bear with comparisons in this country and with being imitated here, reached the following conclusions but to judge the success and significance of the conclusions, one must emphasise the image of Glasgow as a poverty-stricken city with poor housing, <Col N="425" /> a high level of unemployment, a high level of alcoholism and high levels of many other social problems.  The council concluded that:</P>
    <P>The first choice accommodation of the overwhelming majority of respondents to be a house/flat of their own (77%), with a further 4% preferring other forms of independent accommodation, such as bedsit or lodgings. The older age group indicated least preference for a place of their own, preferring their present situation.</P>
    <P>That of course is understandable.  This presumably is an indication of an institutionalised person reflecting his aspirations rather than his capabilities.  Indeed one of the objectives of this Bill is to prevent people becoming institutionalised into hostels and shelter-like accommodation and preserving the aspiration for people to have homes of their own separate from institutional protection.</P>
    <P>The survey continues:</P>
    <P>More than 80 per cent however, of hostel residents stated a preference for alternative independent accommodation to hostels, with only 17 per cent actually preferring hostels; 88 per cent of the 36-44 year olds preferred a house or flat of their own to hostel accommodation.</P>
    <P>That is an area in so far as the under 50 age-group are concerned for which there is virtually no provision through public services for housing at present in this country.</P>
    <P>The survey continued:</P>
    <P>This situation, where the longer the period of hostel used and the more integrated the respondent becomes with hostel environment, the less desire there is to seek alternative accommodation, may be due to the fact that the majority of respondents falling into the long period of hostel-stay category are older men, who are less able to secure alternative accommodation, who are institutionalised to such an extent that they are unable to cope independently, and who are generally more apathetic or resigned to <Col N="426" /> their circumstances.</P>
    <P>My own friends in the Cork Simon Community, in association with some other groups, did a survey on a major hostel in Cork &mdash; not the Simon Community one &mdash; and found very similar conclusions, that is a vast majority expressing a strong preference for some other kind of life than hostel living, that vast majority, at some stage in their lives having lived in accommodation of their own.  The UK Department of the Environment publication <i>Single and Home-less,</i> a publication which could well do with being copied, imitated and produced by our own Department of the Environment, indicates very similar values, attitudes and aspirations on the part of the single, homeless population in general in the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Simon survey of people sleeping rough in 1983 cited one case after another of homeless people finding shelters too strict, too violent, overcrowded and with far too many rules and regulations.  The report concluded that there was a repeated reference to the hostels being strict, overcrowded and expensive and that this indicated that hostels, whatever their role in the future, are not a solution to the problem of homelessness.  That is what this Bill is about.  Homeless people should be entitled to public housing on the same basis as the rest of our citizens.  At the moment they are not by any clear legislative definition so entitled.  Present local authority policy towards the homeless and particularly the single homeless and people living in hostels is arbitrary, inconsistent and varies enormously.  When one adds to that the confusion of responsibility for the single homeless as between local authorities and health boards, the sufferings of the homeless are further compounded.</P>
    <P>I should like to read briefly the answers to a question on a survey conducted, unfortunately yet again, by the Simon Community.  This was a question put to the managers of county homes around the country.  The question was whether, to their knowledge, they were under any statutory obligation to provide accommodation <Col N="427" /> for the single homeless.  That was a good straightforward question to which there had to be a simple answer. The answers were as follows: No, Yes, Yes, No, No, Yes, Yes.  The county homes, which should be the underpin of statutory provision for the homeless, were not in fact unanimous or even certain about their statutory obligation to the homeless.</P>
    <P>Let us consider what happens when a homeless person presents himself to a local authority housing officer for housing. To do this we must contrast various local authorities on the basis of another survey conducted by the Simon Community. In respect of West Cork the reply was:</P>
    <P>This Department does not generally rehouse single able-bodied people. These people are expected to provide their own accommodation.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the use of the word &ldquo;rehouse&rdquo; which comes up regularly in local authority specifications, discussions, submissions and details about housing.  They talk entirely about rehousing people. This narrows the debate to people who have some form of some obvious unsatisfactory housing and who are being rehoused.  There are some extreme manifestations of how narrowly that word can be interpreted.  The second point is the emphasis on single able-bodied people, which as far as I am concerned reflects nothing more than a return to a very limited poor law mentality.  Compare the answer from West Cork to that of Mayo which was as follows:</P>
    <P>When a single homeless person who is unable to provide accommodation for himself approaches the local authority we will provide him with temporary accommodation, normally in the form of a caravan.</P>
    <P>A single person who is homeless is provided with immediate temporary accommodation.</P>
    <P>The normal type of accommodation provided by the Council is caravans, demountable dwellings, and one-bed-room, traditional-type houses.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="428" /> There we have two local authorities each operating under the same legislation producing almost contradictory housing policies as directed towards the homeless.</P>
    <P>The policy of Dublin Corporation as outlined by them is as follows:</P>
    <P>We distinguish between persons aged over 50 and those aged under 50. A homeless person in the former category would be treated as a senior citizen and would be eligible for the accommodation specifically provided for senior citizens.  A single person under 50 may be eligible to go on the housing list if he has a medical or social problem, or if we are satisfied that he is genuinely homeless and unable to provide himself with any accommodation. If a single person under 50 in good health and with a job applied for rehousing, his application would be rejected.</P>
    <P>I would not say that is an unreasonable criterion but to give some examples.  Joe T, a resident in the Dublin Simon Community and living on disabled person's maintenance allowance, disabled with inactive TB, applied for housing on October 12, 1982.  On November 11, 1982, his application was rejected.  He got no points on a housing priority scheme.</P>
    <P>Ellen K, aged 69 and a pensioner, applied for housing in 1979.  By 1983 she had 22 points.  The threshold for getting even low-demand housing is 50 points, and priority housing 100 to 120.  She had been told that even in those circumstances she is much more likely to get even that limited form of accommodation than would be the case of a man of the same age.  She is resident in the Dublin Simon Community night shelter.</P>
    <P>In 1983 two residents applied as cohabitees and were treated as a married couple.  They were given low demand housing without shower, bath or hot water.  They were told, however, that if they had applied separately they would have had to wait for around 20 years, until 2003 AD.  Quite clearly there is a large element of arbitrariness in local <Col N="429" /> authority housing policy as directed towards the single homeless.</P>
    <P>Some local authorities are very positive and consider that the homeless are very much their business.  In the Leitrim County Council area, the homeless applicant takes his chance with everybody else, but being homeless, his chances would be good.  Others are quite adamant that it is not.</P>
    <P>The situation in Dún Laoghaire Corporation is, as outlined by them:</P>
    <P>As you can appreciate, the Corporation's main concern as a housing authority is the provision of accommodation for families, including single parent families and elderly persons. The responsibility for providing shelter for the homeless rests with the Eastern Health Board.</P>
    <P>In Galway Corporation the situation is as follows:</P>
    <P>In general, the housing of single persons does not extend beyond providing for elderly people and the disabled. Other younger able applicants are expected to be able to make their own provision for accommodation.  Where such persons are unable to do so, shelter and maintenance in a County Home or similar institution is provided by the health authorities, in accordance with section 54 of the Health Act, 1953.</P>
    <P>Even if that much were true and I am not accusing them of being dishonest but of being mistaken, we would have some progress.  Their reply continues:</P>
    <P>The Corporation is most anxious that a shelter for the homeless be provided immediately.  Every effort has been made to bring this about.  In view, however, of legal difficulties and the fact that the Corporation has not a prime responsibility in this matter, it is considered that the only possible further action that can be taken is to urge the Western Health Board to provide the necessary accommodation immediately.</P>
    <P>There is a history to that statement which is that Galway Corporation were prepared to play a major part in providing <Col N="430" /> a hostel for the homeless in Galway until they got a directive from the Department of the Envrionment, and this was not in the present Minister's period of office I hasten to add, that they were to have no part in providing a hostel for the homeless even though the relevant section of the 1966 Housing Act authorises local authorities to build hostels.  The Department of the Environment apparently took the view&mdash;I do not know if they still do&mdash;that it is no business of local housing authorities to build hostels in spite of the statutory enablement to do so.</P>
    <P>Galway County Council on the other hand say that accommodation does allow for housing of single persons and that this has been done in a number of cases. Louth County Council state:</P>
    <P>I regret that we do not have standing arrangements to cater for the needs of &lsquo;such persons&rsquo;, and if a single homeless person is placed on the housing list, it would be extremely difficult to say when he or she could expect to be rehoused.</P>
    <P>However, Dundalk Urban Council do accept people from Dundalk Simon Community.</P>
    <P>Some local authorities are extremely unsympathetic to the needs of the single homeless.  Waterford Corporation, for instance say:</P>
    <P>Waterford Corporation has and always has had extensive lists of married couples, one-child and larger families (whether two or one parent) awaiting rehousing from inadequate living conditions.  There is, in practical terms, no point in even considering what policy they would like to formulate in regard to single persons.  Single (non-elderly) persons are not encouraged to apply for rehousing as in fact there is no prospect of local authority rehousing for them.</P>
    <P>Again, that word &ldquo;rehousing&rdquo; is used twice.  Donegal County Council state:</P>
    <P>Due to the acute housing situation in this County at the present time, the Council could not entertain an application <Col N="431" /> for rehousing from a single person, except where that person was at least 60 years of age.</P>
    <P>Limerick Corporation state that ...</P>
    <P>the corporation, as a housing authority, do not make any provision for a single person, that such persons would qualify for institutional assistance from the health board.</P>
    <P>I do not want to allow my emphasis on single persons to be misunderstood.  The problem with homelessness is that if a family are homeless for any period of time they will inevitably end up as single homeless persons because the family will inevitably be split up and divided, and the mother will live in one accommodation and the father in another.  Families under such pressure rarely will survive as a unit and therefore what began as family homeless will end up as single homeless.</P>
    <P>One local authority have a simple answer.  They are Clare County Council who state that:</P>
    <P>the council have no record of any single homeless people,</P>
    <P>even though Simon shelters have people who can proudly trace their childhood and working life to County Clare.</P>
    <P>Other authorities will, however, adopt a flexible and imaginative approach.  Let us take Offaly County Council as an example: They say that:</P>
    <P>Most of these cases are met by the provision of a pre-fab on a site provided through the goodwill of a local farmer.  The pre-fab would consist of a small kitchen, sleeping compartment, and toilet.  A cooker is provided and the pre-fab is serviced with water, sewerage and electricity.  This has proved a very satisfactory arrangement in that it allows the people to remain in areas where they are known and usually neighbours will look after them.  We do not operate a waiting list&mdash;i.e. an urgent case will take precedence and we are generally able to accommodate a person within about three months after application is approved.  A total of 110 single people, mostly over 60, are presently accommodated in this <Col N="432" /> way, approximately 35 over the past 5 years.</P>
    <P>The policy of the Wexford County Council is that the council would endeavour to provide some form of emergency accommodation, most likely a caravan and that applicants have been rehoused from these caravans in one- to two-bed-roomed houses, which as I have said, constitute 15 to 20 per cent of the number of new houses built by the council.</P>
    <P>Laois County Council say that:</P>
    <P>approximately 130 single homeless persons have been rehoused in maisonettes and demountable dwellings in the past five years.</P>
    <P>A similar approach is evident in Limerick, County Kilkenny, Wicklow, Roscommon, Longford, and Tipperary South Riding.  I would like in particular to quote from the latter since, as well as other reasons it is the local authority of the Acting Leader of the House.  They say that:</P>
    <P>The Council does not consider existing hostels and shelters an adequate form of housing for single people.  This council has housed four single homeless people under 60 in the past five years and three over 60.  In addition, it has provided caravans in a further 5 cases.  Clonmel Corporation and the three Urban District Councils in South Tipperary have housed 2 single homeless people under 60 in the past 5 years and 6 such persons over 60.</P>
    <P>To my knowledge that particular local authority in spite of their very progressive attitude to single homeless people have not been swamped by every single homeless person in the country depending on them, looking for an enlightened attitude to housing as distinct from other local authorities.  Perhaps some of the fears that people have expressed to me about the consequences of the implementation of this Bill are a little less than well-grounded though it is obvious that most local authorities are not equipped to respond to the need for emergency housing. Meath County Council, for instance are quite clear that there is no emergency <Col N="433" /> accommodation available from them.  I find it astonishing that local authorities can state categorically that they have no emergency accommodation available.  It seems to me to show a very dim and very limited form of planning for the housing needs that are liable to arise.</P>
    <P>Dublin County Council state that where a housing applicant has been evicted or rendered homeless through no fault of his own &mdash; again I have some doubts about that particular phrase &mdash; the council will endeavour to rehouse them.  They go on to say that:</P>
    <P>... this will be entirely dependent on the availability of suitable vacant accommodation.  As the council's rented housing stock is relatively small and vacancies are infrequent, it is very often impossible to deal with requests for emergency accommodation as they arise.  It is also essential by the terms of the Letting Scheme to be qualified on residential grounds.  Each applicant must satisfy the council that he or his wife is a native of County Dublin or that either spouse has been residing in the County of Dublin for any continuous period of ten years, or for a continuous period of four years immediately prior to the date of allocation.</P>
    <P>Some people are obviously very frightened that if they do not add on all these qualifications the floodgates are liable to be opened.  I do not know that that is right.</P>
    <P>Another critical area is that of hostels. Do local authorities accept on to their lists &mdash; I am not talking about housing &mdash; of people whom they deem to be eligible to be considered for housing, people who are basically homeless but who are living in hostels on a temporary basis?  I must repeat again that hostels are open only at night, that there is little or no privacy in them, that living conditions in some hostels are very poor and sometimes worse than those to be found in prison.</P>
    <P>Carlow County Council state:</P>
    <P>I wish to inform you that in the last five years the council re-housed 16 single persons in limited accommodation <Col N="434" /> dwellings and demountable dwellings. The majority of persons housed were 60 years of age and over.  The council does not house persons who reside in hostels.</P>
    <P>I do not know if there is a hostel anywhere in their area so perhaps that is why they do not house people from hostels.  There is a hostel in Waterford and the corporation there say that&mdash;</P>
    <P>hostels as such, if reasonably adequate, would seem to be suitable for single persons.</P>
    <P>It is always invariably those who never had to live in hostels who think they are suitable for single persons.</P>
    <P>Some local authorities have their doubts about hostels.  Cork County Council say that:</P>
    <P>With reference to hostels and night shelters, I feel that in times of crisis situations this type of accommodation provided a temporary home for such people, yet in the long run lacks the atmosphere of community integration.</P>
    <P>Others consider that hostels are not suitable and will accept hostel residents on to their housing lists.  Monaghan County Council said:</P>
    <P>The provision of hostels or shelters is almost non-existent in this county, and the council does accept applications from persons residing in such hostels or shelters for re-housing.</P>
    <P>Tipperary North Riding had this to say:</P>
    <P>We have accepted applications from the Hospital of the Assumption.</P>
    <P>&mdash; the county home in the area.  Mayo County Council said that residents of hostels and shelters are accepted onto their housing lists, again, a policy that is clearly inconsistent.</P>
    <P>Two other points should be made in this context.  At times we have seen the ultimate absurdity of the Simon Community being asked by local authorities to provide people with housing.</P>
    <P>I might quote a letter received from Dublin Corporation as follows:</P>
    <P>I would be grateful if you would provide overnight accommodation for <Col N="435" /> Miss K. D, aged 45 years.  She is homeless and was just discharged from hospital today.  The flat in Crumlin where she has been living is now unfit for living accommodation.</P>
    <P>It seems that once someone strays over the no-man's-land between insecure housing and none at all, then she is doomed, One local authority will not house the homeless because &mdash; and I would like Senators to listen carefully to this &mdash; to qualify to apply you have to have your existing bad housing conditions inspected, and if you are homeless, then you do not have any conditions to be inspected and so you cannot apply. That particular case does not refer to that local authority.  I will communicate with the Minister in regard to that.  I do not wish to get involved in naming that one here.</P>
    <P>One classic case, written up by the Galway Simon Community Project Leader had this to say:</P>
    <P>Elizabeth and John C. first came in contact with us in June of this year when they were both homeless.  They had returned from England in 1970. They then moved in with John's father and aunt.  They had to leave this accommodation when John's father died in 1971.  They subsequently moved in with John's cousin, where they remained until last June, when relationships deteriorated between themselves and the cousin.  This is hardly surprising, when one considers that the house had only three bedrooms but accommodated three adults and six children.</P>
    <P>From June until September of this year, Elizabeth and John were homeless and John stayed in the Simon night shelter and Elizabeth stayed at Bethlehem House.  During this period they had no opportunity for any privacy whatsoever.  John, who has always suffered from depression, became severely depressed and had to be hospitalised for a period.  He still attends the out-patients clinic at the Regional Hospital.  His work also suffered from the unrest and he could no longer cope <Col N="436" /> with his job.  Since September, they have been staying in a one-bedroomed flat.  The rent is £25 per week and the landlady is threatening to increase it to £35 per week.  Now that they are totally dependent on John's unemployment benefit, this, together with their admitted low coping abilities, holds out little hope for Elizabeth and John maintaining accommodation in the long-term in the private rented sector.  We fear that Elizabeth and John will continually arrive back on our doorstep in need of accommodation but we do not have the facilities for married couples.  They first applied for Corporation accommodation when they returned from England in 1970, but they have to date received no offer at all.</P>
    <P>That was in 1982.  Again, I feel that this couple will only survive and maintain some form of stability if they are given public accommodation.</P>
    <P>The principle &mdash; I suppose the word &ldquo;principle&rdquo; is a little inadvisable, it is more a consequence of neglect than a principle &mdash; of splitting families and then declaring them ineligible for housing because they have become single is clearly obnoxious in a country claiming to uphold the sanctity of the family. There are virtually no family hostels in this State and the Dublin Simon Community is alone in having even a mixed sex night shelter.  This splitting up of families is condoned by only one other State I know of and that is racist South Africa. The Galway Simon Community night shelter welcomes women and children in the afternoon.  The Galway Women's Shelter does not open until 8.30 p.m. and women must mind their babies and young children on the streets every evening until then.</P>
    <P>The record of existing local authority policy to the homeless is arbitrary, inconsistent and confused.  Some operate very good schemes, others are downright inhumane.  This Bill attempts to come to grips with these issues by doing three things.  It introduces a definition into law for the term &ldquo;homeless&rdquo;.  It identifies and defines local authorities as being responsible for the homeless and attempts to get <Col N="437" /> rid of the present extraordinary confusion. It obliges them to house homeless people, the third provision being the one that has caused most confusion in other circles.  Looking at each in turn, first of all we do not have a legal definition of &ldquo;homeless&rdquo;.  The only existing definition of &ldquo;homelessness&rdquo; is derived from the 1824 Act and that is simply a definition to enable us to put people in jail.  The census of 1986 will use the term &ldquo;homeless&rdquo;.  It is a word that, while perhaps it is lacking in legal definition is fairly well understood.</P>
    <P>Basically this Bill has to start from scratch.  The definitions here employ definitions used in the British Homeless Persons Act, 1977.  I would like to emphasise that because I gather from newspaper reports that the Minister, or someone speaking for the Minister, has raised objections to the definition of &ldquo;homelessness&rdquo; in the Bill.  It is, by and large, the definition used in the British Act.  The British Act has worked.  No floodgates have been opened.  There have been no huge inundations of local authorities by hordes demanding immediate housing. There are differences in aspects but it is a similar definition to the British one of &ldquo;homelessness&rdquo;.  It is designed to cover such cases as people sleeping rough, people in hostels and shelters, husbands barred from their homes &mdash; and I make no apology for the fact that even if a husband is barred from his home that does not give us, in society, the right to abandon him entirely &mdash; travellers, prisoners and psychiatric patients who are discharged without the authorities having arranged accommodation for them.  The number of occasions on which prisons and hospitals discharge people to nowhere &mdash; one can discuss this with any voluntary organisation one wishes &mdash; is quite astonishing &mdash; individuals barred from their homes by relatives, which would be characteristic of many of the young homeless and individuals temporarily displaced from the private rented sector.</P>
    <P>This section may well prove to be controversial, but my contention, my starting point, would be that all these people are homeless and therefore are vulnerable to <Col N="438" /> long-term homelessness.  I hope to return again and again to this, that this Bill is not just a provision to cater for the existing homeless population.  It is an attempt to provide a means of intervention to prevent long-term homelessness with all the consequences that has for people and for society.  It is as much a preventive as a remedial measure.  The inclusion of people now in hostels and night shelters in the definition of &ldquo;homelessness&rdquo; is in my view non-negotiable.  Such people were not included in the original British Act of 1977 because of the nature of the compromises that were needed to get three-party agreement.  However, I would hasten to add that even Margaret Thatcher's Tories in 1977 reckoned that it would be politically unacceptable to vote down the Homeless Persons Bill in the British Parliament, that it would provide an image of callousness and hardheartedness that even Margaret Thatcher's Tories could not face.  So there had to be agreement and there was compromise during Committee Stage of that Bill.</P>
    <P>People resident in hostels were not included in the original British Bill, but from 1982 onwards, they have been following the ruling of <i>Regina v. Waveney District Council ex parte Bowers.</i>  Justice Stephen Brown then ruled that a shelter was and I quote:</P>
    <P>... crisis accommodation.  It is crisis accommodation for people who are homeless and offers them a basic night shelter only.  In no sense could it be described as a home, and when one sees that the occupants for the night have to leave by 8 a.m. the following morning and cannot return until evening, one realises that it is not in any sense accommodation which can be equated with a home.</P>
    <P>Therefore even though hostels and night shelters were deliberately excluded from the British Act the courts in Britain have now redefined &ldquo;homelessness&rdquo; in such terms that residents of night shelters and hostels are accepted as being, <i>de facto</i>, &ldquo;homeless&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The second aim of the Bill is to designate the local authorities as responsible <Col N="439" /> for caring for the homeless.  I have already detailed the confusion existing in the minds of county home authorities about their legal responsibilities.  I know that there is a working party involving the Departments of the Environment, Health, local authorities and health boards attempting to grapple with this confusion of responsibility.  However, I have to say that recent statements from the Minister about the brief of that working party have expanded it way beyond what the working party indicated to me they were doing.  That may well have been mis-information.  But I must say that my understanding of what that working party were doing and what I read in the papers this morning is very different. However, I could have been wrong.  The only real choice in terms of designating responsibility is between local authorities and the health boards.  A detailed examination of the medical conditions of homeless people shows that their medical conditions derive from their homelessness, not the other way round.  It is one of the extraordinary aspects of the whole area of public policy with regard to the homeless that they are more or less defined as constituting a medical rather than a housing problem.  All sorts of things, their drinking and other problems, are used to support that contention. Of the 600 people contacted by &mdash; I think it was the Cork Simon Community in 1975, or it may have been all the Simon Community &mdash; 21 per cent had skin disease, clearly due to inadequate personal and clothes washing, drying, or bed linen; 16 per cent had bruising, abrasions, twisted ankles and infected wounds, due to lack of first aid; 13 per cent had chronic bronchitis and emphysema, clearly due, by and large, to lack of warm, dry, ventilated accommodation or adequate footwear, while 15 per cent had nutritional deficiency.</P>
    <P>In May 1982, Dundalk Simon Community reported that, of their residents, 18 had been hospitalised in the previous year and a further 21 had been dispatched to casualty and out-patient departments. The reasons included alcoholism, psychiatric <Col N="440" /> illness, drug overdose, broken limbs, cirrhosis, pneumonia and stomach ulcers.</P>
    <P>People get TB because they are in overcrowded night shelters.  They get foot sores and chest infections from walking around in wet clothes all day.  They get a drink problem because they drink alcohol to keep warm at night and to obliterate the misery of the wet, the damp and the cold because the only fellowship they have, in many cases, is that of the bottle.  I repeat, alcoholism is a consequence, not a cause, of homelessness. They get infestation because there are rats where they sleep.  They are dirty because there is nowhere to wash.  In other words, what we have is a social problem with health manifestations.  If all these homeless people had dry, public housing or indeed any other kind of housing flat, most of these problems would diminish dramatically.  This is the right direction to be going in.  Health boards are not housing agencies.  Any of their solutions to homelessness would understandably and, by definition, be institutional hostel-orientated, the one approach that has clearly not worked.  I would still see health boards as having a role to play.  It would be to support existing voluntary organisations, to help in the provision of night shelter accommodation for both emergencies and for those who prefer hostels to independent housing. The minority would appear to prefer hostels to independent housing.</P>
    <P>The Bill obliges local authorities to house homeless persons.  There is no such statutory obligation at present on local authorities in any area of housing.  The suggestion that there should be, I know, causes some people to freak out but there is no good reason why this should be the case.  After all, health boards are obliged to provide medical services.  VECs are obliged to provide educational services. This would constitute a shift of philosophy in the present housing policy and that is new.  But the present discretionary system does not work and fails quite dramatically to meet the needs of the homeless category.  To preserve the present system in its present form simply guarantees that these needs will go unmet <Col N="441" /> indefinitely.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a commitment to ensuring that Ireland's existing homeless population is housed.  It would guarantee the option of housing for those now sleeping rough and for those in hostels and night shelters.  The orderly housing, over a period of time, of the present homeless population may enable some of the existing shelters and hostels to close.  It is a humanitarian measure whose objective is the reduction of human misery.  It is administratively efficient, by defining one body as responsible rather than two.  An inevitable result of the housing of the homeless population will be a reduction in the need of this group for medical services.  Indeed some will develop a stability of lifestyle that will enable them to return to the workforce and to be producers in society once again</P>
    <P>In that context it is worth throwing up a statistic and its consequences.  Some of our surveys have indicated that, in their lifetime, about one-third of homeless people spend time in prison, usually for petty offences.  If one assumes that in the lifetime of a homeless person, he spends the equivalent of a year in prison the cost to the State of that 12-month period of imprisonment at present costs is approximately £25,000.  The expenditure of part of that sum on the provision of accommodation would probably guarantee that such a person would never end up in prison.  Indeed one could argue therefore that the State would be the nett beneficiary in the provision of housing.</P>
    <P>At present this country has one of the worst set of arrangements for the protection of the homeless in the whole of the developed world.  In that category of the developed world I would include the United States, which sometimes I do and sometimes I do not.  In this case I will include the United States, and I shall revert to that.  With the exception of Greece we are the only part of the European Economic Community not to have some kind of statutory provision for homeless people.  When I saw a recent newspaper headline about an alliance of the poor I began to wonder had I missed out on something new in Irish politics. <Col N="442" /> But I discovered it referred to ourselves and the Greeks.</P>
    <P>In Britain the Homeless Persons Act ensures housing for certain vulnerable categories of homeless people.  In Denmark the position of the homeless is maintained by their 1966 Social Assistance Act.  In France reintegration centres have been established.  In The Netherlands there is a social contract with voluntary organisations to provide accommodation for the homeless.  In The Netherlands a social contract with voluntary organisations does not mean getting the voluntary organisations to do the job while the State provides about 5 per cent of the cost.  It means a genuine equal partnership in terms of funding, legislation and so on.  In Germany 400 million deutschmarks are spent each year on building programmes for their 260,000 homeless.  Nobody is pretending that homelessness is easy to dispense with, easy to get rid of.  Even in an advanced, prosperous country like Germany there are homeless people but they do spend quite a substantial sum of money on them.  Four hundred million deutschmarks would be of the order of £100 million.</P>
    <P>In the socialist countries there are housing objectives laid down in their Constitutions.  In two American States, New York and Virginia, there is now a constitutional right to shelter established by the State authorities.  I should like here to quote from the judgment of the New York Supreme Court, in the context of this constitutional right to shelter, because it is significant both as a decision and in its detail.  This was judgment 42582/79 in Robert Callaghan, Clayton W. Fox, Thomas Damien Roig, James Hayes, James Spellman and Paul E. Toole, plaintiffs <i>versus</i> Hugh Carey, Governor &amp; Others, defendants; dated 26 August 1981:</P>
    <P>It is hereby ordered, adjudged and decreed as follows:</P>
    <P>1.  The city defendants shall provide shelter and board to each homeless man who applies for it provided that (a) the man meets the standard to qualify for the home relief programme established in New York State; or (b) <Col N="443" /> the man, by reason of physical, mental or social disfunction, is in need of temporary shelter.</P>
    <P>No. 2 is a list of shelter standards specified, not by the social welfare authorities, but by the courts and reads:</P>
    <P>2.  The City defendants shall provide shelter at facilities operated in accordance with the standards set forth in this paragraph as soon as practicable and not later than September 1, 1981.</P>
    <P>(a)  Each resident shall receive a bed of a minimum of 30 inches in width, substantially constructed, in good repair, and equipped with clean springs.</P>
    <P>(b)  Each bed shall be equipped with both a clean, comfortable, well-constructed mattress, standard in size for the bed and a clean, comfortable pillow of average size.</P>
    <P>(c)  Each resident shall receive two clean sheets, a clean blanket, a clean pillow case, a clean towel, soap and toilet tissue.  A complete change of bed linens and towels will be made for each new resident and at least once a week and more often, as needed on an individual basis.</P>
    <P>(d)  Each resident shall receive a lockable storage unit.</P>
    <P>(e)  Laundry service shall be available to each resident not less than twice a week.</P>
    <P>(f)  A staff attendant to resident ratio of at least 2 per cent shall be maintained in each shelter facility at all times.</P>
    <P>(g)  A staff attendant trained in first aid shall be on duty in each shelter facility at all times.</P>
    <P>(h)  A minimum of ten hours per week of group recreation shall be available for each resident at each shelter facility.</P>
    <P>(i)  Residents shall be permitted to leave and to return to shelter facilities at reasonable hours without hindrance.</P>
    <P>(j)  Residents shall be permitted to receive and send mail and other correspondence without interception or interference.</P>
    <P>(k)  The City defendants shall make <Col N="444" /> a good faith effort to provide pay telephones for use by the residents at each shelter facility.  The City defendants shall bear any reasonable cost for the installation and maintenance of such telephones.</P>
    <P>On information it is said:</P>
    <P>The City defendants shall provide applicants for shelter with clear written information concerning other public assistance benefits to which they may be entitled at the time the applicants apply for shelter.</P>
    <P>Then there is a provision for monitoring the compliance of the City authorities with those recommendations.</P>
    <P>I would emphasise that those are not the &ldquo;pie in the sky&rdquo; demands of some idealistic voluntary organisation.  They are the conclusions of the New York State Supreme Court as to what would be regarded as the basic, elementary provisions for shelter for homeless people.</P>
    <P>I should like to talk at some length about the operation of the British Homeless Persons Act.  Leaving European examples aside, an examination of housing legislation in our neighbouring country repays study.  I have no doubt that the British example will be used by some to argue both for and against the Bill. Therefore, I would like to set the record straight from the start.  Since 1977, there has been legislation for homeless people in Britain under this Act.  Until 1948, Britain's homeless were subjected to the same workhouse regime as were Ireland's homeless.  This was changed in 1948 with the introduction of the National Assistance Act.  It is interesting to note that pressure for the change came as a result of Luftwaffe attacks on British cities during the Second World War.  Ordinary citizens who had been bombed were accommodated in the degrading workhouses which hitherto had known only the extremely poor.  When ordinary citizens discovered the conditions of the workhouses an overwhelming demand developed for remedies to the workhouses mentality.  They saw how dreadful they were and resolved that the homeless should not continue to suffer the same <Col N="445" /> regime.  Under the National Assistance Act of 1948, it was the duty of local authorities to provide temporary help for homeless people until such time as they achieved public housing&mdash;not an unreasonable viewpoint because of the postwar housing reconstruction programme.</P>
    <P>However, the problem of homelessness did not recede.  It persisted.  The 1957 Rent Act, which decontrolled the private sector, gave rise to a flood of evictions and raised the rents of low-income households way beyond what they could afford.  It was also clear by the late fifties that policies at local level varied enormously.  In one comment on British housing policy, Marian Bowley writing in &ldquo;Housing and the State&rdquo; had this to say:</P>
    <P>Local authorities have been given powers which they are only partially willing to exercise and duties which they are unwilling to perform.  In the absence of any effective central control, the local authorities can and do, in practice, re-legislate as to the extent to which they will carry out or accept a national policy.</P>
    <P>In the context of what I have just said about the behaviour of various local authorities that particular comment is extremely apposite.  In practice what happened was that the local authorities designated the homeless as problem people and passed them on to the health authorities along with the sick and the aged.</P>
    <P>The echoes on today's situation in Ireland are frighteningly similar.  Janet Richards' study of the Housing (Homeless Persons) Act, noted and I quote:</P>
    <P>Many authorities declined outright to accommodate the homeless, or restricted the amount of assistance by applying residential qualifications and quotas, in which the accommodation provided was typically low-standard, half-way housing, which served as a</P>
    <P>&mdash; and this was another poor law echo &mdash;</P>
    <P>deterrent.</P>
    <P>To house the homeless was contrary to the established principles of sound housing policy.  Firstly, it was discordant <Col N="446" /> with the waiting list philosophy. Secondly, the tendency to apply moral criteria in judging needs meant that the homeless, and in particular those homeless as a result of eviction, were perceived to be feckless and undeserving, and hence undesirable as council tenants.</P>
    <P>Therefore, by 1960, it was clear that the National Assistance Act had failed because it did not ensure that local authorities housed the homeless and because, more basically, the Act of 1948 treated &ldquo;homelessness&rdquo; as a temporary product of the war, rather than something structural, which is what it is.</P>
    <P>In 1960, London County Council, following a demonstration of 2,000 homeless people led by two bishops, abolished the three-month stay-time in hostels and set up a special Committee of Inquiry into the Homeless, which reported in 1962.  The London County Council (Janet Richards Report) concluded that:</P>
    <P>Welfare departments are not properly organised, staffed, or equipped to deal with what is, in the main, a housing problem and ...the responsibility of the housing department.</P>
    <P>I hope we will never again have to fight the battle here about who should be, in principle, at least responsible for the homeless.  It has been argued in every other country and the decisions have always ended up on the same lap, falling under the same heading.  I hope we will not have to advance that argument again. London County Council did accept, as did other people working in the field &mdash; and as I have been arguing here today &mdash; that homelessness is the result of restricted access to housing, aggravated by housing shortage, and less a result of personal inadequacies.</P>
    <P>The response of the British local authorities to homelessness was late, lethargic and might not have happened at all but for both the campaigning work of organisations like &ldquo;Shelter&rdquo;, and media attention like the famous film &ldquo;Cathy Come Home&rdquo; which, even now &mdash; almost 20 years later &mdash; is well worth seeing again for the way it catalogues, in <Col N="447" /> believable circumstances, the decline of a family under the pressures of homelessness. I should like to think the same would happen here if ever we produced a &ldquo;Cathy Come Home&rdquo; film.  But &ldquo;A Day in the Life of Martin Cluxton&rdquo; did not produce any immediate response here. Hopefully when the Children's Bill finally emerges we will see some response.  Reverting again to the British position, a Home Office circular was issued &mdash; No. 19 of 1967 &mdash; appealing for a consistent policy in treating the homeless, nothing disturbing numbers of local authorities not accommodating the homeless.  Again, shades of Ireland in the eighties.  That circular failed to achieve its purpose and the situation was unchanged seven years later.  Accordingly, a new one was issued &mdash; Circular No. 18 of 1974 &mdash; which again reminded local authorities of their responsibilities. The number of homeless people still in need of public housing and not getting it continued to rise.  Not until 1976 did the Secretary of State for the Environment accept what the organisations on the ground who worked with the homeless had been saying for nearly twenty years, namely, that legislation was needed.  I would accept that the organisations working with the homeless in this country have been talking about legislation for three years.  I sincerely hope I do not have another 17 to wait.</P>
    <P>The same is true here, and anybody who argues to the contrary that legislation can be avoided and is unnecessary in this area would have great need to rewrite British social history.  The British Act is similar but not identical to the Bill proposed here.  It defines the homeless in terms of priority cases.  It states that local authorities are responsible, and obliges them to house homeless people.  Since 1977, over 100,000 homeless households have been provided with accommodation under that Act.  It has stopped many children being separated from their parents and prevented many husbands from being separated from their wives.  It has improved family life and provided assistance for those who would otherwise <Col N="448" /> not have got it.  It was and is, by any standard &mdash; though inadequate nevertheless &mdash; a humanitarian achievement.</P>
    <P>There are defects in the British Act I would not wish to see included in this Bill.  There are three that I will identify. First, single homeless people are not included as a priority category.  As a result, unless a local authority chooses to house them, they are not housed.  That is why there are still many homeless people on the streets in Britain.  The idea of including single people was not acceptable to the Liberal or Conservative Parties in 1977 and, since the Labour Government was then a minority, all-party agreement was necessary.</P>
    <P>Also under the British Act some local authorities are not obliged to house people who they feel &mdash; and as the Act would define them &mdash; are intentionally homeless.  As a result, some local authorities are able to evade their responsibilities entirely.  In 1980, for instance, six major British local authorities declared over 50 per cent of their applicants as having made themselves intentionally homeless.  They are a small proportion. The usual number of applicants who are judged to be intentionally homeless is of the order of 3 or 4 per cent.  Those authorities using the 50 per cent figure for intentional homelessness are, in fact, abusing the Act.  To give an indication of the sort of abuse that has crept in, I am aware of the circumstances of a battered wife who left her house because her husband was beating her up, and the local authority said: &ldquo;You left of your own free will. Therefore you are intentionally homeless. Therefore you are not entitled to be housed&rdquo;.  That is the sort of perverse interpretation, and hence my great reservations about an intentionally homeless provision or catch provision in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Third, local authorities need not house people who have no local connection.  As a result, some local authorities have evaded their responsibilities, particularly as many homeless persons have, by definition, no fixed abode and therefore no proven record of local residence.  That is why this Bill includes single homeless people, and does not have these clauses that in some areas ensure that the intentions <Col N="449" /> of the British Parliament are frustrated. The British Act has been warmly applauded by all organisations working with the homeless as being of great benefit to families, but generally it has been of little use to single people.</P>
    <P>There were many criticisms of the British Bill as it went through Parliament and I would like to anticipate some of these here today.  It was alleged that councils were forced to house the homeless at the expense of local people.  The contrast between homeless and local people escapes me but it is one that was made fairly vigorously, and vast numbers of amendments were proposed and agreed on that Bill as it went through the British Parliament.  Not true.  Only 4 per cent of applicants have, since 1977, no connection with the area in which they applied. Even in London, supposedly a major centre of transient population, that figure is 6 per cent.</P>
    <P>It was alleged that people deliberately made themselves homeless in order to get public housing.  This is not true on the basis of the evidence available.  Leaving aside those local authorities who abuse the intentionality escape clause, the intentional rate is less than 3 per cent nationally.  Psychologically, I think this criticism is on very shaky ground.  I know some local authority members here would take issue with me on this one. Hopefully on Committee Stage we can discuss that particular clause in some detail.</P>
    <P>People do not give up any sort of homes to throw themselves on the cold and wet of the streets and the tender mercies of local authorities.  Perhaps we can discuss this again: I would have great reservations about it.  There were stories in Britain of people flying into Heathrow Airport, declaring themselves homeless at the expense of Hillingdon Borough Council.  It was true.  There have been two such cases since 1977.  Two in six years &mdash; hardly a valid criticism, but the two of them did make the headlines.  I am reminded of the various interpretations put by the British newspapers on the way the Nielsen case highlighted the problem of the homeless in London.  Many of the more liberal papers identified the problem <Col N="450" /> with the lack of provision of proper accommodation for homeless people. The <i>Daily Express</i> identified the problem as being related to the fact that welfare rates for homeless people in London were too high.  They were attracting a huge flood of homeless people, and the solution was to reduce welfare rates and they would not turn up any more.  You can argue for ever but some people will never believe you.  In 1979 alone, by comparison, 57,200 people applied for housing under the British Homeless Persons Act. I do not take the intentionality argument too seriously, but I am prepared to listen to people with experience in this area on local authorities.  Perhaps the Irish are a bit different.  Perhaps we have an affection for fidding the State that other countries do not have.</P>
    <P>It has been said that this Bill will enable single people to jump the queue over our needy families.  This is an issue which will require much discussion.  It is regrettable that we act on the assumption that we will never be able to provide housing for our people.  In terms of where this country stood 50 or 60 years ago, our record in housing is exceptionally good.  It would be a pity, after the achievements we have actually had over 50 years with limited resources, and as a relatively poor country, if we were now to give in and admit defeat in the face of our housing problem.</P>
    <P>If you begin to shout too loudly that this Bill would enable some group to jump the queue, you are assuming that there will always be a queue, and there will always be a housing problem.  Do we have to accept that assumption?  Even if there is such an assumption, we could talk about it at length.  I do not like the approach or the philosophy.  It is false and faulty.  If there are waiting lists as they stand with families as the priority and the homeless the lowest priority &mdash; if they are homeless for any length of time, or if they are young by and large they will be single &mdash; then the homeless will never be housed.  Our largest local authority, Dublin Corporation, have been frank enough to admit in discussions with the Simon Community that they do not ever envisage themselves as being able to accommodate the residents of <Col N="451" /> hostels and night shelters who are, by and large, the single homeless.</P>
    <P>There are a few things I would like to say about that criticism.  First, housing has progressed beyond the stage of simply being about families on the waiting list in the conventional definition of a family.  It is not that simple any more, and the Department of Environment have said as much in the past year.  The present policies do not cater for significant neglected categories and minorities.  In Britain, for instance, only 75 per cent of public housing is with traditional family units and 25 per cent is about minorities based around single people.  There are suggestions that up to a quarter of the units of housing in Britain in a few years' time will be occupied by single person families.  We cannot ignore the social trend which is a product of urban and social change and we cannot have a housing policy which says we will cater for 75 per cent of our client group, and ignore the other 25 per cent.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I would argue that both groups &mdash; the family unit and other categories &mdash; must be catered for.  It is not an either/or situation.  It is both.  As it is, many local authorities do have special categories.  Some make special provision for single mothers, the disabled, the elderly and the in firm, so the principle of special categories is not unusual.  In one sense this Bill adds one more category to those special categories.  Therefore it is less revolutionary than it may look, and it is not my habit to preach that I am less revolutionary than I look.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, I would accept that the question of families and single people takes us into moral areas of judgment.  I am saying that both classes of applicant are needy and worthy of housing: the family group because they are in poor or overcrowded conditions, and because their children will be suffering with them; and the latter group because of their total destitution, their total lack of any accommodation. Both have good claims, and if we say it is families first and the homeless can wait for ever, then homelessness will always be with us, and the homeless are condemned to perpetual isolation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="452" /> I do not think anybody who supports this Bill will allow this spurious distinction between the homeless and other needy categories to deflect us too much. To produce conflicts between the poor of various categories is as old a policy as was ever conceived in politics.  If there is a need, it is our responsibility as a community to meet that need, not to redefine that need in order to exclude certain categories so as to provide for other categories. If there are serious needs in our society, it is our obligation to meet them, not to ignore them and pretend they do not exist.</P>
    <P>Homeless people are ordinary people with a severe accommodation problem. It is time we got away from the sterotype of the wino, the dirty unshaven alcoholic, the madman, because all that conceals an ordinary human being with needs, aspirations, hopes, feelings and capabilities. It needs to be repeated again and again that they are ordinary people with ordinary needs.  Questions are raised regularly about the capacity of homeless people to house themselves and to cater for themselves. In this regard I should like to quote just one very important example of the capacity of people who are traditionally regarded as homeless to cater for themselves.</P>
    <P>In 1978, Glasgow&mdash;a city of 3,000,000 people with appalling problems of housing, poverty and oppression: Glasgow is almost a synonym for problems of poverty, housing and alcoholism, and so on&mdash;began a programme for the housing of its single homeless population.  From November 1978 to November 1982, 110 women and 462 men were rehoused. Only 14 women and 20 men ever returned to the hostel circuit.  The success rate is, therefore, 94.1 per cent.  These were people taken from hostels and doss houses and similar places.  They had a success rate of 94.1 per cent.  Those people who had come from doss houses and hostels and places like that had a better record in maintaining their rent than the traditional population of such local authority accommodation.  They proved to be better tenants than the average local authority tenant.</P>
    <P>One of this programme's positive <Col N="453" /> results has been the closure of one of the oldest lodging houses in the city of Glasgow. It is the intention of the programme to clear the present number of single homeless, about 2,500 in Glasgow alone, and rehouse them in public housing over a finite period of years.  The evidence is that the vast majority of the single homeless in Glasgow will be more than capable of maintaining themselves in accommodation. Of course, there are social workers and other supports available to these people, and nobody would argue with the fact that they are needed.  It is recognised in the case of families of travelling people that various supports and assistance are needed.  The facts speak for themselves.</P>
    <P>What this Bill is about effectively, therefore, is the elimination of avoidable homelessness in this country.  It would mean that the single homeless who wish to opt from sleeping rough, or the poverty trap of hostel life, could do so, and opt for public housing.  To achieve this would be a social triumph for this country and its people.  It is a worthy goal, a challenge well within the abilities of our people.  We should not allow ourselves to be intimidated by images of hordes of homeless people descending on poor innocent housing officers with limitless demands.  It is a limited problem.  It is a serious problem.  It is a problem within our capabilities to solve.  It can be done and for the sake of the homeless it must be done.</P>
    <P>To pass this Bill is to write success on the social record of this nation.  The practical effect of the Bill on the ground will be nil in the case of those local authorities who already care well for the homeless. For those who do not, and either make them a low priority or ignore them altogether, it will mean changes, and changes for the better.  For the homeless themselves, this Bill will be signalling to an historically oppressed group that this House does care, and will do something practical and useful and valuable to recognise their worth as human beings.</P>
    <P>It is worth recording yet again that, at this stage, if one does not have an address one cannot qualify for social welfare and therefore one cannot qualify for many <Col N="454" /> other things as well.  There is a practice in the Department of social Welfare, and among some community welfare officers, that if people cannot give an address they are not eligible for social welfare benefit, supplementary welfare, and so on.  The Minister responsible explained it to me here in the House, and it is worth repeating. There is not a policy of refusing such benefits to people who have no address, but it is administratively necessary that they have an address so that the application can be dealt with.  Perhaps this could be referred to the Ombudsman.</P>
    <P>The converse is also true.  To say no, to equivocate, to delay, to say this is not the time, to vote this Bill down for reasons of principle or prejudice, out of pique or out of prejudice, is to take away from the homeless one small hope on their horizon.  It is to deny them their intrinsic worth as human beings.  It is to say, effectively, that their sufferings must go on.  It is to abandon the poor to their fate in the jungle of the market economy and of the streets.  It is to flout the words of the United Nations Charter which nobly states that &ldquo;everyone has a right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and family, including food, clothing and housing.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have spent ten years working for and with the homeless.  I have spent ten years fighting for and indeed, on occasions with the homeless.  I have spent ten years watching people declining and dying because there was nowhere for them to go.  I have seen people go blind from shingles because they lived in a night shelter which you could not get a doctor to visit with regularity.  I have seen people decline from reasonable health into the sort of position I have described of people who were 50 and looked like 70.  I have had ten years experience of confusion and procrastination and downright stupidity on the part of local authorities and health boards in their dealing with the homeless with a Victorian mentality, obscurantism, delays, reclassification and general ill-will and confusion.  I have had ten years of anger and frustration which eventually motivated me to do either of two things a person who is angry and <Col N="455" /> frustrated can do &mdash; either take up a gun or get into politics.  Otherwise the anger and the frustration would be too much entirely.</P>
    <P>The homeless have waited 450 years since Henry VIII first defined them as vagabonds to be locked up at the first possible opportunity, 450 years of isolation, of alienation, of illness and, indeed, in many cases of the one refuge they had from their problems, of alcohol.  No one can survive without a home.  No one is entitled to be defined by some arbitrary stroke of official policy as unhousable.  No one can suggest to me that marginal groups will get their share of the nation's resources or indeed the preferential share of the nation's resources without legislation in the form I have suggested.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a response to a need.  It is a response to the need that I have experienced over ten years.  It is a response to the need that the homeless have articulated to me and to every voluntary organisation dealing with the homeless in this country.  It is a Bill which I am sure has defects.  I am sure that in a very few minutes I will hear at length about those defects.  I will say this.  I and the people who work with me have done something that the Department of the Environment have failed to do in 60 years.  We have produced a Bill to liberate the homeless from their oppression. Let me hear about the defects, but we did it.  We did it without the resources of a Government Department, without the resources of the parliamentary draftsman, without the resources of the civil service.  That is the measure of the achievement.</P>
    <P>I want a response in positive terms to this Bill, not a catalogue of the limitations of this Bill which quite obviously are there.  I am prepared to listen to them, discuss them and consider them at length and in detail.  We produced this Bill and the statutory services with 60 years of experience in this area failed to do so. We have the experience.  We are neither fools nor idealists.  Nobody who is a foolish idealist would survive very long in a Simon Community night shelter.  It is no place for foolish idealists.  We are very <Col N="456" /> practical realists, dealing with a very practical problem on a very practical day to day basis.</P>
    <P>The homeless are simply no more and no less than equal partners in the family of the Irish people.  That is what this Bill says for them.  That is what this Bill hopes for them &mdash; that they will be treated as equal partners in the family of the Irish people.  As far as I am concerned, and as far as many people working with the homeless in this country are concerned, this Bill is their moment.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>At the outset I should like to compliment Senator Ryan very sincerely not just on the detailed research he and those who worked with him put into this Bill but also on the way in which he has pursued its implementation and its treatment here today.  It is quite clear from the manner in which Senator Brendan Ryan has been able to mobilise the practical experience and commitment of so many people not just in the Simon Community but also in voluntary housing associations, that he has brought to bear the resources of a very large number of people whose commitment and expertise are not to be doubted.</P>
      <P>We have studied this Bill in considerable detail and with great attention.  It is fair to say &mdash; and I say it politically &mdash; that the work Senator Ryan and his colleagues have done has enabled the Department of the Environment, whose resources are infinitely greater than those of the voluntary people to whom Senator Ryan has referred, to build extensively on the statistics and the research embodied in Senator Ryan's speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was not in the House when the Order of Business was agreed.  I had a meeting with my own party colleagues and in addition to detailed and long discussions with Labour Party Senators I had discussions with our friends, the Fine Gael Party with whom we share Government, and following the representations made it was agreed that the reasoned amendment would not be moved.  I am pleased that that decision was taken by the Senators <Col N="457" /> on the Government side.</P>
    <P>Influence, shall we say, was mobilised in the form of telegrams and telexes from a wide range of people.  I and the Labour Party and our colleagues in Fine Gael, and I believe many other people in the Seanad, agree with the principle and the objectives of this Bill.  The historical outline presented here today reflects a shame on all of us as legislators, and we should act quickly to remove it.  I intend to do so for as long as I have the responsibility in the Department.  My responsibility is tempered by two existing realities with which the practical people of the Simon Community frequently have to grapple.  One: do we have the resources to deal with the problem?  Two: is our solution effective and practicable?  One real difficulty in a society that refuses to pay tax in effect, and yet wants everything today, is the cost of providing any kind of service.</P>
    <P>Our local authority housing programme this year will cost £208 million. That is for the construction of new houses.  In addition to that, the subsidy which we provide for the differential rent sector will cost another £126 million.  We have 30,000 people on our local authority housing list, and we are building approximately 6,000 dwellings per year.  A major cost in the provision of such local authority houses is the cost of building land, a matter about which I have spoken before.  The cost of building land, depending upon its location and depending upon its zoning, can be extremely expensive.  I was particularly heartened, and indeed caused to be somewhat optimistic, when I got the telex addressed to me from the Justice Commission of the Conference of Major Religious Superiors in Ireland and I will quote the text:</P>
    <P>We strongly recommend you support the second reading of the Housing (Homeless Persons) Bill, 1982, in Seanad Éireann tomorrow, Wednesday.</P>
    <P>It was signed by Fr. Joseph Dargan, Chairman, Provincial, Jesuits, Sister Jordana Roche, General, Dominicans, Sister Lucy Troy, General, Presentation Sisters, Fr. John O'Donnell, Provincial, Redemptorists, Fr. William McGonigle, <Col N="458" /> Provincial, Oblates, Sister Nellie Curtin, Provincial, Little Sisters of the Assumption, Sister Pauline Lawlor, Provincial, Daughters of Charity, Sister Stanislaus Kennedy, Provincial, Irish Sisters of Charity, Fr. Michael Mornagh, Augustinian, Fr. Michael Kane, Holy Ghost Fathers.</P>
    <P>I have taken the opportunity to read their names into the record and more particularly the orders they represent, with the specific aspiration that the enormous land holdings they possess as religious orders will, somehow or other, not be given to the local authorities, but be made available to the local authorities at their existing use value, and not at the development value which would prevail because of speculative planning permissions many of them have obtained if they were to sell such lands on the open market. I am optimistic that, in view of their concern and the way in which Senator Ryan has so ably mobilised them, we will get the kind of response which is evident in this telex.</P>
    <P>However, history would temper my optimism.  When Councillor Dermot O'Rourke was vice-chairman of the Dublin Housing Committee of the Corporation in 1967, a letter to the religious orders from that committee did not meet with the same prompt attention this telex has manifested here today.  I think it is true to say &mdash; and I am subject to correction &mdash; that when the present Catholic Archbishop of the Dublin diocese was consecrated, one of the progressive initiatives that he took was to give Merrion Square back to Dublin City, for which the citizens will be eternally grateful. He also responded to the housing problem by setting up the Bethlehem Foundation, a voluntary housing association, an organisation which was able to tap the resources of a very committed person who had worked in shelter agencies in London, Mr. Bill Darman, with the idea of utilising in the Dublin area much of the land owned by the religious orders whose names are represented on this telex today.</P>
    <P>To my knowledge there is only one successful scheme that started nearly ten years ago from that progressive initiative, <Col N="459" /> the Bethlehem Foundation.  Significantly it was the bishop himself who donated the land.  I stand open to correction but, with the exception of one other religious group and one religious order in the north west part of Dublin city, no other land bank of any consequence, or indeed at all, has been made available.  I make that point at some length to demonstrate to people who have practical experience, as Senator Ryan has said, the constraints and the difficulties that exist in making a reality out of the principles and the objectives of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I am the first to admit that Senator Ryan, by bringing this Bill before the House, has served to concentrate our minds on an important social issue and to stimulate an overdue debate on the problem of homelessness.  I am grateful to him for that.  I have no argument with him about the existence of a problem of homelessness and I have the fullest sympathy with the motivation underlying his Bill.  I readily accept that there is a problem. I would like to emphasise at the outset, however, that the question at issue then is not whether a problem exists but how we can best set about tackling it.  This is where I find myself differing, to some extent, from him.</P>
    <P>I hope that I can satisfy him and other Senators that the passing of this Bill into law now would not solve the problem of homelessness but would rather create more problems than it would resolve by injecting confusion into our housing system, and in particular by artificially and arbitrarily dividing the housing problem in a way that would not reflect the relative patterns of need of the many families and individuals who are in urgent need of housing.  We have a duty to these people &mdash; and I as Minister have no option but to accept this &mdash; to ensure that the housing that can be provided from the resources available is allocated fairly on the basis of objective and defensible criteria.</P>
    <P>Coming into the Seanad today and being unable to accept on behalf of the Government such an obviously well intentioned and socially concerned <Col N="460" /> measure is not something that I relish.  I am conscious of the risk that the Government's stance could be falsely portrayed as being unsympathetic to or unconcerned about the plight of the homeless. I personally am profoundly concerned about this serious problem, but I want to be sure that whatever action is taken is well defined and likely to prove successful without imposing penalties and hardship on persons and families who otherwise deserve to be treated as a housing priority.</P>
    <P>Regrettably, having examined the Bill and its implications in depth, I have to say that in its present form it would not contribute to the achievement of the ideals to which the Senator and I &mdash; and indeed the Tánaiste and the Government as a whole &mdash; are fully committed.  It would, on the contrary, tend to frustrate those ideals by upsetting traditional and well-established policies of ensuring that local authority housing is allocated to those whose need is most acute, in accordance with recognised criteria.</P>
    <P>I myself have been clearly conscious for some considerable time of the extent and acute nature of the problem of homelessness, particularly in the Dublin area where I am most familiar with the human tragedy and personal hardship to which it gives rise.  I am familiar with the pamphlet entitled &ldquo;The Case for a Homeless Person's Act&rdquo; which has been published by the Simon Community &mdash; an organisation that, I know, is doing tremendous work on behalf of the homeless and that is eminently qualified to speak about the problems of homelessness.  Anyone with a social conscience could not fail to be impressed by this document.  The Society of St. Vincent de Paul, in their document &ldquo;Towards a National Social Policy&rdquo; have also called for action in this area.  Many other voluntary bodies and individuals concerned with the less privileged have likewise added their voices to the call for action.  Certainly, anyone who has nowhere to live is lacking one of the two most basic necessities of life &mdash; food and shelter &mdash; and merits priority consideration in terms of the social services provided by the State.  Some of those whom this Bill is designed to help have, by any <Col N="461" /> standards, an unacceptable existence and are condemned to a way of life which any civilised society should be striving to ameliorate.</P>
    <P>It is obvious, therefore, that there is a lot of common ground between Senator Ryan and myself.  The difference between us concerns methods, not objectives, and I personally cannot see any real grounds for confrontation.  It is a matter of much regret to me that certain developments on the Bill may have created a contrary impression.  I feel sure there is scope for reconciling our approaches in a mutually acceptable way since, as I have said, essentially we are striving to accomplish the same objective.</P>
    <P>My approach is one of framing a comprehensive and effective policy to alleviate the plight of homeless people and to underpin that policy by improved and appropriate statutory provisions.  For reasons that I shall go into in more detail later, the Bill before the House does not add up to what is required, in our view. It is so fundamentally different in its approach from the existing legislation on the provision and letting of housing by housing authorities that I am fully satisfied that both pieces of legislation could not exist comfortably side by side on the Statute Book without giving rise to severe practical and legal difficulties.  Legislation to help deal with the problem of homelessness &mdash; which is just a part, albeit a very important part, of the overall housing problem &mdash; will have to be compatible with housing legislation generally forming a properly integrated housing code; otherwise, the effective operation of our housing programme will, I believe, be disrupted.</P>
    <P>The development of better legislation in this area must be looked at from a number of viewpoints.  These include the existing other special needs for housing and the difficulties which have arisen in regard to the letting of houses following a recent Supreme Court decision in the Buncrana case which has the effect of precluding a housing authority from letting a house to a person resident or domiciled in the functional area of another authority.  Because of the particular urgency of overcoming the difficulties <Col N="462" /> arising from the Buncrana judgment, the Government intend as a first step to bring forward within the next few weeks a very short piece of amending legislation solely to get over these particular difficulties. Concurrently my Department are also engaged in an urgent examination of Part III of the Housing Act, 1966, with a view to bringing forward more satisfactory provisions.  I am confident that we will be able to complete this examination within a short period to enable a proper statutory framework for the administration of local authority housing &mdash; including meeting the needs of the homeless &mdash; to be formulated and brought forward for consideration by both Houses.</P>
    <P>In considering the best approach, we must start by looking at the existing statutory powers and responsibilities of the local housing authorities and the regional health boards.  Although most Senators will be generally familiar with the responsibilities of local authorities and health boards in relation to the provision of accommodation, in order to keep the debate in perspective, I think it would be helpful for me to spell these out briefly.</P>
    <P>Housing authorities have a statutory duty under the Housing Act, 1966 &mdash; which in itself is a major piece of legislation and incorporated all of the previous body of housing legislation enacted since independence in 1921 and previous to it &mdash; to survey the housing conditions in their functional areas at least once in every five years to ascertain the extent of unfit and overcrowded housing and to assess the adequacy of the supply and condition of the housing as well as the future demand for housing in their areas. They are then to prepare and adopt a building programme setting out the works which they propose to undertake having regard to the housing needs of their area.  The Act also empowers the authorities to provide dwellings and other related facilities or amenities.</P>
    <P>The authorities are further required to make a scheme of letting priorities which must be approved by the Minister for the Environment and in accordance with which their houses are to be let.  In making a scheme they must have regard to <Col N="463" /> certain statutory primary objectives, namely, the elimination of unfit housing and overcrowding and the provision of accommodation for persons in need of it who are unable to provide it from their own resources.  It is open to housing authorities either to obtain a report from a medical officer of health of the appropriate board in all cases, or only in cases where priority is claimed on medical grounds, but where such a report is obtained regard must be had to it.</P>
    <P>While housing authorities are required to adopt a scheme of letting priorities and to make lettings according to the scheme there is no obligation on them to have formal waiting lists of persons who have applied for housing, though in practice the majority of authorities operate some type of list.  These lists are reviewed periodically to include recently approved applicants and to take account of changed circumstances of those already listed.  At present there are about 30,000 approved applicants throughout the country waiting to be housed.</P>
    <P>There are, however, two special categories of persons to whom preference is given outside of the scheme of letting priorities.  These are the elderly and the disabled; neither would in the normal course have high priority <i>vis-à-vis</i> families, and they are enabled to be housed sooner than would otherwise be the case by the provision of special purpose-built houses.  Overall, about 10 per cent of the annual local authority housing output is comprised of units suitable for elderly or disabled persons.</P>
    <P>Schemes of letting priorities can provide for permanent or temporary housing on an emergency basis where, say, a household becomes homeless as a result of fire, flood, house collapse or eviction through no fault of their own.  Housing authorities may, from time to time, have a small reserve of untenanted houses which can be used in cases of emergency, but their capacity to respond in this way is necessarily limited.  This is because of the difficulty of maintaining a significant reserve of dwellings when the ordinary demand for housing is so strong, the financial constraints which limit the construction <Col N="464" /> programme, and the arrangements for priorities, which I have already outlined, under which these houses are let.  These arrangements are essential if we are to have a just and rational system of allocating houses and if the public at large are to have confidence in the policies and practices of local authorities in this highly sensitive area.  Because of the increasing pressure on those housing lists there are many sections of the public in different local authority areas who are rapidly losing confidence in the objectivity and fairness of their allocation system. As a consequence, any measure which in our view would tend to aggravate that loss of confidence would have a very counter-productive effect from everybody's point of view.</P>
    <P>Except in emergency situations, therefore, homeless persons who are not elderly or disabled, to be eligible for permanent local authority accommodation, must apply for housing, be accepted as being in need of accommodation, and qualify for housing on the basis of the order of priority laid down in the local authority's scheme or letting priorities.</P>
    <P>Essentially, the local authorities must focus their efforts primarily on families or individuals whose needs are for permanent housing rather than temporary accommodation and who are capable of holding independent tenancies.  I will return and stress what we mean by that and the implications of it for the housing stock in general and for a housing authority. In fairness, it should be acknowledged that local authorities have catered over the years for many families who have been rendered homeless for one reason or another.  In fact, it is fair to say that any family &mdash; by this I mean a parent or parents and one or more children &mdash; who find themselves genuinely homeless are normally given accommodation quickly by the housing authority.</P>
    <P>In this context, it is worth recording that Dublin Corporation &mdash; the largest housing authority in the State &mdash; in the first six months of this year housed 54 families, 97 one-parent families, 35 couples and 30 single persons, mostly senior citizens, all of whom were classified as homeless.  The corporation have <Col N="465" /> re-let to single people a number of small flats in various locations originally intended for the elderly but which subsequently became unsuitable for this purpose.</P>
    <P>Also from time to time the corporation have made lettings to psychiatric hospitals and other organisations for use as transitional accommodation between institutional and ordinary accommodation. In that regard, the political decision of Dublin Corporation's Housing Committee to respond in 1975-76 to such a request proved to be extremely emotive and difficult, and in my memory ranged over at least four separate meetings.  We finally had to request the chief psychiatrist, Dr. Ivor Browne, to explain to the more cautions, conservative, reactionary, frightened, or whatever adjective you want to use, members of that housing authority just what was intended by the health board and the kind of prospective tenants that would share those dwellings. This has proved to be an extremely difficult task for local housing authorities because of fears which are in many cases unnecessarily stirred up or provoked. The struggle is going on in relation to some hostel accommodation in this city at the present moment.</P>
    <P>In addition, the corporation are examining, in consultation with the voluntary organisations, how they can provide more housing for single persons.  The housing package one of the Tánaiste's predecessors launched in the Spring of 1981 does provide for a range of measures which, hopefully, would enable voluntary organisations to try and provide more housing for single persons.  I recognise that there are considerable difficulties in the implementation and the practical operation of that particular package.</P>
    <P>I should point out here that there is a vast difference between giving housing authorities general responsibility for the provision of housing for any category, be they homeless or others, and imposing &mdash; as this Bill will do &mdash; a statutory duty on housing authorities to house all persons in a particular category, thus conferring on them a superior right to housing. I know from political experience that the degree of abuse to which Senator <Col N="466" /> Ryan referred, and which he minimised, is not a degree that some people in Dublin city would agree with.  I am aware of one particular housing estate, known locally as &ldquo;Little Lourdes&rdquo; because the vast majority of people housed there were housed on the basis of medical priority, and all of them, it appeared to the people who were not housed, had the benefit of miraculous cures after they were housed.  In the eyes of the people who did not get housed there was a belief that that particular fast track of overall priority to local authority housing had been abused: I stress the word &ldquo;belief&rdquo; rather than any factual evidence that would underpin that.  That is something I know from my own practical knowledge of Dublin city and is another indication of how careful we must be in structuring any measures to deal with what is a very difficult problem.</P>
    <P>Now to turn to the role of the health boards.  Section 54 of the Health Act, 1953, imposes a qualified duty on health boards to provide institutional assistance for any person who is unable to provide shelter and maintenance for himself or his dependants.  In practice, there is quite an amount of variation in the type of accommodation provided directly or subvented by health boards.  Every health board has some provision for sheltering homeless people.  In those areas where boards do not make use of their own institutions they grant-aid voluntary and religious bodies who provide hostels or other facilities or, alternatively, they place and pay for homeless people in rented accommodation such as flats, houses, bed-and-breakfast, mobile homes and caravans.  Senator Ryan's speech clearly outlined the different ways local authorities and health boards respond in that way.</P>
    <P>Health boards regard their responsibility as extending only to providing temporary accommodation, that is shelter, for homeless people.  They are not responsible for providing permanent accommodation for individuals who are considered houseable.  This is the responsibility of local authorities.</P>
    <P>While the respective responsibilities of the health boards and the housing authorities <Col N="467" /> may, from what I have said, seem to be reasonably clearly defined, I would not attempt to deny that, in practice, there has been great confusion about the extent of responsibility in individual cases and that there have been differing interpretations of the provisions of the Health Act by local authorities and health boards.  The case for the present Bill is based, to a large extent, on this perceived ambiguity of responsibility for the provision of accommodation for homeless persons.  I support that Bill in so far as it highlights that case.  I would accept that there is a need for clear, sharp guidelines as to the division of responsibility between health boards and housing authorities and for a better understanding by these bodies of their respective roles.</P>
    <P>I would accept also that there are significant differences of approach to the problem of homelessness between the various local authorities.  It is acknowledged by the voluntary organisations that some authorities take a very sympathetic view of cases of homelessness brought to their attention and that they have succeeded in resolving many bad cases.  On the other hand, it is contended that other authorities take a less helpful view of similar type cases.  Again we got specific documented evidence of that in the speech from Senator Ryan here today.  In these circumstances, I also accept that there is a need for a greater consistency of approach as between local authorities in responding to cases of homelessness. This inconsistency may well be due to differing interpretations regarding the respective responsibilities of the health boards and the housing authorities, and if these roles were satisfactorily delineated I think it would also go a long way towards achieving the uniformity in the response of local authorities that is desired.  Of course, differing local housing circumstances may also be a contributing factor to the varying responses of local authorities.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year the Minister for Health set up an <i>ad hoc</i> committee, comprising representatives of that Department, the Department of Social Welfare, <Col N="468" /> my own Department, the health boards and the local authorities, to investigate and make recommendations on these questions.  In their examination of the issues involved this committee have had the benefit of submissions from the non-statutory agencies or bodies, including the Simon Community, who are most intimately concerned with the problem of homelessness.  Considering that the committee are representative of all the statutory bodies involved in dealing with the problem and who have first hand practical experience of trying to administer it as distinct from operating it on behalf of clients, I am confident that they will be in a position to take a fairly fundamental look at these important aspects of the homelessness problem and that they will come up with recommendations that will be clearcut, practical and, hopefully, effectual.  I am hopeful that the committee's recommendations will be available in a matter of weeks.  We should then be in a position to issue clear guidelines to health boards and housing authorities about the division of responsibilities and to set about framing an effective policy for the homeless.  It seems likely, too, that the committee's recommendations could have a worthwhile bearing on the direction of the legislative measures that may be needed.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, the Simon Community, in a letter of 28 February to the <i>ad hoc</i> committee, are on record as saying that if the question of the division of responsibility between the health boards and the housing authorities can be resolved without recourse to legislation, that would be entirely acceptable to them.</P>
    <P>At this stage it is necessary that I should take the Bill before the House and spell out what we believe are the shortcomings and some of the reasons why it could not be acceptable in its present form.  We considered in great detail whether it could be possible to make the Bill acceptable by amendment of its provisions. The conclusion had to be that such a course would not be feasible.  It would have been necessary to alter fundamentally the nature of the measure by a series of major changes.  Even if it was possible to devise coherent amendments, <Col N="469" /> the end result would have been a piece of legislation which, to put it crudely, would be a patched up job.  I believe the correct course to be the one I have already outlined &mdash; that the Government should bring forward their own proposals framed after reasoned and mature consideration of all the possibilities and implications.  In giving that commitment to the House it is quite clear that the urgency that will underpin the work of the Government and the legislation we will draft, will undoubtedly owe its authorship to the pioneering work Senator Brendan Ryan and his colleagues have undertaken.  Therefore I would see the legislation, which will be enacted during this session by both Houses, as being linked with the Bill that is before the House now and the measures which we will bring forward as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan has attached some importance to three aspects of the Bill &mdash; its definition of a homeless person, the responsibility of local authorities and their duty to house homeless persons.  I shall now deal in some detail with these particular facets of the Bill.  The term &ldquo;the homeless&rdquo; has different meanings for different people.  For instance, there is quite clearly a vast difference between the type of person referred to in the Simon Community's document and the scope of the definition of &ldquo;homelessness&rdquo; contained in the Bill now before the House.  The Simon document really deals with what is perhaps the most acute form of homelessness &mdash; men, women or even children on their own who have ceased to associate with family or relatives, who have no accommodation and who sleep rough or in hostels, night shelters or who are forced to reside in institutions.  Some of them would have medical or psychological problems.</P>
    <P>It is not clear to many of the social workers involved if those problems are as a result of being homeless or whether those problems prevent them from being properly housed.  Some are on the margins of society or have opted out of society altogether.  The extent of the deprivation and misery which some of these people may suffer is extreme and it has <Col N="470" /> been clearly put on the record of this House today.</P>
    <P>But the definition of homelessness in the Bill is much broader.  As I read it, many families who are on local authority waiting lists would come within the terms of this Bill if enacted in its present form. For example, a family that is &ldquo;vulnerable&rdquo; as a result of living in unfit accommodation or in unhealthy or overcrowded conditions could well be covered.  Similarly, many travelling families, families who are involuntarily sharing accommodation, men who are barred from their houses by the courts, would appear to come within the scope of this Bill.  Even more of a problem, however, in putting this Bill into practice would be the concept of &ldquo;threatened homelessness&rdquo; as defined in the Bill.  Under section 4 (2) a person or family would, in effect, have to be treated as homeless if it is likely that within 28 days he will become homeless and in need of accommodation. This could well include a family where the breadwinner becomes unemployed and cannot meet mortgage repayments.</P>

      <P>In reading the fine print of legislation as drafted, the worst possible outcome has to be theoretically considered. Senator Ryan's record as a legislator, in which he has paid great attention to such detail in other measures, would indicate that he shares very clearly that concern for legislative excellence which, no doubt, since he applies it to other measures in this House, he would like to apply to his own.  For that reason, we have to look at the extreme possibilities &mdash; and I accept in some cases they are extreme possibilities &mdash; that could happen. They are capable of being amended and provided for, but in terms of legislation one must have, and should have, regard for them.  The fact that the definition of &ldquo;homelessness&rdquo; in the Bill is so wide would mean that many of the cases which would come within the scope of the Bill are already being catered for, in accordance with the priorities laid down, among the 8,000 or so lettings made each year by housing authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="471" /> The Bill therefore would impose a statutory duty on housing authorities to provide permanent accommodation for very broadly and loosely defined categories of persons.  As I have indicated, many of those who are already on local authority waiting lists would certainly come within the categories covered by this Bill.  The imposition of a specific duty on these authorities to house all those who would come within the scope of the Bill would put local authorities in an impossible position.  It would, for example, disrupt the long established practice of allocating houses on the basis of relative need and having regard to the primary objectives laid down in section 60 of the Housing Act, 1966.  In effect, it would create two different routes to rehousing &mdash; one through the existing scheme of letting priorities and the other through being homeless or threatened with homelessness.  Because of the duty being imposed, the Bill would, <i>de facto</i>, give preference to persons whose needs might not by any means be the most acute.  Clearly, there would be an incentive for ordinary applicants to have themselves classified as homeless, or so threatened, in order to gain priority.</P>
    <P>Regrettably I and many Senators in this House &mdash; I can temporarily include myself as a Senator having been here on two occasions although I was not very anxious to stay, which is no disrespect to Senators &mdash; are also members of local authorities and as such deal with people who are attempting to be housed by the local authority.  We know very well the limits and the stratagems to which many people will go to get what they desperately need, and which the public representative will encourage and try and help them to get, that is, a house.  The kind of abuse, or potential abuse, that Senator Ryan suggests may not happen, and which probably would not happen in relation to some of the clients who are catered for by the existing voluntary agents who deal with the conventional homeless people, if you want to put it that way, would, in my considered view as a working politician at local level, undoubtedly happen unless the loopholes <Col N="472" /> as perceived by us in this legislation are closed.  I invite Senators who contribute to this legislation and who have local authority experience and experience working as constituency representatives to comment on how some of these provisions might operate if applied to the general category of people looking for housing, not to the conventional people who are classified as homeless and not to the 3,000 estimated by Simon as being the extent of the number of people requiring to be housed, excluding people known as the travellers.</P>
    <P>To enact this legislation in its present form would be bordering on irresponsible because it would impose a duty on local authorities that could not be discharged within the resources likely to be available to them.  To do so would bring the law into disrepute, probably lead to expensive litigation seeking to secure the performance by local authorities of the duty imposed on them, and be most unfair to families who have been deservedly placed on approved waiting lists.</P>
    <P>I am aware that it is frequently claimed by those working with the homeless that many of their psychological and social problems stem from their lack of roots in society which a home gives them.  I would not dispute that many can successfully make the transition from a state of being homeless to settling in permanent accommodation, if they are adequately prepared and given minimal support.  However, there are certainly some among the homeless &mdash; perhaps some of the most pathetic cases &mdash; whose problems cannot be solved by the provision of permanent housing.  Some of these people do not want to settle in permanent accommodation; others would not be able to cope with an independent tenancy; many need special medical or other care and support. In summary, housing may not be their primary need, and for these this Bill would do little to solve the real underlying problems.</P>
    <P>I would also be worried that, once a duty to house the homeless is imposed on local authorities it would be very difficult to prevent abuses such as intentional homelessness.  The Bill, as currently drafted, makes no attempt to deal with <Col N="473" /> abuses of this nature, but once such an all-embracing duty is imposed it would be difficult, if not impossible, effectively to circumscribe it in such a way as to prevent abuses and preserve confidence in the fairness of the housing allocations.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, many travelling people would come within the meaning of homeless in this Bill and I think it would not be out of place here to refer to the problems of the travelling people in the context of this Bill.  As Senators will be aware, the Review Body on Travelling People, who presented their report last May, dealt at length with the need to provide permanent accommodation for travellers who desire to settle.  The review body were critical of the record of some housing authorities in this area but did not consider that a fundamental recasting of housing legislation was necessary.  Furthermore, the review body came down against the idea of imposing a statutory responsibility for the provision of accommodation on a central authority.</P>
    <P>Having considered this report, the Government decided to establish a Government Review Body, of which I am Chairperson, to ensure that the recommendations in the report are given urgent consideration by the relevant Departments and public authorities and to identify and implement those recommendations which are feasible in the current financial situation.  This Government Review Body are now in the process of developing further proposals for submission to the Government.  I do not envisage a recommendation that the travelling people &mdash; deserving as they are &mdash; be given a statutory right to housing which would give them a priority over other equally deprived members of the community.</P>
    <P>For as long as we have a growing population &mdash; especially when allied to high unemployment &mdash; the allocation of local authority dwellings is inevitably going to be a matter of determining priorities in accordance with relative need.  In this context the imposition of a statutory duty on local authorities in respect of one loosely defined category of persons, the acuteness of whose need for housing may vary widely from case to case, would <Col N="474" /> clearly be invidious and would, understandably, be widely resented.</P>
    <P>Because it is utterly impossible to predict how many persons or families would be admitted under the terms of this Bill as currently drafted, it would not be possible to attempt to estimate the cost of its implementation &mdash; either in terms of the capital cost of providing housing or of the consequent recurring expenditure by way of subsidy, administration and maintenance.  The Simon Community have given a figure of perhaps 3,000 homeless people in Ireland but many more than this would come within the scope of this Bill.  Elderly persons' dwellings are currently costing about £20,000 each to construct so to provide 3,000 units of permanent residential accommodation, one is talking about £60 million which, in terms of total provision of £208 million for public housing this year, is a formidable sum.  Furthermore, the Bill would have other financial implications for housing authorities arising from the need for extra personnel, legal expenses and the cost of providing temporary accommodation.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan has implied that the Bill corresponds to the UK.  Housing (Homeless Persons) Act, 1977 which, incidentally, does not apply in Northern Ireland. I must make it clear that there are fundamental differences between the British Act and the Bill before the House.  It is true that the 1977 Act imposes a duty on housing authorities to provide accommodation for the homeless but it applies to a much less extensive category of persons and in our view did not in practice have anything like the kind of implications for public housing there that this Bill would have here.  In fact during the Commons debate and in the relevant Department of the Environment circular, it was made clear that there could be no overall increase in public expenditure as a result of the Act.</P>
    <P>The duty to house people imposed by the British Act extends only to those who have a priority need for accommodation because of very special reasons such as dependent children, pregnancies, emergency or old age, disability, mental illness and so on.  Generally speaking, present <Col N="475" /> practice in this country secures priority treatment for those covered by the British Act and the application of that Act here would make no appreciable difference and little at all to the single homeless. On the other hand, any concept of priority is entirely missing from the Bill before the House &mdash; the duty to house homeless people is unqualified in its application &mdash; single homeless people, homeless couples without children would have a right superior to families and so on who though not homeless could have a more acute need for rehousing because of overcrowding, unfitness, dangerous or unhealthy existing accommodation.</P>
    <P>Again, the British Act contains provisions to safeguard against intentional homelessness, a feature missing from the Bill.  Where individual provisions correspond to those in the British Act, it needs to be remembered that their practical operation is very much different given the restricted duty imposed on local authorities in Britain compared with the much widespread duty the Bill would place on our local authorities.</P>
    <P>I trust that I have demonstrated my concern and that of the Government to ensure that early steps are taken to improve the lot of the homeless.  However, in the light of its many shortcomings I do not see that this Bill in its present form would provide a solution to the problems.  Indeed, in many respects the Bill would give rise to other difficulties not least its undermining of established priorities in the provision and letting of local authority housing in accordance with the concept of the greatest need.  I suggest to the House, therefore, that the prudent course is to await the Government's proposals on which we are working as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would emphasise the danger of looking at this problem in an oversimplified and unduly emotive way.  I am fully aware that what many people who are concerned about this Bill have in mind is the real and acute need to raise the lot of people who are among the most deprived in our community.</P>
    <P>The Bill, in its present form, will undoubtedly serve the basis for legislation <Col N="476" /> which I am committed to bringing into this House.  What I would suggest to the Senators is that some of the problems we have within the Department, together with a most sympathetic analysis and examination of this Independent Senator's Bill and some of the problems we think will arise, could be discussed by the Senators here based on their legislative and local representative experience.</P>
    <P>The Bill has 13 sections.  Looking through it, I find that because of the way in which we interpret the sections six are either not acceptable or would have a counter-effect to the one that the objective of the Bill would propose, while five are acceptable and two would require amendment, but amendment that would not to any great degree change their substance.</P>
    <P>In fairness to Senator Ryan, who has put a lot of work into this Bill, and in fairness to the people who have worked with him both within the Simon Community and in the other voluntary housing associations, it would be constructive and indeed proper for me to give some indication as to the difficulties and reasons for our finding certain sections unacceptable in their present form.  As we indicated at the outset, the objective of the legislation and the principle of the Bill are substantially shared by all of us and are certainly shared by me personally.</P>
    <P>Section 3 is the one which requires the housing authority to provide accommodation. It reads:</P>
    <P>Subject to the provision of this Act, it shall be the duty of a housing authority to provide accommodation of reasonable standard and suitable type for persons in need of such accommodation who are homeless or threatened with homelessness, either through emergency or because of their social conditions and whose means are inadequate to provide such accommodation for themselves.</P>
    <P>As we see it, this section imposes a statutory duty, enforceable in law, on housing authorities to provide accommodation of reasonable standard and suitable type for homeless persons or persons <Col N="477" /> threatened with homelessness as defined in section 4 of the Bill.  I will come to that later.</P>
    <P>If this was enacted in the present way &mdash; and these are some of the criticisms we have of the section as it is currently drafted &mdash; the health boards would have no function under the Bill in relation to accommodation of homeless persons or persons threatened with homelessness.  It appears that this obligation, which exists even in respect of persons who may not in the opinion of the housing authority be capable of holding an independent tenancy because of personal inadequacy, does nor require an authority to house such persons.  We may get into a situation where someone, because of his socio-medical condition, is unacceptable to the other tenants in a local authority area, who in fact has been made homeless in the first instance as a result of the request of tenants in the area because of the way in which the person has carried on, through no fault of his own.  I can cite specific examples.  There was the case of a single woman in her mid-thirties and living on her own, who simply was not well and who on four seperate occasions burned the furniture that had been provided for her by different agencies and did not burn the coal that had been provided for her.  She simply disrupted the entire flat complex she lived in.  Consistently she left the water running in her flat.  She lived on the second floor in a block of flats in Ringsend.  The water seeped through the concrete floor in a flat of a neighbour.  That small, very closely knit community tried in every way to encourage her to live in a normal way. The local authority could not rehouse her anywhere else because outside that Ringsend area she would not have effectively survived as an individual and no other area in Ringsend would accept her.  There were these kinds of pressures.  These are some of the implications which, from my point of view, could as a consequence of the definition arise from section 3 in its present form.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Accommodation of reasonable standard and suitable type,&rdquo; which is a quote from section 3, is elaborated on by section 12 (2) which deals further with the <Col N="478" /> nature of the accommodation to be provided by the housing authority.  The imposition of a statutory duty on local authorities without making available the necessary financial and staffing resources to discharge the duty, would bring the law and local authorities into disrepute. In the prevailing state of public finances &mdash; while I share Senator Ryan's commitment to doing what is manifestly right &mdash; to quote his own description of the Simon Community as being one which is rooted in practicality, we as legislators must have regard to the state of public finances and realise that there is no prospect of the Exchequer or local authorities being in a position to provide the resources required to give effect to the provisions of the Bill.  Senators will recall the debate we had on the local government charges legislation which came through the House in the summer.</P>
    <P>The imposition of a duty on housing authorities to give accommodation to one particular category of persons constitutes a major departure from all previous housing legislation with the exception of that for the disabled and the elderly.  Regarding the long-established practice of letting houses to those in greatest need, relative needs being determined in accordance with fixed or with certain accepted criteria, under existing legislation housing authorities are obliged to assess housing needs, to draw up building programmes and to make a scheme of letting priorities for the letting of houses provided.  In making schemes of letting priorities they are obliged to have regard to certain primary objectives.  These are the elimination of unfitness and overcrowding in the provision of housing for persons in need of housing and who cannot afford to house themselves.  As I said earlier, it appears that that particular section could be interpreted as being totally in conflict with the main part of section 60 of the Housing Act, 1966.  We would, therefore, have the situation where this Bill would be saying one thing and other legislation would be saying another.  All of us as legislators would accept that to have that kind of legislation on the Statute Book is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>In the definition of homelessness which <Col N="479" /> is the key obviously to this legislation, we have to try to define it in such a way legally that it does not have an overspill effect which I know is not the intention of the promoters of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill is quite an elaborate one and reads:</P>
    <P>(1)  For the purposes of this Act, a person shall be regarded as homeless and in need of accommodation when the housing authority is satisfied that&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  he or any person who might be reasonably expected to reside with him; (i) has no accommodation and is vulnerable as a result of old age, mental illness, handicap or physical disability, pregnancy or other special reason and/or (ii) has no fixed abode and/or (iii) is usually resident in common lodging houses, refuges, night shelters or hostels and/or (iv) solely because of having no alternative accommodation is forced to continue to reside in a general or psychiatric hospital, a county home or other such institution; or</P>
    <P>(b)  he has accommodation but he cannot secure entry to it or it is probable that occupation of it will lead to violence from some other person residing in it; or</P>
    <P>(c)  his accommodation consists of a movable structure, vehicle or vessel designed or adapted for human habitation and there is no place where he is entitled or permitted both to place it and to reside in it.</P>
    <P>(2)  For the purposes of this Act, a person is threatened with homelessness if it is likely that within 28 days he will become homeless and in need of accommodation as defined in subsection (1) of this section.</P>
    <P>The potential implications of that &mdash; again not for the category of 3,000 people to which the Simon Community's report refers, but to other people who would be counted among the 30,000 on the housing list &mdash; for the housing authority and for its integration within the context of the body of housing legislation, which in <Col N="480" /> essence is the 1966 Act and some of the subsequent provisions of the 1979 housing miscellaneous legislation, is a necessity to interconnect and tidy up both of the provisions there and the objectives that are being sought in this section.</P>
    <P>The terms &ldquo;homeless&rdquo; and &ldquo;threatened with homelessness&rdquo; are defined in this section.  I have read them out but perhaps I could summarise them in nonlegal terms.  They are, a person who has no accommodation and who is vulnerable. &ldquo;Vulnerable&rdquo; is potentially a very emotive and variable-valued word.  What would be interpreted by the courts as &ldquo;vulnerable&rdquo; could range very widely up and down from a scale of one to 50, certainly on a scale of one to ten.  One would get the kind of anomalies of treatment from one court to another or from one local housing authority to another that would be unacceptable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister will accept that to say that somebody has no accommodation is quite unequivocal.  It is &lsquo;no accommodation&rsquo; and &lsquo;vulnerable&rsquo; that the section refers to, not just vulnerable alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that if you link the two of them together it could be interpreted in that way but our feeling is that in some cases, given the court structure, that might not be the case.  Section 4 provides that a person may be considered homeless if he has accommodation but cannot secure entry to it or if it is probable that occupation will lead to violence from some other person residing in it. This provision is intended to cover the case of battered wives and separated persons, marital breakdown and so on, where it may not be possible or reasonable to expect a person to share accommodation with another.  However, it would appear to give a housing right to persons against whom barring orders have been obtained through the courts. On the other hand, it might also discourage a person, say a married woman, from seeking a barring or protection order knowing that she will have to be rehoused if she leaves the home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that general area of the definition of <Col N="481" /> homelessness I am very concerned about the concept of &ldquo;threatened homelessness&rdquo; because whatever about fixing up somebody who has clearly no accommodation, the idea of agreeing on what is threatened homelessness can vary quite substantially.  The British Act, for example, has had a very broad definition of homelessness.</P>
    <P>Any person who has no accommodation or who is unable to occupy any accommodation he may own or who has a caravan and so on but has no place to park it.  However, under the British Act the duty imposed on local authorities extends only to those who have priority need for accommodation.  This is the core of a lot of the practical reservations I have, as someone who has been a member of a housing committee and a local housing authority.  By all means let us clearly define in legal terms the body responsible for housing the homeless.</P>
    <P>The Bill that will become law and which will have a lot to do with this legislation will do a great service if it does that alone.  But having done that it is only right and proper that we have got to try to practically incorporate and integrate the homeless person into the system of priority that applies to everybody else.  It was a theme of Senator Ryan's speech that he wanted homeless people to have the right to be treated the same as every other citizen.  Paradoxically, in this instance, the enactment of your Bill under this section would reverse the kind of prejudice they suffered since the time of Henry VIII.  In fact, it would give them a fast track to housing above and beyond the needs of existing applicants and would not have them treated as every other citizen is treated.</P>
    <P>In relation to the 3,000 people, there may be a very pressing argument for some degree of affirmative action in that area.  That is for another day's argument but the effect of this section of the Bill would have that outcome.  Senator Ryan quoted the justification for enacting this legislation on the basis that it will not open a floodgate of demand for housing because the British experience did not have that effect.  But the British legislation had written into it this integration <Col N="482" /> with the general body of housing legislation, the concept of priority need.  We can legislate for the homeless and legislate for its definition and not create an anomalous situation in law that would produce the reverse of the desire to have them treated equally with every other citizen for the first time.</P>
    <P>Sections 3, 4, and 5 really contain the meat of this Bill.  I should like very briefly to refer to the inquiries to be made by local authorities.  As we read it, the implication, among other things, would be that the local authority would be obliged, during the course of their inquiries to determine if the applicant for accommodation is homeless or not or even threatened with homelessness to provide temporary accommodation. They are also obliged to investigate the needs of all homeless persons and to regard them as homeless, irrespective of whether they have made application, and thus entitle them to be housed.  The administrative implications of trying to do that with many people who, by virtue of their homelessness, have many other problems which have come as a result of their being homeless, are enormous.  We would need to limit the degree to which we are imposing duties on local housing authorities.  I can recall quite clearly the debate which took place in the summer of this year in relation to local government charges.  Indeed, I can recall in particular the eloquent prophecies of the Leas-Chathaoirleach in relation to the outbursts of rage that would come from local authorities with regard to giving them more tasks and obligations in a situation of limited resources.  I can just imagine your rhetorical eloquence on the subsection in this Bill if the honest burgesses of Clare County Council were required to implement in this way some of the provisions.</P>

      <P>It is that kind of administrative eloquence I have frequently admired about the people of Clare.  There are, however, those difficulties.  Section <Col N="483" /> 6 has similar problems but they are capable of being resolved.</P>
      <P>I want to conclude the Second Stage contribution on behalf of the Government by repeating what I said at the outset, that is, that there is a very clear need to legislate.  It is quite obvious now that the urgency of the introduction of legislation has been made a reality by the action that has been taken by Senator Ryan &mdash; to whom I pay public tribute in this regard &mdash; and by the voluntary associations and housing organisations that have provided him with the research and details that were set out in his speech.  So far as I am concerned, we will move as fast as possible, and it is up to this House to ensure that the speed at which we move is maintained, to introduce legislation that will do the things which I and many people in this House want: to clearly define who is responsible for the homeless, to clearly define what constitutes being homeless, and also clearly define, if we can, the border line between being homeless and being made homeless or being threatened with homelessness. There is a very real problem in relation to people who are being made homeless through no fault of their own under the existing rents legislation.  We have now the body of work which has been done by the housing associations and which has been put so eloquently on the record of this House today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have said all I need to say in relation to this legislation.  I repeat formally that the commitment is there and that it will be acted upon.  I wish to repeat publicly and I hope to the wider public by way of the media, that I have been somewhat overjoyed by the degree of response from the religious orders, in the way in which they have responded so enthusiastically to the extraordinary degrees of mobilisation that Senator Ryan has evidenced here today.  The local authorities can, as a result of the telex, formally write to the various religious orders whose names are registered in the text of the Seanad Official Debate and inquire from them what kind of land could be made available at existing use prices.  There is no question of expropriation or donations being <Col N="484" /> required or demanded.</P>
    <P>Their commitment to deal with this problem is very welcome.  Their enormous land resources are an intrinsic component of any solution and it is becoming increasingly a critical component in view of the scarce resources that this Administration have been left to run the country with.  No doubt Senators, from their unique knowledge of their own local authorities, will be able to identify other religious orders who were not mobilised in time by Senator Ryan but who would equally share the enthusiasm of the ones associated with this telex and who may reside in the more isolated parts of Ireland.  Homelessness is not uniquely an urban problem so perhaps those other orders could contribute in these difficult times in making resources available at a reasonable price based on existing use and not the prospective speculative value that otherwise might be put on land.</P>
    <P>For those reasons and others which I have already outlined I compliment the Senator for moving this legislation and for affording the House the opportunity of debating it.</P>

      <P>I am sure that Senators are, by now, quite well aware of the general provisions of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any adjustment in the remuneration of parliamentarians inevitably gives rise <Col N="485" /> to a great deal of critical comment, much of which, as we have seen over the past week, can be confused and misleading.</P>
    <P>The simple fact is that Senators, Dáil Deputies, parliamentary office holders and members of the Judiciary have not received any increase in their remuneration for almost two and a half years &mdash; since June 1981.  This position has arisen notwithstanding that the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector in their report of 30 October 1979 clearly indicated that the levels of remuneration which they recommended, and which the Government at the time accepted, should in the future attract all standard national agreements or other general round increases.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the 1981 Public Service Pay Agreement, as amended, which provided for three phased increases of 2 per cent, 6 per cent and 5 per cent have been applied to all the groups dealt with by the review body with the exception only of parliamentarians and the Judiciary.</P>
    <P>Since 1 September last, the first phase of the 1983 public service pay agreement has also been payable in the public service involving a further increase of 4.75 per cent.</P>
    <P>It is, I believe, unfair and undesirable that parliamentarians or the Judiciary should, for no good reason, be excluded from the benefit of national or Public Service pay agreements which apply to all other categories of public servants. Failure to implement their provisions can only give rise to greater problems in the future when steps have to be taken to correct the neglect of past years.  The Bill, therefore, provides that the increases under the 1981 Public Service pay agreement &mdash; 2 per cent, 6 per cent and 5 per cent &mdash; and the first phase of the 1983 public service pay agreement, 4.75 per cent, will be applied as from 1 September 1983, but without retrospection, to parliamentarians and to the annual sums payable to leaders of certain parties in Dáil Éireann.  The full provisions as from the due dates, that is with retrospection, will be implemented in respect of the Judiciary.  The Bill also provides that in <Col N="486" /> the future general pay rounds applied to the Civil Service will also automatically apply to Oireachtas Members and to the Judiciary with effect from the appropriate dates.  In this way the recommendation of the review body will, in the future, be adhered to.</P>
    <P>I do not think that there is any good reason for depriving the Judiciary of the retrospective elements of these increases and for thus treating them less favourably than the rest of the public service. Accordingly, the Bill provides that the increases under the 1981 Public Service Pay Agreement and the first phase of the 1983 agreement will be applied in their case with retrospection to the due dates, that is, 2 per cent from 1 December 1981, 6 per cent from 1 March 1982, 5 per cent from 1 October 1982, together with 4.75 per cent from 1 September 1983.</P>
    <P>In the case of the parliamentarians, however, the Government have decided that the 1981 agreement increases will apply from 1 September 1983 and without retrospection.  As a result of this, TDs who served since the 1981 agreement came into effect will be at a permanent loss of £2,320 approximately which is the amount by which their remuneration fell short during the period up to 31 August 1983 and Senators will be at a corresponding loss of £1,450.  A Senator currently in receipt of £7,619 per annum since June 1981 &mdash; if retrospection had been allowed &mdash; would have moved on 1 December 1981 to £7,828, on 1 March 1982 to £8,298 and on 1 January 1983 to £8,713 &mdash; this last phase to have actually been paid in January of this year, rather than October 1982, in accordance with the amendments to the 1981 agreement.</P>
    <P>In the light of the prevailing economic climate I believe that Members of the Seanad will appreciate the reasons which compelled the Government to decide against payment of retrospection for parliamentarians.</P>
    <P>These increases merely apply to parliamentarians, without the benefit of retrospection, a number of public service pay agreement phases which have applied from the due dates to public servants generally.  Adjustments of this order have also been granted in the private sector. <Col N="487" /> The 19 per cent increase so widely commented on in recent days is no more than the aggregate of these phases which have been enjoyed for up to two years by all other groups but which have been withheld until now from parliamentarians.</P>
    <P>The opportunity is being taken in the legislation to amend the manner in which the terms of general round increases &mdash; such as those under the public service pay agreements &mdash; are applied to Members of the Oireachtas and the Judiciary in the future.  Up to now a cumbersome procedure has resulted in a situation where many months could &mdash; and often did &mdash; elapse between the decision to implement a pay round and its actual payment.  Firstly, there is required a Government decision, followed by the making of a Statutory Order which, in turn, must be laid before the Dáil for 21 sitting days before taking effect.  Should a recess intervene, or if the decision to initiate the procedure takes place during a recess, the process is even longer.  It will be obvious, therefore, that without delay on the part of Government, a considerable time may elapse before an ordinary phase, payable to all others, is actually paid to the Members of the Legislature.</P>
    <P>In the past this process has resulted in a situation where a single increase has been reported or commented upon on a number of different occasions, giving the impression that there had, in fact, been a series of increases actually paid during the period.  In the future, therefore, and commencing with the enacting of this legislation and the current public service pay agreement, increases applying generally to the Civil Service will be applied automatically to Members of the Oireachtas, to the annual sums payable to certain party leaders, and to the Judiciary, with effect from the due date in each case.</P>
    <P>In relation to any other changes in parliamentary remuneration, arising, for example, as a result of a review body inquiry, provision is being made so that, in future, an order having immediate effect could be made either increasing or decreasing such remuneration and such <Col N="488" /> an order would be capable of being annulled by resolution of the Dáil within 21 sitting days but without prejudice to anything already done thereunder.</P>
    <P>In the case of the Judiciary, orders increasing remuneration will simply be presented to both Houses but would not, for constitutional reasons, be capable of annulment.</P>
    <P>When a Seanad general election is called, as the House is probably aware, Senators continue to be paid their allowance until the day before polling day. Accordingly, a Senator who is re-elected continues to receive payment of the allowance without a break.  A Dáil Deputy, however, ceases to qualify for allowance as from the date of dissolution of the Dáil &mdash; recent dissolutions have lasted for approximately three weeks &mdash; and qualification for resumption of payment does not occur until, and unless, the Deputy is re-elected to the subsequent Dáil.  This has caused a serious loss of income to Deputies in recent years because of the holding of three general elections in a relatively short period of time.</P>
    <P>The Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector commented on this matter at paragraph 12.18 of the October 1979 report and said they felt that consideration should be given to the question of continuing payment of TDs' allowances up to the date before polling day for the new Dáil.  The Government have decided that a sum equivalent to one-eighteenth of annual allowance shall be payable to a Deputy on dissolution of a Dáil.  Arrangements will also be made to include the period of dissolution as reckonable for pension purposes.</P>
    <P>Certain other changes, basically of a minor nature, are being brought into effect under the Bill.  These include provision to allow changes to be made to the Members' pension scheme by ministerial amending scheme, provision that the posts of Cathaoirleach and Leas-Chathaoirleach of the Seanad be made pensionable, provision for amending the conditions for regarding the post of Attorney-General as pensionable and provision for removal of an anomaly in the pension terms of certain former Parliamentary <Col N="489" /> Secretaries, which unintentionally resulted from the pension provisions for Ministers of State in the Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) and Ministerial, Parliamentary and Judicial Offices (Amendment) Act, 1977.  I will be happy to explain these changes more fully on Committee Stage, where necessary.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to introduce, by way of amending scheme under the new procedure, an optional situation whereby a defeated or retiring Member of the Oireachtas who has served the requisite eight qualifying years may decide to draw pension on the basis of one-fortieth for each year of service as at present, or, alternatively, to choose a lump sum, calculated actuarially, together with reduced pension payments based on three-one hundred and sixtieths for each year of service.</P>
    <P>I also intend modifying the pension scheme to allow those with short service, who are not qualified for pension, to have their own pension contributions refunded to them as happens in most other pension schemes.  This matter was referred to by the review body at paragraph 12.13 of their 1979 Report.</P>
    <P>The review body, in dealing with superannuation matters, stated at paragraph 12.20 that they were taking the 6 per cent contribution payable by Members into account in considering the appropriate level of allowance and went on to say that if changes were to be made in relation to the refund of contributions where Members fail to qualify for pensions, severance grants for Deputies and the continuance of TDs' allowances beyond the date of dissolution of a Dail, these would have to be part of an overall package and improvements in benefits on these lines would require modifications elsewhere in existing arrangements.</P>
    <P>As already stated, two of these matters are being dealt with, and it is my intention that these changes, and Members' conditions generally, will be considered by the review body when next a general review similar to that reported on in 1979 takes place.  In relation to the question of severance grants the Government have <Col N="490" /> decided against the introduction of such payments.</P>
    <P>While they do not form part of the specific provisions of this Bill, nevertheless I think I should tell the House that it is also the intention of the Government, in conjunction with the passing of the Bill, to update Members' travelling, overnight and day allowances.  These rates have not been increased since January 1980 and have clearly fallen out of line.  For the future, Members who qualify will be paid the same mileage rates as are, for the time being, allowed to civil servants.</P>
    <P>The present overnight allowance of £17.50 for those Members who are obliged to stay in Dublin while the Houses are in session is to be revised to £27.50.  This applies where the Member resides more than 20 miles from the GPO and stays overnight in Dublin.  The day allowance, payable to those Members who reside within ten miles of the House, is increasing from £10 to £16.  Mileage allowance is not, may I remind the House, payable to these Members.</P>
    <P>It should be pointed out that this was the level of increase which was deemed to be appropriate nearly a year ago.  It is intended that, in the future, these figures will be adjusted by reference to Civil Service mileage and subsistence rates.</P>
    <P>While on the subject of expenses, I would like to refer to what I consider to have been less than responsible coverage of this aspect in certain sections of the media.  These have suggested that payments for expenses in some way constitute additional remuneration.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The rates payable to Members of the Oireachtas are designed to recoup out-of-pocket expenses.  It would surely be unreasonable to suggest that Members could carry out their duties as public representatives, such as travelling to Dublin for meetings of the Oireachtas, without incurring out-of-pocket expenses on travelling and accommodation.  The overnight allowance payable is far from generous when compared to similar rates paid to many others, in both the public and private sectors, whose duties involve them in <Col N="491" /> being away from home for protracted periods.</P>
    <P>All that the main provisions of the Bill set out to do is to restore Members and the Judiciary to the level which the review body recommended they should be at, and maintained at, through application of wage agreements.  This is being done by granting the terms of the 1981 Public Service pay agreement and the first phase of the 1983 agreement.  In the case of parliamentarians the adjustment will take effect only from September last. This restores Members' remuneration to the level recommended by the review body but without retrospection.  In the case of Seanad membership this results in a permanent loss of some £1,450 in retrospection <i>vis-à-vis</i> comparable Public Service income earners.</P>
    <P>As I stated in Dáil Éireann there is an obligation upon those of us entrusted with the operation of a democracy to ensure that the democratic system is able to work.  If we should see fit to shirk from providing for what we know is a fair, just and reasonable payment to any Member doing his or her job, and to single out parliamentarians alone as the group who should not be allowed increases applicable to the rest of society, and whose application to parliamentarians has been recommended by an independent review body, then we are doing both Parliament and democracy itself a disservice.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must commend the Minister on having come to the House with a Bill which is, to a number of people, the first one which is unpopular. It is extremely unpopular amongst the members of the public.  There has been much comment on it, a lot of which has not been fully researched or thought out. Perhaps this is the first time that an unpopular public Bill has been recommended to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall not go into what has been said in the other House or into what has been said in the media.  But I will say that it is a very necessary Bill.  I would suggest it was more necessary for the Members of this House than for those of the other <Col N="492" /> House.  There have been comments about the operations of this House or indeed the necessity for this House.  We are a House of the Oireachtas.  We play a very important part in the organisation of legislation.  I would not hesitate to say that the level of debate on all aspects of legislation in this House has been equal to, if not better than, that in the other House.  To many people we might seem to be irrelevant and it might appear as if we should be abolished.  But I do not feel that this should be a House into which people are propelled, in their wheelchairs with a remedial teacher on one side, a blood bag on the other, being wheeled in to convalesce having been either defeated in the Dáil or not been selected for election to that House.</P>
    <P>This House is very relevant.  I was extremely upset by the remark of a trade unionist whom I would consider to be as well paid as any Member of this House, whether he be fulltime or part time, when he said the Seanad should be abolished, that we had dipped our hands into the public till to the tune of 19 per cent, plus expenses, that it was frightening.  And, as the final insult, this trade union official said that the political convalescent home known as the Senate should be closed down, that the majority of its occupants are people who got the thumbs down from the electorate.  He expressed amazement that the figure of £9,000 per annum could be paid as disappointment money.  This was said by the General Secretary of the National Busworkers' Union at a conference in Ballina, County Mayo, last week.  I presume that that trade union official was paid expenses to go to Ballina, County Mayo.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Ballina would be a beautiful place to go to and I would suggest that the said trade unionist had an enjoyable weekend there at the expense of the National Busworkers' Union.  There is absolutely no doubt that he claimed his expenses.  I suggest that his salary as General Secretary of the National Busworkers' Union is at least double that being <Col N="493" /> paid to Members of this House.</P>
      <P>I shall not advance any major case for the increase in the allowances to Senators but I can say that we are, in the main, part-time politicians.  I make no bones about the fact that as part-time politicians every day that we come to this House costs us money.  It has cost anybody who is in business an enormous amount of money.  That is not only because we are unable, in our own businesses, to do the job as we were doing it before becoming Members but equally we have lost the confidence of our bankers, of the people who had been supporting us financially. Anybody who has gone on the Seanad trail will know how much it costs.  Anybody who would maintain that £9,000 per annum &mdash; which is the new rate &mdash; would in any way compensate us is living in cloud-cuckoo land.  I make no bones about the fact that we are part-time politicians. I do not think we are over-paid as part-time politicians.  One might ask what is a part-time politician?  A part-time politician &mdash; looking around on this side of the House, and I see people on the far side of the House also &mdash; is somebody who neglects his business, who goes to meetings seven nights a week, somebody who never sees his home and who has financial problems created because of his part-time obligation to the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The adjustment being made is extremely necessary.  I am not going to say that there are not people around the country who would have a justifiable case in maintaining that we should not get it because their position is worse.  I do not think that should be the argument.  The case was made again that, unless we receive reasonable remuneration, the Houses of the Oireachtas will become a rich man's club.  I am afraid the time has come &mdash; because of the cost involved &mdash; that it will be a rich man's club, or it will be a club for people who are retired or, for those people supported by outside interests.  The day that this House becomes one supported by outside interests &mdash; in the same way as has happened in the United States and in other countries &mdash; will be the day democracy ceases to function here.  There is the situation <Col N="494" /> obtaining in a lot of democracies at present in which parliamentarians are not paid sufficient to do the job they are supposed to do.  What has happened in these democracies?  Special-interest money is being poured behind these politicians. And unless such politicians take the line of such special interests they will not be re-elected to the United States Congress or Senate.  At present in the United Kingdom their Members of Parliament are allowed to take extra money from special interest groups as long as they declare that special interest.  Therefore, if an oil company approaches an MP in the United Kingdom and says: we will pay you an extra £5,000 a year as long as you support us in legislation, that is all right as long as he declares that interest.  I would not like to see the day that we, in this Legislature, would have to depend on outside monies to remain here.  A step has been taken in the direction of ensuring that we operate as an independent Oireachtas, independent in the sense that we will be enabled to remain in office, without outside support.</P>
    <P>I shall not delay the House any longer. I was somewhat disappointed the debate did not commence until 8 o'clock.  I presume it will continue until such time as each Stage is passed irrespective of the time and that anybody who has anything to say on any Stage will be so allowed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all I should say categorically that the Fine Gael Members of the House believe very strongly that the increase proposed is justified, and well justified.  I have a number of points to make which I should like to read into the record of the House, not in the expectation that they will be reported to the public, because they may be too accurate to be reported, but in the hope that some future generation looking at it may at least realise the contrast between the hysterical outburst in the media and the reality of life in the year 1983.  Many of the points I have to make will come back to the irresponsible and undemocratic nature of the response which these increases provoked among those people I would normally expect to call my friends in the media.  However I am strengthened <Col N="495" /> in my desire to criticise them by the fact that their friendship for me never in any way inhibited them from criticising me should the occasion arise.</P>
      <P>The hysteria which greeted the increase in the parliamentary allowances of 19 per cent, or a fraction under 19 per cent, ignored a number of essential facts. I propose to go through those facts briefly so as to place them on the record of the House.  It was suggested in newspaper article after newspaper article and in comment programmes on the electronic media that, in some way, this increase was a massive one which more than compensated Members of the Oireachtas for the increase which had taken place in inflation since June 1981.  Irrespective of who has been in power since June 1981, inflation had increased here between May 1981 and August 1983 &mdash; which are two dates nearest to the dates in question &mdash; by a sum equal to 36 per cent.  It should be clear to everybody in this House that even the granting of these increases will leave the Members of Parliament contributing substantially to the problems of the country, just as have other people in secure employment over the same period.  However other people have been compensated for these things by regrading and other similarly based increases. Such a prospect or option is not available to politicians.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point with which I want to deal is that the tax-free amount has given rise to a considerable amount of adverse comment.  Of course it is right that it should give rise to adverse comment.  But the adverse comment to which it should give rise is from the parliamentarians and not from the general public.  The tax-free amount, which is included &mdash; and which is decided by the Revenue Commissioners as being the appropriate amount to be deducted from the allowances of Deputies and Senators before they are taxed &mdash; is based on their calculations of what are the additional unrecouped expenses of Members of the Oireachtas over and above their recoupable allowances. It was the calculation of a responsible officer in the Revenue Commissioners that half a parliamentary <Col N="496" /> allowance in the case of a TD, which before this Bill stood at £13,802 approximately, constituted expenses incurred by him or her arising directly out of his employment necessarily incurred in the performance of that employment and, as such, were capable of being allowed just as they would be allowed if they arose in any other similar situation.</P>
    <P>The suggestion is that these expenses were, in some way, arrived at a long time ago.  If they were, the expenses of a TD or Senator have more than kept pace with the increase in the basic parliamentary allowance.  To put the matter in its proper perspective let me say that if the parliamentary allowance in respect of a TD &mdash; I will deal with Senators later &mdash; remained at £13,802, if only 25 per cent of that allowance was deemed to be genuine expense incurred under the heading of &ldquo;non-recoupable expenses&rdquo; their true level of parliamentary allowance, prior to this current increase, would be £11,000.  That is £11,000 on which they were fully taxed.  That is incapable of being challenged.</P>

      <P>Getting away from that tax free amount, I did an exercise at the start of the year which was of considerable interest.  Each Member of the Seanad received the State Directory for <Col N="497" /> 1983 which was published by the Department of Public Service for which the Minister is responsible which gave by name in many cases and, if not by name by category, the people employed in the public service sector.  I went through that book and I sought to identify the people who, at the top of their salary scales, had in excess of the amount of money which a Deputy was then receiving.  The total number of people in the public service, not including semi-State bodies, not including local authorities, on 1 January who had salaries which at the top of their scales would have exceeded the allowance of a TD &mdash; not of a Senator but a TD &mdash; was 4,213.  In addition, a minimum of 22,000 teachers employed directly or indirectly by the Department of Education, that is not the total employment, that is my calculation, were on salary scales which, because of the various allowances they were getting, were in excess of the salaries paid to TDs.  It is well that this House should understand, and it is well that those who criticise Members of this House and Members of the other House should understand the relative remuneration which Members of this House are receiving.  They should also remember that half of that remuneration is to recoup them for expenses which they incur which cannot be recouped from other sources.</P>
      <P>I have a list here with which I will not bore the House &mdash; but I will be pleased to supply it to any Member of this House &mdash; of each section of the Civil Service. For example, in the Office of the Revenue Commissioners 497 such people were on salary scales which were in excess of a TD's salary.  I was afraid to count the number of people who were on salary scales in excess of a Senator's salary.  I would not insult the House by making that comparison.</P>

I read <i>The Cork Examiner</i> because I was lucky to be born in a city as beautiful as that.  The way in which that paper reported the increases was nothing short of scandalous, a scandal to the truth and an abuse of the freedom which they have under the Irish Constitution.  I will defend their freedom to do it, but it is an abuse of their freedom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I took the trouble to examine what kind of increases <i>The Cork Examiner</i> themselves had got in the appropriate period of time.  I found out that as and from 1 June 1981 the price of <i>The Cork Examiner</i> increased from 17 pence to 18 pence.  In September 1983 it was 35 pence, representing an increase of over 90 per cent.  I know what they will say: it was VAT.  It was not because, exclusive of the VAT element in both cases, the amount of money which the proprietors of <i>The Cork Examiner</i> were taking from their readers increased by 76 per cent in this period of time.  These are the people who have the cheek to talk about parliamentarians increasing their allowances by 19 per cent.

    <P>Similarly, the bleating of <i>The Irish Times</i> had to be seen to be believed.  I will take a lot more notice of their leading articles of 2 November and 3 November when the gentleman who writes it puts up at the top of the leading article his present salary and what his salary was in June 1981.  It is reasonable to ask why are the newspapers adopting this approach?  This is a very serious point for this House. They are adopting it because they are naturally a cynical breed of people anyway. I suppose that is their job, to be cynical and to be critical.  Some of them, not particularly in the written medium, are doing it because they have a Marxist analysis of society and they want to overthrow the kind of society we have at present.  The capitalist element are doing it because they are in the middle of a campaign of unremitting pressure on politicians from all parties to have VAT removed from newspapers.  That is the kernel of their argument.  If VAT was removed from newspapers there would not be the same degree of criticism as there is at present, and that is the reason. They are a pressure group like any other pressure group and should be treated in <Col N="500" /> the same way &mdash; the merits of their argument weighed but the amount of their pressure discarded.</P>
    <P>Other Senators, Senator Lanigan in particular, mentioned two points I wanted to bring out myself in conclusion. First of all, it is important that the quality of public representation should be maintained, and it is important that this should not become a rich man's club.  In the Seanad, to a greater extent even than in the Dáil, we are searching for an identity. There are Senators in this House who, because of their professions have effectively become full-time parliamentarians even though I accept that it was probably not intended that Senators should so become.  There are certain jobs, such as teaching for example, in which it is almost impracticable to give your full attention to the demands of the job, plus the demands of membership of a local authority, and to retain your full-time position.  There are others of us who are more fortunate.  As Senator Lanigan said, we can just do part of the work we would otherwise be doing and at least preserve some of our outside incomes in this regard.</P>
    <P>This is particularly relevant to what I said about the newspapers.  If public representatives do not take sufficiently high allowances they will become subject, to an even greater extent and for different reasons, to the influences of pressure groups.  It would be a sorry state for this country if our public representatives could not afford to call an election if an election were necessary, or could not afford to make an unpopular decision for fear that it might cause an election.  There should be adequate payment for Members of the Oireachtas and for the Dáil in particular in this regard.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned the important and difficult financial position of some people in this House.  If we do not maintain the purchsing power, to the same extent as it can be maintained throughout the community, not to a greater extent or not to a lesser extent, but to whatever extent we can maintain it for the general body of people, public representatives may become subject to sinister influences.  I should not like public <Col N="501" /> representatives of any political party to become subject to such influences.</P>
    <P>For those reasons it is not a question of giving me pleasure because by the time I have paid my taxes there will not be much pleasure in it left for me, it gives me considerable satisfaction in performing a public duty &mdash; I really think it is in the performance of public duty &mdash; to support the Second Stage of this Bill, which is an important cornerstone of our democracy.</P>

      <P>This Bill places Members of this House, and indeed Members of the other House, in a unique position in discussing and then voting on our own allowances and our own terms and conditions. That is one of the reasons why we do not get &mdash; and can hardly expect to get in Ireland today &mdash; too sympathetic a press.  However, I am impressed with the eloquence and vigour with which the provisions in this Bill in relation to allowances for Deputies and Senators have been championed and defenced by my two colleagues.  I note that the attendance for this Bill is treble the attendance earlier this afternoon when we were discussing the homeless.  I hope at a later stage we will hear equal eloquence and venom in arguing the case of the homeless.</P>

      <P>I am in some difficulty in the sense that my colleague, Senator <Col N="502" /> Ferris, did suggest that I might wait until the Minister comes in.  I think the Minister is familiar with at least the background to this issue, and he may arrive while I am referring to it.  It concerns the fact that the pension scheme for Members of the Oireachtas contains an overt discrimination which was the subject of a Labour Court determination in May of 1979, in a case which I myself brought as a Member of this House at the time. The discrimination relates to the omission from the pension scheme of any provision for widowers or children of married female Members of the Houses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very serious omission.  The section which would require to be amended is being amended in this Bill.  In other words, this Bill actually deals with part of the section which would require to be amended in order to remove that discrimination.  I feel very strongly on my own behalf, and on behalf of the other female Members of the Oireachtas, and on behalf of the example we set as Members of the Oireachtas.  We still continue an acknowledged and identified discrimination on the basis of sex in the pension scheme for Members of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>Following the Labour Court determination which was handed down on 7 May 1979, I had correspondence with the then Minister for the Public Service about the steps that would be taken to remove that discrimination.  When I failed in the initial attempts through private representations and correspondence with the then Minister and Minister of State, I sought to raise the matter on the Adjournment in this House.  I have a letter dated 6 February 1980 from the then Cathaoirleach saying:</P>
      <P>Dear Senator</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have given consideration to your request to raise on the Adjournment today the matter of the amendment of the Members' contributory pension scheme to provide equality of treatment for male and female Members in the provision of benefits to dependants <Col N="503" /> following the Labour Court determination of 7th May 1979.</P>
    <P>I regret that I shall have to rule that this matter is not suitable for discussion on the Adjournment on the ground that it would involve amending legislation.</P>
    <P>For reasons that are standard provisions of ruling that a matter is not suitable for the Adjournment because it requires amending legislation, my motion on the Adjournment was ruled out in February of 1980.  Once more I pursued the matter with the Minister of State and Minister for the Public Service at the time.  I have a letter dated 15 May 1980 from the then Minister of State, Deputy Seán Calleary. It is appropriate to put this on the record of the House.  His letter was as follows:</P>
    <P>Dear Mary,</P>
    <P>Further to our conversation re Widows' Benefits in the Oireachtas Pensions Scheme yesterday you should now have received a letter from Mr. Gene Fitzgerald T.D. Minister for the Public Service letting you know the up-to-date position.</P>
    <P>If there is any other information you need please contact me.</P>
    <P>Yours sincerely, Seán Calleary, T.D.</P>
    <P>Right enough, I got a letter dated 16 May 1980 from the then Minister for Labour and the Public Service, Gene Fitzgerald, T.D.  That letter was as follows:</P>
    <P>Dear Senator,</P>
    <P>I refer to your claim under the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act 1974 that the Houses of the Oireachtas (Members) Pensions Scheme contravened the Act in that it did not provide pensions for the spouses and children of female members while it did provide such benefits in respect of male members, which was the subject of a Labour Court determination on 7 May 1979.</P>
    <P>You will appreciate that the developments in regard to benefits for widowers of Oireachtas Members could not be considered solely in their own context; it was obvious that a decision to provide this benefit for the group <Col N="504" /> concerned could have repercussions in other areas of the public service.  In the circumstances, the implications for the public service as a whole had to be assessed with care.  As is well known, superannuation arrangements comprise a very complex area of personnel management and, inevitably, some time was needed for thorough examination.</P>
    <P>The Government have now decided to make provision for the spouses and children of female Members of the Oireachtas.  My Department is in touch with the Parliamentary Draftsman's Office on the question of amending Section 6A(a)(i) of the Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) Act 1938 and the Oireachtas Scheme itself.  Any necessary consequential action will be taken at the earliest suitable opportunity. Meanwhile, any actual case which might arise can be dealt with administratively.</P>
    <P>Yours sincerely, Gene Fitzgerald.</P>
    <P>That was a letter dated 16 May 1980 assuring me that the Government had decided to make provision for the spouses and children of female Members of the Oireachtas, and that the Department of the Public Service had been in touch with the Parliamentary Draftsman's Office to amend a section that we are proposing to amend in this Bill, in other words a matter which comes fully within the jurisdiction and terms of reference of this Bill.  I fail to understand why, in the range of measures being covered by the Bill, that particular identified discrimination is not being removed.</P>
    <P>To give Senators the precise background to the Oireachtas pensions scheme and the very simple amendment which would remove the discrimination I refer to the fact that section 4 of this Bill provides for an amendment of section 6A of the Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) Act, 1938, an amendment to section 6A which also governs the discriminatory pensions scheme for female Members of both Houses.  That section 6A was in fact inserted into the 1938 Act by two subsequent Acts.  The first of these <Col N="505" /> was the Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) and Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices (Amendment) Act, 1960.  Section 5 of that Act inserted a section 6A, relating to a pensions scheme and deductions for contributory pensions scheme for Members.</P>
    <P>It was a later Act, the Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) (Amendment) Act of 1968, which dealt with the provision for widows and children of Members. That Act extended section 6A by subsection (6) and provided that the section would provide &ldquo;in relation to deceased persons who were Members of the Oireachtas for pensions for their widows and children&rdquo;.  This is the section which grounds the present scheme.  The present scheme is the Scheme for Contributory Pensions for Members of the Oireachtas.  It is a scheme which was adopted under that legislative provision in 1974, but it is still the scheme that operates, and it defines the term &ldquo;widow&rdquo;.  The term &ldquo;widow&rdquo; means the widow of a member or a former member. It provides for the pension for a widow and also a contribution for any children of the widow under the scheme.</P>
    <P>What is omitted from that scheme, and what is still not provided for, and what apparently was not thought to be worth including in this measure, is any provision for the widowers of female Members or the children of female Members.  It is worth drawing the attention of Members of this House to the fact that in November 1983, if I were to die, or if Senator McGuinness were to die, or if Senator Bulbulia were to die, there is no provision for our widowers and there is no provision for our children, from the pensions scheme to which we contribute an equal amount with male Members of the House.  We contribute an identical amount into the pensions scheme.  It is not a matter of speculation as to whether it is contrary to law and contrary to the anti-discrimination pay Act.  It is a matter of fact.  It has been found to be since May of 1979.</P>
    <P>It appears that in 1980 the then Minister for the Public Service was in almost daily contact with the Parliamentary draftsman with a view to bringing in an <Col N="506" /> amendment.  At this stage, having waited a very considerable time to see the law change, I am prepared to sit a bit late tonight and draft an amendment and propose that it be adopted by this House on Committee Stage.  The amendment is a very simple one.  The amendment could be inserted into section 4 and would simply read: &ldquo;...may provide in relation to deceased persons who were Members of the Oireachtas for pensions for their widows or widowers and children&rdquo;.  By adding in &ldquo;or widowers&rdquo; one provides for the potential widowers of those of us who are female Members.  The word &ldquo;children&rdquo; would be linked in whether it was widows and children or widowers and children.</P>
    <P>It is extremely important that we use the opportunity in legislation already amending the section that I am talking about, to add two words &ldquo;or widowers&rdquo; and remove, as I say, an identified and real discrimination which has already been the subject of a determination by the Labour Court in 1979.  Clearly legislation is called for because that has been repeated in declining to have the matter raised on the Adjournment and in the letter from the Minister for the Public Service.  We can only remove it by legislation. We are amending the section that is relevant to the provision.  Therefore it is within the framework of the legislation. That would enable the pensions scheme itself to be revised once the legislation is completed, and budgetary provision could be made for the necessary change in the pensions scheme and the discrimination would be removed.</P>
    <P>A Leas-Chathaoirleach, I did not include you earlier when I was talking about the female Members, but obviously you too have a very real interest in this measure.  As a female Member of this House you have a particular interest and I hope will support the proposal to introduce a Committee Stage amendment to remove this discrimination which, as I say, has been allowed to continue for a very long time, which is totally without justification, and which substantially affects the provision of existing Members of this House and indeed of Ministers and Ministers of State who are also discriminated against in a similar way <Col N="507" /> in relation to their ministerial pensions. Their widowers and children could not benefit from their ministerial pensions. Therefore it is extremely important that we take the time to improve this measure as it goes through this House.</P>

      <P>I do not want to take one iota from the contribution of Senator Robinson, because she has made a very valid and excellent point.  I am anxious to hear the Minister's reply to it.  It is appropriate that we should put on the record of this House what we feel about this matter.  This is the only forum available to us to praise the courage the Minister has shown in response to various demands made on him from the members of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. This problem has been before us for the past year-and-a-half.  I congratulate the Minister on having the courage to bring in the Bill when he brought it in. He brought it in because he felt it necessary. He also had the courage to defend it on the media in the correct terms, and reminded his inquisitive inquisitors that he is giving no more to us than they had already received themselves at the appropriate time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was rather resentful of some of the comments from my colleagues in the trade union movement.  I call them colleagues because I am a member of a trade union.  Some of them actually advocated redundancy when they talked about the abolition of the Seanad.  That is effectively what would happen to me.  I can only speak for myself.  I know many other Members of this House are full-time public representatives, dependent totally and solely on a Senator's salary.  They act as local representatives and members of county councils in an unpaid capacity.  I hope the Minister will not forget members of county councils who give all of their time to representing their people with no compensation.  They have been misrepresented by the media as being on the make.  Some people in the other <Col N="508" /> House adopted a holier than thou attitude. If they feel they are not entitled to this increase they do not have to accept it.  They can hand it back to the Minister for the Public Service who, I am sure, will receive it and put it into a special fund so that when they become dependent on it that they can use it.  That applies to certain politicians who have adopted that attitude for short-term political gain. If they allow themselves to be ridiculed for making that kind of contribution the public will show their wrath at the appropriate time.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that this legislation does away with the absolutely ludicrous situation that ministerial orders had to be placed before the Houses of the Oireachtas and remain there for 21 sitting days. The day the order was made the media reported that you got an increase and the day it was passed they reported that you had got it again.  People thought we got it twice whereas we never got it.  Nobody thanked me for forfeiting the last three wage agreements, which the trade unions negotiated for my colleagues in the public service and argued that it was not big enough.  I was told by people in the public service, admittedly not the Civil Service, that this was not the appropriate time for this increase.  For them it was quite appropriate &mdash; they had already received it &mdash; but we should not have got it because the public are unhappy about it.  One day during the by-election campaign many people spoke about it.  On the second day, out of 700 people, two mentioned it, one was a docker, and he was taking home three times more money than some Deputies, so we did not enter into further discussion on the subject.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister because it takes courage to bring in legislation that is unpopular in the public's mind but which in equity is absolutely necessary.  We all talk about equity, but we should be prepared to stand up in the House to defend something we feel is justified.  The Leas-Chathaoirleach was present at the meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges when we debated this matter for a long time.  Nobody wanted more than was rightfully theirs and we all had <Col N="509" /> reservations about the lack of retrospection. Apparently it is unconstitutional not to give the Judiciary their increase, but when it comes to the legislators they can be disregarded.  In deference to what the Minister decided, I am prepared to accept that.  Because of this legislation, that anomaly will never occur again.  I think that is correct.  Anybody who cannot justify this increase should not be in public life.  If you cannot speak for yourself, you are not in a position to speak for anybody else.  I have no reservations about these increases.</P>
    <P>I depend full time on my Seanad salary. I have a wife and six children to feed, and if any of my trade union colleagues feel I am overpaid, I am prepared to let them renegotiate my terms so long as they look at my salary as they looked at their own salaries, wages, perks, travelling expenses, cars, and so on.  We heard much about Ministers of State having to forfeit their cars.  The day this legislation was introduced not one word was said about the Ministers of State who are expected to be at the disposal of everybody throughout the country 17 hours a day.</P>

We should treat our legislators, Ministers and Ministers of State with the respect they deserve, and the sooner we stand up and speak for ourselves the sooner people will realise we are serious about what we are doing.  This country could be led into anarchy if we allowed ourselves to be spoken down to by other sections of the community. Members should be independent of pressure groups, bribes or corruption.  We should be paid an appropriate allowance to allow us to legislate without being influenced by anybody.  Anybody who is holier than anybody else can hand back the increase.  I am sure the Minister for Finance, Deputy Dukes, will accept any <Col N="510" /> contributions he gets from Members who feel the increases are not justified.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other speakers who have complimented the Minister on bringing in this legislation which could be described by people outside the House as controversial.  In my experience there never has been an appropriate time to bring in legislation granting parliamentary allowance increases.  Nevertheless, this House has not retained parity, if that is an appropriate word, over the years.  20 years ago when I first was elected the Seanad enjoyed about 75 per cent of the Dáil salary and that has been eroded over the years.</P>
      <P>What the Minister has tried to achieve in this Bill is a step in the right direction. It is rather difficult to understand lots of the criticism, even at organisation meetings of one's own party, being levelled at these increases.  In my constituency we have some 80-odd branches and I am expected to try to fit in visits to most of them.  Yet people seem to think I should not be paid travelling expenses.  That was all right years ago when petrol was cheap, but nowadays one has to travel 40 or 50 miles to a meeting and people do not understand, or perhaps they do not want to understand, that parliamentary allowances or travelling expenses are paid only when Members leave home and travel to this House.  Members are not reimbursed for constituency work, nor do they particularly want to be.</P>
      <P>I was surprised to read the comments of a few trade union leaders who seemed to support the principle of a wage standstill for Members of the Oireachtas.  That is a dangerous wicket to be on, especially in times of inflation.  The Government can justly claim that they have come some way in reducing the rate of inflation this year, almost to single figures, and they are to be complimented on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wholeheartedly support Senator Robinson's plea for equality of all Members of this House <i>vis-à-vis</i> pensions.  I would like briefly to ask the Minister the underlying reason in section 5 for not following the precedent set in 1972 when changes were made to accommodate <Col N="511" /> office holders in the other House.  I should like to compliment the Minister on tackling this problem.  It will enable the Members of both Houses to set about their duties on behalf of the public and equip them better to do their work, and in these times it is very difficult to do that.</P>
    <P>People complain about the workload and the numbers of Members.  The Constitution decided, and the people decided when the State was founded, that we would be a bi-cameral constitutional democracy.  That system has served the country and successive generations exceptionally well.  There is no other system in the world I would prefer to the democratic system here.  There are various amendments to the Constitution that one might think desirable, but the Constitution and the freedom our people enjoy are not to be found in many other countries.  Therefore we should cherish, build on and conserve what we have.  I do not think there is anything to be gained by setting our Oireachtas allowances at such a low level that only people who are financially sound, and perhaps have considerable private means, can afford to play a role in guiding the destiny of this State.  For that reason I believe the Minister has made a significant contribution to the continuation of our system of democratic representation and I compliment him on that.</P>

      <P>I refrained from commenting on the Bill until Senator Ferris had made his contribution.  In my opinion he made very relavant points for which he must be commended.  One has to commend the Minister, Deputy Boland, for the manner in which he is handling this particularly difficult problem, difficult from the point of view that it infringes upon the wishes of the people <i>versus</i> those in the public media.  I want to take as an example the alleged round figure of 19 per cent increase described this morning on RTE programme which goes out on Radio 1 from 7.30 a.m. until approximately 10 o' clock.  The presenter opened the programme with a laugh at <Col N="512" /> the situation where we, the Members of the Oireachtas, had the right to give ourselves what we wanted.</P>

      <P>It is a national tragedy when the cynicism of such an individual is tolerated in the national broadcasting organisation.  We have a right to defend ourselves against such people.  Recently when a community festival was taking place in a major town in County Mayo he was brought down as MC for the evening and the figure charged was in the region of £1,000.  I say that openly and freely here, because we must defend ourselves. I am sure that matter will not be discussed tomorrow morning on RTE 1 between 7.30 a.m. and 10 a.m. because he knows and I know that is the truth.  I am not talking about the supermarkets that are opened in the afternoon because it would not suit these people if they were opened in the morning.  A politician's phone will ring at 8.30 a.m. or at 12.30 at night, and if he is not there he is considered a bad politician.  When I heard Senator Ferris speak I felt it was only fair that not alone should the press section of the national media be dealt with, but the broadcasting medium should be dealt with also.  Although I did not hear the programme between 10 a.m. and 11 a.m. I believe, without knowing the facts, that if it did not happen this morning it happened some morning last week.  I was not here all last week, but I am sure comments were made on that programme as well.  We know the fees that can be charged for opening supermarkets by that person who is so critical of politicians.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know how difficult this situation is for the Minister and the parliamentarians &mdash;that is what we are, whether the media like it or not.  I am not here to bash them. I am here to point out facts.  I know a fine pressman who got a recent appointment in the south.  He is a very respectable, decent man and a friend of mine.  His salary is twice mine and his perks include a free house and a free car.  More luck and more power to him.  The paper employing him was mentioned here this <Col N="513" /> evening.  I am delighted he is so successful in his career and I would never begrudge that paper the desire to give employment to people with high qualifications, but on the other hand, I do not think they are entitled to pass judgment on parliamentarians. Generally speaking, parliamentarians have a difficult life.</P>
    <P>I liked particularly the point made by Senator Ferris concerning Ministers of State.  For a short period I served in that capacity and I will never forget it as long as I live.  The demands made on a person in a busy Department are not understood by many parliamentarians, much less by the national media.  It was absolutely disgraceful that State cars were withdrawn. I say this particularly because in my county there are two men who have State cars.  I do not say this on their behalf but because it is a fact: it is not fair that a public representative should have to travel 2,000 miles a week in his own private car.  The Taoiseach and the Government should not have stepped out of line. They should have given as much help as possible to the people who are serving this State so loyally.  A politician will be out of public office for just two minutes before he is forgotten.  People will quickly forget all the work, all the dedication and all the family disturbances one suffered while serving as a public representative.</P>
    <P>Many parts of the Bill are good.  On the 7.30 a.m. to 10 a.m. programme this morning there was an interview with a man named Bernard Levin, an internationally known critic.  The Minister might not have heard of him before; I had not.  I was listening to this programme on my way to the city and Mr. Levin was talking about democracy.  He spoke about the great democracy we have where we could have a programme like this and be critical of parliamentarians. In places like Russia &mdash; this man's grandparents were born in Russia &mdash; they did not have that freedom and there are many other places throughout the world where they do not have this freedom.  Mr. Levin made a very fine point.  In fairness to him, I am sure he did not meet many Irish parliamentarians, but he stood up for democracy, and for the parliamentary <Col N="514" /> system.  I certainly appreciated the comments he made.</P>
    <P>A Senator said today that he was very proud to be a dedicated parliamentarian, with no other profession.  At the end of the day the only failure in this Bill is that the Minister did not pay Senators enough.  It takes a lot of courage to make that kind of statement.  These days demands are made on Senators to go to meetings in all parts of the country.  A Seanad constituency is very big and he is expected to go not alone through the county but through the province and possibly outside the province as well.  There are great demands on the time of parliamentarians, particularly party parliamentarians, and this House is big enough to absorb into its system party parliamentarians as well as those who claim to be Independent parliamentarians.</P>
    <P>While the increase is welcome, in my view it is insufficient.  I want to make that statement, particularly if I am quoted sometime tomorrow morning between 7.30 and 10 o'clock.</P>
    <P>I totally agree with the abandonment of the 21 days, but in his explanation the Minister left out a far more serious matter. If a general election is called after the twentieth day it is &ldquo;bye-bye&rdquo; to your salary increase because there are not 21 sitting days.  That happened on one occasion and amending legislation had to be brought in, but of course it did not go as far as the Minister does on this occasion and I welcome that aspect.  I understand that the present Government do not have a lot of money.  That is not altogether our fault, but theirs.  Retrospection is being paid only from 1 September.  The Government could have done more in that area.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson made a very valid point.  I am sure the Minister and the House will help in whatever way they can to facilitate that situation.  As a parliamentarian &mdash; but not a Member of Dáil Éireann &mdash; I would like to compliment the Minister on the paragraph in his speech where he talks about granting the extra 21 days' pay to TDs on the dissolution of the Dáil.  I had an experience which I will never forget.  I failed to be elected to the Dáil by 26 votes and it was <Col N="515" /> three months before I was lucky enough to be elected to the Seanad.  I spent a most expensive four months trying to get elected to the Dáil and having failed that, trying to get elected to the Seanad.  While some people might have had the experience of a couple of Seanad elections, I can tell them there is a worse experience.  In the past 18 to 22 months I fought five elections, three general elections for the Dáil and two Seanad elections. All these elections are quite expensive. I would like all the national media, from <i>The Cork Examiner</i> to that lovely programme on Radio 1, to try to understand how much those 18 months cost me, and my sources of revenue are very small.  I do not think anybody thought I was in such a position of authority that they would offer me a backhander.  I never sought it, I would not take it, and I never shall take it.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan made a very valid point when he said that even the thought of taking financial aid should not come into the minds of parliamentarians.  If that happened it would be the saddest day for Irish democracy we could ever witness.  As someone who knows what it is like to go through so many elections in such a short period I want to tell parliamentarians that in time they will get their reward because despite what the media say about parliamentarians the public have a special feeling for us.  Wrongs will be righted not financially but in many other ways, in a willingness to help, and you will never forget your experiences in public life.</P>
    <P>Our allowances, salaries and travelling expenses should always be sufficient to allow us to stand shoulder to shoulder with people in comparable positions in Europe.  I am privileged to serve in the Council of Europe and I see parliamentarians from other nations whose remuneration is such that it would be unnecessary for them to seek aid outside of their profession in politics to help them to be re-elected or to stand for election.  For Members of the Dáil who may not be successful at a general election, and did not wish to seek a seat in the Seanad, some type of remuneration should be <Col N="516" /> made available to allow them to adapt to society again.  Some aid should be made available to politicians when they are forsaken by the public for some peculiar reason, or perhaps for no reason at all. This is thought to repay those who have served this country loyally and well.  It is difficult for them to adapt to a non-political life, but to do it without financial remuneration is even more difficult.  That should be taken into account in the future.</P>
    <P>I wish to thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to speak.  I hope I have made points that are relevant.  I am very proud of my ability to work as a parliamentarian. I am very proud of my heritage in politics and of the fact that I would hope always to be able financially to keep my head high in politics and be above any suggestion by anybody &mdash; no matter who it might be &mdash; that we would have to turn to other places for financial help to continue in political life.  It is fundamental that any Government understand that and the cynicism expressed on the national broadcasting stations should be dealt with fairly.  This Bill has gone a long way in the right direction but there is still a lot to be done.  If we are not proud of ourselves no one else will be.  If we do not take care of parliamentary democracy nobody will thank us.</P>

      <P>It was not my intention to contribute on this Bill but lest it be seen that the debate is not balancing, that one side is taking more blame than the other, I will offer to speak.  I congratulate the Minister for doing what other Ministers have failed to do and for having the courage to do what should have been done long ago.  At the end of October we were watching a particular Ard-Fheis and I noticed the words &ldquo;courage to succeed&rdquo;. The Minister here this evening certainly has the courage to succeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I heard Senator O'Leary speak tonight I came to the conclusion that he too has the courage to succeed.  He was positive in his attitude and rightly condemned those who have criticised the increases for Members of the Oireachtas. If we do not defend ourselves then nobody else is going to do it.  Mention <Col N="517" /> has been made tonight of the taking away of cars from the Ministers of State.  That to me was a retrograde step and will be forgotten about in a short time.  If we were members of a trade union we would not have to wait two-and-a-half years for an increase in remuneration.  We are now suffering a permanent loss of almost £1,500 per annum.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increase in travelling allowances.  They have been a disgrace up to now.  It is only right that we are put on the same level as civil servants in that regard.  I found that in respect of going from Athlone to Mullingar for county council meetings, I was getting more than I am getting in respect of coming to meetings of this House.  In addition, one always meets people here in Leinster House who must be entertained by way of meals and drinks.  Therefore, congratulations to the Minister.  We should defend ourselves.  I support what the Minister has done.</P>

      <P>There is no doubt that politicians have a lousy job.  They are treated with derision by sections of society who by and large are vastly better paid than are the politicians whom they deride.  These are people who insist on a level of travelling expenses for themselves &mdash; I refer to the media &mdash; which most politicians would regard as luxurious. I doubt if there is any journalist in the country who would agree that £27 is a decent allowance for an overnight stay away from home.  However, there are questions that should be asked about our allowances, particularly in regard to this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators are aware that there has been a reduction in living standards but why should all of us in this House be entitled to an adjustment in our income from politics when many others are not so entitled?  Why are we more important than everybody else?  Why are we more in need, and in particular, why should people like myself who have considerable incomes from activities outside this House &mdash; and there are many people, apart from myself, who have substantial incomes well in excess of Senatorial salaries &mdash; have a particular claim on an <Col N="518" /> increase of this magnitude?  I do not intend in headline-grabbing fashion to oppose these increases.  I know there are Members of this House who are in considerable financial difficulty.  Even by comparison with average industrial earnings Senatorial salaries are not enormous but there are many of us who do not particularly set a good example of restraint and concern if in addition to substantial incomes from outside politics we quite happily accept this scale of an increase.</P>
    <P>I hope that never again will we as politicians either accept or have imposed on us a restraint in the area of income which we then feel obliged to compensate ourselves for at a later date.  I agree fully with the Minister in his proposal to link political salaries to increases in the public service in future.</P>
    <P>On the question of travelling expenses, I do not know whether the mileage allowances that are allocated to us are generous or otherwise because I do not claim travelling expenses on the basis of a milage allowance.  I travel by train in respect of which I claim public transport travelling expenses.</P>

How many Members of this House or of the other House actually are entitled to the mileage allowances they claim?  I <Col N="519" /> would like to believe that quite a small proportion of the Members of the two Houses actually claim expenses on the basis of their usage of public transport. A number of less than ten was suggested to me.  In other words everybody else, apart from about ten Members of the two Houses, claim mileage allowances.</P>

      <P>If you say that this is not the case, I will simply accept that but I would say that those of us in this House in particular who have substantial earnings from outside politics have good reason to ask ourselves if there is a good reason for our getting a substantial increase in salary.  Could it be avoided by an adjustment in our taxation procedures or something like that?  Is there not a good case to be made for expenses being allowed on the basis of documented expenses?  I get quite an excessive allowance for expenses in connection with the Seanad in terms of the amount of expenses I have.  I know there are Members in this House whose expenses are so enormous that if they were properly compensated for them, they would virtually receive as much again as their entire salary.  That is as it should be, but that is a much more credible position to adopt than a blanket concession of a 50 <Col N="520" /> per cent expense allowance for everybody. There are people here who have enormous expenses, who could document those expenses, and who could justify having virtually their whole salary accounted as legitimate business expenses.</P>

      <P>I do not live off my Seanad salary.  If people would read my election literature they would know my position on that.  I am well paid outside of this House.</P>
      <P>There are other people here who are well paid also but there are many who are not.  This House is a bit different from the other House in that regard.  That is what I am saying.  Those who are, like Senator Killilea, full-time Senators, ought to be entitled not just to half their salaries as an allowance against expenses but to have whatever legitimate expenses they incur in their practice as full-time politicians allowed against income tax. That is the practice for everybody in any other business or profession.  I invite the Revenue Commissioners to have a look at my allowance if that is what people want but I am simply saying that instead of getting ourselves a dreadful reputation in the eyes of the public because of alleged substantial tax-free allowances, which for many Members of this House understate their expenses, we should have a position of having all our expenses documented, certified and legitimised.  If they are well in excess of what people are at present being allowed so be it, and if they are, as in my case, considerably less than that, so be it also.</P>
      <P>Instead of going around apologising for ourselves let us get to a position of authentic documented expenses.  That is the question that has given rise to the major complaint heard in the debate in both Houses.  Let those people who have legitimate, large expenses be properly recompensed as they should be, and let people like myself &mdash; and I suspect there are a number of others in this House &mdash; who do not have that scale of expenses, be appropriately taxed.  That would get away from one of the most persistent and offensive criticisms of the salaries and allowances paid to Senators and TDs.</P>

I consider myself to be a friend of the Senators but I cannot stand idly by without reminding Senator Ryan that he is hypocritical in his approach to this matter.  The Chairman of the Joint Committee on Co-operation with Developing Countries at their meeting of 11 October 1983 when there was a discussion on meetings, said that there was no doubt in his mind that it was better for Oireachtas committees to try to sit on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays after 7 o'clock in the evening.  At that time telephone operators are no longer working and Senators and Deputies tend to be slightly freer than at 3 o'clock in the afternoon when a great many of them have a better chance to do their telephoning and their work with their secretaries. Senator Ryan replied that if the committee sat on Tuesday evenings he would not be able to attend.</P>

There are very few people here who are engaged in other businesses and who could not earn far more money for half the work they do in this House.  Having regard to an ordinary tradesman's wages and what would be his payment for overtime if he were to work the hours that we put in, there is not a tradesman who would not be earning more than the Members of this House are earning.  In addition, when one is a Member of this House, there is not a charity that has not his name on a mailing list.  Shamelessly they look to us for help, but I suppose they find it necessary to do so.  If the Senator does not respond he is earmarked for a future date.  Football clubs or other committees who are running functions expect us to buy tickets.  These tickets can cost up to £30 or £40.</P>

If, as has been said by other people, we do not stand up for ourselves here, how can we be expected to stand up for anybody else?  If people are relying on us to do the right thing for the country and for them when the time arises, how can we succeed if we cannot do the right thing for ourselves?</P>

Far be it from me to make such a claim.  I did say last week that I like doing unusual things and that was in response to some remark made by the Leas-Chathaoirleach.</P>
      <P>I should like to thank the House for the general support it has given to the provisions of the Bill.  I appreciate the fact that Senators have taken the opportunity to place on record their support for a measure which the Government felt was not only necessary but overdue.  I have taken careful note of the points made by Senator Lanigan and Senator O'Leary and I would like again to apologise to the latter Senator because I had to leave the House temporarily to attend a division in the other House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Robinson raised a point which she has pursued previously in another place.  I am rather taken aback to find myself twice within a week in the Seanad discussing matters relating to the male and female genders.  I might say at the outset that I ommitted to deal with a point she raised last week when she suggested that I had said in the other House that the person occupying the position of Ombudsman may be a person of neither gender.  Anybody who would be chosen to occupy the position of that office would be required to have very special qualities. I have made that clear on a number of occasions.  However, to manage to achieve the status which I appear to have <Col N="526" /> conferred upon this being, according to the official record, is neither possible nor accurate.  I am afraid there was a quirk of a gremlin or undistinguished effects somewhere between the reporting of my remark as either gender and the eventual translation into print.  Perhaps it was merely a typographical error.</P>
    <P>The point which the Senator raised today is one of a more substantial and fundamental nature.  The House will recall that Senator Robinson raised with, I think, The Employment Equality Agency, the question of whether the Members' pensions scheme was discriminatory in that it appeared to provide for the payment of pensions to the spouses of deceased Members only in so far as widows of Members are concerned and that in that way, it was discriminatory against the spouses of female Members who might subsequently die.  It was rather a morbid and morose scene that the Senator painted this evening when she invited the House to consider the untimely and sudden death not only of herself but of Senator McGuinness and Senator Bulbulia.  All that at one stroke would be a serious blow to the contributions to this Chamber.  Then some minutes later she joined, by way of invitation, the Leas-Chathaoirleach to participate in this journey, I began to fear for the safety, health and longevity of the Members of this House.  I think, however, that the position is less serious than the Senator may have feared.</P>
    <P>Following on action which she took some years ago and of which she reminded the House, advice was taken at that time by my Department and by the Minister at the time, Deputy Gene Fitzgerald.  The advice then from both the Attorney General and the parliamentary draftsman was that because of the capability of applying the Interpretation Act, 1937 to the Act as it stands, and the fact that the Act as it stands uses the term &ldquo;deceased persons&rdquo;, it can be interpreted as applying equally to widowers of deceased Members as it applies to widows, which is the word used within the section, and the one which the Senator found offensive and possibly worrying.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="527" /> Notwithstanding that, I referred to this matter in the other House because of the Senator in particular I would prefer to deal with this more substantially on Committee Stage.  However, if Senators would refer to section 4 of the proposed Bill and its proposed amendments of the Act of 1938 as subsequently amended, they will find that the intention of section 4 is to allow a situation whereby, unlike previously, it will be within the power of the Minister for the Public Service to make a new scheme, in other words a new pension scheme, or to amend a pension scheme from time to time as the need arises.  I pointed out on Committee Stage in the other House &mdash; at column 1523 of the Official Report for 3 November 1983 &mdash; that it would be my intention when this Bill was enacted, in the making of any amendments and consequently the making of a new scheme through the implementation of section 4 and the consequential substitution of the subsection, as set out in section 4 of the main Act, to include in the amended pension scheme a provision which would clarify, once and for all or perhaps copperfasten what is understood to be already the legal position because of the application of the Interpretation Act.</P>
    <P>Senators and Deputies generally may rest assured that because of the interpretation of the Attorney General and the draftsman on the Act, as it stands, and because following the passage of this Bill it would be possible for the Minister for the Public Service to amend the scheme, and that it is my intention, in its amendment to specify that the scheme apply to widowers as well as widows, the matter raised by Senator Robinson has been dealt with.  I went to the trouble to draw the attention of the other House to this fact because of my knowledge of the Senator's particular concern relating to this matter.</P>
    <P>References were made by different Senators to the criticisms of this Bill since it was announced a little over a week ago. Those of us who are in public life should realise that it is an occupational hazard of being in politics that criticism will be <Col N="528" /> voiced against virtually anything one does.  I do not think that criticism should deter public representatives from doing what they feel to be correct as long as they also feel that they can justify what they are doing, that what they are doing is necessary, fair and equitable.  In the formulation of this Bill I had the endorsement of the Government to approach the matter on this basis.</P>
    <P>All we are doing in this Bill is to restore the salaries and allowances of Members of the Oireachtas to their pre-June 1981 position.  We did that on the basis of adhering to the recommendation of the independent review body's report in October 1979 and, indeed, their earlier recommendation in 1972 when on each occasion they recommended strongly that, once they had established the level at which Members of either House ought be paid, that level in comparability terms, ought be maintained through the regular application of national or general round increases which apply to the Public Service.  That would ensure that the position of Members of the Houses <i>visà-vis</i> other groups within the Public Service would not go askew once again, leaving them in a situation &mdash; as the review body found when last they were convened in 1978 &mdash; where they had to spend an inordinate length of time endeavouring to establish once again where, in the relative order, the Members of the Houses ought be because some national pay provisions between 1974, when the 1972 committee reported and 1979, when some national pay provisions had been applied to Members and others had not. What we have endeavoured to do is to restore Members to the position recommended by the Devlin review body.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan asked in this respect why he should get a certain level of Seanad allowance, why a Member of the Dáil might get, or ought get, a certain level of allowance.  The answer is &mdash; and I think it is the correct answer &mdash; that it is a reasonable procedure for the Oireachtas to invite an independent body to adjudicate upon the appropriate levels of salary that ought be paid to Members of Parliament as they adjudicated on, at the same time, in relation to the remuneration of <Col N="529" /> senior executives throughout the public sector.  Mind you, it might possibly be argued by Members of this House in particular that perhaps, because of the level of payment of Members of the Seanad, it was inappropriate that their allowances ought be reviewed in the context of a review body on higher remuneration. The Seanad allowance is not comparable in any way with any of the other allowances or salaries considered by the review body.  They consider mainly the salaries of chief executives and other people at very senior managerial level.  However, because of the unusual nature of Parliament it was felt that it was correct that the Members of Parliament ought have their salaries reviewed by this body and that is the position.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan made a very fair contribution. He pointed out that there were those like himself &mdash; I hope I am quoting him accurately &mdash; who had considerable or substantial other income.  I think they were the two words which he used.  That being the case, he wondered whether he was entitled to a level of allowance such as Seanad Members get at present, which is £7,619 &mdash; because of the failure to revise it since 1981 &mdash; or which will rise to £9,127 following the passage of this Bill.  The simple fact of the matter is that that is the level, adjusted for national pay agreements and Public Service pay agreements, which the review body suggested in 1979 Seanad members ought be at.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is the obligation of the Government or the Minister for the Public Service of the day to endeavour to distinguish as between Members of the Seanad or of the Dáil which Member ought to be paid more than the other. Their constitutents elect them to these Houses and have the same expectations from each of them.  Their performance afterwards, their work rate, their ability, or the way in which they perceive their duties presumably is a matter between themselves and their electorate.  But if the Parliament or the Government were to endeavour to distinguish between the levels of payment to be paid to various Members of a Parliamentary Assembly &mdash; all of whom are theoretically at least assumed to be performing the same function <Col N="530" />&mdash; then we would be embarking upon a very dangerous road.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out in the other House, there are very many people who are elected to that House also who have substantial other incomes and commitments. Obviously there is a higher proportion of the other House who are full-time Members than there are in this House.  It would hardly be right if the electorate of a particular Dáil constituency, were to be invited to elect people to be paid on a different salary basis, yet requiring the same performance of them.  If we are a democracy then we believe in free democratic choice.  The electorate at large &mdash; in voting in Dáil elections for the return of Members to that House and the specialised electorate which constitute the bulk of the Members of this House &mdash; make the choice in the full knowledge that they are electing, and very often reelecting consistently, certain Members who have considerable other incomes, other demands upon their time and other duties to perform.  Yet that electorate choose to return those people presumably because they feel they have a particular contribution to offer.</P>
    <P>It would have been equally dangerous to have allowed the situation to continue in which salary levels became so derisory that only those of very substantial other means could have continued as Members of either House.  That would be dangerous. I am afraid it would be equally dangerous were a method devised whereby a penal or punitive taxation system was introduced so as to discourage the participation of those with other interests or income.  Despite all their failings this &mdash; and far be it from me to criticise this House having spent so much of my parliamentary career here &mdash; and the other House represent to a very marked degree, and perhaps as good as any other forum, a cross-section of the Irish people. Represented here are people from all strands and sectors of society just as does the other House, if not more so.  That is as it should be.  It would be a poor Parliament indeed if this House were composed entirely of people who were university, or third-level lecturers: who were full-time Senators; who were publicans; who <Col N="531" /> were unemployed or who were retired.  If all of the Members of the House came from one grouping, or from restricted groupings, then the House would not, and could not, accurately reflect the views and aspirations of the people.  Consequently, there has to be a provision whereby those of no substance, and those of independent means will have equal opportunity for election to the House. We hear much about our taxation system. I would have thought that the general suggestion was that the Revenue Commissioners had a system in operation whereby, if there was surplus income available to any one person paying PAYE &mdash; as does each Member of this and the other House &mdash; that that system would ensure that quite an amount of that surplus would be taken and redistributed. That is as it should be.  But it is not for the House to begin to endeavour to to distinguish between one Member and another as to the level of salary he or she might be paid.  I have thought about this matter for a long time and that is the conclusion to which I came ultimately.</P>
    <P>Senator Ferris talked about Members who might feel that for one reason or another they did not want to take these increases which are merely the belated provision of the public service agreements, without retrospection.  He suggested that if there are Members who do not want to take the increases they ought to return them to me, that I would insert them into some fund which could afterwards be used for the distressed and disadvantaged dependants of these Members who apparently he seemed to think might fall upon hard times in the future. Listen: I will provide; they can divide.  If they want to assign a certain amount of their allowance to whatever purpose, if there are Members &mdash; as occasionally there appears to be &mdash; who feel that they do not need the level of parliamentary allowance which is being paid to them, that they are happy to perform, as they see fit, their duties within either House, they can &mdash; and, I am told, sometimes do &mdash; assign a proportion of their allowance to whatever charitable organisation or area of good works they feel most <Col N="532" /> appropriate.  That is a matter for them. But I do not think I should be invited to participate in a system which I get back postal orders every week from different people because they feel that they over-endowed with the riches of this world.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank Senators McDonald, Fallon, Daly and Killilea for their contributions.  Senator Killilea referred to two matters in particular, bringing those of us who do not have the opportunity of listening to Radio Éireann in the morning up-to-date with his particular version of what was said on the radio this morning.  I have no reason to doubt the accuracy of his reportage. It must have been an interesting programme indeed.  Senator Killilea suggested that, in his view, perhaps we did not pay Senators quite enough.  Perhaps that is a legitimate point for him to make. The point I would make, in return, is that we are doing no more than restoring the salaries and allowances of Members of this House to the level recommended by the review body.  Presumably, in the relatively near future the review body will meet once again.  On the basis of their recommendations they are rather overdue to meet to carry out a review of the salary holders within its general area of responsibility.  At that time, if that happens, Senator Killilea will have the opportunity to make &mdash; to what I regard as being the appropriate body &mdash; the appropriate case in relation to Members of the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator referred to the provision whereby the future intention is that Dáil Members on the day of dissolution would recieve an amount equivalent to one-eighteenth of their annual salary.  This is an important change.  I intend also, in conjunction with that, when I amend the pension scheme following the passage of section 4 of this Bill, to provide for continuing pensionability during the periods of dissolution.  Some of us who have been Members of the Houses for some years can recall cases where Members fell short of qualifying for a pension by some few <Col N="533" /> short weeks.  Those few weeks were less than the aggregate of the amount by which they had lost pensionability because of their having fought several general elections.  I am not aware of any particular case where that has happened in the recent past.  I need only invite Members to consider the parliamentary instability of the last two years, when we had three general elections within 18 months, to consider how very difficult it might have been for a Member were he or she to have lost his or her seat in one of those elections as well as having lost his or her allowance during the period.  In fact, the loss to a Deputy who fought those three general elections in 18 months was somewhere of the order of £2,400.  They lost something in the region of nine weeks pay during the course of those 18 months.  After the third election were a member to discover that he or she had lost his or her seat and did not qualify for pension by a period of less than nine weeks, such a member would have a very legitimate grievance.  For that reason I am also providing that a Member who may lose his or her seat or retire, with less than the minimum period for qualification of pension, will have the right to claim a refund of their pension contributions. That is a pretty standard provision in most other pension schemes.  I hope that will be regarded as equitable.</P>
    <P>Senator Killilea urged that the Government might have considered the question of making severance payments to Members who either resigned or were defeated.  I have a great deal of sympathy with this point of view, as did the review body.  They suggested that that might well be considered.  It is, however, a rather complicated matter to consider.  The question first arises as to whether those who are retiring or those who are defeated ought receive severance payment. Because of our unusual system of proportional representation and the manner in which candidates are selected a situation would arise in which candidates with little chance of success might feel obliged to stand so that they could point to their certain defeat as a reason for claiming severance payment afterward. For one reason or another the <Col N="534" /> Government decided that at this stage it would not be appropriate to introduce severance payments, no small part of that reason being the fact, once again, that the provisions of the Bill &mdash; very often contrary to what has been represented &mdash; are doing no more, in the main, than restoring the salaries and allowances of Members to their position of some years ago.  To introduce a form of severance payment might well be regarded as a substantial extra benefit.</P>
    <P>What I have done is to say that I will amend the pension scheme.  At present Members who qualify for pension are entitled to payment of a pension based on 1/40th for each year of service, providing they have served for eight years and, consequently, qualify.  In future a Member who retires or is defeated and who qualifies for pension will have the option of having their pension paid on the basis of 3/160ths, rather than 1/40th, for each year of service and the amalgam of the other 1/160th calculated actuarially into a lump sum.  In other words, in future a Member will be able to opt for the payment of a lump sum and a reduced form of pension payment if they feel that that is more beneficial to their particular circumstances.  That will not result in any cost to the State but at least will allow Members the option of deciding which way they would prefer to have their pensions paid to them.</P>
    <P>I might refer once again to the media criticism, perhaps referred to more than was necessary by many Members.  As I said at the outset that one must be prepared to accept the slings and arrows of political life, I do not resent any criticism that has been made.  If those within the media feel they ought make criticism of these changes, then not only ought they make the criticism but they have a duty to do so.  However, they have one other fundamental duty, that is, to make the criticism based on the factual situation rather than &mdash; as unfortunately happened in certain cases &mdash; on either a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of the factual situation.  For instance, to take the allowance paid to Members and add to that some notional figure for travelling expenses, combined with a further <Col N="535" /> national figure for overnight allowances and notional figures based upon the value of secretarial allowances or postage facilities, is to distort totally the manner in which the actual remuneration of Members is presented to the public.  To add each of those component elements together and suggest that that is what a Member was being paid was to represent to many people in the general public a figure that was as startling to them as it was really untrue and, I might suggest, equally startling to Members.  First, a Member is paid travelling expenses only on the basis of travel incurred.  They are paid overnight expense only on the basis of overnight expenses actually incurred. A payment of £27.50 overnight allowance henceforth, judged by any standard of hotel accommodation rates I am told about in Dublin, could not be considered in any way excessive.  The mileage rates paid to Members are somewhat in line but I suspect, overall rather less than the &ldquo;AA&rdquo; recommended rates.  I know them to be rather less than the rates paid to many people in other professions which engage them from time to time in travel and being away from home for a protracted period.</P>
    <P>To suggest that the cost of the stamp put on letters issued by Deputies or the cost of their secretary ought to be added on to their allowances is as fallacious as to suggest that the cost of those secretaries or postage ought to be added to the salaries or allowances of the leading article writers about whom Senator Daly spoke. I did not set out to provide in this Bill for Persian carpets, mahogany desks, banks of telephones, or blonde secretaries, as Senator Daly seemed to envisage being fairly standard facilities provided for the writers of leading articles in the newspapers. I rather suspect that that is not the case in relation to them.  Indeed the provision of normal facilities for them to carry out their work would not be regarded as part of their salaries.  I do not think that the provision of those same facilities to Members of either House, to enable them to carry out their parliamentary duties ought to be interpreted as being part of their take-home pay, or <Col N="536" /> their real income.  It is not.  It seems to me to be rather an unfair misinterpretation of the situation.  Let there be criticisms, certainly &mdash; and it is not only the right but the duty of the media to criticise if they feel that any of these changes are unjustified or unsustainable &mdash; but please let the criticism be based on facts.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To add a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  Subsection (6) (a) (i) of the said section 6A is hereby amended by the insertion after the word &lsquo;widows&rsquo; of the words &lsquo;or widowers&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding the very detailed explanation the Minister gave when responding to this point, and indeed notwithstanding his own welcome commitment to adjust the pension scheme to ensure that the discrimination is removed, I cannot accept the explanation he has given because the letters that I put on the <Col N="537" /> record of this House and the position, as told to me, contradicts what he said.  I cannot believe that I was indeed receiving a letter from the then Minister for the Public Service which was contrary to the legal advice he was getting.  That letter would be a lie.  I find it very hard to believe that, in a matter on which I have been making representations, the Minister, in May of 1980, was lying to me when he wrote to me and said that it would be necessary to have the legislation amended.  If I may recapitulate the situation: as I said earlier, in February of 1980 I sought to raise on the Adjournment the removal of the discrimination by providing that the widowers and children of female Members of the Oireachtas would be covered by the pension scheme.  The then Cathaoirleach, Senator Dolan, on the basis of the advice available to him, ruled out the matter because it would require legislation.  That was clearly the advice that the Cathaoirleach's office at the time obtained by making an inquiry on it.  Some months later, on 16 May 1980, the Minister for Public Service, to whom the Minister present has referred, gave a contrary view to what the Minister said in replying on this point.  He stated quite categorically in a letter to me:</P>
    <P>The Government have now decided to make provision for the spouses and children of female Members of the Oireachtas.  My Department is in touch with the Parliamentary Deaftsman's Office on the question of amending Section 6A (6) (a) (i) of the Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) Act 1938 and the Oireachtas Scheme itself.  Any necessary consequential action will be taken at the earliest suitable opportunity.</P>
    <P>This is not only a suitable opportunity, it is an appropriate opportunity.  We are already amending that section.  It requires the insertion of two words, or one word, if you put a comma in, and put in the word &ldquo;widower.&rdquo;  There simply is an inconsistency between what has been stated publicly to me, following consistent representations on my part that it would require amending legislation, and <Col N="538" /> that when a suitable vehicle came along that that would be done.  If it was only a matter of interpretation then it would not have required this indication that it required legislation.  It would have been appropriate to deal with it on the Adjournment and the scheme would have been amended by now because the matter would have been one of statutory interpretation.  If it had been a matter of statutory interpretation that would have been a good defence for the Department of the Public Service when the action was brought before the Labour Court.  It was brought initially before the equality officer and ultimately before the Labour Court, and the Labour Court found, as a matter of law, interpreting the law, that there was discrimination.  In response to that, initially the late Deputy Colley, in his capacity as Minister for Finance and the Public Service and subsequently the Minister, Deputy Gene Fitzgerald, stated over and over again that it required amending legislation and that they would use a suitable opportunity to do it.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that this measure is much desired by Members on all sides of this House.  I appreciate that to move, to have this amendment accepted and insert the provision clearly into the legislation would require the matter of going back briefly to the Dáil &mdash; I assume that this could be done at a convenient moment tomorrow without any delay &mdash; and then the legislation could be passed.  But I have to say that, as I have looked at the provisions at the moment, it is clear to me that the insertion of section 6A(6) in the 1968 Act &mdash; referring expressly to the fact that the pension scheme in relation to deceased persons who are Members of the Oireachtas for pensions for their widows and children was intended to cover widowers and children; the pension scheme so states &mdash; was interpreted and applied as covering only widows and children, was defended in the Labour Court as covering only women and children. Subsequent to that it was stated that it would require amending legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of this Bill, as it stands, does not cover the point.  It states that the Minister can amend pension schemes. But he can only do that in conformity <Col N="539" /> with the legislative provisions covering the pension scheme; he cannot go outside that.  If he did it would be <i>ultra vires.</i>  It just possibly may be the case that you can interpret &ldquo;widow&rdquo; in this context to be &ldquo;widower&rdquo; notwithstanding the clear position to the contrary in the letters and in the advice that was obviously given to the Cathaoirleach's Office in February, 1980, a good period after the Labour Court determination.</P>
    <P>I want to remove the matter from doubt.  I do not see why we should be relying on a possible interpretation when we have the opportunity to make it very clear.  Again we have an opportunity to set an example.  The scheme for Members of the Oireachtas has been found to be discriminatory in a binding legal determination of the Labour Court and I think we should put it right expressly.  As a Member potentially affected by this and joined by other Members potentially affected, I would appeal to our colleagues in this House to accept this amendment. The amendment itself inserts into the relevant section 6A the words &ldquo;or widowers.&rdquo; Therefore, the relevant section would mean that the pension scheme may provide, in relation to the deceased persons who are Members of the Oireachtas, for pensions for their widows or widowers and children.  That makes it very clear that you cover the widows and children of male Members and the widowers and children of female Members.  At present the children of female Members are excluded by the way in which the scheme operates, as well as their widowers.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I would submit that, for so long as the legislation does not expressly cover &ldquo;widowers&rdquo;, there is a big doubt about whether the Minister can do it by statutory interpretation or construction. Clearly, the Minister, Deputy Gene Fitzgerald, in May 1980 was advised that he would need amending legislation.  It looks to me as though amending legislation would be needed.  I do accept that a widower could possibly mount a legal case and have a good ground for fighting a legal case.  But I do not see why survivors of female Members of this House should have to go into the Labour Court <Col N="540" /> and start a whole legal process to get their rights when these have already been determined and must be, I submit, clarified.</P>
    <P>The Minister has had the burden of steering this legislation through both Houses and, if this amendment is accepted by him, he will be required to go back to the Dáil very briefly.  I would hope from the response the discussion on this amendment has had in this House that there would be no difficulty about going back briefly to have the amendment made by the Seanad approved by the Dáil.  It would take the matter out of any realm of doubt.  It is an amendment which was, in effect, promised when there was a suitable vehicle.  It was promised on 16 May 1980 by the then Minister for the Public Service, Deputy Gene Fitzgerald, that this precise amendment would be introduced.  I ask the Members of the House to support this amendment and just to take that little bit of extra time and trouble to ensure that it is clearly passed.</P>

      <P>I endeavoured to clarify this matter during my reply on Second Stage. Not wanting to appear to be in any way contentious about this matter, what it really boils down to is whether Senator Robinson is prepared to accept the situation as I have outlined it, or whether she feels the situation is factually correct on the basis of the information given to her by Deputy Fitzgerald when he was Minister.

      <P>May I interrupt briefly?  As I understand it what the Minister said at the earlier stage in response to this point was that immediately after the determination in May 1979 the then Minister for the Public Service had got the advice of the Attorney General that the Interpretation Act would apply.  I am saying that the then Minister on 16 May 1980 informed me in a letter that the Government were going to introduce legislation and that they were in touch with the parliamentary draftsman about it. Either the then Minister for the Public <Col N="541" /> Service was lying in that letter and misrepresenting the situation, or else the Minister has incorrectly stated what the advice available to the Minister for the Public Service at that time was.  I am left in a dilemma.  I do not know.  I have not got that advice.  There is a clear conflict between what the Minister said and the letter I got from the then Minister.</P>

      <P>The Senator referred to May 1979 just a moment ago in her question. The correspondence took place in May 1980.  I suspect that the matter is not at all as deep or mysterious as the Senator may be fearful about.  I would imagine that the correspondence from the Minister for the Public Service of the day to the Senator may have crossed with correspondence from both the Attorney General's office and the parliamentary draftsman's office to the Minister.  My reply on Second Stage was that when the Attorney General's office were asked whether an amendment to the legislation would be required they replied: As to the point raised, it would seem to be provided for by the Interpretation Act, 1937, section 11 (b).  They went on to quote the extract from that section which says:</P>
      <P>Every word importing the masculine gender shall, unless the contrary intention appears, be construed as if it also imported the feminine gender.</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and said no amendment to 6A (6) (a) (i) appeared to be necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>May 1980.  Within the same few days the parliamentary draftsman's office referred to the matter and made the point that because of the use of the words &ldquo;deceased persons&rdquo; in section 6A (6) and the application of section 11 &mdash; the section I have just referred to of the Interpretation Act, 1937 &mdash; it would require the appearance of a contrary intention if the provisions of the section were not to operate.  The draftsman's office concurred with the Attorney General's office in the matter at the time.</P>
      <P>I have a difficulty in this matter which I hope the House will appreciate.  I cannot speak for the then Minister.  All I can do is interpret the situation which seems to be that the Minister, having first been given to understand that legislation might be necessary, was subsequently advised that, because of the application of the Interpretation Act, the scheme as it stood was as applicable to widowers as it was to widows.  However, I have to disagree with Senator Robinson in what she suggests about section 4 of this Bill and its intention to substitute for subsection (4) of the main Bill.  The new subsection (4) says:</P>
      <P>The Minister may make a scheme amending or revoking a scheme under this section (including a scheme under this subsection).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I mentioned in the Dáil on Committee Stage and in my reply to Second Stage, despite the advice given by the Attorney General and the parliamentary draftsman that it is not necessary, to set at ease the mind of anyone who might still be concerned about the matter &mdash; although there does not appear to be any reason for concern &mdash; it is my intention in the making of any amending scheme following the enactment of this legislation, and the passage of section 4 which will insert the new subsections in section 6A of the principal Act, to use a form of wording somewhat on the lines of or perhaps identical to the amendment as tabled by the Senators.  I want the House to feel very sure &mdash; I went out of my way to raise this matter myself in the Dáil on Committee Stage &mdash; that the legal advice available to <Col N="543" /> me is that there is no necessity at present for that to be done.  The Interpretation Act allows for the coverage of widowers of the deceased female Members.  However, I want to copperfasten the situation as it were, if copperfastening is necessary, by including in the amended scheme a reference to the matter raised by the Senator.</P>
    <P>I would ask the House to accept my bona fides in this matter, and to accept that, if the House is gracious enough to agree to the passage of the legislation including this section, I will then have the power to amend the pensions scheme in the manner which I have outlined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CatherineMcGuinness" hpid="Mrs. McGuinness Mrs. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>While I accept the Minister's bona fides in this matter and while I do not want to go over all the points made by Senator Robinson because she has made them ably, and it is a late hour of night, there is one thing that strikes me as extremely strange about this situation.  If this legal advice was given to the Minister in May 1980 a few days after he had written to Senator Robinson, why then did he not write again to Senator Robinson saying: &ldquo;Dear Senator Robinson, It appears that I have made a legal mistake.  The Attorney General now tells me that the Interpretation Act applies.&rdquo;?  A public announcement should have been made reassuring all female Members of the Oireachtas, both in the Dáil and Seanad, that spouses would receive pensions if they came to an untimely decease.  It seems to me very peculiar that nothing was said about it at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both Senator Robinson and I are lawyers, and I am sure no one knows better than we do that one lawyer may tell you one thing about the Interpretation Act and another lawyer may tell you another. I do not think one can be absolutely certain that the thing is copperfastened by simply saying that the Interpretation Act applies, especially as I suppose one might argue that saying in the Interpretation Act that masculine includes feminine does not necessarily mean that feminine includes masculine, which is what we are arguing here.  The main thing that <Col N="544" /> strikes me as strange is that if this advice was received almost immediately after Senator Robinson was written to by the then Minister, why on earth was she not written to again?  Why were we all not told at that stage that we could set our minds at rest and that our potential widowers would be looked after?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I might clarify that.  I hesitate to be so ungracious as to endeavour to deny whatever decision was taken by the Minister of the day.  I am really not in a position to suggest to the House why the Minister might or might not have written to Senator Robinson.  I understand that my Department at the time did notify the staff in the Houses of the Oireachtas, who are responsible for administering the pensions scheme, of the legal advice which had been given to them by the Attorney General's Office. I do not know whether that information was conveyed to the Deputies, but I have been given to understand that it was conveyed to the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps later and later but all the same, with respect to the Minister, this is a very interesting and a very important issue, and one on which we can spend a little more time.  Senator McGuinness has made one of the points I was going to make.  For the record may I just state quite clearly and categorically that I got no letter or communication informing me in any way that there had been a dramatic change in the legal advice available from the Attorney General's Office to the Department of the Public Service.  If there was a communication in the way the Minister said with those operating the pensions scheme, there certainly was no communication with me as a potential beneficiary or a person involved as a member of that scheme.  To the best of my knowledge none of the other Members of this House or of the other House was informed of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="545" /> I find that the Minister is coming a little bit of the way to meet the problem.  He says that, notwithstanding the advice he has about the Interpretation Act, he intends explicitly to amend the scheme. Why will he not explicitly amend the Act? We have the section before us.  We can clarify the situation.  The doubt I have about him explicitly amending the scheme is that there is a problem about whether he has the authority to do it. There was, perhaps, a slight misunderstanding about, or he has been misconstruing the point I made on section 4.  I accept that he can amend pension schemes under this new section 4 provision, but he can only amend them within the framework of the legal provisions of section 6A.  Section 6A expressly refers to widows and children.  That was applied for years as being confined to widows and children.  No defence relying on the Interpretation Act was raised when the matter was challenged legally.  When matters are challenged legally, lawyers get involved. If it had been as clear as that, it would have been raised as a perfectly good defence to the action brought.  It was not raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I gather the defence was entered on a matter of Government policy at the time rather than legal interpretation. I do not want to pursue this because it may appear as if I am endeavouring to make a party political point. It is not my intention to do that.  I understand that the defence may not have been on the basis of legal interpretation, but rather on the basis of the preferred course for budgetary or whatever other reasons on the part of the Government of the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find myself in an embarrassing situation in that I am endeavouring to interpret the decision of the office holder of the time in relation to how he felt he must approach and defend the matter.  All I can do is give to the House the last advice available from the Attorney General who is the law officer who provides the advice to the Government, confirmed by the advice from the parliamentary draftsman. It is the last advice available and consequently I would have to regard it as <Col N="546" /> the best advice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am loath to get into legal interpretations because I am not competent to do so.  I think an injustice has been done to the people who raised the problem initially and who were not consulted afterwards.  That is the least we could expect to have been done, particularly when a Civil Service Department with a specific responsibility had been communicated with about this.  Would the Minister give to the people who are likely to benefit under this section a copy of what was advised to the people administering this scheme, so that people who are now concerned about their situation and their dependants will have it in writing until such time as the Minister can copperfasten it, based on the advice available to him?  That would be a reasonable compromise. If the Minister could give that assurance to the movers of this amendment, we should not have the difficulty we appear to have at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be more than happy to do that.  I am told I have not a copy of the correspondence addressed to the officer here in the Houses of the Oireachtas who was handling the scheme at the time.  I am told that the House may take it as 99 per cent certain that the correspondence is dated 18 May 1980, addressed to the officer here in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I would be more than happy &mdash; as I am sure he will be tomorrow &mdash; to make a copy of that correspondence available to Members.  I cannot say why it may have been decided that that information should not have been conveyed to Members afterwards. It was sent to the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas who administer the scheme.  I should like to thank Senator Ferris for his intervention.  As I said, my Department did notify the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas regarding the advice &mdash; the first as well as the last legal advice given to the Department as soon as they received it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding that advice, and because I feel that perhaps were action not to be taken, a niggling if not unnecessary doubt might be left in the minds <Col N="547" /> of certain Members, I had intended when the opportunity presented itself through the passage of this legislation, in the amending scheme to include a wording which would refer to the spouse of deceased female Members as well.  I suspected that were I not to do so, the legal advice from the Attorney General might still not be acceptable to some of the female Members who might still feel some residual doubt.  I wanted to help to allay their fears and set their minds at ease.  I thought it might be better and nicer were I to include that in the amending scheme.  I still hope to do that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>As I say, I am still staggered by what has been revealed this evening of the machinations in relation to this.  I would like to have copies of the correspondence, because it makes a very interesting file.  I would like to have a copy of the letter if a letter was sent to the staff side of the Oireachtas scheme.</P>
      <P>I repeat what Senator McGuinness has said.  It is unacceptable that no attempt was made to draw this to the attention of the members of the scheme or to communicate further with me on the matter which I had been pursuing, if that is the version.  Curiously the Minister, as I said, is coming part of the way with this amendment. He wants in the pension scheme to make it very clear and to spell out that it applies to widowers.  I simply cannot understand, other than the inconvenience of going back to the Dáil briefly, why he does not make it clear in the legislation, why the legislation on the face of it will remain discriminatory and will be subject to new interpretation, which did not apply in real terms, did not apply in that widowers would not benefit from the scheme and were refused that in the defence which was placed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister was correct.  There were arguments raised in the Labour Court relating to the cost of extending it to the survivors of female Members.  Policy arguments were put forward.  Apparently this can all now be resolved by a switch in legal interpretation.  I would prefer the approach of using this convenient time and mechanism.  If I had the support of <Col N="548" /> other Members I would like to put this matter to a vote as the Minister will not accept it.  I am really in the hands of the House.  It is a late hour, and the Minister has undertaken to amend the scheme.  In the circumstances, I suppose we have at least achieved the substantial objective. It has been a very shabby performance. I hope that my sisters both in this House and generally will note the kind of priority that is given to removing discrimination from various aspects of our working lives.</P>

      <P>I know that you did not, and it is certainly no reflection on you. At the outset I would say that I accept the bona fides of the Minister and I thank him for his attendance in this House at such a late hour and, indeed, for the very detailed attention he has paid to this amendment.  I put my name to this amendment precisely because I felt there was an anomaly, an area of doubt.  I feel that I owe it in justice to my family, and to the families of the other female Members of this House, and to the families of females who I hope will be Members of this House and of the Dáil in years to come in even greater numbers, to ensure that there is no anomaly and that there is absolute clarity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened extremely carefully to the arguments put forward by Senator Robinson, Senator McGuinness and the Minister.  While I am no lawyer, I still <Col N="549" /> feel there is an area of doubt, an ambiguity. It seems to me that the most straightforward, rational way of allaying fear, apprehension and anxiety is to include this amendment.</P>
    <P>This is a matter that transcends party politics.  It is a matter of justice and equity.  I call on the male and female Members of this House to support this, because it seems to be a simple, straightforward way of clearing up what may be a manifest injustice.  I have not found it a happy thought to be contemplating my own demise or the demises of my colleagues. Nevertheless, these are painful facts and truths which must be faced and dealt with.  I do not see why there should be a legal wrangle or a legal hassle if I suffer an untimely death, and why my family or the family of any other female Member of this House or the other House should be put to such inconvenience to obtain what are rights.  I support this amendment with the greatest of good will towards the Minister who I feel is a person of equity and justice.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, there are two possibilities I should like to put before the House.  One is that the Minister is right, in which case there is no problem.  The other is that Senator Robinson is right in which case, in my opinion, the amendment is out of order, because it is seeking to make a change which may or will impose a charge on the public purse.  That applies only if Senator Robinson is right.  If the Minister is right, it does not arise.  In other words, if we are duplicating the legislation it does not arise, but if we are actually changing the legislation and imposing a charge, this is not a power which this House has.  I ask the Chair to rule on whether, in what I consider to be the extremely unlikely circumstance that Senator Robinson is right, the amendment is in order.</P>

If Senator Robinson is right, do we have the power to act accordingly? No one is more frustrated about our lack of power than myself.  Perfectly innocuous amendments that I put forward on the Finance Bill were ruled out on the most outlandish propositions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked if that remark applied to me and said I hoped it did not. The Senator, in her response, seemed to feel that, because of my approach, it should apply at least in part.  I want to say to the House that, if I had considered this amendment to be necessary, I would have included it in the legislation brought before the Dáil in the first instance.  It would, presumably, have been passed in that House and the Bill in that form would now be before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The simple fact of the matter is that the advice from the Attorney General, who is the law officer of the Government, confirmed by the advice from the parliamentary draftsman's office, which is the agency charged with putting into legal form the intention of the Oireachtas in relation to legislation, is that it is not necessary to change the existing section. The existing section, together with the Interpretation Act, 1937, covers the situation <Col N="551" /> which concerned Senator Robinson and caused her to take the case to which we have referred to the Labour Court.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I brought this matter unnecessarily on the House through my reference to it in the other House.  I did that because I wanted to assure any people who might have been worried &mdash; because of the case which had been taken some years earlier &mdash; that the widowers of deceased female Members were already covered under existing legislation.  However, I went further and said that it was my intention when section 4 was passed and amended section 6A of the principal Act, to refer specifically in the amending scheme to the spouses of deceased female Members.</P>
    <P>Quite frankly, I felt that I would take that step, despite the legal advice that it was not at all necessary, because I suspected that since Senator Robinson had fought this lonely campaign two or three years ago with the equality officer and subsequently in the Labour Court, it might well be that either in her mind, or in the minds of some other Members or their spouses, there might be still a lingering doubt because the wording subsequently had not been changed, although the Labour Court appeared to have ruled in favour of the case which Senator Robinson made.  To set at rest &mdash; if it were needed to be done &mdash; the minds of people who might be affected, either Members or their spouses, I felt that, since I had the power to make an amending scheme after the passage of section 4, I would include appropriate wording.</P>
    <P>The House is being invited to accept my repeated assurance that an amendment of this type is not necessary, that the advice of the Attorney General's office, the parliamentary draftsman's office and my own advice, given to the other House, is that the situation to which Senator Robinson refers is already provided for.  The widowers of deceased female Members are covered under the existing legislation through the application to it of the Interpretation Act.  On this amendment Members are being <Col N="552" /> invited to say whether the word of the Attorney General's office, the parliamentary draftsman's office and my word are correct or whether the case Senator Robinson makes is correct.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. MacDonald Mr. MacDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>On Second Stage I supported Senator Robinson and I still support the principle.  After listening very closely to the debate on this section, I have no doubt whatever that the spirit contained in section 4 clearly underlines the equality between widow and widower. The Minister has put it on record that that is his view and his intention.  In view of that, I think the House can rest assured that justice will be done whenever the necessity arises in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>First, might I respond by clarifying immediately the remark I made earlier?  I hope it was not in any way an obscure remark.  I referred to the whole shabby history of this matter.  If the position is, as it now appears to be, that legal advice was available as of May 1980 to the effect that this scheme would be covered by the Interpretation Act, that is not the way it was being applied and that is not the way the schemes in the public service were being applied.  There was a case brought by IFUT before the Labour Court, subsequent to the case I brought, and nobody raised it there. Nevertheless, if this legal advice was available and was not communicated to Members of the Oireachtas and particularly Members who were affected by it, I call that shabby.  It was in that context I referred to it.  I was not being critical of the Minister.  I said the Minister had dealt fully with the issue in reply to Second Stage and had made a welcome clear commitment to spell out in the pension scheme, which he intends to amend, that it will extend to widowers.  The issue that is raised, and Senator Bulbulia focussed on this very well and very calmly at the end of a long day and a long debate, is that there is necessarily a doubt &mdash; how could there not be from the very history we have identified this evening &mdash; about the legislative provisions and now we have the vehicle to clarify that doubt. <Col N="553" /> The Minister is in a sense acknowledging that there is a doubt because he is willing to clarify the scheme.  Why are we not prepared to clarify this in the legislation giving him the authority to amend the scheme?  Why is he amending the scheme by reference to an interpretation and spelling out the word &ldquo;widower&rdquo; but he will not put the word &ldquo;widower&rdquo; into the section?  Ministers can only implement schemes by delegated legislation under a section within the framework of that section. Why does he feel it necessary to spell it out in the scheme but he is unwilling to accept this amendment to spell it out in the legislation?</P>
      <P>The Minister could make redress not for his lack of willingness to remove a discrimination, but for the way in which it has happened over a substantial period since 1979.</P>
      <P>As the Minister will recall, I raised this matter at the joint parliamentary meeting of the two parties the day this Bill was published and nobody said that was covered by the Interpretation Act. Indeed, the Taoiseach said that this is a matter which should be covered by this legislation and the Minister of State for Women's Affairs asked me for chapter and verse on it.  Nobody said anything about an Interpretation Act.  It was felt that this was something that should be amended.  Since the Minister referred to the fact that he mentioned this in the other House, I feel I have to refer to the fact that I had raised it, because it was clearly the suitable vehicle to amend the legislation.  Fortified by what Senator Bulbulia said, I think this is an amendment we should put and not withdraw.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of clarification, in fairness, the Taoiseach handled the debate in the absence of the Minister and said he was not conversant with all the sections.  I have already suggested a possible compromise &mdash; a copy of the instructions given to the relevant officer administering these schemes should be made available to the people who would benefit under it and that document in writing should supersede everything else in writing. With that and the Minister's commitment surely there is no need to have <Col N="554" /> a vote on something everybody agrees on.  Surely this written document will stand up in any court of law.  If the Minister gives an assurance that he will make available a copy of that correspondence which supersedes all other correspondence, that should set Senators' minds at rest in the interim period until such time as the Minister has an opportunity to insert the appropriate words.</P>

      <P>Why did the parliamentary draftsman not follow the precedent set in 1972 when dealing with subparagraph 1 (a) (a) when he came to deal with subparagraphs (c) and (d) of subsection (1) (a)?  This has resulted in discrimination against two former Members who gave distinguished service to the nation through the Seanad.</P>

      <P>As I mentioned on several occasions, the main intention of this Bill was to restore Members to the position they were at pre-June 1981.  There were a number of other items which had been touched upon &mdash; for instance, in the Devlin Report &mdash; and which were &ldquo;improvements&rdquo; of a minor nature.  One of them was the question of the pensionability or otherwise of the Cathaoirleach and Leas-Chathaoirleach.  First, because of the decision of the Government that the pay charges should not be applied retrospectively and that the Members would be at a permanent loss of that retrospection, some principle conveyed through the sections and the other provisions meant that it was felt it would not be appropriate to go back to apply pensionability for service prior to the service of the present and future occupants of the positions of Cathaoirleach and Leas-Chathaoirleach. I appreciate the legitimate point raised by the Senator but while amendments were being made it was felt that the amendments ought be made basically in the context of the present Parliament.</P>

      <P>I propose we adjourn <i>sine die.</i>  It is quite likely that we will meet next week.  I want an assurance from the other House that they have completed legislation we are expecting, and there will be a Private Member's Bill from the Labour Party.  Officially, I want to adjourn <i>sine die</i>, but I want to advise Members that it is likely we will meet next Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 11.13 p.m. <i>sine die.</i></P>
