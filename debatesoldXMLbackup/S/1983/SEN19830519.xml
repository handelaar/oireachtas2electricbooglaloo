      <P>Last night I was dealing with the third point in Senator Eoin Ryan's contribution.  I dealt with the qualifications I felt were necessary and had not been answered by Senator Ryan on the use of the word &lsquo;unborn&rsquo; on the one hand and the very much more valuable contribution he made on the question of the equal rights of the mother and the problems that may be posed by the use of that phrase.  The last point I was making was that the point laboured by Senator Eoin Ryan on the existing legislation was that the constitutional amendment, if enacted by the people, would not change the law and that the law would remain as enunciated under the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861.  I made the point that that is not the full story because, of course, the 1861 Act at present is interpreted with reference to the present Constitution and it is significant that this piece of legislation has never been tested concerning its validity or its constitutionality.  It is because it is in that limbo situation that the change in the Constitution could make a very fundamental difference to the law as it is enacted.  It is not sufficient to dismiss the question of the examination of what the law really is by saying that this constitutional amendment, if enacted by the people, will not change the law.  It may and it may even change the statute law because the statute law will no longer be interpreted on the basis of the existing Constitution but in the light of the amendment which would then have been enacted by the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, the criticisms which were outlined in this House, and in the other House, and in general debate in the country, and specifically the criticism concerning the lack of public discussion and lack of indication from Fianna Fáil in regard to what they mean by the word &lsquo;unborn&rsquo; is an extremely dangerous situation.  That is the reason that it is important that the main Opposition party should put on record what they mean by the use of the <Col N="1034" /> word &lsquo;unborn&rsquo; and at what stage do they think that an unborn child or foetus comes within the constitutional amendment they are proposing.  It is a reasonable question and one which they have singularly failed to tackle.  That is one of the most disturbing aspects of the situation. As I said previously, at least I put forward what I thought it should mean recognising that that, of course, is by no means definitive and is capable of being interpreted in a different way from the way I suggested it should be interpreted. That is the way I believe it should be interpreted.  I again recommend to Fianna Fáil that they should put on record what they mean by it so that the record will show for future generations and lawyers what was in the minds of at least a significant portion of the Legislature when they used this term &ldquo;unborn.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the previous speaker, I am flabbergasted at what Fianna Fáil are saying.  They do themselves, in particular, no great honour by avoiding issues, particularly the issue I have raised here again and again &mdash; I apologise to the House for raising it again and again &mdash; but the people and I are entitled to an answer: how do Fianna Fáil propose to deal with the problem that the Director of Public Prosecutions has identified? He has said that this amendment will make it, in his interpretation, more difficult to initiate prosecutions if they were required under the 1861 Act.  That is his opinion but I do not know any other basis on which the DPP can initiate a prosecution other than the fact that it is his opinion that a prosecution should be initiated.  The courts decide whether people are guilty or not and that is the way it should be.  The Director of Public Prosecutions decides whether prosecutions should be initiated.  My understanding is that if he decides not to prosecute the procedures needed to get around that would be extremely complicated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have an obligation to the people and, in particular, to the cause they so eloquently espouse, what they call the pro-life cause, the cause of protecting this country from abortion which they say is best done in the wording of <Col N="1035" /> this amendment, to explain to all the people who believe that that is what Fianna Fáil are doing, how they will get around the problem that has been identified by the Director of Public Prosecutions, that he will have considerably greater difficulty in initiating prosecutions if the Fianna Fáil wording is accepted by the people.  They cannot go on forever saying it is just an opinion.  He is not just John Citizen in the street; he is the Director of Public Prosecutions.  What do they propose to do?  Sack him and replace him by somebody who will accept their interpretation, thereby negating the whole idea of having a Director of Public Prosecutions? What do they propose to do, indict him, have him suspended or taken to court?  He gave his opinion and Fianna Fáil have an obligation to this House, and the country, to respond to that.  The response is not just to shrug shoulders and say &mdash; tough luck, that is just his opinion.  His opinion is what counts ultimately in the whole initiation of prosecutions. His opinion is the one that we as a community have decided to rest upon in terms of the initiation of prosecutions in criminal cases.  It is the one we have to accept and that is the one the country's verdict will be determined by.  Will Fianna Fáil please tell the country how they propose to handle that objection? They cannot go on forever saying it is just his opinion.  It may well be just his opinion but it is also the opinion that counts. I should now like to put my second question. Senator Eoin Ryan made some fairly platitudinous references to the aged and things like that.  I have been reading the Constitution to check up on this.  For instance, there is reference to the aged in the Irish language in the Constitution. They are referred to as, an tsean.  There is no reference to sean daoine or anything like that.  In the case of the unborn it is referred to as &ldquo;an mbeo gan breith&rdquo;. There is a difference between the English and the Irish in the case of this wording which is not extant in the other one.  With regard to what the Minister for Justice said about what I saw to be pecularities between the English and the Irish version, of course he is right that they are <Col N="1036" /> taken directly from the Constitution. However can he tell me whether those English and Irish versions have ever been interpreted by the courts?  There could well be a conflict on that Article between the English and the Irish versions.  The possibility of conflict must have been envisaged otherwise we would not have this indication that where there is conflict the Irish version holds supremacy.  There is no point in quoting the Constitution back to me.  Just because there is one anomaly in the Constitution would not justify entering another anomaly.  If those peculiar differences between the English and the Irish versions have not been interpreted by the Supreme Court do we really know that those words mean what it is alleged they mean?  They are the two questions I address to Fianna Fáil.  If some Fianna Fáil member will not tell me what they propose to do about the Director of Public Prosecutions I will have to hop up again and again because they are behaving disgracefully on that issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>One has enormous sympathy for the Minister, whom I welcome to this House, for the situation in which he finds himself.  He is, indeed, in an invidious position presiding over the attempts to pass an amendment to the Constitution the wording of which was not of his devising, nor was it the devising, one must make very clear, of the Fine Gael Party.  In my Second Stage speech I deliberately refrained from making points of a party political nature. I felt very strongly that it was out of place in this debate because it is about something very fundamental and very crucial to Irish society.  I also felt, given the civilised atmosphere in this House, that it was out of place with the very tenor of this House.  Having listened to the debate on Committee Stage carefully, and having seen the serried ranks of the Opposition singing dumb on what is fundamentally an issue of the greatest significance and obviously, seeing them feeling quite happy at seeing something pass into the Constitution which is fraught with danger and ambiguity I find it very difficult to contain myself.  The last time I sat on my rolling cadences and expressions <Col N="1037" /> of contempt but I am not able to do so this time.  I want to put it on the record of the House that the amendment is being brought in courtesy of the very people who brought about the Talbot car deal, The Pat O'Connor case, Mr. Seán Doherty and his multifarious activities.  Perhaps one is not allowed to put one's snout into that.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will ask the Senator to withdraw it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KatherineBulbulia" hpid="Mrs. Bulbulia Mrs. Bulbulia">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I will withdraw.  I will say that it must be accepted that the implacable attitude of the Opposition who refused point blank to give an explanation, to qualify, to outline the implications of the wording they are attempting to bring before the Irish people in a referendum has brought me, a normally mild-mannered person, to a pitch that I must state that integrity in political life is not merely about integrity in sexual matters, it is about integrity right across the board.  It is moral to care about what is right and proper in a referendum.  It is moral to have integrity.  It is moral to put country before party and that is what should be done in this case but is not being done in this House or, indeed, anywhere else.  That is what I resent, and bitterly and deeply resent.  I am looking for explanations from that side of the House.  I am waiting for clarification.  I am waiting for an in-depth detailed analysis of the wording and I am not getting it.  This is what has brought me to this pitch.  It is not my normal form.  I am normally courteous and civilised and I make my points of an intellectual nature but I cannot do it in this case.  The Opposition are absolutely frustrating the intellectual questioning of this side of the <Col N="1038" /> House.  As Senator Brendan Ryan said he will wait until doomsday to get the answers.</P>
      <P>I cannot believe it is possible for all Senators on that side of the House to be of one mind on this issue.  It is just not possible for people to be of one mind on any issue.  I see no subtleties, no variation, no explanation and no thought.  The most that has come out of this debate is that it is so because I say it is, therefore it is.  That is the most crazy type of logic. It is illogical.  That is why on this side of the House we will insist on questioning, asking and trying to see if the Opposition will be honest and face up to the implications of this wording and what they mean for mothers, children and for this society.  This debate has caused a great waste of parliamentary time in the opinion of many people but because the consequences are so far reaching and because it is possible it will bring about very dangerous situations and threaten the lives of mothers and children it is not a waste of parliamentary time although I accept we could be getting on with more practical legislation.  It has caused divisions right down through the very fabric of society, in the legal profession, in the medical profession and in the Churches. Those divisions may not even be healed in this generation and I would not like to have that on my conscience and I do not see how the collective ranks, with their collective conscience, can have this on their conscience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The wording before us sees the cultivation of vagueness as a virtue.  I do not propose to delay the House unduly with lengthy discussions on the word &ldquo;unborn&rdquo; and its ramifications, though it did intrigue me to hear a suggestion made by Senator O'Donoghue yesterday that it would please him if it was qualified by the word &ldquo;child&rdquo;.  It would be very nice if this could be done and it would add yet another innocent, sweet sounding word into this anodyne amendment.  Unfortunately, it avoids the issues of fertilisation, implantation and viability which have been so carefully and painstakingly developed by this side of the House.  It skirts the issue, evades the issue and is symptomatic of all the Opposition have <Col N="1039" /> offered us in this debate.  This term &ldquo;unborn&rdquo; has no meaning in law or in medical science that I know of.  It is not qualified.  Therein lies its intrinsic danger. It does not even refer to the unborn human, a point which Senator O'Donoghue was attempting to make.  It could be, if taken to its logical conclusion, that we may not even be allowed to eat eggs any more.</P>
    <P>Leading pro-amendment obstetricians in various statements to the newspapers and at meetings have prejudged the legal interpretations of the amendment.  The master of one maternity hospital in Dublin wrote to the papers stating that the amendment will not change current practice in his hospital, all of which is very soothing and very uplifting.  Current practice presumably includes termination of pregnancy when ectopia or carcinoma of the uterus exist.  This brings to mind a quotation from <i>Alice Through the Looking Glass</i> by Lewis Carroll which is as follows:</P>
    <P>When I use a word, Humpty Dumpty said in a rather scornful tone, it means just what I choose it to mean, neither more nor less.</P>
    <P>It is perhaps appropriate to quote an egg in this context but it might be wise to bear in mind what actually happened to Humpty Dumpty at the end of the day. Perhaps the pro-amendment people will be particularly gratified to hear the weighty opinion of an egg being accorded significance in this debate.</P>
    <P>I regret that the Minister is not here although I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare to the House.  There are a number of points on which I would like the Minister to comment.  Does he consider that legislators in a democracy have a responsibility towards the public to ensure that in a referendum the issue should be presented to the public in a clear and unambiguous way?  If, as I feel sure, he will respond affirmatively to this does he consider that this Fianna Fáil wording meets those requirements?  If, as I expect he will, he answers in the negative, may I ask him if <Col N="1040" /> he would countenance the possibility of a citizen bringing an action against the Oireachtas for putting him, the citizen, in a position of voting on an issue in a referendum which he does not understand? This has never happened before; it has never been necessary.  Previous referenda have been crystal clear.  Granted the implications of joining the Common Market may not have been immediately apparent to the citizens who partook in that referendum but it was a clear-cut choice which was presented to them, &ldquo;Do you or do you not wish this country to join the EEC?&rdquo; No such clear-cut choice is being presented to the public in this amendment to the Constitution.  If I were to pick any word which reigns in the minds of the public on this amendment it would be the word &ldquo;confusion&rdquo;.  The legislators are doing themselves and the public a disservice by placing before them in a referendum wording which is manifestly ambiguous, which the legislators in this House fail to comprehend and which the public have not an earthly chance of comprehending.  I cannot see who is going to make this wording clear to them. I know, and everybody in this House who is honest and who is facing up to the reality of the situation knows, that the public will be lead to believe that they are voting for or against abortion.  They will happily go out in their thousands to do just that when that is not what this amendment is about.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to the other conundrum inherent in the wording and that is, with due regard to the life of the mother.  As matters stand the equal right does not lie with the foetus, in practice.  In our hospitals every day our obstetricians make decisions involving the premature delivery of infants.  This is done out of due regard for the health of the mother. There is no legal framework within which those decisions are made.  Many obstetricians stated that they do not expect the amendment to interfere with current obstetric practice.  Their decisions are made primarily in the best interests of the mother and, as far as practicable, in the best interests of the neonate.  The result is frequenly that the tiny neonate comes out of this second best.  This happens <Col N="1041" /> despite the very best efforts of the team involved, obstetricians, neonatologists and paediatricians.  In the main these decisions are wise and considered and ones with which no sensible person could quibble.  The amendment purports to give rights to the neonate but it cannot ensure that these rights will actually obtain so long as current medical practice in this field continues.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister care to outline how these equal rights of mother and child would be implemented?  He will, of course, realise that decisions of this nature made by obstetricians, without the framework of the law, have to be made expeditiously.  There is very often an extremely dramatic situation.  These decisions are made hastily and instinctively with the skill, training and expertise of the obstetrician and his caring brought to bear on what is very often a matter of split-second timing.  He is the arbiter in this situation.  Nobody has made him the arbiter and it is a decision which, we, the Irish people, are happy to see an obstetrician have because in him we recognise skill, training and expertise. Should this amendment become part of our Constitution who is going to arbitrate in these situations?  Will there be annexed to every maternity unit here a representative of Government to act as arbitrator in such situations?  This may sound very far-fetched but it is the logical interpretation of this wording, which is shrouded in mystery.  We look to the Opposition to bring some clarity to bear, but so far in this debate they have failed lamentably and have come with their humpty dumpty obiter dictum: &ldquo;It is because I say it is&rdquo;. That is not good enough.  It is not good enough for the legislators and the Irish public.</P>
    <P>A very interesting situation will arise should the Supreme Court have to interpret this matter and it will have to interpret it as sure as night follows day, because it is crying out for interpretation so vague is it.  If the Supreme Court decides to interpret that citizenship commences from the moment of fertilisation all kinds of very interesting possibilities and ramifications will follow.  The fertilised <Col N="1042" /> ovum will also have to be accorded the rights all citizens have.</P>
    <P>One sees the Minister of State at the Department of Health and at the Department of Social Welfare having enormous problems computing the children's allowance which will have to accrue to those fertilised ova.  It is not far fetched.</P>
    <P>It is logical, if one determines that citizenship will attach to fertilised ova, that all the rights of citizenship which we enjoy must attach themselves to the tiny embryo.  We are talking about the right to children's allowances that I alluded to. We are also talking about death certification in the event of still-birth or abortion. We are talking of funeral grants for the burials of the aborted products of conception.  Perhaps while I am on the subject the Minister could tell me whether there is a still-birth register in this country.</P>
    <P>We are witnessing in this House the final stages of an ill-begotten, ill-conceived proposal.  Would that it could have been still-born.  The proposed wording represents a further assault on women by a predominantly male Legislature who are legislating for circumstances in which they will never, ever find themselves. Existing methods of contraception may be outlawed because it is inevitable that the hawkish elements in SPUC and PLAC will not stop at this but will proceed to take constitutional actions against existing methods.  This has been the case with the organisation LIFE in England and unfortunately we are an imitative society.  I am very confident that those people, with their taste of victory, will rampage on to attack more legislation which we have.  I would say in passing that we do not have much in the way of contraceptive counselling in our maternity hospitals, certainly in two out of three, except, of course, in regard to the method approved of by one Church.  Such moves by organisations which have pressed for this amendment will be resisted with far more vigour than is being presented in the attempts to pass this amendment.</P>
    <P>Even at this eleventh hour I would appeal to and implore political leaders, Church leaders and leaders in the professions <Col N="1043" /> to come together recognising that we hold so much in common and that this worthless amendment jeopardises all that we hold in common.</P>
    <P>We are shortly to witness something of an historic step forward, namely the establishment of the All-Ireland Forum.  I listened very carefully to the Northern voices which spoke in this debate.  Not one of them felt that this amendment had any merit or any applicability to an all-Ireland which we devoutly espouse. Because of that and because a gesture of goodwill towards the forum is called for and is warranted, I call for a stop to this dreadful amendment which has divided and upset the citizens of this State so much.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to comments of Senator Honan when she spoke, dissociating herself and her party from the scurrilous and vicious letters which were received, in the main in this House by women Senators.  I would like to thank her for that.  Never in my wildest dreams have I associated her or any members of her party with such vicious, lowdown, nasty emanations.  It is interesting to note in passing that since the lady Senators in this House took their courage in their hands and stood up to this nastiness and viciousness, those people have become silent.  It certainly points out that the way to deal with ugliness, viciousness and nastiness is not to cower before it, not to be timorous &mdash; to stand up and point at it, and that will make it go away.  If anything good has come out of this amendment that has.</P>
    <P>I have concluded all that I want to say. I will repeat that I see in the wording both in relation to &ldquo;unborn&rdquo; and &ldquo;with due regard to the life of the mother&rdquo; anomalies and mysteries which are still shrouded.  I look to the Opposition to shed light on these difficulties.  I challenge them, since they stand over this wording, that it is their right, duty and their moral obligation to spell out for us in detail the meaning of these words.  Until they do so there will be a large measure of dissatisfaction with this amendment, and this will be translated in the votes against it <Col N="1044" /> outside this House if and when it sees the light of day.</P>
    <P>Those of us who have failed to obtain satisfaction to our questioning happily and with confidence can go to the public and say, &ldquo;This thing is a nonsense&rdquo;.  It had a failed Committee Stage in another House where the debate degenerated into an unseemly debacle, which was referred to by the Minister of State with responsibility for women's affairs when she spoke here at the last Seanad meeting. It has failed in its Committee Stage in this House because we did not get replies to the questions which we so urgently sought answers to.  It is a mystery, and when in doubt the best thing to do is to vote against it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Following Senator Bulbulia's line of argument it is appropriate to place on record that this House is in a total mess about the type of wording that is before us, which we are trying to amend in some way or to which we are trying to get answers as legislators with a responsibility for the actual wording that we finally will put before the people.  The almost unconstitutional question we are asking the people to vote on will be to give a decision on a ballot paper which itself does not even include the actual proposed wording in this Bill but a narrower question: &ldquo;Do you or do you not agree with this amendment&rdquo;?  It is the wording contained in the Referendum Bill itself that will be on the polling card. I will be putting amendments down to that Bill requesting that the public be allowed the opportunity, before a referendum, to decide themselves, because we have not decided for them, if the words are the correct words.  Because their choice is so limited, I feel there is an obligation on us to ask the public if they themselves are satisfied, first with the words, and second, with the need at all for this referendum because of the continuing debate that has gone on here without any satisfaction to those of us who are genuinely concerned about the possibility of abortion being made legal in this country at any stage, and the responsibility we feel we have towards the protection of the unborn.  There is <Col N="1045" /> absolutely no doubt in my mind that any stand I personally, or members of my party, have taken on this issue has been vindicated in all the debates that have gone on in this and the other House.</P>
      <P>I am quite satisfied that the points we have raised, but which are still unanswered, are relevant to this amendment, to the words in the Bill.  I suggested yesterday that we might slow down now and stop to look at what we are doing finally, in the eleventh hour of this debate on this constitutional amendment.  I think there is an obligation on all of us, whether we are leaders of our groups in this House or leaders of the political parties in the country as a whole, at this eleventh hour to stop to look finally before we put this matter on a ballot paper and polling card for the people, who will have no choice. They must vote or abstain.  They are unsure, and people who are totally opposed to abortion could possibly abstain on this referendum because of the ambiguity of the wording.</P>
      <P>Because of that there is a definite responsibility on us now.  I would plead with the people on the other side of the House, particularly Fianna Fáil Senators who are all committed, in a way, to the purpose we on this side have put forward. I think if there is that goodwill between us we can definitely call for a cooling off period during which we could sit down to review the debate we had and all the points made.  When that review has taken place, perhaps, as Senator Martin O'Donoghue has said, there are other words that we could all agree with that would have the same purpose and still not be ambiguous or unclear or be reinterpreted by a court in a way which would be contrary to all the philosophies that we stand for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is our obligation.  I intervene a second time on Committee Stage to say this is how I feel.  We should proceed from there.  A decision by a vote of this or the other House or a majority vote of both Houses will not answer for the people the questions that they are now asking, which we have not answered and which we have a responsibility to answer, that is, if we have any function whatever in this.  We should not just sweep it under <Col N="1046" /> the carpet, wash our hands of it like Pontius Pilate, leave it to the people to decide, when we have not guided them in any way.  We have only set off further doubts in their mind.  These doubts have been justified by the experts whether it is medical, legal, religious, political or otherwise.  The divisions are there and it is time for us to patch up the divisions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a brief point about the word &ldquo;unborn&rdquo;.  Before I do so I would like to say that I am rather disappointed with Senator Bulbulia's charge regarding integrity.  Throughout my career I have disagreed with many people.  In this instance I find it difficult to accept that all the Members on the other side find it difficult to understand the words.  I have never questioned anybody's integrity.</P>
      <P>I tried to make the point yesterday that most people would be in agreement that this is an adjective qualifying a noun.  The question is what is the noun?  I think it is right to conclude that this noun has been left out for some sound reason.  It is also necessary to point out that in the Constitution we are dealing with people, human beings, not animals.  It seems to me clear that we are talking, as I said yesterday evening, about a human being during the gestation period of 266 days.  There is no difficulty in deciding when that period ends.  It ends at birth.  The difficulty seems to be about the commencement.</P>
      <P>From the experts whom I quoted previously, it is clear that life begins at the beginning.  This is what they say.  We can take many meanings out of words.  The word &ldquo;conception&rdquo; itself has different meanings.  But if &ldquo;beginning&rdquo; means the start, in my view it is at the time of conception when the male sperm impregnates the female ovum.  It is clear in my mind that this is the time when life is switched on.  This is the question that has been asked all along &mdash; in my view, as an ordinary layman, I believe that life is switched on at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me also that the reservations which Members have on the other side with regard to this is concerning contraception, more particularly with the methods of contraception which <Col N="1047" /> could be regarded as abortifacient.  I pointed out before that the experts have satisfied me that there would be no problem about retaining the present methods. I am quite satisfied that the <i>status quo</i> will be continued.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Which present method would there be no problem with?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that various methods of contraception are availed of.  I am not a doctor, I have no medical background, but whether it is the intra-uterine device, or pills, or medicine, I understand that some of these methods may be regarded as abortifacient. In the other House Deputy O'Hanlon explained that he was satisfied as a doctor that there would be no problem with regard to the continuation of the present methods.  He said that in any event it would be impossible to establish that a pregnancy had taken place.  From my part I am quite satisfied, with all my colleagues, despite what Senator Bulbulia has said, that the <i>status quo</i> will continue. I also believe that this could not be incorporated in the Constitution, simply saying that the <i>status quo</i> will continue, because other developments may take place.  I am satisfied in this respect that the <i>status quo</i> will continue.</P>
      <P>I have said I am very concerned in any instance of distress.  I would like to make that clear.  Senator O'Leary and other Members time and again have asked the question what do we mean by the word &ldquo;unborn&rdquo;.  I have tried to explain what I understand it to mean &mdash; that life begins at the beginning, and though it might suit some people to believe that life begins at implantation, if we are to take a logical line it must go back to when the male sperm impregnates the female ovum.  It has been established to my satisfaction that the present methods of contraception will not be interfered with and that the <i>status quo</i> in relation to contraceptives will be continued.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no intention of delaying the House at all this morning except to clarify one or two points.  They require clarification after the second <Col N="1048" /> speech of Senator Eoin Ryan yesterday. In it, he made an attempt, for which I am grateful, to come to terms with questions that had been asked from this side of the House in matters of definition.  He began with a question he was asked concerning the meaning of the term &ldquo;the unborn&rdquo;, but unfortunately Senator Ryan decided that he would refer to some of the concern that I had, referring deliberately to my own speech as pedantic.</P>
      <P>For the sake of the record of the House, I would remind the Members that I do not believe for a second that the speech the Senator had just heard was pedantic.  He was trying to offer a definition that has meaning to him, and I respect that, but how can you say that my question about the rights of the unborn was pedantic when I succeeded it in my presentation yesterday by four explicit questions all dealing with situations in which doctors might find themselves. This, to me, is not pedantic at all.  It deals with real situations in which practitioners and mother and the foetus will be affected by the way in which this term travels along through the legal process. They are real questions which have been posed by people who are in this situation: they are questions that have been asked by mothers, they are questions that have been asked by medical practitioners; and to suggest that they are simply the ramblings of someone who wants a pedantic exegesis of the meaning of the word &ldquo;unborn&rdquo; is extraordinarily unfair.</P>
      <P>The second point I want to make is that I did not introduce into Seanad Éireann the term &ldquo;unborn&rdquo;.  I am one of the people who said right from the very beginning that I found no necessity, no meaning and a great deal of danger, a remarkable insensitivity and an enormous hypocrisy in having this exercise undertaken at all.  I am not in the business of exchanging my certainties for somebody else's certainties, saying, &ldquo;I can with certainty assert that&rdquo;.  I did not take that position quite deliberately because I believed from the very start that there are matters about which certainty is not possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Eoin Ryan's speech was an extraordinary one, in a way.  It was one <Col N="1049" /> of those speeches that would almost make one think it was a soothing speech. He used the phrase in it that he was offering a legal opinion which he suggested may be wrong, which has that attractive Irish humility which we now and again are visited with.  But he went on to suggest from this legal opinion, which may be wrong but which is set to assure me, in my questions, which are in the end only pedantic in his view, that no change will be made in the law.</P>
    <P>That is the strongest statement made since this inter-exercise began.  I know nobody else who, with such lack of reservation, has made the statement, &ldquo;No change will be made in the law&rdquo;.  He followed it by repeating late in his speech that there will be no change, and then he spoke about the position of the doctors in the situations to which many of us had made reference, and he said that if we were to believe that anything else other than common sense would prevail we were people, to use his own words, who would believe anything.</P>
    <P>The fact is that medical opinion is divided.  It is divided for anyone who wants to read the newspaper.  It is divided if anybody wants to read the letters and submissions that have been made to us in this House and in the other House.  In an interesting way, which we might reflect on, some people I know who are very reserved people in writing to the papers and very slow people to come forward to offer their opinions on controversial matters, have taken the extraordinary step of joining together to write letters under their joint signatures to the newspapers saying that matters which are for them matters of decision in their professional practice are being put in danger.  Therefore there is no point in suggesting that there is one common sense within the medical profession in these matters. There is not.  It has had the effect in a curious way of dividing something that was not as divided before or in which divisions were hidden.</P>
    <P>One other question I also put was that on a Stage like this I was certainly unhappy about the suggestion that we would be unsure of something, that we would let off something to the people for <Col N="1050" /> their opinion, and that we would decide that we had done a good day's work by using language that had been suggested by many people as imprecise and that posed questions which had not been answered.  This was airily brushed off by saying: &ldquo;Do you want a medical dissertation in the Bill?&rdquo; We did not want a medical dissertation in the Bill but some of us stand here as people who did not use this language in the first place.</P>
    <P>I have not repeated one syllable of what I said at Second Stage.  I deliberately waited until this Stage to put four situations in medical practice which have not been replied to yet and that will affect how I will vote.  It would have been interesting if someone had said: &ldquo;How did this word &lsquo;unborn&rsquo; get used at all; who used it first, from which literature; where is it used elsewhere; are there societies that use it?&rdquo; I know that &ldquo;na mbeo gan breith&rdquo; is our own contribution to cultural history, but why did people who wanted the inter-exercise not say: &ldquo;Some people got literature from a group in the United States where they had been using this term for some time.  Many people were unhappy because it could mean anything but we decided it was a good way to organise a campaign&rdquo;?  If this had happened we would have known the origin of the word and one would not have needed a medical dissertation for that. The moral majority in the United States needed no medical dissertations to justify their language as far as they were concerned. As I said yesterday it simply had a good strident quality.  I will leave that because I might be transgressing back to a general point about the origins of this campaign and its structure.  What does concern us now is not only that word, but every other word, in this paragraph and the way in which these words are connected, the way in which sometimes these words seem to acknowledge existing rights, are unclear as to the status of a new right they might be suggesting, and are utterly imprecise about how the rights that might exist in relation to the mother are left intact or changed by this new assertion of the new right.</P>
    <P>I repeat the questions I asked and I want to defend myself.  As far as I am <Col N="1051" /> concerned these questions are not the questions of a pedant, I will remind Senator Ryan that it is now in the record of the House that I asked questions about the position in which a doctor may find herself or himself in relation to an ectopic pregnancy.  My second question dealt with cases of cancer; my third dealt with the use of particular drugs and my fourth dealt with the clarification of particular forms of contraception.  None of these questions has been answered.  I want to raise another question about which some Senators may not agree.  What happens when the right to life of the woman is threatened?  What about the future health of the mother?  Can anybody categorically state that there will be no question of any change in relation to practices as regards the future health of the mother who is experiencing difficulties?  We are speaking of a woman who will move out of these situations which we might suggest in the abstract, and who will live a much impaired life for the rest of her life. That is why I used the phrase I used on Second Stage.  If we leave these questions that affect women like that, perhaps there are only a few people involved, or dozens or hundreds, then the measure is unequivocally, in my view, anti-woman. I am asking these questions again on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The last point I want to mention is this, and it comes back to Senator Ryan's suggestion in his second speech, which was interesting, in which we were told to have commonsense, to throw away our fears and be assured that nothing whatsoever will change.  This was the extraordinary suggestion that was made, without, of course, having been told exactly how, that nothing would change.  I would like to make sense of this.  We are going to have another extension of the nod and a wink view of Irish life.  There is the possibility that things might change at any time, but we will be asked to believe that nothing will really change because we will not draw any attention to it.  I ask myself another question.  Take the very eminent medical practitioner who wrote to the paper and said he wanted to assure people that nothing would change with <Col N="1052" /> regard to current practice in his institution. What status does that have?  Is he saying &mdash; and I would like to know the answer &mdash; that nothing will change in current practice in his hospital because there is no implication for any change in anything that may happen as a result of the referendum?  That is one interpretation. Or is he saying something else, that nothing will change in his institution whether there is any implication or possibility for a change in this referendum? Is he inviting people to defiance?  Or, is he saying that nothing will change in his institution in relation to current practice because he has decided it?  Are we invited to some kind of authoritarian definition that the person who can head an institution will be the person who will set down the code of actual behaviour?</P>
    <P>I believe that these uncertainties are not answers to questions that we put on behalf of the people who will be affected by the consequences of this amendment being passed with these words in it.  It is not a matter of simply nit-picking about the words; I suggest to those who are attracted by another argument, that it is not a matter of saying that the people will understand what the words are about.  In matters like this, where we have already succeeded in dividing the people who are working in the hospitals &mdash; as well as we have divided the people in the churches and the community generally &mdash; that is just not good enough.  The reason this is being discussed in depth on Committee Stage is that the Second Stage enabled us to have an argument as to why this amendment was necessary.  The Committtee Stage invites us explicitly to look at these words together and in combination and to look at attempts to improve them &mdash; Senator Ross's amendment represents one such attempt.  It would be an interesting exercise to look at the seven other occasions when we amended the Irish Constitution, and to look at the words we used on those occasions, to look at the debates that took place about the form of the words and what we were after.  There was no such ambiguity, uncertainty and, of course, at the end of the day there was no such opportunism or, with respect, such a considerable <Col N="1053" /> degree of hypocrisy serving as a large backdrop to the mumbo-jumbo that these words are.</P>

      <P>We have had a long discussion on this amendment to the Schedule and this is symptomatic of what has been a very long debate.  What we have seen over recent months has been a prolonged search for a satisfactory wording which would give a guarantee in some form or another against the introduction of abortion in this country against the wishes of the population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should consider the alternative forms of wording &mdash; in the Schedule and in the amendment &mdash; and then ask ourselves how much progress have we made as a result of this long discussion?  We do not have very much progress to show.  If we ask ourselves where we are now, compared to where we were three months ago, I do not think we will see much difference.  What has this debate demonstrated? I feel it has demonstrated one thing above all, and that is the folly of using an adversary mode of debate on constitutional matters or on moral matters. Since we have been dealing in this question with something which is both a <Col N="1055" /> constitutional question and a moral question, I feel we have in this case a double folly.  This is the lesson we should learn as we reach the <i>impasse</i> that we face in regard to the heart of this Bill, which is the Schedule that we are now discussing. We should learn the lesson that in regard to moral matters, above all to moral matters, affecting the Constitution, the only path that will result in an improvement in our constitutional position without other indirect effects whose disadvantages would far outweigh the advantage of some constitutional improvement, is that we will have to follow the road of seeking all-party agreement.  We have been guilty of double folly in the manner in which we have tackled this and I hope that this folly is not repeated in regard to other matters.</P>
    <P>This House is entitled on Committee Stage to seek an improvement in the wording of the Schedule.  The scope for such improvement is wide indeed.  All of us who have followed this long debate have read various suggestions sent to us as to how the particular wording could be improved.  If these wordings commended themselves to the Seanad and the Seanad thought there was a reasonable chance of the wordings commending themselves to the Dáil, then our duty would be clear. But there is one amendment that is just not worth our while discussing and that is the one that was categorically rejected in the other House.  Unless we believe in fairy godmothers, we could not hope for a reversal of that particular vote.  The one amendment which we have had before us on Committee Stage is an amendment that is really not worth our while discussing, it is not worth our while sending it back to the Dáil.  That is the reason why the members of the Fine Gael group &mdash; in spite of this amendment being flapped in front of their faces as the Fine Gael wording &mdash; are not to be tempted into doing something which would be pointless, namely, returning to the Dáil the form of words which Dáil Éireann has rejected by 87 votes to 65.  That has been our position throughout this debate on the amendment and it remains our position at the end.</P>

      <P>I would like to clarify one point.  I would like to reassure Senator Fitzsimons that in my earlier remarks no attack was intended on the integrity of any one individual Member of the Opposition.  It was the collective integrity which bothered me, and a certain smug moral triumphalism which I perceived.  I listened intently to Senator Fitzsimons' lengthy contribution on Second Stage and I was touched by certain personal facts to which he alluded and by the integrity, depth and honesty which he portrayed in this discussion.  I would like to give this assurance to him personally and to reassure the Opposition Senators individually.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to reply to one or two points which Senator Dooge made when he said this was the one amendment which was not worth discussing.  It was, as far as I could see, the one amendment which had any chance of getting through this House.  If the Leader of the House had an interest in new amendments and new wordings, surely we would have seen these put down by the Fine Gael Party. It is no coincidence that my amendment is the only amendment before this House. I did not expect any amendments from Fianna Fáil or the Labour Party.  The Fine Gael Party publicly declared that they had no interest in obstructing this Bill going through this House.  As far as I can see the sense of that is &ldquo;We would like it to go through as quickly as possible&rdquo;. The proof of that is that the Fine Gael Party put down no more wording. If there was another wording they thought would get all-party agreement or would have been acceptable to this House, why was it not put down for discussion by this House at this stage?  They had that opportunity but they did not put it down.  That is a very big gap and that is a yawning fault in the argument Senator Dooge is making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House has probably heard me four times on this subject so I shall be very brief.  The debate on this amendment has been proved to be a pretty unholy mess. Both major parties have made a disgrace of themselves and on the whole, their silence has been deafening.  All day yesterday <Col N="1057" /> I saw both of them putting out one person to bat on a very sticky wicket, with few other contributions.  We had Senator Ryan for Fianna Fáil all day trying to explain the inexplicable and Senator O'Leary nearly all day trying to defend the indefensible, with some very vacant Fine Gael benches all day as well.  They are about 300 per cent better represented now than they were all day yesterday.  The sweet reason of Senator O'Leary in his calling at this late stage for all-party talks I find difficult to accept and difficult to give credibility to.  Why has this not happened before?  Why is it coming at this stage when we are nearing the end of this long and very tortuous procedure?</P>
    <P>I thought Senator O'Donoghue's ideas of new wording on Report Stage were encouraging.  They were constructive, certainly, but I do not believe that there will be all-party agreement.  Senator Ferris also made some constructive suggestions, but I do not believe at this stage it is possible that this will happen.  The Minister presented a reason for him not being able to recommend a defeat for this amendment because, he said, there was no reason to believe the Dáil will change its mind.  I do not mind whether the Dáil changes its mind or not.  I am not here &mdash; nor is any Senator &mdash; to predict the will of the Dáil or the decisions of the Dáil.  We are here with a constitutional duty to take each issue on its merits. There is absolutely no point in us being here, amending legislation, talking about legislation, delaying, revising or defeating legislation, if we are going to say &ldquo;Ah, well, the Dáil is not going to allow this, so there is no point in doing it at all&rdquo;. There is not really much point voting on anything if that is the situation.  We are an independent body with a different constitutional function.  It is not for the Minister, or for anybody else, to predict what the Dáil is going to do; it is for us to act as an individual body and leave the Bill to take its constitutional course.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the effect would be if we did defeat this Bill but it is being said that it would make absolutely no difference in terms of the referendum <Col N="1058" /> when it goes to the country.  I do not believe that.  The Seanad defeated the constitutional Bill put before it on the PR referendum.  I believe that had a significant effect in the country.  I gather the Fine Gael Party are going to recommend to the country that they vote &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  I believe the defeat by the Seanad of that constitutional Bill gave a credibility to the opponents of that Bill which helped to defeat it in the country.  I also believe such a defeat here would probably have the same effect in the country when it comes to the poll.</P>
    <P>I think a defective, dangerous and ambiguous Bill is about to be allowed to proceed through the House without much opposition with the active connivance of those who oppose it in this House. I make no apology for putting forward this amendment, because I believe it is right that the governing party should be made to face up to their responsibility and this they have singularly failed to do.</P>

      <P>Senator Ross has posed a number of questions to the Fine Gael Party.  He asked why there was no Fine Gael amendment down for Committee Stage, and later, he gave as his opinion that he did not believe it would be possible on Report Stage to get an amendment to which there would be all-party agreement and that is the answer to his first question.  If Fine Gael had managed to find a satisfactory wording which would have all-party agreement in this House, and therefore have a chance of all-party agreement in Dáil Éireann, we would have followed that road.  Such a form of words has not been found. Whether it is really impossible to find it I do not know.  It has not been found, and that is the reason why we had no amendment down.</P>
      <P>In regard to the appeal that this House has a constitutional function which it must discharge, the constitutional function of this House is the power of delay. The Constitution is clear on that point. We have no constitutional function of decision regarding such constitutional matters.  We do not even have the power of initiative in regard to constitutional matters.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <Col N="1059" /> The net question is whether, in fact, the delay is in the public interest or not. Senator Ross has mentioned it again and drawn a parallel with 1959.  The situation was very different then.  On that occasion, it was Fine Gael who were in Opposition and they were joined by Labour and Independents.  Most important of all, that was based on a political issue and not on a moral issue.  This has been part of the problem, that we have been dealing wrongly with something which is both a moral and a constitutional function.  We do not believe that further delay is in the public interest and we will not facilitate further delay.</P>

      <P>I had not meant to intervene again in this debate but I cannot resist drawing attention to the fact that what Senator Dooge in his inimitable way makes appear to be sweet reasonableness, is in fact nonsense.  The Fine Gael Party are the Government.  The Fine Gael Party, with the Labour Party's agreement, could very easily put an amendment through this House without the agreement of Fianna Fáil.  They do not need all-party agreement for an amendment.  Therefore, the putting <Col N="1060" /> down of an amendment at the Committee Stage or the Report Stage is far from useless, if they do not need to get the kind of all-party agreement he is speaking about.  Therefore, they have taken a conscious decision not to put down an amendment, and they cannot get out of it by saying there is no use doing it without an all-party agreement.</P>
      <P>Secondly, I was very pleased to hear him admit in unequivocal terms that this is a moral as opposed to a political issue.  Many of us have had grave doubts about the wisdom of using the Constitution because this is regarded as being a purely moral issue, and not a legal and political issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>My reason for raising this matter is that in the past week, and especially in the past two days, CIE have removed a number of pupils from post-primary school buses in County Leitrim. The problem is that many of these pupils have now been attacked when they are at their most vulnerable.  Many of them are facing either the intermediate or leaving certificate examinations in the coming weeks.  I was shocked to hear the Minister in her statement to the Dáil on Tuesday night last state that these pupils could now move to schools within certain catchment areas.  We all know that it has not been the tradition or the accepted principle for pupils to move from one school to another in the middle of a school year. What is really annoying is the fact that <Col N="1065" /> pupils are being segregated and divided among themselves by reason of the imposition of the various charges proposed by the Minister.</P>
      <P>The proposal with regard to school catchment areas is quite shocking.  I should like to ask the Minister, with regard to County Leitrim, what are the various catchment areas for the various schools within the county?  I know that these catchment areas have been operated in a very flexible way since they were first implemented.  I would appreciate if the Minister could tell the House today what are the given boundary areas for the various schools.  I am referring to the schools in Carrickallen, Mohill, Ballinamore, Carrick-on-Shannon, Manorhamilton and Drumkeerin.  There is a situation arising where children who live on one side of the road are told that they must go to a school which they have not previously attended because they are outside the catchment areas.  Yet in some cases those schools are up to three miles further away from them than the schools they are attending.  In the Mohill post-primary catchment area pupils from the Bornacoola area are being told that they must go to schools in County Longford. Yet these schools are two and three miles, in some cases further, from their homes than are the schools they are now attending.  In addition they must travel two miles to meet the bus whereas up to now they could avail of the bus that passed their doors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This whole situation has been brought to a ridiculous state.  The regulations that were supposed to be implemented earlier this year have collapsed totally.  On occasions I have contacted CIE and the Department with regard to the problems that have arisen.  One is told by CIE that they are complying with a regulation from the Department of Education, while the Department state that CIE are the problem.  I should like the Minister to clarify the position of people who have submitted payments but who have not yet received school bus tickets and also the position of those who have submitted medical cards.  A medical card should not be used as a criterion for school transport.  The holding of a medical <Col N="1066" /> card is a private and medical matter and should not be used as a guideline for any scheme other than the medical schemes.  It has no place in letting everyone know the children who are availing of school transport without charge.</P>
    <P>The fact that pupils outside the catchment area are being forced to pay a higher rate of contribution leads to the problem that where there are undefined areas, children are being put off buses who should be entitled to be left on.  I would appreciate if the Minister would tell me where I might be in a position to inspect the maps with regard to County Leitrim and its school boundaries. Despite attempts by a number of people in this regard nobody has been given the opportunity of seeing the catchment area maps.  The overlapping of boundaries is quite peculiar.  There is one case that arises where a child who is a half a mile further down the road is entitled to free transport to a school whereas a child two miles nearer is not so entitled due to the fact that a river which cuts across the road leaves that child to one side of what is supposed to be a catchment area.  Thus that child is forced to go to the school which is not the school of his choice and not the school nearest to him.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that there is such a short time left in this school year, would the Minister reconsider the position with regard to the entire school transport system not only for County Leitrim but for pupils all over the country who are now facing their toughest time as regards examinations at school level or at national level?  This pressure now being brought to bear on these pupils will have a definite effect on their performance and the Minister will in the future have a lot to answer for to those pupils because we all know how critical marks are when it comes to examinations in regard to points for entry to university and points for entry to a number of other occupations. Two points can mean the difference between somebody being able to pursue the career he would have liked and having to settle for a second choice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to interrupt the Senator but at no stage yet <Col N="1067" /> have you mentioned the removal of children from school buses, which was the basis on which I accepted the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>I did mention the fact that pupils who are attending post-primary schools in County Leitrim have been removed this week from the buses, especially those attending post-primary schools in Mohill who have really suffered this week in a much greater way than was the case previously.  What I am saying here is of relevance to the fact that these pupils like others up and down the country, are being discriminated against because of the proposed charges being implemented at a time when the pupils are at their most vunerable.</P>
      <P>The Minister has a duty to those pupils in County Leitrim and elsewhere to allow them the facilities which they were granted by the issue of school bus tickets in September 1982.  These tickets were issued to them on the basis that they would be valid until June 1983.  The Minister is being asked here to take immediate action with regard to pupils attending schools in the various centres in County Leitrim to allow them to be carried on school buses until the end of this school term.  I am asking her also to reexamine the entire position with regard to the whole school transport system with a view to bringing forward a fair and equitable solution to the problem, a solution which would allow the service and the facility of free transport to continue.  I do not know how long the Minister wishes to have to reply to this motion.  If she could indicate this, perhaps I could arrange with Senator Mullooly, who wishes to speak also, as regards the time factor.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>I may be upsetting Senator Ferris's plans for the evening.  The issue of these pupils who were this week in Mohill removed from the CIE facilities of taking them to school has caused irreparable damage to some of their future prospects.  A number of those pupils, due to local agitation and due to some local hold-up, were a number of minutes late for State examinations.  This is very serious. The Minister, in her wisdom, should now look at the position with regard to the school transport situation and see if she can see her way to allowing these pupils to be carried.  She should also carry out an investigation as soon as possible into the reasons for some of the people who submitted the necessary moneys and medical cards, where they are applicable, were not given tickets.  While the children in question have not been removed from the buses, they should have been allocated their tickets.  I would appreciate also if she could tell me what means are at her disposal to allow these pupils to be conveyed to the schools they are now attending.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that the Minister, having a rural constituency, knows the problems facing these people in rural areas.  In view of the fact that Senator Mullooly wishes to make a contribution I would now like to offer him the opportunity of doing that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Something that intrigues me is why Senator Ellis has waited this long to raise the question of the anomalies in the catchment boundary areas in County Leitrim because to my recollection the catchment boundaries were designed and drafted back in the mid-sixties.  There was at that point in time a certain degree of liaison, co-operation and consultation with various school bodies, managements, authorities and indeed a transport liaison officer.  In <Col N="1069" /> most cases the CEO in the respective county was appointed to liaise and the maps were made available for inspection and so on.  I can appreciate that possibly because of the events in County Leitrim and indeed in other rural areas in the past week this has brought the matter to a head.</P>
      <P>I come from an area like County Leitrim but I will deal with the situation in a Leitrim context.  I agree with Senator Ellis that there is a high degree of dependence on school transport.  So far it has been an excellent service.  It has been a very reliable service but a service that has been under-appreciated.  For the service to operate efficiently it is obvious that it must be organised and structured. We must have rules and regulations and we must stick to them in County Leitrim and in any other county for that matter. The only way in which this can be done is by building a catchment area around a particular centre.  But when this was being done there were consultations with the various interested parties and the catchment areas which we now have emerged therefrom.  I would agree, however, that there are some anomalies.  I was astounded to hear that there was an anomaly as great as a two-to-three mile variation as in County Leitrim.  I wonder will this on examination and on inspection stand up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole idea of the school transport system is to minimise the amount of duress on pupils and to facilitate their educational development.  Inside a certain area it is presumed and assumed that they can either walk, or have the wherewithal to get to the particular centre themselves in County Leitrim.  Outside that particular perimeter, school transport is freely available.  On the basis of new regulations introduced by the Minister, free travel is now available outside that perimeter but within the confines of the catchment area in County Leitrim for anybody who has a medical card.  Medical cards are a very fair method of deciding arbitrarily whether somebody is entitled to free transport.  Those people who are on health boards or who are associated with local authorities and so on will tell you that in order to qualify for a medical <Col N="1070" /> card, the health authorities must take into consideration such factors as hardship cases, chronic ailments, the means of the family, the number of dependants in the family and so on.</P>
    <P>The real crux, however, arises in the Border catchment areas.  But in order to have a catchment area you must draw a line.  That line, by and large I can safely say in most cases, is a fair line based usually on a six-mile radius around the particular centre.  In order to have it operated efficiently it at times splits parishes.  At times it splits village areas and townlands.  At times it differentiates between one side of the road and the other.  But this is the way in which it has been structured and must be structured.  If you start allowing flexibility then you open the floodgates in County Leitrim and everywhere else.  I would, therefore, exhort the Minister that there is one occasion possibly in which she should show flexibility.  That is in relation to subjects which are not available within a particular catchment area but are available in an adjacent catchment area.  I mean adjacent and not that one would have to leap-frog from one catchment area over another one.  In those cases, in order to allow equal rights and equal scope within the education system to everybody, there should be provision that if somebody can take himself to the edge of a catchment area in order to get into a catchment centre or towards a centre that allows a subject that is not in his native catchment area, some provision should be allowed for free transport.</P>
    <P>Again, I am somewhat amazed that both the Minister and CIE are being portrayed in this debate as being bailiffs.  The overriding principle in this debate seems to be the care and the concern for the child.  People have short memories in this regard.  It is only eight short months ago when babies and children were discriminated against by the then Minister for Health, who will go down in history as the Minister who took the cough bottle from the child.  I have no doubt whatever that the Minister will have a compassionate look at the situation.  There are anomalies in the system but I believe that the system, when it is examined by the Minister, <Col N="1071" /> will be improved considerably and that we will start off the school year in September with a slightly more rational system, a better system and a more equitable system as a result of the Minister's initiatives.</P>

      <P>I rise to support the case made by Senator Ellis.  I would ask the Minister to accept that the recently-introduced arrangements are not working, that they are leading to chaos and confusion that they are imposing severe hardships on many pupils in Leitrim and elsewhere.  Children who were previously carried are now being left on the roadside. Many of these children will be doing examinations in a couple of weeks time. These children are faced with the choice of either travelling on foot or by bicycle for long distances to school or else missing school during those vital weeks before their examinations.</P>
      <P>I know that the Minister said in the Dáil that she does not accept that there is chaos and confusion as a result of the recently-introduced arrangements.  But if she reads today's papers she will see that the representatives of two of the major school parents' organisations in the country, Mrs. Mary O'Carroll of the Catholic Secondary School Parents' Association and Ailis Bean Uí Riain of the Christian Brothers Schools Parents' Federation, have both agreed that there is chaos and confusion throughout the country and that very many children are affected by this.  It affects them in Leitrim and the counties adjoining Leitrim where some children have to travel from those counties to post-primary schools in Leitrim. There is confusion as to who should pay and who should be allowed to travel free.  There is a situation in the catchment boundary areas where pupils are being collected at the same pick-up point.  If we take two pupils, whose parents are the holders of medical cards one of those pupils has to pay £24 to travel to school on the school bus while the other pupil is carried free.  Senator Higgins referred to the catchment boundary area situation and conceded that there is confusion in relation to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1072" /> Free education was introduced in 1967 and, at the same time, the free transport scheme was introduced for students who were three miles or more from an adequate post-primary centre.  For the purposes of the transport scheme the country was divided up into catchment areas but what happened was that the Department in many cases adopted catchment area maps which had been drawn up by the planning section of the Department in connection with post-primary school rationalisation which they were studying at that time.  Those maps were then adopted as guidelines for school transport but in many cases they proved inoperable in practice.  It was because of this that the transport section and the transport liaison officers made practical decisions which, in effect, ignored the maps and opted instead for what were referred to as logical routes.  As a result, those catchment area maps became irrelevant as guides to operational and accepted catchment boundaries and remained so until the advent of the recent decision to impose school transport charges.</P>
    <P>With the decision to impose those charges the Department have reverted to using those outdated and irrelevant maps.  This is responsible to a large degree for the confusion that we have. The new ruling on catchment boundary pupils and on charges to catchment boundary pupils ignores all the agreements and the decisions worked out and agreed on since 1967.  Pupils from areas now described once again as catchment boundary pupils over the years have been given entitlement to full free transport to post-primary schools.  The situation is that we can have two pupils who a couple of months ago were regarded as having entitlement to full free transport, and whose parents have medical cards, now being treated differently.  One is being charged £24 to be carried to school and the other is travelling free.</P>
    <P>There is so much confusion, chaos and so much hardship being inflicted on pupils that the Minister should suspend the recently announced arrangements until such time as there can be a satisfactory and suitable scheme worked out.  I have no doubt that the Minister will get the <Col N="1073" /> co-operation of the school authorities, the parents and the Fianna Fáil Party's spokesperson on Education.  She was guaranteed this co-operation last evening in the Dáil.  I have no doubt that during the summer holidays it will be possible to work out a suitable and satisfactory school transport scheme for the country. In view of the fact that we are so close to examination time and that there are sufficient stresses and strains on pupils who are sitting for examinations the Minister should take this factor into consideration and give an amnesty in respect of the current charges.  The Minister should suspend the operation of any school transport charges until September, the beginning of the new school year.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Ellis that it is undesirable that medical cards be used as a criterion for accepting eligibility for school transport.  Medical cards were introduced in order to determine eligibility for health services and while the Minister said in the Dáil that there is confidentiality, sensitivity and anonymity in relation to the way eligibility for free school transport is being investigated, she will have to admit that in rural areas it is very difficult to have confidentiality in relation to such matters.  Pupils are aware if their colleagues have free transport because their parents hold medical cards and those who have not free transport because their parents do not have medical cards.  It is impossible to preserve confidentiality in a rural situation.  I understand Senator Lanigan wants to contribute for a few minutes so I will finish on that note.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank the Cathaoirleach for his kind words, which I appreciate very much.  I am very glad to be in the Seanad where I spent many happy years, a House which I consider to be an extremely important part of Irish democracy. Senators will be aware that when the Government assumed office on 15 December 1982 they had a mandate to tackle the very severe economic and inflationary problems the country was facing.  Most significant among those problems was the extent of borrowing to meet current expenditure and one important and stated objective of Fine Gael policy was the phased elimination of current budget deficit.  Indeed, Fianna Fáil before leaving office had made movements in this direction and these movements were reflected in the Book of Estimates published on 18 November 1982.  The Government had indicated to the electorate their acceptance of the main points in this Book of Estimates and within those Estimates was a provision of £28.2 million for the operation of the school transport services in 1983.  This provision, made by Fianna Fáil when in office was made in the full knowledge that the cost of operating the school transport service in 1983 on the same basis as 1982 would be £33.6 million.  This left a shortfall of £5.4 million.  The then Fianna Fáil Minister for Education, Deputy Gerard Brady, in a statement issued on 18 November 1982 in connection with the publication of the Estimates indicated that the charges would be introduced for school transport in the case of pupils in post-primary schools.  He foresaw the arrangements as consisting of the <Col N="1075" /> issue of a season ticket with a lower charge for junior pupils and with a concession to take account of the circumstances of larger families.  The Government on assuming office adopted the general outline of this approach but amended it to take account of families for whom the payment of school bus charges on behalf of their children would constitute undue financial hardship.  Accordingly they introduced from the beginning a concession whereby senior cycle pupils attending their appropriate centres and whose parents or legal guardians were holders of medical cards would be exempt from the charge.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am putting this question in context as to why students were refused admission to school buses last week in County Leitrim particularly.  This concession of the medical card for senior cycle students was followed after consultation and experience by the extension of that concession to junior cycle pupils and, as the House may be aware, the charges were: junior cycle pupils, £14 per term; senior cycle pupils, £24 per term.  Students who attended a centre other than the appropriate centre, that is catchment boundary pupils, £24 per term.  In consideration of the circumstances of large families the Government limited the contribution payable by any family to a maximum of £50 per term.  The circular which went out also detailed the question of the exemption of medical card holders. Once those charges had been established and accepted by the majority of users of the school transport system it followed in equity that any pupil on whose behalf the appropriate charge had not been paid or who had not been excused the charge <Col N="1076" /> forfeited the right to continue to use the service.  Indeed, had charges not been introduced and the contributions as outlined sought from parents, the range and scope of the service would have had to be substantially restricted.  I would emphasise that, taking into account the concession towards parents who would experience financial hardship, the Government were seeking by way of contributions from parents £1 million less than that sought under the Fianna Fáil proposals of 18 November 1982.</P>
      <P>It is important to spend some minutes on the catchment boundary facility difficulty which has been raised by Senators.  It is a topic on which there is a great deal of ignorance generally and problems arising in many areas.  I know that Senators, perhaps, are not aware of the history of it.  There are also examples sometimes quoted of very large and flourishing schools which stand to lose a few pupils to adjacent and less populous centres unless the catchment boundary concession is put on a par with the conditions for pupils who have full eligibility within the terms of the school transport scheme.  It is very important that we should be clear as to what we are talking about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the purposes of school transport the country is divided up into catchment areas, each such area served by its own adequate post-primary centre.  In response to Senator Higgins, who asked about the definition of an adequate post-primary centre, I should like to state that a centre is deemed adequate on the basis of having a satisfactory range of subjects.  These subjects include Irish, English, mathematics, a science subject, a modern language, a practical subject such as art, home economics, mechanical drawing and so on.  These catchment areas were drawn up initially in consultation with schools authorities and had regard to distance and traditional patterns of attendance as well as to the economics of school transport and the maintenance of a viable network of post-primary school services.  Pupils who live more than three miles from the post-primary centres serving their catchment areas are eligible for transport to <Col N="1077" /> those centres.  As a special concession pupils who are eligible for school transport but who choose for reasons of their own not to attend the post-primary centre serving their catchment area but to go instead to the centre serving an adjoining catchment area are granted what is known as catchment boundary facility. To avail themselves of this facility pupils must board the school bus within the catchment area of the centre they are attending.  They are themselves responsible, and they always have been responsible, for getting to such a boarding point and there never has been any question of their using school transport services for this purpose.  Once they have got to the catchment area of the centre they are attending they may be given transport to that centre subject to the payment of a catchment boundary charge of £24 and provided there is spare accommodation on the school bus after all eligible pupils have been served.</P>
    <P>The medical card concession does not apply to pupils availing themselves of catchment boundary facilities.  It is hardly necessary for me to defend a long established structure of school transport services or to point to the fact that the service was established in the first instance to enable children who would have had difficulty on grounds of distance in making a satisfactory attendance at school to do so.  The service was not and could not be established to assist in the exercise of choice as between one post-primary centre and another.</P>
    <P>When pupils choose to go to school outside the centre serving their catchment area they do so in the knowledge that transport may not be available at all or that, even if they can be accommodated initially as catchment boundary pupils, their continued transport is not guaranteed as they can be displaced at any time by an increase in the number of eligible pupils using the particular service.</P>
    <P>If one looks at the catchment boundary facility in this light, in County Leitrim or anywhere else, it is perfectly clear why the medical card concession cannot and should not be extended to pupils wishing <Col N="1078" /> to avail themselves of the catchment boundary facility.  Firstly, the use of the catchment boundary facility is not a necessary prerequisite to ensure a satisfactory attendance at school on the part of pupils who would have difficulty in doing so on grounds of distance.  It arises solely from a free choice made by the pupil not to go to the centre serving the catchment area in which he lives but rather to go to a centre frequently more distant serving an adjoining catchment area.</P>
    <P>Secondly, catchment boundary transport is in itself a concession within the terms of the school transport scheme and is not guaranteed.  Should the medical card concession be extended to pupils wishing to avail themselves of the catchment boundary facility the conditions would certainly arise when there would be pupils entitled to claim the medical card concession and for whom no catchment boundary transport would be available.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, such an extension would clearly raise extremely difficult problems of priority where pupils in excess of the spare capacity of the service are applying for catchment boundary transport. Should pupils entitled to avail themselves of the medical card concession be given priority over pupils on whose behalf the appropriate charge must be paid?  I need not comment on the threat such an arrangement would pose to the anonymity of the arrangements attending the medical card concession.  On the point of anonymity, it is extremely important to stress that every child travelling on the school buses who has a ticket has an identical ticket.  Therefore, there is anonymity and no difference whatsoever between children travelling free or children who are paying.  They have precisely the same ticket.</P>
    <P>At present priority in catchment boundary transport is given in accordance with seniority within the post-primary school course and this is seen to be the most equitable system of allocating a restricted number of places.  With a medical card concession in operation the conflicting claims of medical card status and seniority would not be subject to ready resolution. <Col N="1079" /> I will now refer to some of the points made by some of the speakers on other questions.  As regards the availability of maps or details of catchment boundary areas, of course any person can inspect at any time the maps of the catchment boundary facility in the offices of the transport liaison officers, the CEOs, in every county.  I am sure the Senators who are concerned on this point will immediately make it their business to avail of that facility.  On the question of my spending the summer reconsidering the whole question of school transport, which was made by colleagues of some of the Senators in the other House, that suggestion, if it were acted upon, would be grossly unfair to the vast majority of users of the system who have indeed complied with the regulations, fulfilled them, who are using the school transport system and who are very anxious that the transport system available to them would continue.</P>
    <P>With regard to the point when payment has been submitted, or medical cards have been submitted, and no ticket has issued, I am not aware of such cases and if Senators who are aware of such cases bring them to my attention I will have those details looked into immediately.</P>
    <P>On the question of catchment boundary areas, there was a suggestion that there was some flexibility or changeability about those areas.  In fact catchment areas are not flexible and all the centres have clearly designed catchment areas. These catchment boundary areas were established after a great deal of consultation with school authorities in all the areas concerned.  No change whatsoever could be contemplated without considerable consultations with everybody involved, the school authorities in a large area and parents.  There could be no question of that kind of flexibility as it would upset the arrangements which have been agreed to with existing schools.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a couple of other points arising from what has been said.  It was brought to our attention that in County Leitrim there were some incidents <Col N="1080" /> of children being refused admission on school buses because they had not paid and some attempts made to stop the buses.  I want to make it quite clear that on 1 March all parents were advised to pay the school bus fees or submit medical cards by 8 April in order to be issued with tickets.  That notice was issued on 1 March.  This date was extended to 27 April.  Notification of the extension of that date was carried by a series of prime-time television and radio advertisements, by advertisements in all local newspapers and the bus drivers informed all the children that the final date for payment or application was 27 April.  It was made quite clear in all of those advertisements and in every notification that after Monday 9 May children without tickets would not be able to travel.  That fact was carried quite clearly and was generally heard all over this country.</P>
    <P>I find it regrettable that parents should have decided to ignore all these reminders for whatever reason.  Parents themselves, therefore, ran the risk of depriving their children of school transport. Of course, it is particularly regrettable &mdash; as mentioned by some Senators &mdash; if their children are facing public examinations.  Parents making that decision, having been warned very clearly in the most widespread manner possible, made the decision to deprive their children of school transport.  I find it regrettable that many parents were encouraged to behave in this way.  I believe that the people &mdash; for whatever reason &mdash; who encouraged parents to behave in that way share a responsibility for the consequences to those children in terms of problems with examinations.  I want to make it clear that the responsibility for children not being able to travel because the tickets have not been applied for rests squarely on those who made the decision not to comply with the regulations.</P>
    <P>An even more regrettable aspect of recent times is that despite all the warnings, and all the advance notifications, in some isolated places some small groups organised action of an illegal nature blocking school buses thereby depriving <Col N="1081" /> all children, those who hold medical cards and those who have paid, of transport to school.  I find that extremely regrettable.  I believe the word &ldquo;reprehensible&rdquo; is not too strong.</P>
    <P>The main concern I have is to make sure that the school transport system will continue to be available to parents who wish their children to use it.  I will insist that we have a full system of school transport. I cannot justify the costs of the school transport system here at this time. It would be well to realise that the arrangements for the school transport charges were introduced specifically to enable the school transport services to be maintained on a basis which would provide a comprehensive service on a wide geographical basis.  The operation of the scheme is difficult and complex.  Much preparatory work has to be completed each summer before the commencement of the next school year.  It should be understood that unless very positive and immediate steps are taken to establish the basis on which the school transport system operates in the next school year difficulties may arise in relation to the range of services to be provided.  I need to emphasise that the deposits being requested from parents in respect of the children to be carried on the school transport service in 1983-1984 should be paid by the specific date of 16 June.  It would be a very serious disservice to pupils concerned to create a situation where there could be any confusion in regard to the necessity for compliance with this essential requirement for the establishment of the basis of transport arrangements from the beginning of September.  Any groups or people who encourage parents not to comply with this latest request run the risk of depriving children of school transport services in the coming school year.</P>
    <P>I hope I have answered most of the points made by Senators.  I will be happy, of course, to deal with specific details if Senators wish to bring them to me.</P>

      <P>I raised this matter on a specific area, County Leitrim.  I agree with the Cathaoirleach that the contributions &mdash; even by myself &mdash; wandered a little further than county boundaries or the schools within that county but I am disappointed with the Minister's reply in view of the fact that she did not state &mdash; except to name the county &mdash; what, if any, proposals she had to deal with the problems of pupils in that county.  I mentioned a few specific areas, especially with regard to post-primary schools in Mohill, County Leitrim.  I am aware that there may have been a request to the Minister recently to meet a deputation from that area with regard to the school transport problem.  I do not know if she is willing to meet them but I feel she might.  If she has time in the future I hope she will agree to meet a deputation from there to discuss the specific problems the people have in that area.  We all know that there are grey areas involved but Mohill, in particular, is one which is surrounded by other post-primary schools. It is an area where quite an amount of tradition has been built up with regard to the schools that pupils attend.  The Minister would be doing the parents in the area a service if she agrees to meet them in the near future to discuss their problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put it to the Minister when I was speaking earlier that I hoped, in view of the short term left, she would agree to allow pupils to be carried from now until the end of the school year.  In her reply the Minister stated she was not prepared to allow that concession.  In fact, the Minister has blamed the party to which I belong for being the baddies in this case, in view of the fact that the Estimates proposed by Fianna Fáil were less than what was said by the Department to be necessary to implement the school transport scheme.  Had Fianna Fáil been in power they would have implemented the cuts in a much more humanitarian <Col N="1083" /> way than the way in which they have now been implemented.</P>

I hope that at this late stage she will see her way to allow pupils who have been deprived of the facility, especially those in Leitrim, to continue to use the system until the end of the school term, only three weeks away.  If she compares the charges which she imposed with the charges to send those pupils to school by <Col N="1084" /> private bus, she will find it would have been much cheaper for the parents to hire and to pay a private bus service.  I am asking the Minister to reply to my request to meet a deputation of parents from the Mohill second level catchment area to discuss their problems.</P>
