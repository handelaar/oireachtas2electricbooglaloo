      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 9.  It is proposed also to take the items in that order except that it is proposed to take the Motion, No. 9, from 3.30 until 6.30 p.m.  The reason for this is that the Minister for Finance has indicated that not only would he like to contribute to the debate on this motion but he would like, if possible, to be present throughout the debate.  As the Minister will be engaged in the other House at 7 o'clock, it is proposed that we take the motion at 3.30 p.m.</P>

      <P>There is one problem which I discovered this morning with regard to the procedure of the House.  I wished to raise a subject on the Adjournment, which has been debarred under Standing Order No. 28 which says that items to be raised on the Adjournment must be handed in to the clerk at 3 p.m. on the day prior to the sitting day of the House. I feel that Standing Order militates against Senators who live outside Dublin and who come to Dublin only on the morning of a Seanad sitting.  I would like the incoming Committee on Procedure and Privileges to consider changing that to read &ldquo;that it be handed to the Clerk or to the Cathaoirleach before 2.30 p.m. on the sitting day in question&rdquo;.  In my view the present position leaves politicians and Members of this House, who are representatives of quite a considerable electorate, <Col N="108" /> at an unfair advantage because they are not able to give 24 hours' notice of questions which are of urgent importance. I wished to raise today the question of the Government's failure to provide the necessary finance for the extension of Sligo Hospital.</P>

The announcement was made at 3 o'clock yesterday.  In that case it was impossible for us to put down a motion today.  I agree with what Senator Ellis has said&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Senator Tras Honan be elected Leas-Chathaoirleach.</P>
      <P>Is mór an onóir domsa ainm An Seanadóir Tras Honan a mholadh mar Leas-Chathaoirleach ar an Seanad.  Nuair a bhí sí mar Chathaoirleach rinne sí dea-obair ar son an tSeanaid agus rinne sí a dícheall cothrom na féinne a thabhairt do gach éinne.  Táim cinnte má toghtar í inniu go mbeidh foireann mhaith againn &mdash; tú féin mar Chathaoirleach agus í mar Leas-Chathaoirleach.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. T. Hussey Mr. T. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion.  I hope the House will accept Senator Tras Honan because she has distinguished herself in the Chair.  I am sure that the House will be in agreement that she is a very suitable candidate for appointment as Leas-Chathaoirleach.  I have great pleasure in seconding the motion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>In rising to support the nomination of Senator Honan for the post of Leas-Chathaoirleach, I want to put on the record that I, on behalf of the Labour Party, feel it might be appropriate &mdash; and the Independents might agree with this stand &mdash; if the Labour Party and the Independent grouping, two minority groupings, were consulted and considered for the posts of Cathaoirleach and Leas-Chathaoirleach.  The two larger parties seem to assume even when there <Col N="111" /> is a change of Government, that we will sit back and agree to nominations from either side.  It would be appropriate, when these positions are being filled if minority groupings were considered. This would show our colleagues from the North of Ireland, whom we are glad to have with us, that we do in fact share power, in this House in particular.  I will not refer to the other House or to other institutions of which some Senators are members.  In this House we, as a party, have always subscribed to protocol.  In future we should be included in discussions about the filling of the posts of Cathaoirleach and Leas-Chathaoirleach. I am sure the Independent group think likewise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think we will be found wanting when discussions of that nature next take place, but I would like to remind the Senator that a Labour Senator was Leas-Chathaoirleach for a considerable period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion that Senator Tras Honan be elected Leas-Chathaoirleach.  In doing so, may I take this opportunity to wish her continued success as Leas-Chathaoirleach, and I am confident she will have the confidence of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We could probably consider Senator Ferris's proposal on another occasion.  On this occasion I am very happy to support the proposal that Senator Honan be elected Leas-Chathaoirleach. She comes from the best radical Fianna Fáil tradition, a tradition which has been somewhat lost in its more recent accretions, but which represents what is best in this country in terms of its thrust, ambitions and hopes.  She also did a fine job as Cathaoirleach and Independent Senators had every reason to be grateful for her work.  Therefore I speak for myself and for the other Independent Senators in welcoming her and supporting her nomination as Leas-Chathaoirleach.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased to see Senator Honan nominated as Leas-Chathaoirleach. <Col N="112" /> We all owe her a debt because in the last Seanad she had more influence in getting Ministers into the House.  I would like to thank her for that. I wish her the best of luck and I hope it all works out well for her.</P>

      <P>I would like to add my congratulations to Senator Honan on behalf of every Member of the Seanad, and particularly the people who served with her when she was Cathaoirleach.  I want to take this opportunity to thank her for her courtesy to me, to my party and to the other Members of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to convey my congratulations to Senator Honan on her election as Leas-Chathaoirleach.  I do that for a number of reasons, one of them being that I am a neighbour of hers.  I join in with the compliments that have been paid to her on her performance as Cathaoirleach.  I am satisfied that she will continue to show the same degree of impartiality as Leas-Chathaoirleach as she did when she was Cathaoirleach.  I wish her very well.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to congratulate Senator Honan on her election as Leas-Chathoairleach.  We owe her a very great debt because she was impartial and fair-minded when she was in the Chair.  I wish her well in the time ahead and I am certain she will be a very great help to the Cathaoirleach.  I would also like to offer congratulations to the Cathaoirleach and to wish him well in the time ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank my party for nominating me as Leas-Chathaoirleach and I warmly thank the Opposition, or rather the Government side &mdash; it will take me a little while to get accustomed to calling them the Government side, but by the time I have got used to doing so I hope they will be gone again &mdash; for their good wishes.  There were such magnificent speeches made about me the day the Cathaoirleach took the Chair, and again today that I am a bit confused <Col N="113" /> as to why I was moved out of the Chair, especially if I had been doing such a good job.</P>
      <P>I am deeply grateful and honoured to be appointed Leas-Chathaoirleach.  A colleague who is no longer with us &mdash; and we did not have any great love for each other while he was here &mdash; said I was committed to this House and that I had made this quite clear inside and outside this Chamber, and that I was not using it as a convenience to get to higher places. He used the word &ldquo;higher&rdquo;.  To me this is the highest place.  It could be said that making me the Leas-Chathaoirleach is another way of keeping me quiet.  As Senator Ryan said, perhaps I am the old type Fianna Fáil.  If he dubs me that I am proud of it.  I will not change, and that is letting everybody know on both sides of the House where I stand.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Taoiseach saw fit to nominate the Northern Ireland Senators.  I was a little confused by one word Senator Robb used when congratulating me on my performance as Cathaoirleach.  He used the word &ldquo;honeymoon&rdquo;.  If he was on a honeymoon with me I did not know anything about it.  It is better to make that clear here.</P>
      <P>Before I sit down I would like to congratulate Senator O'Mahony on his appointment to Europe and wish him well.  I do not think he is here today but I would like my message to be conveyed to him by some of his Labour colleagues.</P>
      <P>I intend to carry out my duties as Leas-Chathaoirleach with the same commitment, dedication, time and hard work as I did in my short term in the Chair. My warm and sincere thanks to all.</P>

Senator Ryan knows of old that that committee are very expeditious about their business.

      <P>As this is the first time I have spoken in this House, I would like to offer my congratulations to you, Sir, and to Senator Honan who has just been appointed.  The best wish I can have for her is that she will have a term here of not less than four years.</P>
      <P>This order complies with an EEC Second Council Directive on summer time arrangements concerning the harmonisation of the summer time period throughout EEC member states.  The order is a follow-up to the Winter Time Order 1981 (S.I. No. 67 of 1981) which the House approved on 11 March 1981. The principal effect of the order is that we will have a similar period of summer time in 1983, 1984 and 1985 as we have had for the past two years that is, from the last Sunday in March to the fourth Sunday in October, that is, 27 March 1983 to 23 October 1983; 25 March 1984 to 28 October 1984; 31 March 1985 to 27 October 1985.</P>
      <P>The summer time period in these years will begin one week later than prescribed in the Standard Time (Amendment) Act, 1971 (No. 17 of 1971).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission consider that the harmonisation of the summer time period would help the efficiency of transport, communications, commerce and contracts generally between the countries concerned. <Col N="119" /> Discussions with a view to the standardisation of the &ldquo;summer time&rdquo; period have been going on for several years.  There are several problems of course, including the fact that natural time in the United Kingdom and here is substantially different from that of the continental member states.  The Commission have accepted this and have taken cognisance of this in the directive by prescribing that the summer time period should end one month earlier in the continental member states than in the United Kingdom and Ireland, that is, 25 September, 1983; 30 September, 1984; 29 September, 1985.</P>
    <P>This is a most favourable arrangement from our point of view as we have always favoured the longest possible summertime period and the public, when consulted about the provisions of the Standard Time (Amendment) Act, 1971, were in favour of having our period of summer time synchronised with that in the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>A minor consequence of the order will be that the time of change from winter time and <i>vice versa</i> will be 1 o'clock in the morning Greenwich mean time rather than 2 o'clock.</P>
    <P>I now call on the House to approve the order.</P>

    <Title>Air Companies (Amendment) Bill, 1983  [  Certified Money Bill ]:   Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Minister for Transport (Mr. J. Mitchell) Jim Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. J. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is essentially an enabling one which will allow the Minister for Finance to increase the State shareholding in the air companies by up to £60 million and to increase from £75 million to £150 million the State guarantee limit for borrowings by the companies.  State equity investment in the air companies at the present time is £43.6 million and, subject to passage of the Bill, it is the intention of the Government to subscribe an additional £30 million by way of equity over the next 12 months, £15 million <Col N="120" /> before the end of the present month and the other half before 31 March 1984.</P>
      <P>The Bill has to be seen as part of a comprehensive package designed to bring the air companies back to profitability as soon as possible.  Action by the airlines themselves and certain cost alleviation payments by the Exchequer are other elements in the overall package.  I should perhaps point out that, apart from some timing changes necessitated by the fact that introduction of the Bill was interrupted by the dissolution of the 23rd Dáil, the financial restructuring package is along the same general lines as that announced by my predecessor in July 1982.</P>
      <P>lation relating to the air companies last came before the House.  Since the Air Companies (Amendment) Bill, 1978, which also provided for an increase in the State's shareholding in the air companies, was discussed, the aviation industry has passed through traumatic times.  We have witnessed the demise of such well-known airlines as Laker Airways and Braniff, other major carriers such as PanAm have struggled for survival, while the aviation industry world-wide has recorded losses of unprecedented proportions.  The situation is still grim.  To put the position of Aer Lingus in its proper perspective, it is interesting to note what Mr. Knut Hammarskjold, Director General of IATA (International Air Transport Association) had to say about the state of the air transport industry in the course of the association's most recent annual general meeting.  Mr. Hammarskjold pointed out that preliminary estimates for 1982 indicate that the combined loss for IATA carriers in their international scheduled operations will be more than two billion dollars and that collectively these carriers had lost money every year since 1979.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main factors causing serious financial problems for the world's airlines have been the severe economic recession, which in recent years has affected the entire western economy and caused a slump in tourism and in travel generally, the effect on airline costs of inflation, fuel cost escalation, high interest rates, volatile currency exchange rates, and general <Col N="121" /> over-capacity, particularly on the North Atlantic, which has led to severe competition for traffic and unremunerative fare structures.</P>
    <P>In the year ended 31 March 1982 Aer Lingus returned a net loss of £9.2 million. This followed a net loss of £13.6 million in 1980-81.  These figures are in stark contrast to a net profit of over £4 million in 1979-80 and a general record of profits through the Seventies.  Indeed, lest the profitable record of Aer Lingus be overshadowed by their current difficulties, I think it only fair to point out that in the 20-year period from 1960 to 1980, Aer Lingus made profits in all years except four.  This was a record matched by few national airlines.  However, this record could not be maintained due principally to a dramatic deterioration in the economics of the airline's North Atlantic operations.</P>
    <P>While the company's North Atlantic service has traditionally been a loss maker, profits from their European air transport operations and more particularly from their ancillary activities, such as aircraft overhaul work, helicopter operations, hotels, computer services etc., have over the years helped to cushion the results of the Aer Lingus/Aerlínte group as a whole.  The scale of the 1980-81 losses, coupled with an assessment that 1981-82 would be little better, changed that situation utterly and left the airline facing major problems.  At the heart of those problems was the question of continued operation on the Atlantic.</P>
    <P>Aerlínte have lost money in each year since 1971 on their North Atlantic operations and accumulated losses on those operations as at 31 March 1982 exceeded £63 million.  The problems of the Atlantic have now become endemic and all airlines are suffering from them.  Indeed, in the year 1981 total published losses incurred by the airlines on the Atlantic amounted to $400 million and a figure of much the same magnitude is estimated for 1982.  Excess capacity and uneconomic pricing have inexorably brought heavy losses in their wake.  Governments on both sides of the Atlantic have for some time past recognised the need to bring a degree of stability back into the <Col N="122" /> market and, while some steps have been taken along that road, in a situation of deep world recession and excess aircraft capacity it would be unrealistic to expect an immediate about-turn from the uneconomic pricing policies that have plagued the airline industry in recent years. If anything, the events of 1983, as they are unfolding, suggest that the road to recovery will be a very long haul indeed.</P>
    <P>For Aerlínte the problems of an Atlantic operation are particularly acute.  The smallness of the market, affecting economies of scale, seasonality, affecting the ability to employ aircraft adequately on a year-round basis, and low average fare, arising from the dominantly tourist as against business nature of the Irish market, are factors which inescapably make the Irish carrier's role especially difficult. Against this background of continuing heavy losses and inherent difficulties in their operation, Aer Lingus concluded, following a review of their strategic position with the help of management consultants, that without some additional State investment they could not maintain Atlantic operations.</P>
    <P>The fundamental question, therefore, had to be faced: should Aerlínte continue to provide an Atlantic service or should the presence of the national carrier on the route be terminated?  An expert group, comprised of representatives of my Department, the Department of Finance, the Department of Trade, Commerce and Tourism and Aer Lingus addressed that question and the related financial implications.  The review group looked at the main factors in the deterioration of Aer Lingus's financial performance, examined the scope for cost reduction measures within the company and reviewed the role of the ancillary activities and their contribution to the company's finances.  The group looked in detail at the future of the North Atlantic service, having regard to its contribution to the economy generally.</P>
    <P>The review group's examination revealed that in the short-term at least there would be very little difference between the operating loss returned by the airline with their full range of trans-Atlantic and European services and the <Col N="123" /> loss anticipated with North Atlantic services closed down.  This situation arises from the fact that, in spite of 1,500 immediate redundancies which would arise with an Atlantic closedown, a large element of costs currently shared between the transatlantic and European operations would remain after an Atlantic closedown, thus pushing up significantly the costs of the European operation, rendering that operation unprofitable.</P>
    <P>In the course of their assessment of the value of the airlines's trans-Atlantic operation to the economy generally and the implications of cessation of services by the only carrier on the route with a commitment to providing a service on a year round basis, the review group consulted with representatives of the various agencies concerned, including Aer Rianta, Bord Fáilte, SFADCo, Córas Tráchtála and the IDA.  The group found that, apart from the very substantial loss of employment involved &mdash; 1,500 jobs &mdash; the withdrawal of the Aerlinte service would prove damaging to many sectors of the economy including tourism, trade and commerce.  I should, perhaps, mention that this view was generally shared by the agencies consulted by the review group.</P>
    <P>While continuation of the North Atlantic operation was not seen by the group as being justified on strictly commercial grounds even though closure would significantly disimprove the economics of the European operation, the group's assessment of the contribution made by the service to tourism, trade, industrial development, Shannon Airport and the Shannon region generally, indicated that a recommendation in favour of termination of the service would be difficult to justify.</P>
    <P>It was on the basis of all these considerations that the last Government, in considering the financial position of the air companies in July 1982, concluded that it was essential from a national viewpoint that the airline should continue to provide a scheduled trans-Atlantic service, a decision recently re-affirmed by the present Government, which also <Col N="124" /> accepted the need for further State investment in the air companies.</P>
    <P>The immediate problem is that arising from losses in the past the balance sheet of the air companies' consolidated operations bears an unsustainable level of debt relative to State equity.  As of March 1982 the ratio of debt to equity was 88:12 and the interest bill in the year 1981-82 was in excess of £12 million.  This is an unacceptable position for a company engaged in international commerce.</P>
    <P>In examining the need for further investment in the air companies, the Government have had to take into consideration not alone the particularly difficult financial position of the Exchequer but also competing claims for equity investment from other State companies, some of which are also in the transport sector.  It is against that background that the Government recently confirmed the former Government's decision to invest £30 million equity in the air companies by 31 March 1984.</P>
    <P>The Bill to provide equity is only one part of a thoroughly researched and comprehensive proposal to restore as soon as possible to viability the finances of the national airline.  There is no question that losses will be tolerated indefinitely or that there is unlimited Exchequer support available.  Action by the airline themselves is, therefore, an essential element in the overall plan to improve their financial performance.</P>
    <P>An area in which Aer Lingus have been remarkably successful has been the development of profitable ancillary activities to balance the losses which the company have incurred on their air transport operations.  Over the years, operating profits, before interest and tax, from ancillary activities, have grown from £4 million in 1973-74 to over £18 million in 1981-82.  In net terms the 1981-82 profit after all charges amounted to some £12 million.  The success of Aer Lingus in these ancillary areas of providing services to other airlines, hotel management and financial and computer services, is an example of the dynamism which Government expects from State enterprises. These activities provide profits which have helped to sustain basic transport <Col N="125" /> operations; without them a serious crisis in the airline's finances would have occurred long before now.  In addition, they help to provide and sustain significant employment in Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, the essence of commercial risk-taking that some investments may not come up to expectations. The Government, therefore, expect Aer Lingus to keep under continual review all the individual components of their investments with a view to ensuring that they are earning an adequate return.  I know that this view is shared by the Board of Aer Lingus.  Moreover, in the present circumstances there are limits on the amount of finance which the Exchequer can make available to the airline.  In that situation, it is reasonable &mdash; and I know that the previous Government were of the same view &mdash; that the company should make the maximum contribution which is commercially prudent from their ancillary activities, towards the resolution of their present problems.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise, however, that it is not Government policy that Aer Lingus should disengage from their ancillary activities.  It would be a very short-sighted strategy to dismantle the ancillary activities programme and forego the profits that the programme can continue to generate. A continuing, and hopefully growing, flow of profits from an ancillary activities programme, constructed and operated within the constraints of the airline's own resources, can help to ensure that Aer Lingus continue as a self-sufficient airline to discharge their mandate to provide air transport services on cross-channel, European and North Atlantic routes.</P>
    <P>Action is also being taken by Aer Lingus with a view to improving efficiency and reducing costs in every aspect of their operations.  Undoubted progress is being made on this front, but with the recession continuing and constant pressure of competition, Aer Lingus must be relentless in cutting back expenditure wherever possible.  I fully appreciate that such necessary action can, of course, affect certain routes.  Indeed, Montreal and Chicago have already had to be dropped from the company's scheduled passenger network. <Col N="126" /> The B707 fleet was retired as its economics disimproved.  Operating patterns have had to be modified to realise savings. Substantial savings in fuel consumption are being achieved and new technology is being introduced.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the considerable progress which Aer Lingus have made over the past two years in reducing staff numbers. While consultants' reports have made it clear that Aer Lingus are in line with industry norms of productivity for airlines of their size, the financial pressure which they are facing and the drastic measures being taken by their competitors to reduce their unit costs are such that further improvements are clearly necessary.  It is clear that our State companies which operate in international markets can only continue to be successful if their unit costs are as low as or lower than those of their competitors.  Sustainable jobs of long-term value to the community can only be maintained within a framework of commercial viability.  For this reason I strongly support the efforts of Aer Lingus to streamline their operations further by reducing supervisory structures and simplifying work practices. Considerable progress has already been made but Aer Lingus are themselves fully aware of the need to do more to enable them to return to profitability as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>When these various elements &mdash; equity investment by the State and the measures being taken by the airline themselves &mdash; are combined, the unfortunate fact remains that Aer Lingus will still be in difficulty at least until a much more favourable environment is restored on the Atlantic route.  In that situation, and bearing in mind that accumulated losses on Atlantic operations give rise to an interest bill of the order of £7.5 million a year, the Government accept that some temporary support in respect of the commitment to continue Atlantic operations is called for.  Payment of £5 million a year for a three-year period between 1983 and 1985 by way of cost alleviation to Aerlinte accordingly forms an integral part of the overall financial re-structuring package. Provision for payment of the first £5 million instalment is included under subhead <Col N="127" /> S. of the Transport Vote in the current year's Estimates.  I must stress, however, that this cost alleviation is a temporary measure to help the airline during a period of particular difficulty.  As such, it will, I believe, help the airline's finances without interfering with the commercial ethos of their operations.</P>
    <P>There is one other aspect of the North Atlantic situation to which I must refer and that is the position in relation to charter traffic from the United States this year.  Senators may have seen recent press reports on this subject and I would like to take this opportunity to clear up any misunderstanding which may exist.</P>
    <P>Firstly, may I say that the Government welcome US charters and see them as having an important role to play in ensuring that the needs of Irish tourism are adequately served, particularly in the peak season.  Any assessment of charter activity must, however, also take account of the basic need to provide the framework for comprehensive, reliable year-round air services at the lowest possible economic prices to meet the growing requirements of trade, commerce and tourism between Ireland and the US. Excessive charter capacity can very easily destabilise the market for scheduled carriers with a commitment to providing year-round services.  This can be particularly the case when the charter capacity is provided at what can only be termed opportunistic or indeed predatory fare levels.  It is against that background that I have had to examine the position as it was emerging on the charter front this year and take certain decisions which I will now recall for the benefit of the House.</P>
    <P>In examining charter programmes submitted in accordance with my Department's charterworthiness rules up to 31 January 1983, I reviewed the overall market situation and concluded that for the New York and Boston gateways, filed programmes, coupled with the services provided by the three scheduled service carriers, would provide ample capacity for the coming summer.  I accordingly approved the programmes before me at that time.  These programmes provided <Col N="128" /> for a doubling of the number of charter seats that could be offered, as compared with the 1982 level of operations, and for a 50 per cent increase during the peak months June to September.  In approving that scale of increase.  I am satisfied that there is ample scope for growth in tourist traffic between the US and Ireland in 1983.  In that regard, Senators will be aware that Bord Fáilte have set themselves a target of a 5 per cent increase in tourist numbers from the United States this year.</P>
    <P>The charter programmes will be operated on PanAm aircraft by Round Tower/Old Country Tours, the largest tour operator in the United States specialising in the Irish market, and by International Weekends, a large Bostonbased tour operator who have brought visitors to Ireland for many years.  The approved charter programmes are attractively priced and, taken in conjunction with the extremely keen fares being offered by the three scheduled carriers serving the US-Ireland market, Aer Lingus, Northwest Orient and Transamerica, should go a long way towards helping Bord Fáilte to attain their 1983 target. Indeed, I should also mention that PanAm charter operations played a significant part in the turn-around in Shannon Airport's fortunes last year, and the increased charter activity now authorised should help further to strengthen Shannon's performance during the current year.</P>
    <P>I have referred already to the destabilising impact that excessive charter capacity can have on the overall market. Accordingly, when approving the increase in charter activity which I have already described, interested parties, including a number of US airlines and tour operators, were notified that summer 1983 charter programmes beyond those duly filed and approved by me would not be authorised from either New York or Boston into Ireland.  That decision. I might add, was taken only after full consultation with the State agencies involved in the promotion of tourism to Ireland, all of whom acknowledged that the decision was necessary in the best <Col N="129" /> interests of Irish tourism and the development of Shannon Airport.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that without this regulatory action, considerable damage could have ensued, damage which would not only have aggravated Aer Lingus' already serious financial problems on the Atlantic, but might also have undermined the commitment of the US carriers to continue providing scheduled services to Ireland.</P>
    <P>Some press reports have suggested that my decision also affects charters from Chicago.  That is not the case.  Charters from Chicago, or indeed any US point outside the gateways of New York and Boston, are not affected by my recent decision.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I should like to say a few words about Aer Lingus' current traffic performance and prospects. Traffic for the year ending 31 March 1983 continues to show the effect of the recession and, for the third year running, cross-channel air traffic is down compared to the previous year.  Continental traffic has shown a fall of some 1 per cent. In traffic terms, the Atlantic is the only bouyant sector, with Aer Lingus achieving a growth rate of 3 per cent in 1982. The year ahead is seen by Aer Lingus as another difficult one.  In financial terms, and taking account of the various measures to which I have referred during the course of this speech, the position is, however, somewhat more promising with Aer Lingus hopeful of reversing the loss-making results of recent years.</P>
    <P>The financial package which is now being put together was developed after an exhaustive analysis of various options by the review group to which I have referred already.  I recognise that the package still leaves the airline with a formidable task in endeavouring to return to profitability.  Such a return is vital, not only in terms of the next few years, but also so that the airline can begin to face the major question of fleet replacement in the latter half of the eighties.  I should like to add that I am grateful to the Opposition for their co-operation in the speedy passing of the legislation through the Dáil and I know the same co-operation <Col N="130" /> will be forthcoming in this House.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of Fianna Fáil I welcome the Bill which, as the Minister is aware, was being prepared when we were in Government.  Only a few changes have been made in it.  I welcome the Minister to the House and I am conscious that he is in charge of very important Departments.  He faces an onerous task and a great deal of responsibility rests on his shoulders.  I am sure he is already aware that he will have little time away from hard work.  Unlike some of his Cabinet colleagues the Minister has rightly attributed certain aspects of the Bill before the House to Fianna Fáil and I commend him for that.</P>
      <P>It is Fianna Fáil policy, as clearly outlined in <i>The Way Forward</i>, to demand from all semi-State organisations a commitment to viability in their operations. Nothing less should be expected from Aer Lingus.  The Minister is correct in saying that Aer Lingus deserve our compliments for the commendable way the company ran their business in the last 20 years.  It is worth noting that with the exception of four years the company were very successful throughout that period. That is a clear indication of the ability of the company.  In fact, certain matters would have helped the company to eliminate the black marks in the four unsuccessful years.  For example, when the company make a profit the Department of Finance, the initial investors, take it away in taxes and leave the company with very little money to spread around or invest.  When we are considering the viability of semi-State organisations in future we should bear that matter in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The North Atlantic route is the most precarious aspect of the company's operations and is causing most headaches. The Minister placed a lot of emphasis on the importance of tourism and told the <Col N="131" /> House that Bord Fáilte have set a target of 5 per cent growth in business from North America this year.  There is no doubt that such a growth would improve the position of Aer Lingus but it must be remembered that the target was set before the budget was introduced.  I am afraid that the expectation of a 5 per cent growth is an idle dream now.  The budget has done irreparable damage to the tourist industry and I have no doubt that all Members agree with that statement. Bord Fáilte's programme to increase traffic from North America will fall by the wayside because, as is accepted by most people, only a foolish person would come to Ireland for a holiday.  The increases imposed in the budget will harm the tourist industry.  Aer Lingus have built their hopes for the future on a 5 per cent growth in traffic and because it will not materialise the company, in a short time, will be returning to the Houses of the Oireachtas for more money.</P>
    <P>In this regard we should remember what happened to the national airline of Israel.  In the international inflation table we are second to Israel.  When the Israeli Government felt they could no longer afford to give money to the airline it folded up.  It would be regrettable if that happened here but if there is any such danger the Government must consider all the options including closing down the North Atlantic route.  We hope for a change of attitude by the Government in regard to the tourist industry, particularly in regard to those using the North Atlantic route.  It is right that that should be pointed out to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Some years ago I can recall a Minister telling a joke about British airlines and Aer Lingus at a time when Aer Lingus were very successful on the North Atlantic route.  It was said that the British airlines had remarked that the Aer Lingus planes appeared to be travelling very slowly across the Atlantic but the response from Aer Lingus was that their planes were fully loaded.  In those days Aer Lingus planes were full travelling in both directions.  We should learn something from that.  If the planes are not full we should change so that other products <Col N="132" /> can be taken to and from America.  In this regard the transport of mail should be taken into consideration.  Some arrangements could be made with the Department of Posts and Telegraphs with regard to cost.  I offer that as an example of possible change.  Certainly we must adapt and try very hard to make this North Atlantic route a viable one.  I am sure Aer Lingus have adopted such measures on European flights.  Possibly the Minister would suggest to Aer Lingus other aspects of the usage of flights which would make the company more viable.</P>
    <P>One could waffle on all day about this Bill but all one can do is accept the necessity for this Bill and wish Aer Lingus well in their efforts to make this route viable.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, the Minister for Transport and the Government in general might review the cost of coming to Ireland on holiday which is so extravagant that it needs urgent attention.  Tourism is vitally important to our national airline and our railways.  The responsibility for the projected downflows in tourism rests totally on the shoulders of the Government and I hope even at this late stage that they will change their attitude to it because without it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="133" /> That Seanad Éireann notes with concern the abuse by employers of the duties imposed on them by statute as evidenced, for example, by their failure to pay taxes already collected by them such as PAYE and VAT and the implications of this abuse for the national finances.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate you, Sir, on your election as Cathaoirleach.  This is the first opportunity I have had of doing so.  I wish you well and every co-operation in that role.  I also welcome the Minister for Finance to the House and wish him well in his new and very onerous position.</P>
    <P>In moving this motion I wish to say straight away that the payment of taxes and the maintenance of jobs are among the most important issues of public concern at present.  Both relate to the motion and both affect most people's lives.  At a time of economic difficulty, as we have at present, the last thing we need is the non-payment of taxes such as PAYE, PRSI and VAT.  Millions of pounds are collected by employers but regrettably not paid over on time to the Revenue Commissioners.  No matter how one looks at it, we are talking about very large sums of money and this has serious implications for the revenue side of the Government's finances.  Given the very high rates of VAT we have at present, let us take an example of a manufacturer of electrical goods with a turnover of £10 million.  The VAT element alone in that turnover is £3½ million, a very sizeable sum indeed.</P>
    <P>All too often nowadays we have company closures.  When a business gets into a tight financial situation, taxes like PAYE and VAT are among the first to go unpaid.  This non-payment of taxes can serve as a danger signal that there is trouble in that business, perhaps even a pending insolvency.  Vital jobs may be in jeopardy and the business with these tax arrears may owe debts to smaller enterprises. Too often nowadays we see smaller companies going to the wall because their accounts have not been paid by the larger companies they have <Col N="134" /> supplied.  This, of course, is compounding the problem of job losses.</P>
    <P>In some insolvencies the situation is really bad.  Not alone have some employees lost their jobs &mdash; and that is bad enough &mdash; but they also have, in some cases, lost their pension rights which had been deducted but had not been paid over to the appropriate funds.  So there is a problem, which for employees in particular is of the gravest proportions. This raises the question of what to do about it.</P>
    <P>In this connection I look forward to the contributions of other Senators and to the Minister's observations.  For my own part, the non-payment of these taxes like VAT and PAYE to the Revenue Commissioners should be tackled in a positive way rather than by using the big hammer of penalties alone in all cases. The reality is that there are companies providing valuable employment and adding value and wealth to the national economy.  In some of these same companies there are substantial arrears of PAYE and VAT due.  If the Revenue Commissioners are under strict instructions to impose penalties for late or non-payment than in many cases the cure could be worse than the actual disease. The consequence could be more company closures and therefore more job losses.  Having said that, however, I feel that the Revenue people would be doing a valuable service to companies that do not pay VAT and PAYE on time by insisting on prompt payment.  In so doing, they would be placing an onus on these companies to get to grips with their financial situation and to get their working capital requirements in order.  In so doing, they would be placing an onus on the offending business to find a loan elsewhere, such as from Fóir Teoranta to meet their working capital requirements.</P>
    <P>I would like to make an additional point here in relation to insolvencies.  I fail to see why Government taxes are regarded as preferential creditors in a winding up situation.  Employees, in particular, have in many cases invested a large part of their working lives in a business. There is a case certainly for examining the priority of preferential treatment <Col N="135" /> for them when a company is becoming insolvent.</P>
    <P>It is usually however &mdash; and in fairness to companies this should be said &mdash; in an attempt to keep a business afloat that PAYE, PRSI and such taxes are not paid on time.  But this raises the question of what actually causes business failure in the first instance?</P>
    <P>On both sides of the House we know that we are in the grip of a very severe international recession and external factors do, of course, militate against the prosperity of companies.  The point I want to make is that there are internal factors which are within the control of particular businesses.  Among those I would include efficient production, imaginative marketing and the development of good relationships between management and employees in the work place. I would like to say that I regard the lack of good working relationships between management and employees as one of the main causes of business failure.  There is an urgent need for more co-operation between management and employees involving an indentification by both sides with the fortunes of the enterprise and also a recognition by both sides that profit is essential for the success of all.  Too often, however, there is mistrust between management and employees in the work place, with each side going down its respective tunnel of self-interest: management mistrust employees and employees mistrust management.</P>
    <P>A business, however, is a shared venture and this should mean, but all too often does not mean shared decision-making and shared information.  On the question of information, there is an extreme reluctance by managements to sit down, disclose and discuss company information with their employees.  It is true that more work needs to be done on the presentation of meaningful information and also of course to prepare employees to treat such information in a confidential fashion.  However, employees for their part very often are the local experts in a work place.  They very often have a pool of knowledge, a pool of expertise about the workings of an organisation. <Col N="136" /> This is left untapped because management do not ask them for their views.  Furthermore, where a business has financial difficulties surely key stakeholders like employees should be among the first to know about it.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that the problem of the non-payment or late payment of PAYE and VAT could best be tackled by adopting a positive approach to it rather than by relying solely on harsh penalties. There are, of course, cases of gross abuse which certainly demand severe penalties. Take, for example, a person in business who recognises that his company is going into severe trouble and disposes of his assets in advance of the winding-up. When the creditors come to collect their debts there is little or nothing left.</P>
    <P>The more general problem however is that management do not acknowledge financial difficulties early enough.  This is a real managerial problem.  It was underlined by the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies, of which I was then a member, who examined the affairs of Fóir Teoranta.  In their evidence to the committee Fóir Teoranta representatives said, and I quote, &ldquo;the fact is we continue to receive requests at very short notice. The reasons for this would seem to be psychological; many businesses experiencing financial difficulties will go to endless trouble to conceal their plight from creditors, bankers and financial advisers in the expectation that things will come right.  The result very often is that irreparable damage has taken place before we come aware of the company's problems&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Clearly there is a compelling case for businesses to adopt preventive measures before things get out of hand.  I suggest to the Minister that by not pressing for prompt payment of PAYE and VAT the Revenue are in effect giving a loan towards working capital to businesses. This is inequitable.  It is not fair to the firms that pay up these taxes on time and it is particularly unfair to the employees who already have had these taxes deducted at source from their incomes.  I would hope that the practice by the Revenue of allowing employers to defer payment of PAYE and VAT would <Col N="137" /> stop.  Business needs working capital and some of the companies that do not pay up these debts are actually in need of loans for working capital.  If they can make a decent case for such loans, then they should go to Fóir Teoranta and not fund themselves from unpaid taxes.</P>
    <P>I would now like to turn briefly to the role of State enterprises and the contribution they can make to the rescue of operations of businesses in financial difficulty. Fóir Teoranta are an obvious one; the IDA have a very good rescue division; AnCO have a role to play, as have CTT and so on.  Now by acting in a coordinated fashion they could bring a speedy, concerted rescue package to a business in difficulty.  While each of these State agencies has a valuable contribution to make to rescue activity, there is a tendency for them to adhere to the narrow confines of their briefs and not act with enough co-ordination or speed when called upon for help.  Meanwhile valuable time is lost while the company is trying to survive and get on the path of profitability.</P>
    <P>The main theme in what I have said then is that prevention is a preferable and more desirable way to handle tax arrears than reliance on penalties alone.  The law, however, does have a role to play, particularly in relation to insolvent businesses. As the law stands at present, creditors cannot effectively take action against dishonest practices by directors and managers of insolvent businesses.  The law on insolvency is in need of review and certainly is in need of reform.  One of the more provocative spectacles we see in this respect is that of directors of companies which have become insolvent starting business again, perhaps the next day, under a different name.  Our company law as it stands now makes it an offence for any person knowingly to carry on business with intent to defraud.  The problem is that this offence cannot be proved.  It is impossible to prove it.  This is very disturbing, it seems to me, because it undermines confidence in the entire system.</P>
    <P>In this connection, the Cork Committee, chaired by Sir Kenneth Cork, has studied the law of insolvency in the UK. <Col N="138" /> It represents the first comprehensive study of insolvency law in the United Kingdom.  There is much in those proposals that we could usefully study.  The Cork Committee recommended the introduction of the offence of wrongful trading as a situation in which a person incurs debts without a reasonable prospect of being able to meet them.  I would like to summarise the main points that I wish to make.  When a business gets into financial difficulty taxes like PAYE and VAT are the first to go unpaid.  By not facing up to their financial difficulties on time many businesses are putting vital jobs in jeopardy and perhaps doing irreparable damage to companies for the future.  If a business needs working capital and can justify a case for a loan for that purpose, then it should seek a loan from Fóir Teoranta and not fund itself from unpaid taxes.  The lack of good working relationships between managements and employees is one of the main causes, in my view, of business failure. All too often management mistrusts employees and employees mistrust management.</P>
    <P>There is an extreme reluctance by managements to sit down, disclose and discuss company information and company affairs with their employees.  It seems to me that if employees were put on the alert about difficulties in a business, they could jointly with management contribute to ideas for improving the business.</P>
    <P>On the question of State-sponsored bodies, I have called for a more co-ordinated approach among State agencies that can make a direct contribution to the rescue of companies in trouble.  I am not advocating the establishment of another State-sponsored body for the purpose, but rather informal co-ordination by these bodies to tackle in a concerted fashion and promptly companies seeking help.  I made the point that the law of insolvency needs to be examined and reformed and that there is a lot of valuable work already done under the Cork Committee in the UK whose law is similar to our own, which could be studied with benefit here without engaging in elaborate exercises along the same lines.</P>
    <P>I would like to conclude by warmly <Col N="139" /> congratulating Senator Tras Honan on her election today as Leas-Chathaoirleach. I wish her every success in her position which I know she will discharge with commitment and courtesy.</P>

      <P>I share the concern expressed by Senator Hillery which prompted him to place this motion on the Order Paper.  While he dealt with the implications of this abuse for the national finances I regret that he did not include the implications of this abuse for the workers directly concerned.  I know that in the general body of his observations later he did touch on this subject, not always to my satisfaction, because both of us approach the concept of industrial relations &mdash; I do not call it a skill, technique or a profession &mdash; from extreme ends of the spectrum.  Senator Hillery approaches it from the halls of old ivy and I approach it from the hedgerows. While the State suffers substantially by a failure of companies that go into difficulties to meet their just statutory payments, I always have the feeling that the State is better able to sustain that type of pressure and that type of loss than the unfortunate workers who are the victims of this mismanagement which Senator Brian Hillery so eloquently dealt with.</P>
      <P>Not only is there a question of PAYE and VAT, but there is also the problem of PRSI.  A classic case in this area recently concerned Carrigaline Potteries where the owners of that enterprise, like the bedouins of old&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirwan</NameTxt>
      <P>A firm situated in the <Col N="140" /> geographic location of Carrigaline recently went out of business and the owners of that enterprise, like the bedouins of old, disappeared over the sand dunes and to the best of my knowledge have not yet been located.  The net effect of that exercise was that workers employed in that enterprise, near the location of Carrigaline, did not and were not entitled to avail of their statutory benefits.  One of the sad features of this exercise was that this problem developed as a result of the State ensuring that the implications of this abuse &mdash; as Senator Hillery described it &mdash; did not cost them any money.  To my knowledge the Revenue Commissioners moved in and had a liquidator appointed and the net effect of that was that while the State to some extent guaranteed its fiscal stability, the workers suffered immeasurably and to this day have not received that element of statutory benefit to which they are entitled.</P>
      <P>There is an obligation to introduce some sort of mechanism to enable people employed in any enterprise to be certain and confident that statutory deductions from pay are transmitted to the appropriate statutory body.  Whether this can be done speedily or in the course of time I do not know.  I am aware that while Senator Hillery expresses concern about this problem, it was a problem when his administration were in power and indeed it was a problem when previous administrations were in power and nothing was done about it.  I can tell him, and it may be of interest to this august House, that my organisation are taking the necessary steps to ensure that it does not happen again in respect of its membership.  We have advised our members to go to their employers at determined periods and demand from these employers substantial evidence to the effect that statutory payments have been made.  If they cannot get this type of evidence then that experience which I have gleaned on the hedgerows and not in the halls of old ivy will be brought in as a defensive mechanism and will click merrily into gear for quite some considerable time, with all of the after effects that that type of action calls for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="141" /> That is what we propose to do, but I would be less than honest if I did not say that there is an obligation on the appropriate Minister to ensure that hardships such as have been described by Senator Hillery and myself do not occur.  If the debt is owing then that debt has to be paid.  People who are trapped within the fiscal arrangements of the State through the medium of PAYE and PRSI must pay.  Some means will have to be found to ensure that employers who have an obligation to meet statutory payments in respect of their workers are also trapped within the fiscal arrangements of the State.  If this motion on the Order Paper does nothing other than focus maximum attention on those in positions of responsibility who have an obligation to see that this difficulty is eliminated and if we have achieved that here today, then I will go home happy.</P>
    <P>As a new Member who was not here when she was Cathaoirleach, I would like to add to the many congratulations which have been extended to Senator Tras Honan on her election today as Leas-Chathaoirleach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to be associated with the compliments and the congratulations to Senator Tras Honan on her appointment as Leas-Chathaoirleach. I also congratulate the previous speaker on his recent election to a very high office in his union.</P>
      <P>I would agree with much that was said by the previous speaker.  I feel he is correct in saying that the failure by companies to pay moneys owed to the State is literally stealing.  It is the lowest form of stealing there is.  This money is deductible by law each week from the already overburdened and overtaxed PAYE payer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and the Government have a difficult task ahead of them.  Senator Kirwan pointed out that there was the case in Cork recently concerning a reputable company.  We had in the past far more serious cases than that, and the one that comes to my mind was the first. It happened in County Leitrim and the McCartin group of companies left the State with a burden of approximately £1.3 million in moneys due in PAYE and <Col N="142" /> PRSI.  When that company were wound up the Government let that matter slip.</P>
    <P>The Minister is in a most precarious position because no matter which company is involved in future in non-payment they will use that as an example of what the previous Coalition Government did when they were in power in that particular instance.  To add injury to insult, recently a Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas made a statement in a newspaper that the companies would be right to utilise that money and not pay it to the State.  That person is a member of a Government party and I am amazed that he is still a member of that party.</P>
    <P>It places an onerous task on the Minister for Finance to try to make an effort to bring in legislation to correct this.  We should be really talking about the rules of common etiquette, the rules of normal living, whether a person who collects money on behalf of another person pays the debt.  It is as simple as that.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has my sympathy. For many other reasons he must be the most popular, or unpopular man throughout the country.  The example has been set within his parliamentary party, by a Member supporting the Government, in the public pronouncements made by that member in the national press recently.  He is a Fine Gael Member of the European Parliament, no less.  It certainly behoves the Leader of the Government, the Taoiseach, to show some leadership in how normal discipline should be applied within his party.</P>
    <P>I do not blame many of the smaller companies who find themselves in difficulty after watching that episode.  I look forward to the Minister's explanation today, to me and to the nation, of that performance.</P>
    <P>We offer him a beautiful opportunity to explain to us precisely how he proposes in the future to eliminate this problem. My belief is that a person who collects money on behalf of another person or body and does not pay it is doing something worse than stealing.  We saw the workers in the Carrigaline district in great difficulty when they applied for what they were entitled to.  They had actually paid <Col N="143" /> their PAYE tax and PRSI out of every week's wage packet.</P>
    <P>Where does the Minister start?  If he starts from today the example of the past will be used.  The Minister has to go back and clear the air regarding what has passed before he begins to apply new rules for the future.  That is of great importance to this House and to the nation.  I look forward to the Minister making his comment on that line.  It is terrible to think that a private company could walk away with £1.3 million of State funds paid by workers and members of that company.  It demands an explanation. It was with that in mind that I put my name to this motion with Senator Hillery.  The lapse is in the past tense.  An explanation will clarify the matter.</P>
    <P>As regards VAT, which is also mentioned in the motion, it has almost come to the stage now when VAT is paid and there is very little room for escaping it if the VAT inspectors call to see you.  That system does not seem to be as important as the PRSI and the PAYE aspects because it is done on a monthly basis. When it is not returned you are questioned as to why, and the repayments have to be made.  The system is clarified from that point of view although there may be people caught for peculiar circumstances. It is not as open to as much abuse as the other is.  That is why I felt it deserved a mention, but probably more from the point of view of explanation.  I do not see many loopholes in it.  There may be efforts made now and again to dock an issue but it is such an entwined system that you get yourself choked up if you are operating the system illegally. The VAT returns are straightforward. VAT is paid quicker.  This is because it involves repayments in most part.</P>
    <P>I concur completely with Senator Hillery on what he has said.  I do not blame the trade union movement for now drawing up rules and insisting on receipts from those who collect those taxes.  These are to be viewed at certain times.  It is about time that was done.  That will not solve the problem because there may be some companies who are not unionised and who may not have that facility to check.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="144" /> For that reason the Minister must now, for the protection of those workers who have paid their bills, ensure that that money is paid and that accounts are settled.  I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say on this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>May I join with your colleagues, first of all, in congratulating you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, on your election to office this afternoon? I wish you a long career.</P>
      <P>I am very pleased that the House has given me the opportunity to reply to this motion today.  It is a subject which is causing a great deal of concern and it is also a subject on which there is a certain amount of less than well informed comment. I do not propose to go into individual cases.  I do not even propose to follow the euphimistic circumlocutions of Senator Killilea in going into particular cases.  That would not be right in relation to the firms concerned.  The problem is a very substantial one.  We must all be concerned about it not only from the point of view of the efficiency of the collection of our taxes, although that must be a major concern, but also from the point of view of the more general approach within our community to the payment of taxes, which indeed is another problem of wider scope than the matter of this motion.  I am bound to say that some of the misunderstandings in relation to this problem have seemed to gain currency rather rapidly in recent weeks.  If I might just instance one or two of them which Senator Hillery raised it will illustrate the size of the problem.</P>
      <P>Senator Hillery said that it was necessary to stop the practice of allowing businesses to defer payment, to take unsanctioned loans of working capital from the State.  I want to make it quite clear that there is no practice of allowing businesses to defer payments of taxes.  I will expand on that a little more.  There are cases where this happens by arrangement, but there is no practice of allowing firms to defer making payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to add, before coming to the body of the motion, a remark or two about another point made by Senator Hillery.  Again, it is in a different context, <Col N="145" /> but since he has brought it into this motion we should, perhaps, look at it very briefly.  He suggested that certain State agencies are interpreting their particular role too narrowly, that Fóir Teoranta and the IDA interpret their role too narrowly and, perhaps, lose time in coming to the aid of firms.  There is a wider discussion there and, indeed, a very important one for our industrial development.  To make the point that State agencies are losing time in coming to the assistance of companies is rather beside the main problem.  The difficulty is, as the Senator pointed out during the course of his remarks, that a number of companies lose time in approaching the State agencies.  It is difficult for any State agency, the IDA or Fóir Teoranta, to spark off to come to the rescue of a firm unless the firm has brought the problem to that agency's attention.</P>
    <P>I would like to say very firmly that the practice of deliberately withholding taxes due, in any circumstances, is an abuse which I condemn without any hesitation. We are all aware that in some cases firms hold on to moneys in order to keep the business going for a period.  There are cases also where firms have been able to raise insufficient money to pay the net wages of their employees.  In those circumstances they have withheld the payment of taxes collected in order to improve the cash flow and to keep the business going at the level which is desired.  They do not, in fact, simply withhold tax due to the Revenue, but they thereby create a debt to the Revenue which proves very difficult to recover.  I would not approve of either of these practices but we must recognise that these are some of the consequences of the most serious recession that has hit this country for the past 50 years.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of publicity in recent times about a few individual cases where firms have gone out of business leaving due and unpaid large amounts of tax which have accumulated over an extended period.  Questions are asked as to how this can happen.  As I have said, I do not intend to go into individual cases, but I would like to set the problem in its real perspective, see what is actually happening <Col N="146" /> and suggest what courses of action might be open to us in future to ensure that employers and traders pay their due taxes.</P>
    <P>It is a complex issue and it is very easy to assume that all of the problems are uniform and general.  It is also unfortunate that a lot of concern about this issue has led to the problem being fairly widely misrepresented in some recent reports. That has led in turn to a tendency to agitate for particular solutions, without first studying what the true nature and extent of the problem is.</P>
    <P>There is a real problem in that PAYE and PRSI contributions and value-added tax remain in the hands of traders and employers long after the sums should have been paid to the Revenue.  We all know that there are those who exploit limited liability so as to cheat their creditors and the Exchequer, and that they can go on creating further damage to the business they engage in and to the community as a whole.  I would make the remark that when times are good and revenue is buoyant the tendency seems to be to approve, without questioning, those who seem to have achieved success in their particular fields.  On the other hand, in difficult times, we must be careful not to change our emotional attitudes and swing too far the other way and rush into condemning the entire business world because of the conduct of a few who default in their responsibilities.  That is what I have in mind when I say that I want to put the problem into its context.</P>
    <P>This year the Revenue Commissioners will collect about £5,000 million in taxes and PRSI contributions.  Value-added tax and PAYE are the major segments of the total yield.  These are collected and paid over by traders and employers.  In the current year we expect value-added tax to yield £1,000 million and PAYE to yield over £1,500 million.  A further £990 million will come in for PRSI health contributions and income levies through the PAYE system.  The duty to remit these taxes is imposed by statute but the entire basis of our collection system depends on there being a high level of compliance and the minimum tolerable degree of inspection and policing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="147" /> No system will work if statutory sanctions and legal proceedings have to be taken in the case of virtually every taxpayer. Compliance must continue to be the accepted norm.  It is important that public opinion and attitudes should emphasise this.  It can be said that the system worked reasonably well for about ten years in the case of value-added tax and for some 20 years for PAYE.  There was always some difficulty about non-compliance. I am bound to make the point now that the difficulties we are discussing did not start today or yesterday. I suppose when tax revenue was buoyant the default was generally not very significant and was relatively manageable. Inflation and higher tax rates all round have dramatically increased the amounts of money coming through the system. Coinciding with the recession and other difficulties there has been a slowing down in compliance and a growth in the sums remaining unpaid.</P>
    <P>To illustrate the size of the collection operation, I will just point out a few figures.  Each month the Revenue Commissioners process some 50,000 PAYE and PRSI payments from employers. Every two months there are up to 40,000 VAT payments due and a further 20,000 claims for a refund.  While there has been great emphasis on the amounts of tax outstanding and criticisms of the collection procedure, these form only a part of the Revenue staff's work.  They have other responsibilities and other functions to carry out such as the making of tax assessments, the bringing of cases to appeal, the preparation of the Finance Bill legislation and the preparation of material for replies to parliamentary questions.  We are all very conscious of the fact that tax matters are very frequently the subject of parliamentary questions.  There is also a great deal of work in relation to customs and excise, capital taxation and other areas of taxation.</P>
    <P>In respect of collection work significant progress has been made in recent years in automating the collection arrangements, which are now largely computer based.  The corollary, however, is that if <Col N="148" /> an individual employer decides or feels compelled to defer or to reduce his tax payments the likelihood is that he will escape detection for a period.  Whether this is short or long depends upon the degree to which he appears to be defaulting.</P>
    <P>In order to make it more difficult to escape detection I am looking now at ways and means of improving the automated collection arrangements operated by Revenue so that default will be detected more rapidly and more accurately. The only way to ensure absolutely that delays or defaults do not happen will be increase dramatically the Revenue staff on inspection and collection work and to enforce payment of arrears quickly and ruthlessly.  It is doubtful if, in any democracy, such a rigid and ruthless system would be acceptable, since it would have to apply to the good taypayer, the one who pays fairly quickly but after the precise deadline, and the defaulting taxpayer. There would be no merit in stepping up inspection unless this is followed through by effective and inescapable enforcement.  The consequence of such increased surveillance and enforcement would be that firms going through a temporary period of difficulty could not expect any period of grace.</P>
    <P>I was encouraged to hear Senator Hillery in his opening remarks say that we should proceed not by means of the rigid application of penalties but that we should adopt a more constructive approach to the problem.  I will be pointing out to what extent the approach is, and indeed has been for some time, constructive and how we hope to make it a little bit more constructive in the future, while safeguarding the integrity of the collection system.</P>
    <P>Various figures have been mentioned about the total amount of tax uncollected. The media have frequently used the figure of £1,200 million.  This figure, I would emphasise, is an accounting figure and is taken from the Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the Appropriate Accounts for 1981.  I ask Members of the House to consider very carefully what I am about to say in order that we may grasp the true extent of the <Col N="149" /> problem.  The figure is not an amount of tax which is ripe for collection and being left there uncollected.  It is a balance flowing from an accumulation of assessments which are almost entirely estimated assessments.  More than £700 million, that is well over half of the total, is already under appeal or inquiry.  It is in a collection system being processed, indeed, in a way which in many cases responds to Senator Hillery's call for a constructive approach to the problem. That accounts for over half of this figure of £1,200 million which has gained currency in recent weeks.</P>
    <P>This leaves a balance of less than £500 million which appears to be for collection but which ultimately might prove not to be collectable, at least in the short-term. This is because, first of all, in many cases there will be claims for the admission of late appeals; secondly a large amount of tax is already subject to instalment arrangements; and thirdly, in a number of cases the persons assessed are in financial difficulties and are liable to go out of business leaving the tax unpaid.  I want to make it clear that I am not playing down the extent of our collection problem, which is serious, but I want to get the figures straight so that we will be talking about the real problem that is there and not a mythical, inflated problem which is the one which seems to have gained popular acceptance by the uncritical and undistinguishing mention of that overall figure.</P>
    <P>I also ask Members to accept the figures of outstanding tax or what appears to be outstanding tax covering all the years up to 1981 in the context of a collection figure of more than £1,200 million collected over the last six years.  I have been quoted on a few occasions recently as having said that &ldquo;there is no crock of gold out there&rdquo;.  It is important that we all realise this.  If there were such a crock of gold I can assure the House that I would be the first person to want to get my hands on it.</P>
    <P>I might illustrate this by reference to what has happened to that £1,200 million figure arising from the Comptroller and Auditor General's report of July 1982. By the end of last year that figure had <Col N="150" /> dropped to £960 million, a reduction of £240 million.  Of that £240 million over 90 per cent was discharged as not being properly due and less than 10 per cent was brought into the Exchequer.  This proves that there is no crock of gold out there.  It illustrates also one particular aspect of the figure outstanding, which is the fact that a great deal of it is accounted for by estimated assessments.</P>
    <P>The problem is that, for a variety of reasons, the collection of this money, or indeed the portion of it which will ultimately prove to be due or collectible, is a long drawn out process.  A large part of it will be the subject of claims for late appeals, as is allowed for under our existing legislation.  Unfortunately, there is no time limit on this, and in some cases the firm or individual owing tax will not have the money and will be unable to pay. Others who are going through a difficult period will have been given an instalment arrangement and collection will be spread over a couple of years.  I am sure that Members will agree that it is reasonable to allow such arrangements in cases like this.</P>
    <P>Even in those cases where enforcement action is initiated there are problems. There is a backlog of work in enforcement which seriously delays collection but I must say that it is not simply a question of staff.  Increasing staff numbers in the Office of the Revenue Commissioners will not of itself bring about a large decrease in these arrear figures.  The situation is more complex than that and calls for a different approach.  We must look not only at the fundamental rules governing the collection of tax, but also at the law in relation to appeals and other factors.  We must consider the basic community attitudes to tax generally, to evasion of tax, the avoidance of tax and to unreasonable delays in the payment of tax.  As long as these practices are perceived by the community at large as being somewhat less than a crime against the community it will be difficult to make progress in this area.</P>
    <P>As I said a few minutes ago, efficiency in tax collection depends to a very large degree on compliance on the part of taxpayers. I would add also that in looking <Col N="151" /> at the reasons for delays in tax collections, we should have some regard to the reasons why the law is as it is with such defects as we may believe it to have at the moment.  Essentially, there are concerns in the present state of law put there by our legislators to ensure that taxpayers who believe that they are being over-assessed, too rapidly assessed or wrongly assessed have a means of appealing against that.  The fact that the appeal procedure may be abused is not in itself an argument against having an appeal procedure in the first place.  That is an aspect of the present discussion which does not get enough publicity but which is very important in the case of individuals or firms &mdash; we all know them &mdash; who believe quite sincerely that the assessments made on them for tax do not properly reflect the liability which they believe they have under existing legislation. There must be in our system a means under which such firms or individuals can have redress or can have a discussion and can establish what their true liability is both to their satisfaction and to the Revenue Commissioners' satisfaction without the scales having been loaded against them from the very beginning.</P>
    <P>I have been talking about the collection of tax generally.  The subject matter of this particular motion is the retention of taxes due by employers.  This is part of the overall collection problem.  There has been a considerable amount of criticism of the behaviour of employers in withholding this tax and the Revenue Commissioners have been criticised for permitting businesses to hold on to Revenue moneys, thereby financing themselves out of moneys properly due to the Exchequer.  The point has also been made in some quarters that it would be in everybody's interests if the Commissioners moved more quickly and brought these businesses to the brink so as to force them to seek professional help at an earlier stage.</P>
    <P>The practice of withholding moneys due to the State is unacceptable.  In a period of recession it has become more widespread as firms in difficulties have <Col N="152" /> sought every possible means to ensure a cash flow to maintain their business.  In some instances, at least, this action simply postpones the day of reckoning and may well have the ill-effect of delaying an approach for a proper rescue operation. This aspect has been exaggerated, and the claim that such rigorous and ruthless action by the Revenue would result in new life being infused into the company is a claim which has not been put to the test.  Secondly, the impression has been given both in public debate in recent weeks and in this House this afternoon that workers lose their social welfare entitlements if employers fail to make proper returns to Revenue.  This is just not true.  The impression has been created also that virtually every other firm in the country that has run into difficulties in recent years have resorted to the practice of withholding tax.  Again, this is not true, although that misconception may arise from the widespread publicity given to a few situations where it has emerged that very large amounts were owing to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>A few figures will help to put the situation into its proper perspective.  An examination was carried out of the firms which went into liquidation or receivership in the period November 1981 to April 1982.  These numbered 286, of which 276 were liquidations and 10 were receiverships.  Of the 286 cases, 103 were not registered for PAYE-PRSI and VAT, being mainly investment companies. Of the remaining 193, 167 were registered for PAYE of which 41 had no outstanding liability at the date of liquidation and 154 were registered for VAT of which 85 had no liability.</P>
    <P>Of the 126 PAYE cases with liability, 14 involving £835,000 were under individual control at the date of liquidation and 112 involving £860,000 were subject to automatic processing.  Individual control refers to instalment arrangements or negotiations under way with the Revenue Commissioners or individual referral for enforcement.  Of the 69 VAT cases which had liability, the corresponding figures were five under individual control involving £595,000 and 64 subject to automatic processing involving £1,100,000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="153" /> These figures will show that the general situation is by no means as bad as some presentations would have us believe.  This should not, however, diminish our determination to defeat this problem.</P>
    <P>It has been said that enforcement would be more effective if the preferential status accorded to taxes due to the Revenue Commissioners were repealed, the suggestion being that Revenue's preferential status leads to a certain laxity rather than a determination to go out and pursue the collection of outstanding tax. This allegation is totally untrue.  Indeed, those who have had occasion to come into direct contact with the Revenue about payment of their taxes are unlikely to subscribe to this view.  The allegation is based in the first place on the false assumption that all tax is protected by preferential status.  That is not so, and where a company are forced into liquidation, Revenue have to take their place with the unsecured creditors in respect of their non-preferential tax.  In these cases, the Revenue are also at a loss.  It is therefore wrong to suggest that the Revenue Commissioners are neglectful in carrying out their statutory responsibilities, or that they sit back, resting on a preferential status which is only partial.  I can state categorically that preferential status is not a factor in determining the Revenue Commissioners' approach to the collection of tax.</P>
    <P>The calls from some commentators for drastic action by the Revenue Commissioners remind me of the man in the Gospel who caught his fellow servant by the throat and cried &ldquo;Pay what thou owest&rdquo;. The reply was &ldquo;Give me time and I will pay thee all&rdquo;.  It is true that Revenue have entered into arrangements in particular cases whereby outstanding tax is to be paid in instalments on an agreed basis. Where this is done, however, there is insistence on current taxes being paid as they fall due.  Such arrangements have been made frequently, and some have received considerable publicity.  The arrangements have been entered into where the money was just not there, the alternative being imminent closure of the firm in question or redundancies.  If the money was not available at that time but <Col N="154" /> there were plans to make the company viable, it is difficult to say that the Revenue Commissioners should have rejected this approach and closed down the company immediately.  Instalment arrangements are not attractive to the Revenue Commissioners and they do not like entering into them, but there are times when it may be the only rational approach in the circumstances where a firm are unable to pay, but have a possibility of being brought back to viability. We must leave it to the Revenue Commissioners to decide in what cases and in what circumstances they will give time to pay the debt.</P>
    <P>This type of arrangement is probably one of those which Senator Hillery had in mind when he was calling for a more constructive approach to the problem of collecting arrears and it is one which our legislators and our administrators in their wisdom have retained within the system. Some commentators have suggested that Revenue should operate an early-warning mechanism whereby the rescue agencies would be alerted in good time to a company running into difficulties.  This suggestion overlooks the obligations as to confidentiality which are imposed on the Revenue, again for very good reasons with which we would all agree.  Secondly, it is not the function of the Revenue to counsel businesses as to when they should seek help from rescue agencies or to call in those agencies.  The Revenue function is to collect tax, not to spark off the rescue process referred to earlier by Senator Hillery.</P>
    <P>The publicity which this particular issue has received is one which as a community we should try to turn to good advantage.  It is an abuse for employers to withhold taxes, and this practice must cease.  The Revenue Commissioners will be far from lenient with firms who resort to this practice.  I hope that my contribution to this discussion will put this problem into proper perspective and allay fears that it has reached almost epidemic proportions.  This is by no means the case.  The fact is that the vast majority of employers in this country remit their taxes, if not immediately, fairly shortly afterwards, so we are not <Col N="155" /> dealing with a widespread problem, the result of which is to deprive workers of their rights in the event of a firm closing down.</P>
    <P>It is disappointing that the hard core of outstanding taxes &mdash; which is a small proportion of the figures quoted &mdash; is not amenable to immediate collection.  I should say, however, that out of these arrears, the Revenue have been collecting about £20 million a year, a figure which we hope to bring this year to £30 million.  With a streamlining of procedures, it is intended to make a much bigger impact in coming years.  The growth in arrears must be arrested.  While I have listed various barriers to improved collection, this does not mean that we are accepting the <i>status quo.</i>  I expect to see further improvements at an early date.  A more selective approach to enforcement has been introduced and this is already showing results.  I announced in the budget a tightening of the appeals system designed to speed up this long drawn out process of finalising liability.  This will help, but more remains to be done and I will be looking at further measures which might be brought in.  If the abuse of withholding tax is not discontinued, we may have to look at the possibility of attaching to company directors liability for PAYE-PRSI and VAT not paid over by their companies and which those directors know have not been paid.  I appreciate that such a step brings into question the concept of limited liability and could raise some legal problems, but these may have to be faced if we can find no other satisfactory solution to a problem which, it is clear, the general body of taxpayers are not prepared to tolerate.  In that connection &mdash; Senator Hillary mentioned that same approach &mdash; we should be conscious of the fact that it would be a fairly substantial change in our approach to limited liability and one into which we should enter with a very clear knowledge of what we are doing and of what the consequences would be.  If the practice of withholding these taxes continues we may have to consider going that far.  I wish to make that point very clear so that those people who are involved in that <Col N="156" /> abuse will be very conscious of the risks they are running for their own businesses in, perhaps, bringing us to the point when we would have to make a fundamental change in a part of our business which has a very important function to play even though its origins may have been some time in the past.  Such a change may be the price of continued abuse of the system by a small number of individuals.</P>
    <P>I should like to add one or two remarks about the basic approach to this problem. I mentioned the fact that the efficiency of the collection of any tax depends on compliance by the taxpayer.  It would be almost impossible to operate a system which required the application of statutory powers and the exercise of inspection in relation to each individual taxpayer.  While statutory provision and the administration of the law can obviously do a great deal, and I hope will do more, to ensure compliance, the fact remains that we must rely on the taxpayer's sense of involvement in and responsibility with the community to make the system work with proper efficiency. There is no substitute for a belief by taxpayers that they should pay their taxes as part of their duty to the community. It may sound platitudinous to say this, but it is a problem which is probably more acute in times of depression.  But in times of depression and economic difficulty it is even more important for the State to be in a position to be sure that it is going to collect the revenues which are due to it on behalf of the community. Until we get to the point where we have a wider and keener &mdash; I do not say more enthusiastic &mdash; approach by taxpayers to paying their taxes, in spite of whatever measures we may take we will have a problem in relation to the collection of taxes.  We, as legislators, have a duty not only to look at the legislative requirements of this problem but to look also at our own role in forming the attitude of the public in general and of taxpayers in particular to the payment and collection of taxes.</P>
    <P>I conclude by saying that I have been trying, during the course of these remarks, to put the problem into its <Col N="157" /> proper perspective, and I hope that when we have seen what the real extent of the problem is, we will then be able to measure more accurately the size of the response which we must make to it.  We have announced a number of measures in this year's financial statement aimed at dealing with this problem, and I would hope that this, plus the fact that other changes of a fundamental nature may be required if compliance is not improved, would bring those involved in this abuse to a realisation of the size and seriousness of the abuse and that we would then be able, both from the point of view of public attitudes and from the point of view of our legislative and administrative equipment, to reduce this problem to a fraction of what it is today.</P>

      <P>We are indebted to those Members who have put this motion before the House for consideration.  As a number of Senators have remarked, and has been confirmed by the Minister, this problem has reached a degree of public awareness in the last few months which makes its discussion at this stage relevant to what is being talked about by the ordinary people of Ireland.  It enables us to afford the Minister an opportunity of putting on record the point of view of both himself and the Revenue Commissioners in this regard.  It was with considerable anticipation that I looked forward to the contribution of Senator Hillery. The motion was quite clearly to condemn the employers who failed in the duties which are outlined in that motion.  I looked forward to the manner in which he proposed to tackle the implications of giving practical application to that abuse. It is fair to say that we are all very strong on abusing the matter in general but we <Col N="158" /> might not stand up to such careful scrutiny when being examined in the particular. In that regard I was disappointed with the way in which Senator Hillery proposed to tackle the problem.</P>
      <P>This situation arises because companies are starved of finance.  A company can be starved of finance for many reasons.  It may be that through no fault of the workers, the company are running into hard times because of that being the way the market is going for the particular product in which they deal.  They can alternatively be in that situation because of an abuse of their position by the participators in the company or by the workers.  Obviously the emotional attitude we would have to the people who find themselves in this position would vary significantly depending on how the company arrive at the position in which they find themselves.  As practising politicians, when faced with the closure of an industry in one's own constituency or in one's one area, the practical considerations which force their attention on one might from time to time bring about an attitude of mind which is totally in contradiction with the spirit of the motion which is before the House.  There is no one problem but a large number of problems, and because there is not one problem there is not one solution.  We might condemn a company who find themselves short of cash but whose participators and operators are living a lifestyle which is not compatible with the level of the earnings of the company.  In that situation a decision by the Revenue Commissioners to apply the full rigours of the law would be politically acceptable and welcome. The inevitable consequences of that situation would have to be accepted as right and proper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a situation where a company, through no fault of their own, find themselves temporarily short of money and if the employer at the end of the week finds he can do one of two things &mdash; pay next week's wages or return the VAT and PAYE &mdash; his position is a lot more difficult. Here is the nub of the problem: have we as legislators the political will to put into effect the sentiments which are contained in this motion?  I do not see any <Col N="159" /> evidence that we have that political will. Our whole concentration on this aspect of our finances is in itself a fudging of the issue.  It is a refusal by elected representatives to take seriously the grave problems which exist in our public finances. Instead of being willing to tackle the real problems by real sacrifices, we are willing to divert the attention to this side issue and side show, and for that real reason I welcome the Minister's speech which put into perspective the kind of figures that we have been hearing of in respect of tax arrears.</P>
    <P>I know from personal experience in a previous occupation that because the Revenue Commissioners consider that tax is now due that is very different from the tax actually being due and payable at some time in the future.  The Minister quite rightly points out that a very large proportion of the £1,200 million would be under appeal.  Some of it would be due and would be paid in due course, and if it was improperly appealed, if the rules are being properly applied, penalty interest would be applied by the Revenue Commissioners in respect of that improper appeal.  In respect of the portion that is under appeal it is either legitimately under appeal and should not be counted as part of the £1,200 million at all or it is not legitimately under appeal, in which case not only would it fall due to be paid itself but a penalty rate of interest will fall to be paid by reason of the fact that it was improperly appealed. In those circumstances, in considering what the outstanding taxes are, we must eliminate from consideration virtually all that amount of money which is under appeal.  The penalty rates of interest are very severe.  Not only are they quite high by ordinary standards &mdash; I am a little out of touch but I suspect about 1½ per cent per month of 18 per cent per annum &mdash; but, significantly, they are not allowed as a deduction for tax purposes in the following year, so that the 18 per cent which you are charged for delaying the payment of tax is the equivalent of twice that amount in ordinary interest terms.  The penalties for wrongly appealing tax are quite severe.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="160" /> In addition to that, the balance of £500 million can arrive in a variety of ways. No doubt some of it is arrears, in the real sense of that word, and all those arrears should and must be paid, but to think that the collection of this tax is going to solve the problems of the country is oversimplifying the extent of our financial problems and diverting attention from the very real problems we have to face in the years ahead.  That is the danger of putting all our emphasis on the question of tax arrears.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister, if he has not the opportunity to clarify the position here today, to investigate the question of whether the employees of companies who default on their payments should suffer a diminution of their social welfare entitlements.  This is not an area in which I am expert but I do know that they should not suffer in this way because it is not their responsibility to collect the tax. It is not their responsibility to see that the tax has been paid.  It is important that the Minister should clarify this because the feeling is abroad in many different kinds of activities that the workers who work in a firm like the firm in County Cork that was not mentioned here today are placed at a disadvantage.  I do not know whether that is right or wrong, and if the Minister cannot answer it here today he should fully investigate the matter and issue a public statement to ease the disquiet that I know is growing over items such as that.  If the workers of the country know that they need not fear the consequences of a default by their employer their concern can be the same as everyone else concerned, the concern that a defaulting employer damages the general interest of the country rather than the specific interest of the employees.</P>
    <P>When times are tough and a private company are going through a difficult period how often have we heard the argument that it is much cheaper to keep people at work than to pay them the dole?  Very convincing arguments are put forward at the time of the imminent closure of any industry.  The consequence of reliance on an argument like that is that it provides a justification for an employer <Col N="161" /> who says: &ldquo;At least by keeping the firm open for a while longer I am keeping 20, 30 or 40 men off the dole&rdquo; and the general view is that that is better than putting them on the dole.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons for the Revenue Commissioners being selective in the way they tighten up but nevertheless may be, considerate in certain cases, is that very often the lifestyle of an employer is not consistent with the relative lack of prosperity in his firm.  In those circumstances, it is reasonable for the Revenue Commissioners to apply the full rigours of the law.</P>
    <P>In my experience of dealing with the Revenue Commissioners, which is considerable enough, I must say that by and large they are both humanitarian and sensible in their approach.  I do not deal with them now but I have never had the experience of putting a request to them that was based on reasonable logic and having it refused.  They have always refused requests which I or other people might have made but which were not deserving of support and consideration. The way in which the Revenue Commissioners discharge their responsibility in this regard is sensible.  They go a long way towards striking the balance that all sides agree is important in ensuring that precipitate action on the one hand does not close firms too readily and, on the other hand, that delay does not cause untold losses for the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>I was very interested in what Senator Hillery said with regard to the law of bankruptcy, and I would add a change in law of receivership, because company law is based on the law of bankruptcy, and it is all tied up in the same Gordian knot.  The Minister's comments with regard to preferential treatment are obviously valid, but they do not fully deal with the problem and it is something which we should carefully consider.  As far as the Fine Gael side of the House are concerned, we support this motion.  We think the abuse by employers should be noted with concern, and for that reason we will be supporting the motion when it comes to be put.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first occasion I have had the honour to speak in this House.  May I congratulate you on your election as Cathaoirleach and wish you well.  I would like to place my comments regarding this motion on record.  I agree entirely with the motion and with the spirit of the motion.  We are concerned about the deliberate or convenient abuse by employers with regard to their statutory obligations of payments of PAYE, VAT, employment levy, income tax, impositions by local authorities and as rates, water rates and other changes that would be coming on stream.  It is very unfair to the ordinary worker, the taxpayer and the ordinary businessman who pays his fair share of tax &mdash; and sometimes his unfair share of tax as seen by him &mdash; who knows in his heart and soul that there are people in his locality who deliberately evade the payment of their tax, be it PAYE, VAT or otherwise.</P>
      <P>I would like to place on record my views of the problems that exist in certain areas, especially business areas.  I would like this House to take special note of the plight of the family business that had existed over many years.  Take the family grocer, the family publican, the hardware shop, the electrical shop, or the small industrialist who saved his money and had the willpower and the guts to develop a small industry and give employment to local people.  What happened?  Businesses could be put in two categories. First there is the old type businessman, the family grocer, whose only knowledge of bookkeeping was to enter in his book a few groceries a local person had not the money to pay for.  Then there is the firm that is properly administered.  They have a staff, a secretarial assistant and proper records are kept.  The family businessman has not moved with the times.  To him bookkeeping is abhorrent, something he knows little about.  To keep up with the times the small family grocer had to improve his premises, probably by borrowing money from banks and other institutions, to compete with the bigger type supermarkets who import most of the produce they sell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The garage proprietor has been hit in <Col N="163" /> many ways.  His business has fallen flat. The garage business at the present time is in what I call the black economy, where people drawing unemployment assistance, work in the back streets.  The family publican is almost non-existent due to cross-Border trade &mdash; the black economy again, smuggled goods, spirits, etc.  We must remember that approximately 65 per cent of the publican's turnover is revenue for the Government.  Since the beginning of the year, the turnover of most publicans has dropped by almost £1,000 per week.  To compete with modern trends, these people improved their premises through loans from banks and other institutions in the late seventies and early eighties, and at interest rates of approximately 20-25 per cent.</P>
    <P>When we look at this motion we would be wrong to condemn everybody who does not pay tax or who does not keep up to date with his tax payments as a person who deliberately sets out to evade the tax for which he is liable.  These people are caught up in a net where their business is failing, their capacity to improve their businesses is curtailed or has come to a halt, and because of falling returns and pressures to meet their repayments in order to hold on to the business, they gradually fall back in their duty to the State.  I agree wholeheartedly that our first duty is to the State, to pay our taxes, but these people, through no fault of their own, are caught up in this net. We should have a human approach to the smaller businessman.  I am not referring to the big, get-rich merchant who sets up a business, owes hundreds of thousands of pounds &mdash; and it has happened in this city &mdash; to the Revenue Commissioners, folds up and then opens down the road a few months later.  We should get after these people.</P>
    <P>I know from experience that small business people got tax assessments for £500 or £1,000 and they were very worried about them because they did not know how to deal with the problem.  They did not know how to handle a bookeeping system and they were saddled with this problem.  It was only an assessment, but to them it was something more than that. <Col N="164" /> They see their businesses closing down because they do not have the money to pay these tax demands.  I am sorry to say that the recent Finance Bill struck a death knell for the small businessman.  The problem looks bad today but, in my opinion, it will be much worse in the years ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are only a few points I want to make on this motion. Everybody in this House will agree that we all must note with concern the abuse by employers of the duties imposed on them by statute.  That is only right.  I would prefer if the motion were broadened to suggest that employees also should be concerned with what happens within their own firms.  To a large degree, there has been abuse by trade unions in not giving their members the knowledge of business procedure which would allow them to go to their employer and find out in what state their payments of PAYE-PRSI are at any particular time.</P>
      <P>One of the bureaucratic decisions made in this country some years ago was the abolition of the stamp.  We went on to the PRSI system where the employer sent off his returns at the end of a particular period.  With the stamp system the employee could find out how many stamps were on his card at any time, and if there were no stamps on his card he knew exactly where he stood.  Once the change over was made from the stamps to the present system the trade unions did not follow through with their responsibilities to their members.</P>
      <P>Somebody should speak for the employers, because at present it seems to be a sin to be an employer.  Every day one reads in the papers of the abuses by employers of their duties to the state. Employers have a duty to more than the State; they have a duty to the people who work with them, for them and beside them, and they have also a duty to themselves. The State is not set up, as has been suggested, on Orwell's 1984 system, and I sincerely hope never will reach that stage, but we are heading there very fast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first sign that a business is in trouble is when they do not send off their PRSI or their VAT payments on time. <Col N="165" /> Unfortunately, people in small businesses are spending so much time trying to survive that they do not have time to sit down to do the proper things and they are late making their PAYE and their VAT returns.  They are trying to survive not alone for themsleves but for the people working with them.  It has been suggested recently that employers who do not send off their PAYE-PRSI-VAT returns on time should be jailed.  I would like to know how much it is going to cost to keep those people in jail, and how many people would be out of work as a result.</P>
    <P>Senator Lynch mentioned the problems of small businesses trying to stay open.  The smaller business people are being hit hardest at present because they are easily got at by the Revenue Commissioners.  The local tax man can get at the small businessmen very easily, but he is not getting at the multinationals, he is not getting at the bigger companies; he is not getting at the companies that have owed tax, PRSI-PAYE, for years. Each week one reads of companies who have come here &mdash; whose jobs and premises are grant-aided, everything about them is grant-aided &mdash; and when they go out of business it is found that they have never paid PRSI.  What they did was to send PAYE and PRSI returns, without sending the cheques.  The computer grinds this information into the system and the computer knows they owe that amount of money, but with the small businessman it is a different story.</P>
    <P>The small businessmen have been the backbone of this country.  They are forced by legislation or otherwise to look at the implications of making late PRSI or VAT returns &mdash; that they will go to jail &mdash; and that this country is going to sink into the mire and nobody will be prepared to employ people.  We have imposed a tax collection system on business people which takes as much time as it takes to run the business.  Take a small business down the country.  It takes at least three days a month to organise the VAT returns, and probably another day to organise the PRSI.  There is somebody employed as a tax collector, and if the businessman is late making his returns he <Col N="166" /> is liable to daily fines, and interest rates which are quite high.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of the large amount of PRSI money owed to the Government.  One would imagine it was all owed by the employees, but when one looks at the actual situation 11.61 per cent comes from the employer and only 7.5 per cent from the employee, which is a very large sum to take from any employee's gross wage.  In too many cases, because of high interest rates, the 11.61 per cent is notional, and the money is not there to be paid.</P>
    <P>We should note, as the motion states, that there is concern about the abuses but I do not think the extreme measures suggested by various people for dealing with employers should be put on the Statute Book.  Next month there is going to be an extra 1 per cent levy on employment. That is going to create more problems for employers and employees.  As was said by Senator Lynch, too much of the economy is being driven out from the tax paying economy into the black economy. I am in the motor trade and I know what is happening there.  Daily I see people being let go but they turn up working in back street garages doing jobs for everybody.</P>
    <P>Next month under the Social Welfare Bill there will be a reduction in social welfare short-term benefits from six days to five days.  This means garages will let many more people go, because at present they are working three-day weeks.  This applies to other industries also.  At present the employers are getting the benefit of these workers for three days and the employees are being subsidised by the State for three days, but what is going to happen as a result of the Social Welfare Bill?  These people will not easily allow themselves to be put on short time.  They will be looking for redundancy.  What will happen then?  Many firms will not be able to pay redundancy.  There will be a spate of smaller firms going into liquidation, because they will not be able to pay the inflated redundancy rates that are being looked for.  The employer will get only 60 per cent of the statutory redundancy figure. Unfortunately &mdash; and it happened recently in Arklow &mdash; people are not <Col N="167" /> getting the statutory redundancy payments; they are getting three to four times more.  That is fair enough if the firm can afford to pay it.</P>
    <P>I am afraid the reduction from six days to five days for social welfare benefit is going to push more people out of work. That is not what I want.  If we could get back to a situation where the employee, as much as the employer, would take responsibility for the payment of the PRSI there would be less abuse.  If the trade unions took proper steps to ensure that their members, or their shop stewards, went to their employers at the end of each payment period, there would be a lot less abuse.</P>
    <P>This motion asks that the Seanad note with concern the abuse by employers, but I would prefer to see it widened to take note of the failure of employees to look after their own interests and of the trade unions to look after the interests of their members.</P>

      <P>I will be quite brief. I would like to thank the Minister for giving his time this afternoon to speak on this motion and for the lucid and informative presentation he made on this subject. He did emphasise that compliance by taxpayers is essential and I find we are at one on the approach to tackling the problems of non-payment of PAYE, VAT and PRSI.  He rightly made the point, in exhortation or otherwise, that there is no substitute for people exercising their duty to the community. The payment of these taxes, of course, falls clearly into that category.  He did underline, however, that if a point is reached that lack of compliance becomes a more serious problem, then fundamental legal changes may be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, in his statement, referred to the role of Revenue as being that of collectors of taxes only.  In the course of my opening contribution I did say that the non-payment of PAYE and VAT may serve as the first real signal that a company are in financial difficulty. It would not be drawing too much on the ingenuity of the Revenue people to discuss with an employer who is unable to <Col N="168" /> pay his taxes promptly, the possibility of seeking finance elsewhere in order to pay his tax arrears.  It was in that context that I mentioned Fóir Teoranta as an appropriate agency for a working capital loan.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not specifically take up the point about the reform of insolvency law.  I am glad Senator O'Leary joined me in that connection in encouraging the Minister to explore the possibilities of examining and reforming the law in this respect.  It is certainly overdue. In conclusion, I would like to say that Senators have made very valuable contributions and have given many insights drawn from their own practical experience.  While I have the opportunity, may I congratulate Deputy Nealon, on his appointment as Minister of State, who is now standing in for the Minister for Finance?</P>

I have sent for the Minister to resume the debate on the Air Companies Bill, but I am not sure how soon he will be available.  This is really a matter for the House.

      <P>I should like to congratulate the Leas-Chathaoirleach on her appointment today by the Seanad.  Senator Honan featured before &mdash; when I was not a Member of this House &mdash; as Cathaoirleach, and I am aware that <Col N="169" /> because of the way she has carried out her duties she has been spoken of with great respect.  I also welcome the Minister to the House.</P>
      <P>The measure under discussion is intended to provide the necessary financing for our national airline, a very important public image of this country.  Our national airline not only flies to the United States &mdash; the transatlantic route is a very important part of the whole enterprise that is Aer Lingus &mdash; but also to Europe and elsewhere.  It is perhaps the most important symbol of Ireland, reaching every city throughout the world. The airline carries its role commendably and brings great confidence to our people.  It is a very attractive vehicle to be used for the development of tourism here.</P>
      <P>We are all aware that the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism is in the United States to try to attract additional tourists in the course of 1983 and 1984. He is there with the objective of assisting Bord Fáilte to increase tourist traffic to this country.  We have heard of the expected 5 per cent increase in tourism this year.  I believe that the company's financial record over the last 20 years, which was very profitable, showed that it was farseeing and not afraid to embark on new areas of development that were advantageous for the company and, as a State company, for the country.  They have demonstrated that over a long period.  There have only been four years &mdash; as the Minister said &mdash; where losses were incurred by the national airline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that because the company had only four bad years out of 20 we should not have some element of constructive criticism in relation to what might be done about the difficult position the national airline is in.  It is well known internationally that people are not travelling on holidays as much as they used to.  Certainly the Americans are not travelling in the same numbers as they used to.  That produces an additional problem for the airline.  It is because we are an island community and because of our need to have regular traffic into the country that we depend more on it than some of our neighbouring countries in Europe <Col N="170" /> would.  Other countries would not treat their national airline with the same degree of importance.</P>
    <P>The international recession which has affected airlines worldwide has certainly hurt Aer Lingus in its operation.  The company faces problems on the transatlantic route and is working against severe odds in competition with other airlines during the summer &mdash; particularly the two airlines that fly into Dublin, Transamerica and the Northwest Orient.  Those airlines provide competition for Aer Lingus but they also bring in new traffic. However, Aer Lingus have to carry their airline commitment throughout the year and provides a daily service to New York and back.  What concerns me about the Aer Lingus operation &mdash; particularly the translantic operation &mdash; is the value of continuing the jumbo service between Dublin and Shannon.  I hope the Minister will comment on that later.  I wonder whether a lot more thought could be given to the economy that would result for Aer Lingus if the jumbos took off from Shannon using the great facilities that Shannon Airport offers and if a smaller craft, such as a Boeing 737, was used for the Dublin-Shannon connection, a Cork-Shannon connection or a Belfast-Shannon connection.  The jumbo has to take off twice en route to New York before it leaves Ireland, and with the price of fuel that must be a costly operation.  Fuel costs are one of the largest elements involved in the problems of air transportation.  Surely the Minister could, in conjunction with Aer Lingus, see to it that steps are taken to achieve economies in relation to that.</P>
    <P>It is important to state that although the Aer Lingus group loss in the course of the period 1981-82 was of the order of £9.2 million, looking objectively at the total picture in relation to our national airline and all their activities they made considerable profits in some ancillary activities, such as the repairing operations at Airmotive Limited.  In addition, the company operate in areas such as leasing aircraft, computer work, hotels, and are now running golf courses.  Those areas are producing an additional £12 million for the company.  It is important as an <Col N="171" /> entrepreneurial activity that the Aer Lingus company should be engaged in those activities.  It is doing a great deal of good that the company are giving their time to such ancillary activities and providing hotels for tourists and support services for other airlines.  The two figures must be put together when looking at the loss situation that has been incurred by the national airline.  In net terms the 1981-82 profit of the ancillary activities was £12 million but the company overall incurred an operating loss of £9.2 million.  Those figures should be taken into account in relation to the ongoing programme of Aer Lingus in the period ahead.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to be in the slightest over-critical of Aer Lingus.  The company is engaging in a very important job of giving the country an image abroad, bringing in tourists, and engaging in a lot of ancillary activity which is important to the country and the enterprise of Aer Lingus.  The fact that the company is doing this has contributed to the success of Aer Lingus as an operation.  Every possible economy should be sought in relation to the overall operations of the company in a climate where losses could be suggested to be of the order of £21.2 million in relation to the airline operation itself.  The service from Dublin to Shannon is an area where definite economies could be achieved.  I have heard figures of the order of £5 million suggested as being a possible economy in this area. Given the level we are dealing with, the degree of funding which is required by Aer Lingus, increasing the shareholding to £60 million by the State and the guarantee limit on increases from £75 to £150 million, those considerable sums should be granted to the company because I am certain they will pay off.  However, although there have been exhaustive looks internally in Aer Lingus and its associated companies as to economies and making the airline a more successful operation that part of its operation could be looked at in more detail and, perhaps, may result in additional economies.  I will not delay the House any further but I believe the Bill is appropriate.  I look <Col N="172" /> forward to hearing some comments from the Minister in relation to my contribution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill and support the measures proposed in it.  I welcome the Minister's commitment, and the decision of the Government &mdash; I acknowledge it is a continuation of a decision by the last Government &mdash; to provide the financial support required by our national airline. This is being done, as the Minister told us, by increasing the State's shareholding by up to £60 million, by extending the guarantee limit on borrowings by the airline from £75 million to £150 million, and by increasing the State equity investment of £33.3 million by a further £30 million over the next two years.  The national airline as far as I am concerned &mdash; I believe it is the view of all Members &mdash; has served us well, and it is important that we should recognise the contribution it has made to so many aspects of our economic development.  Its activities and assistance in the promotion of tourism and business and its contribution to our economic progress must be recognised.</P>
      <P>It is only right that we should express a certain pride in the airline and be proud also of its success.  Its continued success is something that is necessary for our national well-being.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national airline, as we have been told by the Minister, in common with other airlines throughout the world, has experienced severe difficulties in recent years.  A number of factors have contributed to that including the world recession, escalating costs in many countries, in particular in our own, and the increased cost of fuel oil.  Recently I saw a figure quoted by an executive of Aer Lingus which brings into perspective the effect increased oil prices have on the operation of air companies.  In 1970 fuel oil represented about 8 per cent of operating costs.  Four years later that figure had more than doubled to 17.5 per cent. Last year that figure had again increased to 26 per cent of operating costs.  That gives a fair indication of the problems that Aer Lingus and quite a number of other air companies have to contend <Col N="173" /> with.  Inevitably, those factors have had their effect.  We know that a number of airlines have collapsed in recent years and it is to the credit of our national airline &mdash; we have Aer Lingus and Aerlínte involved &mdash; that they have succeeded in weathering the storm to a reasonably satisfactory degree.  Even against the odds &mdash; I am referring to the Minister's speech &mdash; in the past year North Atlantic air traffic increased by approximately 3 per cent.  Despite the difficulties I have outlined and which we are all conscious of, and in an atmosphere and climate in which other airlines have collapsed, Aer Lingus has maintained its position to a reasonably satisfactory degree and, again against the odds, brought about a marginal improvement on, for example, the North Atlantic route.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's decision that his views are in accord with those of the review body of experts who considered whether the North Atlantic involvement by our national airline should continue. I am pleased that the decision is to continue the involvement of the national airline on the North Atlantic route because I believe that the presence of our national airline as a scheduled carrier is vital as far as we are concerned.</P>
    <P>Some years ago a very effective campaign was launched by TWA and Pan Am to get landing rights at Dublin Airport in addition to Shannon.  They advanced what proved to be a convincing argument at the time that in giving them these additional landing rights at Dublin the country could be assured of improved business, trade and many additional tourists. The landing rights were granted and we all know what happened afterwards. Within two years of the landing rights being granted one of those airlines pulled out completely and by 1979 the other airline as good as removed itself from the scene.  The lesson to be learned from that is that we cannot depend on the airlines of another country to maintain a scheduled service all year round to Ireland.  We need a scheduled service between here and America and to ensure that we have it we have no option but to continue the <Col N="174" /> service our national airline is providing across the North Atlantic.</P>
    <P>The commercial position of the North Atlantic has been outlined by the Minister. Those who have been following it with interest over the past few years cannot but realise the enormous difficulties on that route.  Up to the early seventies the North Atlantic was one of the most profitable routes an airline could operate on.  One of the factors that contributed to that situation was the policy that for a number of years had been applied by the United States Government of ensuring tight regulations in regard to the operation of airlines across the North Atlantic. During the seventies we witnessed a complete and total reversal of that policy to what became known as the open skies policies.  The effect of the open skies policy was to increase the competition on the North Atlantic, to enable other airlines to compete for the market and, in addition, we had the arrival of Laker Airways.  That brought about a situation where the North Atlantic became the least profitable route.  In that situation we must admire the success of our national airline in not alone surviving on that route but operating in a relatively satisfactory position.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of our national airline's operation to which the Minister referred is its success in promoting and developing profitable ancillary activities in such a way that they have continued to show an increase in profit over the years.  The Minister gave us a figure of £12 million net profit from those ancillary activities for 1981-82, which is almost equivalent to the amount of the total interest paid by our national airline.  The Minister, in the course of his speech, referred to the ratio of debt to equity &mdash; 88:12 &mdash; and said it was unsustainable.  I endorse that view.  The measures proposed in the Bill will help to remedy that situation and in some way improve and strengthen the financial position of our national airline. Those measures are long overdue.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to the fact that the loss incurred by our national airline for the year ending March 1982 was £9.3 million, and he also stated that the figure for the previous year was £13.6 <Col N="175" /> million.  I hope that in his closing speech the Minister will indicate how that welcomed improvement materialised.</P>
    <P>I should now like to be parochial.  I am conscious that the Minister referred on a number of occasions to the importance of the North Atlantic route to Shannon Airport.  I read his Second Stage speech to the other House and I was taken by the fact that he emphasised that Shannon is the country's transatlantic airport.  I encourage him to endorse that viewpoint again in this House.  The people of the Shannon area are very conscious of the importance of Shannon Airport to the area and to the country.  They are also conscious of the fact that statistics show that of every three passengers carried in either direction across the Atlantic at least two of them either get on or get off at Shannon.  I have been generous, and rightly so, in the compliments I paid to our national airline on the matter they have carried out their functions, but I should like to express reservations that are shared by quite a number of people in my area.  The Minister has given a commitment that Shannon is our international airport, but there are many people in the Shannon area who doubt, and have doubted for some time, that the commitment of our national airline to Shannon as our only international airport is 100 per cent.  We have witnessed over the years the transfer of staff, services and activities from Shannon to Dublin. We regularly witness also the over-flying of Shannon Airport by the flight from New York to Ireland on to Dublin.  We hear excuses that there are cross-winds on particular days or that visability is not good on another day.  I hope the Minister will give us the dates on which Shannon has been overflown during the past year and the reasons on each day.</P>
    <P>We have had comments from pilots and others about the undesirability of the double stop.  It is a very expensive operation.  There has been a lobby in existence for years who have worked towards promoting Dublin rather than Shannon as the one stop for transatlantic flights.  In view of the amount of traffic generated <Col N="176" /> at Shannon, the fact that two-thirds of the passengers either get on or get off there, if there is a question in relation to the double stop it should make economic sense to have that stop at Shannon.  Any passengers for Dublin should be ferried from Shannon in smaller aircraft.  In addition to Dublin, centres such as Cork and Belfast could also be serviced.</P>
    <P>I am told that our national airlines are developing a policy that will involve the purchase of smaller aircraft and a greater involvement by the national airline in regional and internal flights.  We are involved today in voting considerable sums of money, which I have no reservation in doing, to the national airlines and it is only reasonable to say that we are entitled to know what their policy is with regard to engaging in internal and regional flights to an extent that was not done in the past.  In fact, they have disengaged from a number of routes that operated in the past, some of which are now being operated sucessfully by smaller companies.  I would appreciate it if the Minister would let us know what is the policy of the national airlines in relation to additional internal and regional routes.</P>
    <P>The Minister might bring us up to date on the position regarding the proposal for a customs pre-clearance arrangement at Shannon and also regarding the Federal Express project which was under very active consideration some time ago. We are aware that both these projects would be of considerable benefit to Shannon Airport.  We are also aware that discussions on them have reached a very advanced stage.  For some reason that is not quite apparent, matters seem to have halted in relation to both.  There are people in my part of the country who would like to know if the attitude of our national airlines to both these points has been as simple as it could have been.  Has the attitude of the national airlines to customs pre-clearance and to the Federal Express project been in any way part of the delay that has arisen with regard to the bringing into operation of both these projects?  I would be glad to have that information.</P>
    <P>The Minister has clarifed in a satisfactory <Col N="177" /> manner the situation with regard to charters.  Quite a number of people were concerned with certain articles which appeared, some of which conveyed an impression that, as a result of the decision in relation to charters on the the North Atlantic, the tourist industry stood to lose £14 million.  The Minister told us that Bord Fáilte are predicting that the growth in tourist traffic from North America will be in the region of 5 per cent this year. He has ensured that charter seats available on scheduled flights from New York and Boston to this country will increase by 50 per cent and that beyond the New York and Boston gateways charters originating anywhere else in the States have open skies before them.  The articles concerned were misleading and damaging and I am glad that the Minister availed of the opportunity to clarify the situation.</P>
    <P>We are voting substantial sums to the national airlines and these are well deserved.  The airlines have proved their value to the country and will continue to do so in the future.  Despite the reservations that I may have expressed in relation to local matters, on the national scene our national airlines have done a magnificent job for the country.  They deserve our support and I am glad to be in a position to vote for that support today and to join in congratulating them for the wonderful services which they have rendered.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the Seanad, congratulate him on his appointment as Minister and wish him well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, in his opening speech, has correctly identified and underlined the North Atlantic part of Aer Lingus-Aerlínte activities as the key problem facing the organisation.  The North Atlantic losses are caused by a variety of factors, not least by the exceptionally long off-peak period of eight months and the fact that aggressive price competition on the North Atlantic is limiting the airline's ability to make up the winter shortfall with summer revenue.  The traditional tactic of chartering out surplus North Atlantic capacity during the off-peak period is very difficult at present <Col N="178" /> due to a world surplus of Boeing 747s. Speaking of tactics, I wonder if Aer Lingus have given enough emphasis to projecting themselves as an international airline, instead of as an extension of the tourist industry and, secondly, as a European airline.  I would like to see them being perceived as being in the airline business, attracting customers from the United States to Europe and including as many stops in Ireland as is feasible.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus are different from many other airlines in that they have had a huge expenditure in marketing to attract a market back to Ireland due to our tiny home base.  American airline companies have greatly benefited from this marketing effort because they have not had to spend large sums on marketing.  They can derive the benefits from the expenditure incurred by Aer Lingus in promoting Ireland for tourist purposes in particular.</P>
    <P>I do not want to give the impression, because of the special features that adversely affect Aer Lingus, that ours is the only airline losing money.  This is not so.  On the contrary, the airline industry &mdash; and I include here the airlines of the United States and of Britain, Germany, France and Italy as well as Ireland &mdash; have incurred losses on the North Atlantic since 1972.  Why is this so?  The reality is that the airlines are not able to operate commercially on the basis of relying on market forces alone.  This raises the important question of regulation.  Regulation which will allow economic operation by the most efficient is imperative and Government intervention is, therefore, necessary.  In that context, I am very glad to see that the Minister has intervened in the case of charters for the summer of 1983.  I would like to see more regulatory support for Aer Lingus against the dumping exercise in which the United States has engaged over the past several years on the North Atlantic.  I would suggest to the Minister that it will be necessary for Ireland to join with other European governments in taking strong collective action against the United States in order to impose a rational regulatory régime on North Atlantic services.  Unless some such action is taken the present loss-making chaos will continue <Col N="179" /> with obvious implications for the Irish taxpayer.</P>
    <P>Nobody is denying that there is a financial crisis in Aer Lingus and the financial position would be far worse were it not for the highly successful ancillary activities in which the airline had the vision to engage in the early seventies.  The ancillary activities investment made a contribution of £90 million to the group's finances up to March of last year.  This is a most creditable performance.  One of the main reasons for the deterioration in the net results of the Aer Lingus-Aerlínte group has been that their equity base is inadequate and the consequential interest payments have been very substantial.</P>
    <P>I see today's Bill as both welcome and necessary in helping our national airline on a very difficult path.  The Aer Lingus group have made a major contribution to Irish tourism, to Irish trade, to industrial investment and to the Irish community generally.  I heartily support the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChristyKirwan" hpid="Mr. Kirwan Mr. Kirwan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirwan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister and I have broken lances before.  This is the first occasion on which I have met him in the Seanad Chamber and I want to assure him that on this occasion I will not indulge in the verbose, caustic criticisms to which I have subjected him on a number of occasions, other than to say that I expect that the Bill is essentially an enabling one, a Money Bill.  Any Bill that provides the essential capital injection to the civil aviation industry as represented by Aer Lingus-Aerlínte is indeed a welcome one, although I have the view that perhaps it is not enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to make one or two observations on the general text of the Minister's statement. He quite correctly points out that the civil aviation industry in international terms has gone though a traumatic period, not unrelated to the energy crisis which began in the early seventies.  He goes on further to make the point that the principal private operator in the United Kingdom, Laker Airways &mdash; of not too lamented memory &mdash; has gone out of business.  Braniff, the fourth largest carrier in the United States, has also gone out of business and he makes the <Col N="180" /> point that the principal United States flag-carrier, PanAm, is also in some fiscal difficulties.  This is all quite true.  He copperfastens these assertions by making the point that Hammarskjöld of IATA has also concluded that there will be a loss of over $2 billion by the carriers before the end of this year and that these losses have been consistent and systematic since 1979.</P>
    <P>I accept all of these facts but what worries me is that later on in the statement he tells the little airline which services somewhat fewer than 4,000,000 people, a tiny little State, an off-shore island off an off-shore island, that unlike the international giants of the civil aviation industry it must operate on a profitable basis.  Somewhere along the line I detect the scent of the interdepartmental civil servants, who from positions of unthreatened employment, without having to test their skill or expertise in the market, seek to manage the various institutions that have been set up by the State. The Minister talks about the continuing and, hopefully, growing flow of profits in respect of our little national airline.  If Braniff could not do it, if Laker with all his financial ingenuity could not do it and PanAm cannot stay in business, it appears that the Minister is setting our little airlines a virtually impossible task.</P>
    <P>There is a mechanism which interests me which is set out as one of the aids towards achieving this viability in civil aviation.  The Minister talks in terms of the progress which has been made in Aer Lingus over a number of years in reducing staff and there is the further point that sustainable jobs of long-term value to the community can be maintained only within the framework of commercial viability.  I shudder when I hear people talk in terms of an alliance between profitability and the maintenance of long-term jobs because if commercial viability is to be attained at the expense of jobs and if this is to be a regular and a constant phenomenon, if this is an acceptable social evolution, then we are going to be in some difficulty in the years ahead, taking into account the rapidly expanding population worldwide and the effects of the technological revolution upon the <Col N="181" /> work force.  It is a long time since we took work out of the home, out of the village, out of the farm and into the factory place. We have to provide for a population that has a greater life expectancy and we cannot do it if in the pursuit of viability and financial rectitude we do it at the expense of jobs.</P>
    <P>Substantial contributions have been made by the staff of Aer Lingus-Aerlínte to achieve this type of viability and I know the Minister will say that it is not his job to manage Aer Lingus-Aerlínte, no more than it was his job to manage B &amp; I, but when you set financial parameters within which these institutions must work that, in effect, constitutes control and becomes a business technique of some magnitude.  I ask the Minister to take into account that in the last analysis the State through its agencies still has an obligation and responsibility to its citizens to provide them with the dignity of work.  It is quite clear that the private sector has failed in this regard.  I know of no private operator of any substance in the civil aviation industry.  We have Avair and others but they are not big and one of them recently threatened to come out of Cork.</P>
    <P>I add my voice, too, to the observations made in respect of the Shannon Airport complex.  We had here a tremendous vision related to the internal combustion engine when it was absolutely vital to provide a landing place for piston-engined aircraft after a long Atlantic crossing.  Unfortunately, the technological development, which constitutes a fear in many respects, has reduced the value of Shannon Airport in the eyes of some people.  Overflying it has become the rule rather than the exception.  There are some people who would talk of building another airport not too far from Shannon while it has been argued that Shannon is dying, while it has been argued that another airport &mdash; which I will leave to the august Senator from Cork who will speak after me &mdash; has the same problem.</P>
    <P>There is a need to maintain our civil aviation industry.  It stands as a milestone to the industrial renaissance of this little State of ours and if it is to be maintained I would urge the Minister that it be maintained <Col N="182" /> with the minimum effects on the staff employed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>One comment I wish to make on this Bill is a fairly broad ranging one and the other comment concerns a matter affecting my own area of the country. The Bill as introduced by the Minister is bound to have our support because it is a Bill which has the support by and large of both this Minister and his predecessor and no doubt they have carefully examined the position within Aer Lingus-Aerlínte and arrived at the conclusion that this is the minimum necessary for these companies.</P>
      <P>I will not join the list of people who prefaced their remarks about this Bill by glowing tributes to our national airline. That is not what this Bill is all about. Basically this Bill, as Senator Kirwan has said, is enabling legislation to allow the Minister to subscribe substantial extra funds to State companies, and it is against this background that the Bill must be judged, not against the background of whether we are for or against the existence of a State company operating an airline, of which everyone in this House is in favour.</P>
      <P>The problem is that we have been given no overall idea as to the plan for this company or this group of companies.  We have been given no overview.  We do not know where we are going.  We are told that an inter-departmental review committee was established.  That inter-departmental review committee no doubt arrived at conclusions which were made available to the Minister.  They were not, however, made available to me.  If I am being asked to give my seal of approval, in so far as the Seanad approves a money Bill, to the granting of extra money to this organisation, there is a complete absence of information on which any Member of the Oireachtas can make a rational decision.  There are not before us the results of the review group.  There are not before us the results of any joint committee of the House of the Oireachtas or a committee of the other House, even if we were not represented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no indication except the word of this Minister and the last Minister that <Col N="183" /> this is sufficient money.  I am not saying we should not give them the additional £30 million which they are looking for. Perhaps £30 million is not enough.  If so, we should give them more, because if the companies are worth preserving we should establish them on a sound financial basis.  Maybe on the other hand £30 million is too much.</P>
    <P>There is no way in which we can arrive at a rational conclusion as to the right amount of money to be given to this company.  Effectively we are participating in the writing of a blank cheque to this Minister, whose judgment I implicitly trust, but also to any future Minister of any political hue, whose identity I do not know.  We are giving him the authority to increase their share capital from £30 million to £60 million and increase the amount of guarantees from £75 million to £150 million.  We are giving a blank cheque to the Minister.  He does not have to come back.  He does not have to ask our opinion.  He just makes the increase.  I will vote in favour of this Bill because I trust the Minister but this is not a rational way for the Oireachtas to carry on its business.  This is an ideal Bill on which to make this comment because it is a Bill which is the creature of two administrations.  It is not the right way to carry on.  Obviously certain targets were set for the company.  Senator Kirwan has referred to profitability targets.  I am sure there were such targets but I do not know what they were.  Therefore when this Minister or another Minister comes in six or seven years time and asks for more money, I will not know whether these profitability targets have been met.  No doubt there were targets with regard to either maintenance of the existing employment, the reduction of employment or increased employment.  No doubt there were targets like that but I do not know.  Therefore the next time this matter comes before the House.  I will not know whether they have succeeded in meeting these targets.  No doubt there was another plan, no doubt there was another inter-departmental committee and no doubt the result of their investigation was equally a mystery <Col N="184" /> to those who were called upon to vote for substantial increases in the amount of guarantees being given to State companies. I am not saying that the amount of money is too much; I am not saying it is too little.  I am just saying I do not know. That is not a reasonable way to ask Houses of the Oireachtas to make a decision.</P>
    <P>That is my only point with regard to the general structure of this Bill and this type of legislation.  I am not blaming the Minister.  I am not blaming this Government or the previous Government.  It is a matter of the way we are controlling or failing to control our State enterprises. Senator Kirwan and I are approaching the matter from a different angle but arriving at the same conclusion.  I do not know what the civil servants have in mind for Aer Lingus, but if I did it might improve my input to this discussion and enable me to make a rational decision as to whether to play my small part in giving this increased money.</P>
    <P>My second point concerns Cork airport. It is true to say that a confusion seems to exist in the minds of many people concerning the future of each and every airport in the country.  It is quite obvious because of its closeness to the major centre of population that the future of Dublin airport is as secure as the airline industry.</P>
    <P>The problems of Shannon airport and the need for its confirmation as our international airport have been rightly stressed by both Senator Alexis FitzGerald and Senator Michael Howard. They are welcome contributions which should have our support.  The role of Cork airport has not been properly defined, and the way in which Aer Lingus have been talking about downgrading the services into Cork airport has been disturbing, especially for those like myself who use the airport quite a lot.  There is a need not only for feeder flights to Dublin but for regular services to London and to the Continent of Europe.  It should not be outside the wit and ingenuity of those who control Aer Lingus and Aerlínte to make use of the facilities provided by Cork airport to service the very substantial number of people who live in the <Col N="185" /> Cork and Kerry regions.</P>
    <P>I do not want to ascribe to Aer Lingus motives which suggest that they are unfavourably disposed towards the airport at Cork.  It is fair to place them on warning that every public representative in the south of Ireland is looking with interest at the way in which they treat their services in and out of Cork airport, the way in which they develop their services and the way in which they ensure that the airport remains as a service both to the economic and social life of the southern region.</P>
    <P>Certainly the Minister will have our support and we wish him well with regard to this Bill.  It is really up to the House itself rather than the Minister to look carefully at the cavalier fashion in which we increase the guarantees for a State company by such a dramatic amount of money with so little information before us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I first compliment Senator Tras Honan on her appointment as Leas-Chathaoirleach?  I hope she will be there for a long time to come.  Secondly, while welcoming the Bill I have to admit that I am confused about the Minister's statement because I fail to understand how he can admit a few times in the statement that in actual fact the North Atlantic over the last ten to 12 years has been a loss-maker and it has been admitted that the profits &mdash; we had profits in four years only &mdash; have been coming from European operations.  Now we see a situation where Aer Lingus are downgrading particular airports, that it is readily admitted profits were made out of, to keep the North Atlantic going.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fail to understand that, and it is only right that it should be questioned.  Indeed other Senators before me have questioned it.  It has been brought to my attention over the last few months because of the information about Aer Lingus downgrading, in particular, Cork and Shannon. It cannot be denied that flights are overflying Shannon when there is no need for it.  Senator Howard has covered that point.  At the same time, why should we allow a situation where extra money must be allocated to these people without <Col N="186" /> seriously questioning whether they are doing the right thing generally for the people who pay the money, the taxpayers?</P>
    <P>I admit that the North Atlantic is a very important area.  We hope there will be a 5 per cent increase in tourism this year.  I will not deny that is a very important area.  At the same time, it is only proper to point out that, in particular, in the Cork area serious concern is being shown by industrialists in that area.  I will give one example.  It was brought to my attention yesterday that in actual fact off the south coast of Cork rigs will be working there by next summer and $600,000 a day can be spent in that area and up to $1 million a day on oil rigs.  Concern has been shown by the people engaged in this work that no services are available at Cork Airport.  The State could be losing out generally because of this.  The onus lies on the management of Aer Lingus. The way they are going about their services from Cork Airport and Shannon Airport is causing people very serious concern.</P>
    <P>I also understand that when other people are prepared to give a service to these particular airports very strong objections have been raised by Aer Lingus about the services.  One particular service that has been running out of Cork for the last 18 months is Danair &mdash; from Cork to Gatwick.  There were strong objections by Aer Lingus at that time as to whether Danair should fly out of Cork. Danair gave a commitment that they were prepared to give a service from Cork at 9 o'clock every morning and Aer Lingus, I understand, said that if they were going to give a service at 9 o'clock Aer Lingus would give one at 8.30.  That is very bad management, and I fail to understand why they could not give this service before Danair said they would give the service at 9 o'clock.  That is a very serious question and a very serious allegation.</P>
    <P>We are now saying we must give extra money to these same people today.  I am not going to sit here and be a yes man for anybody and say that we must allow it.  I welcome anything that will better the people of this country, but I seriously <Col N="187" /> question whether Aer Lingus' priorities are right, and serious questions must be asked.  Avair are giving a commuter service from Cork to Dublin and because these people have come up with this particular service, a charge of £45 is charged for the return trip.  Cork to Dublin via Aer Lingus early in the morning was costing in the region of £38, and the day after Avair started their commuter service between Cork and Dublin, the Aer Lingus charges were increased from £38 to £45.</P>
    <P>I do not know if they are prepared to compete or if they should do what the other person is doing.  They say the next week that they should be doing the same as Avair.  Why did they not say that before these people started?  Why are they now readily admitting that turbo-prop planes are now the thing to be in? A large amount of money has been spent over the years on 737s in particular and 111s and now they are admitting they are too big for these particular services.  I fail to understand that.  It should be seriously questioned why they are now prepared to give these particular services when other people are now doing them.</P>
    <P>Another matter was brought to my attention and I feel that it is only right that it should be mentioned.  We subsidise a State company to provide services to the people of the State, yet I understand that when these particular aeroplanes land at Heathrow they are told that they must fuel there, I imagine, because the fuel is cheaper.  At the same time if the State is subsidising a company to fly aeroplanes and they are not prepared to buy fuel in the same State I question it.  I now understand that Shell who provide the fuel in Cork Airport are leaving the airport and are allowing somebody else to provide the service, because no fuel is being bought at that particular airport. We also have a situation where the people providing the airport are losing vast amounts of money by air.  Why are the semi-State company not providing the fuel?  If we are seen to be creating employment, why is it that we do not allow the semi-State company.  Air <Col N="188" /> Rianta, to provide the fuel themselves? Why should we be allowing a private company to do it at all?</P>
    <P>I would like also to refer to the foreign carriers.  Why are Aer Lingus showing so many objections to other people who are prepared to come in and give services to these airports and they are not prepared to give the service direct out of Cork? They are saying that we must now go to Dublin if we want to travel to Manchester or Paris.  We can just imagine what it means to people who are getting on in Cork and being told that they cannot get a flight to Paris or to Manchester direct. We must not give the impression that the south west region will accept that they cannot fly direct.  Aer Lingus have a responsibility to the people of Ireland as well as to the North American people. The priority should be the people of Ireland because they are getting the money from them to provide a service to the people who are giving the jobs in Ireland.  Yet, when the industrialists want to get out of this particular south west region they cannot get out direct.</P>
    <P>If an industrialist wants to go from Cork to Brussels &mdash; it only takes in the region of 55 minutes &mdash; he has to stop off in Dublin and he can be three or four hours waiting.  That is crazy, long-term thinking.  It is most unfair to people down the country to be giving the impression that there is only one particular airport. Priority must be given throughout the country to everybody in it.</P>
    <P>I readily admit that in comparison with the Dublin airport, Cork airport is not as busy.  The population is not as great.  At the same time it is only fair to say that the impression must not go out of here implying that Aer Lingus are calling Cork airport and, indeed, Shannon airport second class airports.  That is most unfair with the amount of money that is being put into them.  Serious questions must be asked about that.  They should not go unanswered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Minister for Transport (Mr. J. Mitchell) Jim Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. J. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like, first of all, to express my gratitude to all those who participated in this debate and who were kind enough to congratulate me on my appointment <Col N="189" /> as Minister for Transport and Posts and Telegraphs and welcome me to the House.  I have been very stimulated by the debate and very interested in the points that have been raised.  I will endeavour to answer the points raised as best I can.</P>
      <P>I will start with Senator Killilea.  He referred to the burdens being carried by the tourist industry.  He suggested that Aer Lingus's task of attracting travellers to Ireland would be more difficult as a result.  One of our strengths in attracting tourists to Ireland in recent years, and particularly from the United States, has been the very attractive air fares.  That will continue to be the case this year.  I am confident &mdash; I know that my colleague the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism is of the same view &mdash; that Bord Fáilte's target of 5 per cent increase in tourist numbers from the US can be attained in 1983.  I note from a report in this morning's <i>Irish Times</i> that the major charter operator into Ireland, Mr. O'Connor of Old Country Tours, is also confident of a good year in 1983.  The longer term situation is something that the Government will be giving attention to in the next few months.</P>
      <P>Senator FitzGerald referred to the turnaround at Shannon, as did Senator Michael Howard.  Senator FitzGerald referred to the use of jumbo aircraft between Shannon and Dublin.  The question of turning around at Shannon was one of the main items discussed during the course of the Second Stage debate on this Bill in the Dáil.  Conflicting points of view were expressed, with a number of Deputies arguing forcibly for a turnaround of services at Shannon and the other side making the point that it should be at Dublin.  I want to repeat the point that I made in the Dáil, that Shannon is our transatlantic airport.  In terms of the Aer Lingus situation I must stress again the fact that the national carrier depends almost equally on Shannon and Dublin to provide the traffic for its transatlantic operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is in contradiction of a point made by one of the speakers.  He suggested that two out of every three passengers either landing at or embarking from Ireland <Col N="190" /> used Shannon.  That is not the case.  It is very much even steven between Dublin and Shannon.  Aer Lingus depend almost equally on both airports.  The turnaround option is one that has been looked at from time to time.  All the analyses indicate that for many reasons, including key marketing and operational ones, a continuation of the present pattern of operations is in the best interests of the airline. Therefore, there is no question but that Shannon airport is, and will continue to be, our transatlantic airport, and that there will continue to be a dual stop at Dublin and Shannon on the transatlantic service.</P>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald spoke of the £20 million-plus loss which Aer Lingus incurred on the air transportation side, losses that are cushioned by profits from their ancillary activities.  The whole point of Aer Lingus' involvement in the ancillaries was to provide such a cushion for what has traditionally been a cyclical operation, with peaks and valleys recurring frequently on the air transportation side.  The North Atlantic operation is in fact the root cause of Aer Lingus' losses. The operations on cross-channel and into Europe, broadly speaking, break even or turn in a small profit.  I have to qualify that by saying that that is so as long as they can share the overheads with the Shannon transatlantic route.  Nevertheless the fact that the air transportation side is turning in losses makes it incumbent on Aer Lingus to take every step to improve efficiency and to reduce their costs.</P>
    <P>I dealt with this aspect in some detail in my opening speech.  There is no question but that Aer Lingus will have to continue their efforts in cutting their expenditure and achieving economies and savings wherever possible.  Senator Kirwan referred to the point that Aer Lingus were expected to make a profit when such airlines as Laker, Braniff and Pan Am have closed down or have difficulties. The fact is, Aer Lingus, as I said in my speech, have had profits in every year except four over the past 20 years and, therefore, according to Aer Lingus' performance a profit is a thing that we can expect and ought to expect.  Aer Lingus' <Col N="191" /> management and Aer Lingus' work force want to be in a profitable situation. They do not want to be a burden on the State.  It is, therefore, right for this House and for me to encourage them in that direction.</P>
    <P>Senator Kirwan saw implicit in my speech an insistence on job losses.  I want to say that I cannot guarantee that jobs will not be lost.  I can guarantee that I have given every encouragement to the State bodies under my control to avoid job losses where possible.  If there are other ways of saving money the protection of jobs should be very high in their consideration although job losses may be unavoidable.  I would certainly like all other ways of saving money to be found first.</P>
    <P>Senator Howard referred to our experience with Pan Am and TWA in terms of their case for landing rights at Dublin.  As Senator Howard pointed out, both airlines lost interest in providing scheduled services between the US and Ireland, underlining the point that the only airline on which we can rely to give the year round scheduled service that is vital for the development of Irish trade, industrial development and tourism is Aer Lingus.  It is for that very reason that the Government see it as essential that Aer Lingus must continue to provide a service on the Atlantic.</P>
    <P>Senator Howard also raised questions about the frequency of Aer Lingus over-flights at Shannon.  He said that they are almost fifty-fifty, one overflight for one landing.  That simply is not the case. Overflights are very much the exception and, for scheduled flights, the only grounds for overflying are safety considerations. I will get details of the extent of and the reasons for overflights in the past year and write to Senator Howard shortly.  He requested that information but it is not to hand.  The Senator also inquired about the basis for the improvement in the airline's financial fortunes in 1981-82.  The improvement came about largely through the efforts of the airline's cost reduction programme that extends over the entire range of the airline's <Col N="192" /> operations and covers items such as staff, overheads, fuel conservation, etc.</P>
    <P>Another point that Senator Howard raised was the question of Federal Express locating at Shannon.  This would be a very welcome development though, unfortunately, Federal Express, having examined the matters in detail, recently decided, we understand, that to extend its operations into Europe at the present time of recession is not on.  So, the proposal has been deferred at least for the present.  On the customs pre-clearance question this is a complex proposition with many different considerations having to be weighed up from an Irish perspective. Aside from that the concept could only be advanced with the active participation of the US authorities.  On that score, a fundamental requirement from the US point of view is a minimum throughput of US-bound passengers.  At the moment Shannon is below this maximum figure, but I know that Aer Rianta are still keenly interested in the concept. When customs pre-clearance becomes a live issue there will, of course, have to be an effort to try to strike a balance between the pros and cons being advanced by those in favour of and those opposed to the introduction of this concept at Shannon.</P>
    <P>Senator Hillery spoke of the need for regulatory action on a wide front between the United States and Europe.  That is, in fact, happening.  I am glad to say that my Department have played an active role in the process which led to the conclusion of an experimental memorandum of understanding between the member countries of the European Civil Aviation Conference and the United States in regard to North Atlantic pricing.  That is but a first step back from the road of total de-regulation or open skies as it is sometimes called, but I would hope that it represents a first step on a road back to airline profitability.</P>
    <P>Senator Howard inquired about Aer Lingus' involvement in the provision of internal air services.  The airline have, of course, operated services between Dublin, Shannon and Cork for many years.  Over the past year or so Aer Lingus have joined in arrangements which <Col N="193" /> are there to provide supplementary internal air services, most notably between Cork and Dublin.  Interest in internal air services has been stimulated in recent years and, at the moment, I am examining applications from a number of private operators to expand into this sector.  At the same time, Aer Lingus have been looking at whether an all-jet fleet is the correct approach at the present time.  In fact, the company have recently concluded that they should again become involved in the operation of turbo-prop equipment.  Aer Lingus are currently in the process of acquiring a Shorts 330 aircraft on lease for an experimental period. I am confident that the scene in terms of internal air services will see considerable evolution and development over the next few years.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with Senator Kirwan's point.  Senators O'Leary and Cregan were understandably concerned about Aer Lingus' operations out of Cork.  I should say that Aer Rianta are very concerned about the traffic scene at Cork and any proposals that are made to me for services to and from Cork will be very carefully examined.  It should be said, in relation to Aer Lingus, that the original proposals were indeed for very stark reductions in direct services from Cork. Following the intervention of the Lord Mayor and other people in Cork and discussion between them and Aer Lingus a compromise set of proposals has been arrived at which greatly improves the situation. I want to thank Aer Lingus, the Lord Mayor and those who were with him for their positive contribution to a compromise and sensible solution.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with all the points that have been raised by Senators.  I want to thank the House for its expeditious dealing with this Second Stage.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>When the Minister is inquiring for Senator Howard about the <Col N="194" /> over-flying, which he did not seem to really take his word on, would he also inquire from his Department about the number of persons landing at Shannon as against Dublin?  I am afraid the Minister is not up-to-date.  The same number of passengers do not get off at Dublin airport and Shannon Airport.  The Minister said it was on a one-to-one basis.  That is not correct.  When the Minister inquires for Senator Howard about the over-flying I would like him to inquire also if his statement a few minutes ago regarding the number of passengers landing at Dublin and Shannon is correct.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the last point raised by Senator Honan, the fact is I was talking about Aer Lingus.  The number from Shannon and Dublin for Aer Lingus is roughly equal.  The overall figures are different because more airlines go into Shannon.  On the over-flying situation the Senator will appreciate that I am personally not watching to see what happens.  I am only as good as the information I am told.  I understand the number of over-flights is negligible.  I will certainly get the figures and I will also convery them to Senator Honan.</P>

      <P>I consider it very important that we are members of IATA. I see IATA as a very valuable international organisation and a very useful forum to help get the transatlantic services back into some sort of regulation. I think it was the de-regulation outside of IATA that has caused so many problems.  I value the membership of IATA and I think it is important to the country.</P>

      <P>In his introduction to the Bill the Minister mentioned the demise of various well-known airlines.  Some of these were members of IATA and some of them were not members of IATA.  The Minister mentioned airlines such as Lakers and Braniff, then he brought in PanAm.  Laker were obviously not a member of IATA, Braniff were not and PanAm are.  What benefit has it been to PanAm to be in IATA?  It would appear to me that IATA are a cartel.  By being in IATA we are members of a cartel who are setting prices which have no relationship to the commercial enterprise in which Aer Lingus and the other members of IATA are involved.</P>

      <P>Either I am confused or the Minister is confused.  Is he talking about passengers from Shannon to Dublin?  I am talking about the North Atlantic passengers coming in to this country and going out.  My information, and I think Senator Howard's information, is that it is two to one.  Is the Minister going to find out for me that it is one to one?  I remember speaking at length on a Bill like this a few years ago in the House and the number of passengers has not changed.  Is the Minister talking about Dublin-Shannon flights, up and down, while I am talking about the North Atlantic persons coming in and landing at Shannon because the ratio of passengers coming in is two to one?  Is the Minister telling me that it is one to one?</P>

      <P>I am saying that the current Aer Lingus transatlantic traffic pattern is precisely 49 per cent of the passengers originating or terminating at Dublin and 51 per cent at Shannon.  I have not got the figures for all airlines, but I will ascertain them and communicate them to Senator Honan and Senator Howard.</P>

      <P>On a follow up to that question, is there at present within Aer Lingus a deliberate over-booking situation whereby from the States they are offering very cheap four day rates?  Each week people are flying into Shannon on package deals from the States.  Aer Lingus here are also selling return tickets to the States using the same planes and each weekend in Shannon they are having to fly people from Shannon to London and <Col N="197" /> from London to New York, or wherever. The Minister may not be aware of this total over-booking situation.  Maybe this is where this one for one goes totally out. I am talking about Aer Lingus package deals into Shannon.  At Shannon airport on Saturday last there were about 54 people left who had booked seats from Ireland to the States and back but who could not get on the planes because of the over-booking that is being done.</P>

      <P>We had a <i>contretemps</i> here about a fortnight ago as to whether we would sit last week or this week. There were various people very concerned that we did not sit last week and they expected that there would be enough business for last week and this week.  It was suggested that we sit today, we would be sitting tomorrow and that there would be business ordered for tomorrow.  Is there a particular reason why there is not business ordered for tomorrow, because judging by the amount of verbiage that was coming from certain people who are not in the House at present, it would appear as if they wanted the House to sit two days this week and that there would be plenty of business?</P>

      <P>All I can say is that I urged on the House on the last occasion the policy of taking matters steadily and working at a steady pace.  For the amount of business coming to us from the other House, to meet once a fortnight is the appropriate rhythm.  We have facilitated the Opposition by taking a Private Members' motion when we met today and I hope to facilitate the Government side in a similar fashion when we meet on this day fortnight.</P>
