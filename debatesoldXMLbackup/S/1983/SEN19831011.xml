      <P>It is proposed that all of our time today should be devoted to the discussion of item No. 2 which is the motion on the Action Plan for Irish published by Bord na Gaeilge.  I am proposing this not only because of the importance of the question itself but because this is an all-party motion.  We should acknowledge this and perhaps encourage such all-party motions to be discussed here.  For these two reasons also I propose that we dispense with the usual limitation on the debate itself, that it would not be limited to three hours, and in regard to the length of individual speeches, while I do not want to encourage anyone towards verbosity in either language on this occasion, I think it would be appropriate if these restrictions did not apply.  I might say that it is proposed to meet next Tuesday in order to <Col N="2" /> take No. 1, and to take a Private Members' Motion,</P>

      <P>It worries me a little bit that we are meeting here today and we were given a provisional order of business which included the Tourist Traffic Bill.  I am delighted that we are today to take item No. 2.  It is a very important motion and I am delighted that, possibly because we do not have the Tourist Traffic Bill, we will be able to give it adequate time.  Nevertheless it worries me a little bit that the Minister involved in the Tourist Traffic Bill could not be available today and that next Tuesday is the day ordered for the next business.  This would seem to me to be a change from our normal procedure.  I would have expected that next Wednesday would be the next sitting day in normal circumstances. I would ask the Leader of the House if possible that we meet next <Col N="3" /> Wednesday because it would appear that it would be more suitable to most Members of the House if we have not enough business to stay here for three days. I suggest that, if the Government can order business here in any one week that needs three days, we come up Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursdayu, but if not, I think Wednesday would be a more suitable day than Tuesday.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in the hands of the House over this.  I would have thought that if we were very close to conclusion at 8.30 we might sit an hour later so as to finish.  If there seems to be a few hours left of the debate I think it might be more appropriate to meet at 10.30 tomorrow but if we seem to be only at half time, then I think it would be appropriate to adjourn until next week. Perhaps we could see what the position is when we take our normal break from 6 o'clock to 7 o'clock, and agree accordingly.</P>
      <P>In regard to the question of the day on which we meet next week in order to take the Tourist Traffic Bill, I can assure the Leader of the Opposition that in proposing Tuesday I sought not the convenience of the Minister but the convenience of the Seanad.  I thought it might be useful if we could sit another day untrammelled by the rival publicity of Dáil Éireann, which will meet on Wednesday week. Again I think this is a matter that could be discussed by the Whips and an agreement reached as to whether we sit on Tuesday or Wednesday.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann takes note of the Action Plan for Irish 1983-1986, published by Bord na Gaeilge, and <Col N="4" /> calls for the setting up of an all-party Oireachtas Committee to consider that Plan, to review the present condition of the language both in the Gaeltacht and outside it, and to make recommendations to the Government on an Irish language policy for the future.</P>
    <P>Ag cur tús leis an díospóireacht seo ar staid na Gaeilge faoi láthair agus ar a bhfuil i ndán di amach anseo, is gá dhá shliocht gearra a lua as an Plean Gníomhaíochta don Ghaeilge 1983-86 ó Bhord na Gaeilge.  Is achoimrí iad sin ar an dhá phointe bunúsacha ar a gcaithfimid áird a thabhairt sa díospóireacht seo agus a chaithfidh a bheith mar threoir againn san Oireachtas as seo amach.  Is firinní soiléire an dá phointe agus dá bhrí sin ní mór iad a dheimhniú agus a thuiscint.</P>
    <P>Ina bhfocail scoir leis an achoimre ar an bPlean Gníomhaíochta don Ghaeilge luann Bord na Gaeilge go soiléir mhórtabháil atá orainn sna habairtí seo. Deireann siad: &ldquo;Ní féidir ach le treallús láidir daingean an Ghaeilge a athbheochan. De bharr an meathlú atá ar an teanga sa Ghaeltacht faoi láthair b'fhéidir go mbeidh sé ro-mhall pleanáil a dhéanamh i gceann deich mbliana.  Ní mór an deis a thapú láithreach.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Tríd an tuarascáil ar fad deireann Bord na Gaeilge arís agus arís eile go bhfuil an Ghaeilge mar theanga phobail i gcontúirt mhór faoi láthair agus gur ag dul in olcas atá an scéal.  Léiríonn an bord go bhfuil géar-ghá le cinnireacht mar riachtanas bunúsach chun go mairfidh agus go leathnóidh an teanga i ngnáth-úsáid.</P>
    <P>Throughout their report Bord na Gaeilge emphasise again and again that the present position of Irish as a community language is a precarious one and that the situation is worsening rapidly. The bord point to the predominant requirement of leadership as an essential prerequisite to the long-run survival and growth of the language in common usage. On page four of their report the bord state quite clearly that &ldquo;an essential element of any properly promoted language planning operation is public leadership &mdash; and the personal example of political leaders would be vital to the success of the plan&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="5" /> The two brief quotations from the plan which I have used describe the two most fundamental truths which we must together accept during this debate.  First, we do not have much time in which to act if we are to ensure the survival of Irish as a spoken, living language on a sufficient scale to provide a basis for its wider revival and usage.  Secondly, the primary responsibility for the survival and revival of Irish rests with politicians, with the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I think it would be useful to describe briefly the reasoning and general attitude of the four signatories of the motion before us.  Last year, two of the signatories, together with some other Senators, had informal discussions about the serious condition of the language at present and about how we might take an initiative to bring the language question back into the centre of public affairs.  Unfortunately a general election intervened at the end of last year to interrupt our discussions, but then, as now, we saw an all-party approach as being central to the possibility of success of such an initiative. In the spring of this year we decided to revive our initiative by involving a member of each political grouping in the Seanad in the preparation of an agreed motion for debate, which motion is now before us.</P>
    <P>Each of the signatories to this motion believes strongly in the all-party approach which we have adopted.  The position of the language now is so precarious and the task which lies ahead so great that there is no room or time for partisan party attitudes to predominate our discussions.</P>
    <P>If we look back over the history of our State each political group in the Oireachtas can point to high points and low points in the performance of the other political groups in relation to language policy.  We could spend the whole of this debate in analysis of the past and in pointing the finger at one another's successes and failures or at the successes and failures of the Irish language organisations themselves, but this is not the intention behind the motion before us.  We must, of course, learn the lessons of the past in relation to language policy, as our work <Col N="6" /> proceeds in the coming months and years, and in a calm, analytical, non-partisan way.  Today our task is to make a commitment to the future of the language, in unity, so that the word goes out clearly that Oireachtas Éireann is committed to the revival of Irish and is taking concrete steps to fulfil that commitment by setting up an all-party committee on the subject.</P>
    <P>Our approach today, then, is based on a recognition that the Irish language is in a fragile condition and that the duty of politicians who care for its future is to create a consensus for progress.  That consensus must transcend all political groups so that the revival of Irish is seen for what it is &mdash; a matter of vital national interest in the pursuit of which we all have a part to play.</P>
    <P>All-party consensus is required for another reason.  In this, as in all democracies, Governments change.  If we are to secure continuity of policy in relation to Irish over the medium to long term it is necessary that we create a consensus on what that policy should be so that progress is not impeded by dramatic policy shifts which are grounded in pragmatism rather than genuine concern for the language.  I do not point any finger in this regard and I do not even suggest that such events are likely to occur in the future on the part of any political party. Nevertheless, the language issue is so important and its state so precarious that, it seems to me, it is vital that we create a realistic, hard-headed consensus of approach at Oireachtas level which will not be set aside no matter who will form the Government in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>We do not have great experience in the Oireachtas of all-party committees, nor can we predict whether the range of committees recently created to review policies in a number of economic and social areas will have useful results or whether they will break down along party lines.  Time will tell in these cases, but I believe it will be possible to create consensus in the proposed all-party committee on Irish, not least because all of us are aware that time is not on our side and that our duty to the language at this time <Col N="7" /> of crisis in its existence does not permit of partisanship.</P>
    <P>These thoughts are deeply ingrained in the minds of the signatories to this motion.  Let me add a personal experience which has helped me to understand how we should approach our task.</P>
    <P>As Senators may know, I have been a member of the European Parliament since March last.  In the same month I became a member of the Parliament's Inter-Group on Minority Languages and Cultures, which is in effect an all-party committee of members committed to the survival and revival of the Community's many lesser-used languages and their associated cultures.</P>
    <P>There are two things in particular to note about this committee and their work.  The first is that they represent a widespread recognition in the Community that the death of any of the some 25 lesser-used languages in the member states would represent a serious blow to the diverse quality of European culture. For this reason the Community this year, for the first time, is spending money on the promotion and development of these threatened languages.</P>
    <P>The money being spent this year, 100,000 ecu, is relatively small but it is significant of the commitment of the Community to lesser-used languages that money is being spent in this way in the middle of a severe economic crisis.  It is, I believe, an example to us here in this regard.</P>
    <P>The second feature of note in relation to the Parliament's Committee on Minority Languages is their working methodology. The committee comprise representatives of all political groups and of most member states.  Despite the diversity of ideological opinion which exists in the committee, and despite the different degrees of political and cultural importance of minority languages in the member states represented, the committee work on the basis of seeking out objectively correct policies.  They seek to make their decisions on the basis of objective analysis and to set aside national and ideological requirements as far as possible. <Col N="8" /> This approach is adopted in recognition of the fact that the task is so great and the available time-scale so short, that the search for a hard-nosed consensus is essential at this time.  This is an approach to their work which I would earnestly commend to the proposed Oireachtas committee.</P>
    <P>Finally, in relation to the European Community, I am pleased to say that there is now a real prospect that the proposed European Bureau for Minority Languages and Cultures will be sited in Dublin before very long.</P>
    <P>There is one other general point which I wish to make in relation to the motion before us.  Our debate today gives us the opportunity to show our solidarity with the cause of the Irish language and with all those who are working for its revival and development.  That is very important, because I sometimes feel a sense of isolation on the part of Irish language organisations from the mainstream of Irish public life.  Despite the fact that successive Governments have helped to create and fund a set of economic and cultural institutions devoted to language revival, there is a sense of feeling among language activists that these sometimes represent State lip-service to Irish rather than vital instruments of a coherent language revival policy.</P>
    <P>I cannot say that these activists and organisations are wrong to feel this way. Experience over recent decades would suggest that the revival of Irish has slipped down the list of priorities in public life in a way which is alarming.  This point is put rather charitably in the Bord na Gaeilge plan, which States:</P>
    <P>It is widely perceived that in recent times the State has drifted towards a policy of relative neutrality in matters of language policy....  A passive or arms length policy by the State towards Irish as a minority language in a system in which English is dominant, is not merely neutral but negative.</P>
    <P>These comments summarise the concern of Irish language activists and organisations when they look at the role of the State in recent years.  They are right to express these concerns and it is understandable that they feel a sense of isolation. <Col N="9" /> One of our primary tasks today, therefore, is to begin to reverse any such feelings of isolation which exist.  We can begin to do so by expressing our solidarity with the language, its organisations and its activists and by going on in the period ahead to express that solidarity in more concrete terms in the work of the all-party committee.  What we are seeking to build today, however, is not just a limited show of solidarity based on those Senators whose facility in and commitment to Irish are proven.  What we are seeking to achieve is a consensus to act on the part of all Senators who accept the vital national and cultural significance of Irish, irrespective of their own levels of proficiency in it.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to say that, while many Senators with fluent Irish will contribute to our debate today, so too will many &mdash; including myself &mdash; whose Irish is of moderate standard, as will many with no Irish at all.  All that is required at this stage of our debate is a commitment to Irish and its associated culture and a willingness to explore the way forward.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate at this stage of my contribution that I should try to offer an answer to a question which sometimes crops up in converstaion on the subject before us &mdash; why bother with Irish?  Why not let it die and concentrate instead on fundamental economic and social issues which need urgent remedy?</P>
    <P>In the first instance, of course, one must say that there is no contradiction between the objective of reviving the language and fulfilling economic and social objectives.  For the last 30 years, if not longer, there has been no exceptional commitment to Irish on the part of the State, yet this has not helped us to deal in any coherent way with the economic and social problems which afflict us.  In fact, I believe that our failure to achieve many of our economic, social and political objectives is mirrored in our failure to revive Irish and that the causes lie in our colonised past and post-colonised present.</P>
    <P>I would go further to suggest, although I am not an historian or linguistic scholar or sociologist or anthropologist, that the decline of the language over several <Col N="10" /> hundred years has had a demoralising effect on our national pschye, which has made us less capable than we might be of responding to economic, social and political challenges.</P>
    <P>The reverse side of the coin is that if we set about reviving the language in a serious and thoughtful way now, we might unleash a creativity and energy which, in turn, would help us to come to grips with the many economic and social crises which we face.  What we are talking about here is the quality of our culture and its ability to respond to challenge and change.  Culture in this, its true sense, is &ldquo;the social heritage of a community: the total body of material artefacts, of collective mental and spiritual artefacts and distinctive forms of behaviour created by a people and transmitted from generation to generation&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Culture therefore, as Colonel Eoghan O'Neill has said recently, is something transmitted, communicated and learned. It includes both ideas and things, and how they are conceived, made or used. This information is passed on language which is the basic element of culture.</P>
    <P>But language is not simply a means of oral or written communication.  It's form, in turn, conditions our ideas and ethical values as Wittgenstein pointed out, and helps us to analyse and act on what we see in a particular and special way.  Irish culture thus defined rests, as O'Neill has said, primarily on the Irish language, because it was the language of the majority of the population until the last century. I would suggest that its continuing decline has de-energised and made less creative our entire society and has reinforced the demoralisation brought on by the wholesale emigration which accompanied it.</P>
    <P>A clear commitment to Irish language revival, therefore, in addition to the intrinsic value which this would have for Irish culture would, in my view, release new energies, ideas and commitment over the whole range of our economic and social life.  This is my answer to those who would question the value of Irish in a society which is so obviously beset by so many problems of an economic and social nature, all of which need urgent <Col N="11" /> attention.  My case in short, however badly I may put it, is that serious efforts to revive the language, far from diverting us from dealing with the long-running sores of unemployment, low production us from dealing with the long-running sores of unemployment, low production and poverty, may well revive a sense of national purpose without which little can be achieved.</P>
    <P>It could also be argued that attempts to develop more widespread usage of the Irish language would have an adverse effect on progress towards a political settlement between the two political traditions on the island and that, therefore, the Irish language should be set aside in the interest of a greater good.  This position ignores two fundamental realities. First, it ignores the fact that the majority of the people of Northern Ireland have a Gaelic cultural background, with Gaelic as their ancestral language.  Linked with this is the reality that Ulster Protestants played an immensely important role in the revival of the Irish language from about 1790 onwards in the industrial North.</P>
    <P>Secondly, it ignores the fact that any settlement between the traditions of this island must be based on an acceptance of diverse cultural streams within a commonly accepted social and political framework.  Surely, whatever settlement eventually emerges will reflect the diversity of social, cultural and political opinion on the island and will accord tolerance and support to diverse cultural priorities.</P>
    <P>In truth it can be said that the revival of Irish poses no greater threat to the cultural priorities of Ulster Protestants than it does to the cultural priorities of the 39 per cent of the people in the Republic who, according to a recent MRBI survey, would not like to see Irish more widely used in everyday life in the South.  In fact, of course, it poses no threat to either.  Rather, failure to make progress towards a wider use of Irish diminishes us all, while at the same time generating disenchantment and resentment among those to whom Irish is a matter of vital interest and concern.</P>
    <P>Indeed, as Eoghan O'Neill has said again, history provides innumerable <Col N="12" /> examples of tension, instability or conflict, where cultures have been ignored or suppressed, or where the existence of a particular cultural distinctiveness does not receive due recognition within a community or between communities.</P>
    <P>We have seen the results of such suppression in Northern Ireland.  It would be lamentable if new antagonisms were to be generated in the South in the future between those who are concerned at the precarious position of Irish and a State which refuses to go beyond lip-service. But we have not reached that point yet and hopefully we will be wise enough to take steps to avoid it.</P>
    <P>In its Action Plan, Bord na Gaeilge indicate that their medium-term strategy involves discernible movement towards a bilingual society by the year 2000.  This is clearly an acceptable and achievable objective, given political will at the level of the State itself.</P>
    <P>The recent MRBI survey indicated that 53 per cent of the population favoured a more widespread usage of Irish in everyday life and that is a hopeful baseline from which to begin.  It is no longer clear to me, however, and it has not been for at least two decades now, whether successive Governments and politicians, including myself, are committed to a bilingual society in any serious way.  I have no sense that such an objective has been at the centre of Government priorities during that time, or indeed that the objective of a bilingual society has been on Government agendas at all.</P>
    <P>The time has come, therefore, for all of us in all parties to ask ourselves honestly what do we wish to see done in relation to Irish.  Let us together take off the cloak of hypocrisy which has covered our positions in recent decades and let us be honest with ourselves and with the people.  If we do not care about Irish, if we are prepared to see it die, let us say so.  Then at least people can see where we stand and they can make up their minds about us and about the language, unfettered by verbal hypocrisy.</P>
    <P>If, on the other hand we care, then let us together start making the decisions which are necessary, not only to move <Col N="13" /> towards a bilingual society, but to secure the very survival of the language itself.</P>
    <P>I now turn briefly to some of the principal policy objectives which I see as being important in the period immediately ahead.  I do not propose to deal with all the recommendations and suggestions contained in the Bord na Gaeilge plan, even though I believe strongly that almost all of these are worthy of immense attention.</P>
    <P>I would like to distinguish four areas where we must begin to make progress. The first is in relation to the Oireachtas itself.  It is obvious from the speech which I have made, most of which has been in English, that my own fluency or level of facility in Irish is mixed, to put it mildly. I imagine that that is the case for most politicians in the Oireachtas.  However, if we are serious about our business, each of us, with whatever facility in Irish we have, should seek to utilise it in our day-to-day business here.  That at least gives a signal to the people that we are serious about it, that it is not something we pay lip service to on State occasions or occasions of public importance, but that we will try in our own ways to introduce it into our discussions and debates in the Oireachtas as frequently as we can. For my own part, I give that commitment, even though my feeble attempts today ran into difficulty when I could not read my script, because of the type size.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is important that the first thing we realise during our debate today is that we ourselves must give the lead.  I sense a feeling of isolation among many of the people outside who are activitists in the cause of the Irish language, and that is understandable.  We must reverse that by giving whatever we can ourselves to the language in terms of our own commitment in this institution here.  It is important that we seek clarification from the Government about the role of public bodies generally in the revival and development of usage of the Irish language.  It is discernible that the usage of Irish in public bodies has diminished over the last few decades, although Bord na Gaeilge are now involved in a process of trying to reverse that trend by setting up special programmes inside State bodies of all <Col N="14" /> kinds at local and national level so that there is greater usage of Irish and so that there is greater access and facility given to people with Irish when they seek to do business with these semi-State and other public bodies.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the Government come in behind Bord na Gaeilge in this attempt.  I am sure that would be their intention.  We have to do this and we have to be clear about precisely the rights of Irish language speakers in relation to public bodies.  That is another element of the commitment which the State must make in terms of its own operations in conducting its own business.</P>
    <P>Secondly, it is clear from the Bord na Gaeilge plan, and from all that has been said by all kinds of people, that an essential prerequisite to the survival of Irish, its usage and growth towards a bilingual society depend absolutely on the survival of the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>With your permission, a Chathaoirleach, I should like to quote some comments from the Bord na Gaeilge plan which seem to me to be apposite and should be put on the record of the House. On page 2 of the plan the board say:</P>
    <P>A major threat to the development of this type of bilingual community would be the continuing decline of the Gaeltacht.  It will not be possible to establish any kind of bilingualism in this country without the support of a significant &lsquo;basic community&rsquo;&mdash; in the Gaeltacht and elsewhere &mdash; in which Irish is the principal language or, at least, a language of major significance in daily life.  For the past 150 years this &lsquo;basic community&rsquo; has been declining steadily in the Gaeltacht.  In 1891, for example, 30 years before the foundation of the State, about 19% of the population in those counties now forming the Republic of Ireland claimed to be Irish speakers.  The great majority were native speakers in Gaeltacht areas.  Today, some 60 years after the foundation of the State, only c. 1% of our population can be said to be native speakers using Irish as their normal day-to-day language in Gaeltacht areas.  These figures lead inevitably to <Col N="15" /> the conclusion that there is very little hope indeed that Irish will survive as a community language in the Gaeltacht beyond the end of the century.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, it must be a first and fundamental part of any bilingual policy to arrest the decline of Irish as a community language in the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>That excerpt from the plan states in the starkest possible way that time is running out for the future of Irish in the Gaeltacht. The arrest of the decline in the language there must be a principal priority in terms of Irish language policy.</P>
    <P>The board go on to indicate a series of influences which have led to this situation to which I will refer briefly. The daily impact of a television service transmitting perhaps 95 per cent of its programme content in English is, of course, a disgrace. It also seems to me to be very much against the spirit of the legislation which led to the establishment of RTE. I say this without hypocrisy.  RTE must be told that the rights of Irish language speakers have got to be met in the terms of the programming policy, not only in the context of RTE 1 and 2 programming, but hopefully as rapidly as possible in the creation of an all-Irish language television station such as the Welsh language station they have in Wales.</P>
    <P>I do not think we can underestimate the effect of pumping through television enormous quantities of English language programmes into Gaeltacht areas.  It is very obvious that there is an immense hunger for Irish language television programmes in these areas.  Anybody who visits the Gaeltacht and sees the way in which people seek out Irish language programmes and watch them in massive numbers when they are available knows this.  The Government have a duty to make it clear to RTE that the very low level of existing Irish language programming is unacceptable, intolerable and is, indeed, a denial of the rights of those to whom Irish is a first language or at least a language which they use in their everyday lives.</P>
    <P>The board also point to the fact that <Col N="16" /> public bodies conduct their business predominantly through English in Gaeltacht areas.  I am referring in particular to local authorities and health boards.  This is not the case with Údarás na Gaeltachta, but it is true that other agencies make no attempt to see to it that business with people from the Gaeltacht is conducted through Irish in the way the Gaeltacht people would like to have it done.</P>
    <P>It is clear too that the linguistic effects of industrialisation have made their impact in the Gaeltacht areas.  The inflow of English-speaking residents, either following industry or for other reasons, has had an effect too.  We need urgently policies and commitments which will seek to reverse the impact which these influences are having on the Gaeltacht areas and which will seek to regenerate the feeling among Gaeltacht people that the State is behind them in their efforts to hold on to their living language.</P>
    <P>Currently it is important for me to point to the reality in relation to education. Obviously, education is a vital means through which we would seek to move towards a bilingual society.  However, despite the fact that the State is nominally committed to the achievement of this objective, in recent decades we have witnessed a continual decline in the status and quality of Irish in the educational system.  Here again we have a clear contradiction between the theoretical commitment of the State to bilingualism and the practice which it condones and indeed encourages.</P>
    <P>I should like to quote the concluding remarks in an article by Séamas Ó Buachalla on pages 29 and 30 of <i>The Crane Bag.</i> His comments summarise the present position very adequately and effectively indeed, and point to the urgent necessity for a revamping of policy in education relating to Irish.  He says:</P>
    <P>The substantial changes in the status of Irish within the educational system during the past two decades have been catalysed and influenced by a number of complex interacting factors.  The policies which sought to modernise and reorientate the economic system in the late fifties appeared to demand an attitudinal <Col N="17" /> shift which would regard attachment to established cultural values as a hindrance.  The Irish language was seen within the educational system as a symbol and central element of that culture.  Political developments during the seventies centering on Northern Ireland may have accelerated this process. In the educational reforms of the sixties policies of expansion and curricular renewal were implemented which liberated the system from the inertial rigidity characterising it for four decades. When some research findings offered evidence that policy on the Irish language needed rethinking, it became quite convenient to offload on the language policy all the inadequacies of the educational system.  The reality of course is that educational policy in the four decades after independence was determined more by the sensitivity surrounding Church-State relations rather than by the demands of language revival.</P>
    <P>He goes on to make various other points, but I will quote his conclusion where he said:</P>
    <P>Have we reached the stage when any integrated plan designed to link the educational system and society at large in a realistic policy of bilingualism, may come too late?  There is ample evidence to indicate that the Irish language within the school system is in a weak condition; its status is no better now than it was in the early years of the century.</P>
    <P>In looking at education there are a number of things which seem to me to be of fundamental importance.  First of all, we must begin to get back to the stage where teachers who teach Irish are competent to do so.  I am afraid in many cases this is not the case at present.  We need to review the programmes for teachers of Irish.  We need to review the method of access to teacher-training for Irish teachers, and we need to ensure as rapidly as possible that when we say we are teaching Irish in school we are doing so with teachers who are competent in this area.  Far too often nowdays, particularly at second <Col N="18" /> level education, the reality is that Irish is being taught by people who do not know it themselves.  Of course, that washes off on the pupils and it leads to the kind of consequences which we have seen in terms of output from education with facility in the language.</P>
    <P>It is important too that we begin to move towards the expansion of all-Irish naí-scoileanna, which in my experience have proven highly acceptable and successful. We need, in other words, to isolate key areas of education where we are failing to get across the Irish language in an effective way despite the many years which most pupils spend in school.  I would isolate two things in particular: the importance of teacher training, including in-service training; and, secondly, the development of naí-scoileanna at age four to seven.  Needless to say, the welcome trend, in recent years towards the development of all-Irish schools, particularly at primary level, should be encouraged, developed and funded as far as possible.  What one is looking for now is positive discrimination in favour of the Irish language.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer now to another set of proposals in the Bord na Gaeilge plan which seems to be among the priorities, that is, the need to create networks and centres at community level where people outside the Gaeltacht areas with a facility in Irish and who want to use it can meet. One of the big problems in Dublin is that there are very few places where people can meet who wish to speak Irish and make an effort to improve their knowledge of it.  This proposal should be pursued as rapidly as resources allow.  Let us also bear in mind that in the interim there is no reason why existing resources cannot be utilised to fulfil some of the purposes behind this proposal.</P>
    <P>It is important that we get more people on the ground to help activate those who wish to become more fluent in Irish or who wish to come to grips with Irish for the first time.  I do not think we are talking about large resources here.  We are talking about some manpower resources and some travelling expenses.  There is no reason why we cannot, by some means or other, provide more people to help <Col N="19" /> motivate those interested in the language, particularly those parents in the vicinity of Irish language schools who are capable of being easily motivated, given the right environment and resources.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to make one point in relation to staffing, particularly in relation to Bord na Gaeilge, where there is a genuine staffing problem at middle rank level.  There is a shortage of executive level staff.  This will have the effect of slowing down the ability of the board to get on with their work.  I would urge the Minister to have a look at this aspect as urgently as possible.  I am aware of the difficulties associated with the Government's manpower policy, but if this commitment to the Irish language means anything we have to be able to make special cases in relation to it and to discriminate in its favour.</P>
    <P>I recommend that we set up this all-party committee whose task will be to get down to the serious business of analysing policy in detail and monitoring the performance of successive Governments in the years ahead.  It is regrettable that I have not been able to speak in Irish here today.  I had hoped some months ago that I might have come to a level of fluency which would have allowed me to do so, but it is important that those of us who are committed to Irish &mdash; despite the fact that we are not fluent in it &mdash; should be prepared to stand and say &ldquo;Yes, we believe in this language and want to see it revived and developed, and we will do all in our power to help it&rdquo;.  It is also obvious that we have a responsibility, individually, to seek to become more fluent in Irish and I hope to achieve that aim some time in the future.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom an rún a mholadh.  Tá sé soiléir do gach duine anseo inniu go bfhuil géarchéim ann i dtaobh na Gaeilge agus tá sé fíor freisin go bhfuil mórán cainte déanta i dtaobh na géarchéime seo sna blianta ó thosaigh Conradh na Gaeilge ag obair chun an teanga a athbheocan, ach is oth liom a rá agus ceapaim má bhfuilimid i ndáirire maith anois agus a bhí 20 nó 30 bliain ó shin.  Ní ceart dúinn inniu milleán a chur <Col N="20" /> ar éinne i dtaobh na staide seo ach a fháil amach anois conas a fhéadfaimid leigheas a fháil ar an scéal.  Ceapaim go bfhuil níos mó fonn ar dhaoine anois an teanga a fhóghlaim mar táimid i gcrua-chás eacnamaíochta agus tá mórán daoine ann atá tar éis a fháil amach go dteastaíonn uathu níos mó ná saoltachas, saibhreas, cúrsaí eacnamaíochta nó pléisiúr bréagach, agus ceapaim má bhfuilimid i ndáirire go bhféadaimid plean a bhunú chun go mbeidh an teanga Gaeilge múinte i slíthe nua &mdash; go bhféadaimid san Oireachtas a thaispeáint go bhfuilimid i ndáirire agus go mbainimid níos mó úsáide as an chéad teanga.</P>
      <P>We are discussing this motion in an atmosphere when many people are extremely interested in the revival of not alone the Irish language but of our whole cultural heritage.  It is true that in times of economic problems people look away from the economic issues and towards the culture of their country, they look into themselves to find out what they can do to preserve their own image of themselves; they revert to religious beliefs and seem to find themselves a little bit more than when they were totally involved in economic matters.  I am not suggesting that people have to lose their jobs to find themselves, but unfortunately at times of economic difficulty this is often the case. If one looks at the attitude of people to religions &mdash; and I do not mean the normal religions we speak about, but cult religions &mdash; one will see what I am talking about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Caithfimid ár ndícheall a dhéanamh chun go mbeidh níos mó Gaeilge le fáil ar RTE.  Feicimse gurb é RTE an chéad úirlis a fhéadaimid a usáid chun go mbeidh níos mó Gaeilge á craoladh, agus aontaím leis na daoine a léiríonn gur ag dul ar chúl in ionad chun tosaigh atá staid na Gaeilge ar an teilifís faoi láthair. Aontaím le daoine éagsúla go bhfuil gá le stáisiún teilifíse a bheadh lán-Ghaelach nó dhá-theangach.  Tá deá-obair déanta ag Radio na Gaeltachta ach is léir go bhfuil sé ró-réigiúnach, agus is fíor go mbeadh sé níos fearr tríd is tríd dá mbeadh méadú ar na huaireannta craolta.  Tá sé an-riachtanach go mbeadh ath bhreithniú déanta <Col N="21" /> ar chláracha teilifise agus radio do pháistí.</P>
    <P>In our attitude to this motion we must look at new methods of getting people to understand what we mean when we speak about the revival of the Irish language. To me, the Irish language is not alone a revival of a means of communication, but it is a means of learning about our culture and our country.  As an intellectual exercise alone, it is worth reviving.  There is no doubt that RTE have failed totally in their efforts to maintain a knowledge of the Irish language, let alone extend it. I remember when the second television channel was being mooted, a very high-powered group went around the country trying to prove that we should have a second channel in Ireland rather than rebroadcast BBC or HTV programmes. I am afraid they did a disservice to this country by bringing in a second channel which, in my opinion, has no input into Irish culture or the Irish language.  The people in the south-east would have been better off watching HTV and BBC Wales, where they were getting a second language programme, Welsh, for three-quarters of the day.  It is amazing the number of people who picked up a reasonable knowledge of the Welsh language. Through an extension of the use of Welsh we have seen what has happened &mdash; they have now their Channel 4. If Telefís Eireann did as much in a bilingual sense as HTV and BBC Wales have done we would be closer to a bilingual society here and RTE would be fulfilling the function for which they were partly set up.  It is true that RTE have failed miserably in their attitude towards children and broadcasting for children.  RTE produce one children's programme a day which is shown at 2.45 in the afternoon. It is an English little jingle type programme but on Saturday mornings they reproduce quite a number of foreign programmes. Those programmes are excellent. They come from educational stations in the States and have taught many people how to appreciate the English language. With a bit of imagination RTE could do the same for the Irish language.</P>
    <P>As Senator O'Mahony said our educational system is failing miserably in its <Col N="22" /> attitude towards the Irish language and the Department of Education must be blamed for this.  Tá sé rí-shoiléir go bhfuil staid na Gaeilge sna scoileanna go huafásach anois agus aontaím le Coiste Gnó Chonradh na Gaeilge gur ceart go dtosnófaí ag bunú scoileanna lán Ghaelacha ar fud na tíre, go gcinnteofaí go mbeadh cumas árd sa Ghaeilge ag gach múinteoir Gaeilge, and that is extremely important.  Many people who are teaching Irish have no more than a basic interest in or knowledge of the language.  I have six children going through the school system at various levels and, unfortunately, the schools which they attend have lost to a large degree the will to teach Irish or to use Irish.  They have lost the love of Irish that was there.</P>
    <P>Is oth liom a rá go bhfuil scoil amháin ann, Coláiste De La Salle i bPort Láirge, agus nuair a bhí mise ann bhí múinteoir ann, Seán Ó Muirí, agus ní raibh an ceárd-teastais aige nó ní raibh aon chéim ó aon choláiste aige, ach bhí sé mar cheann de na múinteoirí is fearr a bhí in Éirinn, agus gach éinne a bhí ina rang bhí eolas aige ar an Ghaeilge agus nuair a bhí aon rud le rá ag an múinteoir is i nGaeilge a dubhairt sé é.  Ach níl seisean ann níos fuide.  Anois caithfidh gach múinteoir céim a bheith aige, ach níl aon Ghaeilge ag na múinteoirí agus níl suim ins an Ghaeilge ag mórán díobh.  Conradh na Gaeilge arís a chinnteofaidh go mbeidh cumas árd sa Ghaeilge ag gach múinteoir Gaeilge agus go mbunófar córas náisiúnta réamhscolaíochta as Gaeilge chun go ndéanfar cinnte de go mbeidh gach páiste ag fólaim Gaeilge go héifeachtach agus go gcuirfear níos mó béime ar labhairt na Gaeilge.  It is important that the spoken language is concentrated on more than the written language. In the old days the Leaving Certificate students who knew most Irish when they left school were those who studied the pass course because they did not have to go into the nuances of grammar.  They spent more time learning how to speak and read the language rather than how the language was built up.  It is not very important to know the grammar of the language.</P>
    <P>Tá sé an-thábhachtach go gcuirfí níos <Col N="23" /> mó béime ar labhairt na Gaeilge.  Mar a bhí déanta sna scoileanna, is ceart go múinfí ábhair eile i gnáth-scoileanna trí Ghaeilge.  Bíodh 50 faoin gcéad breis marcanna ins an Ard-Teistiméireacht le fáil má déanadh eolaíocht trí Ghaeilge. Ní hé mar atá anois.  Ceapaim gur ceart go mbeadh oideachas lán-Ghaelach ar fáil ar gach leibhéal do muintir na Gaeltachta agus go mbunófaí rannóg faoi leith sa Roinn Oideachais chun freastal ar fhorbairt na Gaelscolaíochta, go ndéanfaí forbairt ar na scéimeanna éagsúla a freastalaíonn ar dhaoine fásta gur mian leo Gaeilge a fhóghlaim.  We must look, as Bord na Gaeilge mentioned, at adult education and the place of the Irish language in adult education. A lot of good work is being done by Conradh na Gaeilge and has been done for many many years.  Many people may say they are a narrow group of people but without Conradh na Gaeilge there would not be Irish in many many places at this stage.  A disservice was done to the language by the people who should have been doing the service, the Department of Education and the educational system as a whole.  Were it not for the adult education courses available through groups like Conradh na Gaeilge the language would have died.</P>
    <P>Ba cheart go mbeadh gach éinne in ann a chuid gnó a dhéanamh trí Gaeilge i gach Roinn agus go ndéanfadh an Stát a chuid gnó sa Ghaeltacht trí Gaeilge amháin, agus go n-oibreodh na cúirteanna trí Gaeilge agus mar sin de. It is important that people should be able, if they want to, to do their business through Irish whether in a court, a county council or health board office.  Bord na Gaeilge in their suggestions made it plain that they are interested in seeing this type of action take place.  It is sickening to read of court cases being brought because people are not able to do their business through Irish or are not able to go into a Department of State and do their business through Irish.  It is something that the Department, and the board will have to look at carefully.</P>
    <P>Ceapann Conradh na Gaeilge go bhfuil gá ann Bille Cearta don Ghaeilge a bhunú <Col N="24" /> agus éilíonn siad go láidir go gcuirfí tús láithreach leis an bproiséas chun a leithéid a achtú.  It would seem to me that we have come to a sorry stage in Ireland when there has to be a bill of rights suggested for the Irish language, since the Irish language is supposed to be our first language.  According to Bord na Gaeilge and the Gaelic League, the Irish language has gone to such a state and is so neglected that a bill of rights is considered necessary.</P>
    <P>Léiríonn figiúirí as an Ghaeltacht chomh mór is atá cruacás na Gaeilge san Ghaeltacht.  Thit líon na gcainteorí Gaeilge san Ghaeltacht 7.4 faoin gcéad idir 1961-1971, agus thit céadatáin na cainteoirí Gaeilge san Ghaeltacht ó 86 i 1961 go dtí 83.3 i 1971.  Tá níos lú ná 50 faoin gcéad de pháistí na Gaeltachta ag freastal ar scoileanna náisiúnta ag tuilleadh deontas faoi scéim £10 Roinn na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>The situation in the Gaeltacht, as has been pointed out, has deteriorated and it has deteriorated for many reasons.  It has deteriorated because the State has not given the service to these areas and in some instances it has set up factories and put in managers with no Irish.  Equally it has been affected by the fact that teachers in the Gaeltacht no longer have to have the desired acquaintance with the Irish language that one would feel would be necessary and right in an Irish language area.</P>
    <P>It is extremely hard for parents in a Gaeltacht area to promote the language in their homes if they are not getting full support from the schools.  It should not be impossible for Údarás na Gaeltachta, Bord na Gaeilge or an Roinn Oideachais to set up special classes for non-Irish speakers working in Gaeltacht areas.</P>
    <P>Ceapaim go bhfuil áit ann do Chumann Lúthchleas Gael san phlean, mar tuigimse go bhfuil mórán daoine í Chumann Lúthchleas Gael go bhfuil beart acu an Ghaeilge a athbheochan ach níl dóthain literacha a scríobh go dtí baill den fhoireann: &ldquo;A Chara, You are selected ... Is mise, The County Secretary&rdquo;.  It is an insult to get a letter from civil servants, sometimes addressed to Oireachtas Members and members of the public, <Col N="25" /> starting with &ldquo;A Chara&rdquo; but they cannot write the rest of the letter in Irish because they are afraid the message might not get across.</P>
    <P>Tá dóchas ann i measc daoine go bhféaidimís uilig feabhas a dhéanamh ar an scéal agus caithfimid san Oireachtas ár ndícheall a dhéanamh chun cabhair a thabhairt do gach aicme go bhfuil fonn orthu an chéad teanga a usáid nó a fhóghlaim.  Molaim a bhfuil déanta ag Bord na Gaeilge go dtí seo agus aontaím leo go' bhfuil gá le gach aicme a bheith páirteach san Action Plan Gaeltachta, an pobal uilig, an Roinn Oideachais agus an Stát.  Aontaím leis an moladh go mbeadh Ceisteanna as Gaeilge curtha ar Chlár na Dála agus go dtógfaí ceist amháin ar a laghad as Gaeilge gach lá a mbíonn Tráth na gCeist sa Dáil agus go labhródh cainteoir amháin ar a laghad as gach páirtí as Gaeilge ar an Dara Céim de gach Bille agus go molfadh an Rialtas go gach Aire Gaeilge a labhairt ar ócáidí oiriúnacha a mbeadh tuairisc ghinearálta ar obair a Roinne á tabhairt aige don Dáil nó don Seanad.</P>
    <P>We in the Oireachtas are also to blame for the problems of the Irish language. The Oireachtas has indulged in a lot of pious platitudes but the language is not used to the extent it should be used.  I am glad that this debate is taking place and that all parties here can see, at this late stage, the need to look at the Action Plan of Bord na Gaeilge.  We in the Houses of the Oireachtas should give a lead in the very hard job that is ahead of us if we are to ensure the survival, not to mind the revival, of the Irish language.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome the action plan.  I am not an Irish speaker. I have read the plan and it is well constructed. I would like to express solidarity with my colleagues in support of the plan. It provides for leadership, accountability and good consultation with regard to the required procedures.  The plan will lead to co-ordination and co-operation and I like the idea of the short-term linking into the intermediate term.  It is very seldom we get that in plans presented to us. We usually get long-term plans with no <Col N="26" /> short-term movement to knit into such plans.</P>
      <P>The survival of the language is attainable. At first, it might seem that it might be unattainable, but taken step-by-step and in the way the plan is set out, it is attainable.  What we have to consider is that the rules have changed because we are living in a changing world.  Plans can go wrong.  The rate of change is rapid. Many things take over and the plan may be relegated to a minor position by people who might be able to help.  If the plan is going wrong it should be scrapped and started again and I urge those in authority to bear that in mind.</P>
      <P>From my own background I must introduce some small note of caution.  Quite frankly we do not always pick the best people to do the job when we are making appointments to State positions.  We do not always pick the best leaders, as has been shown in the past.  It is not the best player on the team but the person who is in a position to give the right type of leadership that is required, in other words, someone with a Henry Ford mentality. When Henry Ford's engineers told him they could not produce an engine with eight cylinders he sent them away to continue trying.  They worked on it for 12 months but still told him that they could not do it.  He told them that nothing was impossible and they finally did it and that is how the famous Ford V8 was created. I would urge people in positions of leadership to try to impress on people who are responsible to them that success is attainable.  There is no excuse for failure but there must be co-operation and understanding.  Much rests on the heads of people who are to be placed in positions of leadership.  Either they are motivators or they are not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know that there are people who are enthusiastic about the language but there is a big problem in trying to create a desire for Irish in the minds of the people where such desire does not exist. I went to primary school only but while I was there I hated Irish, or at least I thought I hated it.  This was because it was mixed up with false patriotism and used to teach us about the Sheares brothers or some other such people.  Possibly <Col N="27" /> I could not grasp the Irish.  I left school at the age of 12.  The problem was that we were not being taught Irish in the right way and, consequently, there was no desire in us for the language.  As I went through life and travelled the world I regretted not having Irish.  When one goes to Strasbourg, for instance, and hears one's colleagues speaking the language, one feels foolish.  One does not know when to laugh or when to cry.  At a time like that one realises that one is envious of people who have mastered the language, who are so fluent in it, and who in fact have put an awful lot into trying to help the language forward.  Desire for the language can be encouraged. Obviously the youth will be the main target in trying to instil in others a desire for Irish.  A person who left school in 1932 would have great difficulty in returning to successful studies now.  He would have lost the capacity to learn.  All he could do would be to spend some time in the Gaeltacht.  A crowd of fellows going from the inner city to Connemara and indulging in a booze-up would hardly come back fluent in the Gaeilge.  Somebody has to start thinking of dealing with people who are not so young but who might still have the desire to learn the language.</P>
    <P>I would like to get a grip of the Irish language but the desire to learn it is not strong enough in me because other matters have taken over my life.  We must emphasise the question of creating, through the education process, a desire for Irish.  I would be concerned about a situation in which people might have to rely on an Irish-English dictionary in order to learn the language.  At the rate of learning two or three words per night, they would need to spend six or seven years before acquiring any real knowledge of the subject.  But if that was the only means available in some instances, it might be of some help.</P>
    <P>We talk of diploma courses at university. Why must it be a university only that can award diplomas?  Why can there not be some sort of diploma that is not necessarily a university diploma?  Why, for example, cannot the Catholic <Col N="28" /> Workers College or the College of Industrial Relations be looked at to see can they give some sort of diploma, not the top level diploma, but some sort of diploma or certificate?  There are other places like those to which trade unionist activists go to pursue courses.</P>
    <P>It may be somewhat early to talk about a phrase book for tourists when we cannot get a grip of the language ourselves but at least if there was a phrase book for non-tourists, it might be a help.</P>
    <P>We have to be very honest about what we are talking about.  We have been criticising Radio Éireann and Telifís Éireann for not putting on programmes in Irish but let us be clear about it and let us understand the people we are dealing with.  One could put an Irish-speaking person on the &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme every evening but at the end of a week there would be people who would not know that person's name because &ldquo;Dallas&rdquo; or some other programme would have taken priority.  What happens in many homes where Irish is not understood is that when an Irish-language programme is broadcast on radio, the family switch to some other station.  The same applies to motorists who have radios in their cars and who do not understand Irish.</P>
    <P>I agree that the amount of time given to the Irish language on our radio and television programmes is not adequate in terms of the proportion of the population who wish to hear or see such programmes. I think they have got a raw deal there.  We have to bear in mind that Teilifís Éireann do not give much co-operation and they need to be talked to in regard to their attitude and why there is not a sufficient number of programmes going out.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Mahony mentioned teachers who were teaching Irish but did not know Irish.  I know a number of people who are not teachers but can teach Irish very well.  I know two or three people who could give children grinds and help them to get their leaving certificate. Many such people are receiving unemployment assistance and this matter should be considered.  Is there any reason why the teaching of Irish must be confined <Col N="29" /> only to teachers in this plan of action?  There is no reason why people who have a good leaving certificate with a high grade in Irish cannot be employed to help children in their neighbourhood to do well in Irish in their leaving certificate.</P>
    <P>There are other areas that need to be looked at.  We have fanatic Dublin supporters but we also have fanatic Gaelic speakers who are trying to push it too hard and have not the right approach to it.  The whole question of fanaticism must be looked at as well.</P>
    <P>Overall I see the plan as being very good.  I mentioned earlier the qualities I see in the plan and it is now a question of creating the desire among people and making sure that the faith in it is not perverted.  Also it is a question of motivation. There must be no question of pulling back.  The plan must go ahead and we must make sure that the people in positions of leadership are responsible for making sure that everything else ticks over in a very active and hard-working way.  Otherwise the plan is doomed to failure.</P>
    <P>Provision should be made if possible to give an annual grind to children who have not got the money for private tuition when they are coming up to intermediate certificate, group certificate or some other examination.</P>
    <P>I support the plan.  It has my full solidarity. I hope some day to be able to stand up here and say &ldquo;Tá mé go maith, Conas tá tú féin?&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CatherineMcGuinness" hpid="Mrs. McGuinness Mrs. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join other Senators in supporting the motion before the House that an all-party Oireachtas Committee be set up to consider the plan published by Bord na Gaeilge.  At the moment I am taking the place of my colleague, Senator Brendan Ryan, who will no doubt have a great deal more to add to this, but there are one or two areas to which I would like to draw attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present situation of the Irish language has been described by Cumann na Gaeilge as géirchéim na Gaeilge &mdash; and géirchéim na Gaeilge is what it is indeed. It is a very difficult situation in which the <Col N="30" /> Irish language finds itself at the moment. There are two major areas which are primary causes of these difficulties because they have a major influence on the life of every person in this country.  I refer, firstly, to the area of the schools and, secondly, to the area of television broadcasting.</P>
    <P>With regard to the area of schools, some years ago the coláistí ullmhúcháin, the preparatory colleges in which teachers were educated before they went on to teacher-training colleges, were abolished. I am not saying that these preparatory colleges were totally without fault or that they were absolutely ideal.  However, at one time people who were going to be teachers in the national school system &mdash; and the national school system is the system that applies to virtually all children &mdash; attended these preparatory colleges, na coláistí ullmhúcháin, and they went on to teacher training colleges with a good solid speaking and writing knowledge of the Irish language.  They came out of the teacher training colleges with that knowledge improved.  They went on as teachers in the national schools able to put across their knowledge. It seems that since these colleges were abolished there has been a steady decline in the ability of ordinary national teachers to speak and to teach Irish as they should.</P>
    <P>I am not using this as a stick to beat the national teachers with or as an accusation against them, but nevertheless it has been put to me that up to a few years ago if you asked a national teacher for an interview on the radio in the Irish language you could rely on the fact that he or she would be able to speak Irish.  This is no longer so, and it is increasingly no longer so.  If we do not produce the teachers in the basic school systems who can put across both knowledge and love of the Irish language we will fail to produce the same knowledge and love in our children. While I am not necessarily suggesting that we should bring back the preparatory colleges, this is an area which all the Irish language organisations &mdash; Bord na Gaeilge, Cumann na Gaeilge and so on &mdash; would expect us to have a look at in this proposed select committee.  Unless <Col N="31" /> we can produce this at the basic level we cannot possibly succeed in teaching our children to speak Irish.</P>
    <P>The second matter relates to television and broadcasting.  Obviously, all the Senators who know me will feel that I have a vested interest in this area, but it is not because of my vested interest that I am saying this.  Television broadcasting in this country is, as Senator Harte has made very clear, one of the most influential things in our society.  We have only to look at the way in which Irish society has changed in all sorts of attitudes since Telifís Éireann started in the early 1960s to realise what an influential medium this is.  In a great many households, particularly those where books are not read, households which might be described as not particularly culturally orientated, the television set is probably the most important cultural influence.  Yet the amount of broadcasting in the Irish language on Telifís Éireann has steadily declined until it has reached a very low ebb at present. One of the difficulties which those who are working in this area have is that there is a kind of &ldquo;ghettoisation&rdquo; of Irish, that one is expected to produce programmes in Irish which deal only with the Gaeltacht or with Irish or with the things that should be of interest to people who already speak Irish.  But it seems to me that the whole point should be that programmes are produced in the Irish language which deal with ordinary everyday life or with vital news.  The other day we had a report of a most important case in Strasbourg.  Did we have anyone interviewed in Irish on that subject?  It is important that we deal with the things that happen ever day, for instance, the Cherryville train disaster, somebody being shot in Northern Ireland and not just little shut-in ghettoisation of it where we say that Irish speakers want some programme about what is happening in Connemara, west Clare or west Kerry. That is not the way to handle this matter. Irish should be included in the news, in current events and in the things which vitally affect ordinary people's lives.  As long as we treat it in the way that we do <Col N="32" /> we tend to fall into the situation of the gentleman who spoke at the feis in Myles na gCopaleen's <i>An Béal Bocht</i> where, I am sure many of you will remember, he had to make the speech about opening the feis.  He referred to everything in terms of the Irish language and life in the Gaeltacht: therefore it was good and nothing could be referred to outside that. I am sure many of you who have, like myself, enjoyed that book will know exactly what I mean when I say that there is a danger of turning all our Irish broadcasting into opening speeches for the feis in <i>An Béal Bocht.</i></P>
    <P>As far as sound broadcasting is concerned, we have the enormous plus of Radio na Gaeltachta which has been very successful and which not only is heard in the Gaeltacht areas but, through VHF, can be heard all over the country and I do not mean just all over the State.  This is a step forward.  Nevertheless, hand in hand with that, we have a decline in the amount of broadcasting in Irish in ordinary sound radio.  As Senator Harte said, you have your car radio on and you listen to it and if a programme in Irish comes on, if it is a programme of special interest to Irish, you will not make the effort to understand if you have not got fluent Irish but if it is about something that is of vital interest, such as will Ford's shut in Cork, then you will make the effort to understand.  Therefore, it is important to try to use Irish in the broadcasting system in a way which will make people who have imperfect Irish improve their Irish rather than making it a shut-off area for specialists and what Senator Harte refers to as fanatics.</P>
    <P>When we look at some of the things which are proposed in the plan, I emphasise also the necessity for the development of theatre in the Irish language. This is something again which tends to have at least partially declined in recent years.  I remember as a student attending many productions in the Abbey Theatre where if you stayed on late you saw a play in Irish, at no charge.  There is nobody like students for wanting to get something for free as well.  Ernest Blythe, the man who has been castigated in many ways by writers after his death, <Col N="33" /> arranged that if you attended the Abbey, very often you got a one act play in Irish thrown in at the end.  This was a great encouragement to people who were interested in the theatre.  Again there were the regular productions in the Damer Hall in St. Stephen's Green and they attracted an audience who were interested in theatre in the Irish language. I should like to support the proposals made in the plan that theatre should be promoted.</P>
    <P>Although we are surrounded by so many bad signs in the progress of the Irish language, for example, the decline in the number of speakers in the Gaeltacht, the decline in the number of people who speak Irish only, one of the good signs is the number of writings and publications in the Irish language and the amount of public support which they get. There is no doubt that we have more writing in Irish now than in previous years and the public are more interested in it. People who write books in Irish have a genuine public who read them.  This shows that there is a desire for good material in Irish &mdash; the kind of desire that would provide an audience for the sort of radio and television programmes I am talking about.  They are also more open in their nature as literature.  They deal with subjects with a wider sort of literature than they did in past years when they might have been the sort of thing that was caricatured in <i>An Beal Bocht,</i> the kind of Gaeltacht novel where everything was about how you lived in the corner of the glen, how poor you were and how you spent your time going out fishing from the Donegal coast, or whatever. They are more cosmopolitan and varied in nature and one of the hopeful signs is the amount of writing in Irish and the public that there is for it.</P>
    <P>Another hopeful sign is the demand for schools for young children in which all teaching is through Irish.  It is essential that as much encouragement as possible should be given to these schools.  The more the State encourages very young children to learn to speak Irish, the more the language will progress, because it is at that age that one learns.  It is not without significance that the words &ldquo;mother <Col N="34" /> tongue&rdquo; are used to describe somebody's language because it is very often from the mother that someone learns the language. This is brought out in statistics which show that in Gaeltacht families where wives are brought in from outside the Gaeltacht, there tends to be a decline in the use of Irish in the family because it is the mother who puts across the use of any language.  If we use all-Irish schools at an infant level we will encourage children not to approach Irish in the way in which Senator Harte has described, not to feel when they are put into the ordinary national school or the secondary school that this is an impediment, or a burden on them but that this is something they can understand, enjoy and which will go hand in hand with their interest in traditional Irish music which has improved so much and extended its attraction in the last few years.  Support for all-Irish speaking schools, especially at that level, is essential.</P>
    <P>On Saturday when I attended a conference of the Council on the Status of Women I was sorry that that conference was being picketed at the gate of Jury's Hotel by a group of people from Leixlip who were seeking an all-Irish school for their children but had so far failed to obtain it.  While I am not aware of the whole background to this situation, it is a pity that as a woman going in to a Women's conference I was faced with a group of mothers who said, &ldquo;Please take our leaflets.  We want to have our children educated though Irish and nobody will help us to do so&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Closely related to this, and mentioned in the plan, is the position of teaching aids.  This has been a long time problem of textbooks in Irish for all the various courses that are needed in school.  Some are excellent but in other areas there is a great gap and this is something that is essential to deal with.</P>
    <P>As far as the Gaeltacht is concerned, it is very serious that there is such a decline in numbers, not just of people who use Irish all the time in the home but a decline of monoglots, people who speak only Irish.  While bilingualism is desirable, in regard to the position of minority languages in other countries it is true that <Col N="35" /> it is a danger sign when you reach the stage when there is virtually no one at all left who can only speak that language and cannot also speak the stronger language, as it were.  We must face up to the fact that, commercially and internationally speaking, English is a stronger language.  If we are going to reach a situation where there is no one left who cannot speak English, then there is a grave danger that Irish will go on declining in the Gaeltacht.  We need to take every possible step to encourage it to remain there and move outwards from it, as the plan suggests.</P>
    <P>We have seen complaints from various people that there are signposts in the Gaeltacht &mdash; I know from experience this is certainly the case in Connemara &mdash; only in Irish.  Tourists will ask how they will know how to find their way, because they have maps in English but the signposts are in Irish.</P>
    <P>I would ask that the Ordnance Survey and the people connected with it should make a better effort to produce popular easily available maps where the names of the places are in Irish as well.  Tourists often speak French, Dutch or some Scandinavian language and have not any particular expertise in English.  If the map and the signposts match each other, they have no problem.  Their problem is that, while we have provided signposts in Irish which says, say &ldquo;Casla&rdquo;, the map continues to say &ldquo;Costelloe&rdquo; or the signpost says &ldquo;Clochán&rdquo; and the map says &ldquo;Clifden.&rdquo; They really have a genuine problem. If they had maps in Irish easily available &mdash; on sale, say, at every garage &mdash; they would not have the same problem. It is not any harder for them to follow if both are in Irish than it is if both are in English.  It would be well worthwhile to try to do small things like that.</P>
    <P>Just to return to the major idea of promotion of the Irish language, this must be done through everyday life.  It is very threatening to Irish that Bord na Gaeltachta and Connradh na Gaeilge can draw attention to the fact that it is so difficult to transact one's ordinary business in Irish.  Therefore, Irish is again being driven into a sort of specialist area. <Col N="36" /> In the last few days I have been reading the very attractive and interesting book <i>Up At The Park</i> which was written by Mrs Shannon, the wife of the former American Ambassador.  One of the things that she remarks on is the education of her children.  She encouraged the younger children, who had not got very far on in their education, to take Irish in the schools that they went to, even though, theoretically, as diplomatic children they were exempted from having to do so.  She remarked how extraordinary it was how very few people in Ireland seem to speak Irish in spite of the fact that they were all taught Irish in school. This is a significant remark from a woman who is very clearly sympathetic to things Irish, who wanted Ireland to do well and who has written a book in which she describes her pleasure and her delight in Irish life.  Unless we can, through this action plan for Irish and through action by the Oireachtas and the organs of Government, make Irish a vehicle for everyday life, then we will have failed.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a chur in iúl do Sheanadóirí as ucht an réitigh seo. Ba mhaith liom cúpla focal a rá anois i dtosach agus ba mhaith liom ansin go dtugtaí cead dom freagraí a thabhairt ar <Col N="37" /> na pointí a ardófar, go deimhin cuid acu atá ardaithe go dtí seo ag na daoine go bhfuil páirt glactha acu sa díospóireacht, ceathrar Seanadóirí, agus ba mhaith liom tagairt a dhéanamh don méid atá ráite acu agus a bheidh le rá ag Seanadóirí eile ina ndiaidh sin a bhfuil mé cinnte go mbeidh siad ag ardú pointí.</P>
      <P>Táimid uile faoi chomaoin ag na Seanadóirí a chuir de stró orthu féin an tairiscint seo a chur ar an gclár oibre agus í a moladh anseo inniu.  Is cúis dóchais dúinn go bhfuil fonn ar an oiread sin Seanadóirí gach tacaíocht is féidir a thabhairt dár dteanga dhúchais agus gach dícheall a dhéanamh chun í a chur chun cinn.</P>
      <P>Ní gá domsa an tábhacht is cuimse a bhaineann leis an nGaeilge a mhíniú daoibhse ach b'fhéidir mar sin féin nár mhiste roinnt pointí a lua ar mhaithe leo siúd nach dtuigeann an scéal chomh maith céanna.  Cé go raibh baint mhór ag traidisiúin eile i gcruthú chultúr an lae inniu in Éirinn, is iad fréamhacha an traidisiúin Ghaelaigh is doimhne a théann síos i stair na tíre.  Is í an Ghaeilge, ar ndóigh, teanga dhúchais na tíre seo le cúpla míle bliain agus is í a bhí mar ghnáth-theanga ag formhór mór ár sinsear anuas go dtí an céad seo caite.  Is í an comhartha is suntasaí í ar ár náisiúntacht agus is í is mó a thugann dath agus daonúlacht don phearsantacht Éireannach.</P>
      <P>Is taisce í an Ghaeilge ina gcnuasaítear ní amháin samhlaíocht fhileata mhuintir na hÉireann ach freisin a mothú spioradálta, a ndúil sa tsaoirse, a leagan éirime agus meoin, agus a saíocht agus a nósanna dúchais.  Dá dtárlódh, de dheasca neamhshuime nó fuarchúise, go ligfí don teanga dul in éag, ní bheadh slánú go deo ar mhéid an chaillteanais. An mhuintir nach mbeadh mothú ceangail acu lena sean, agus tuaiscint acu ar a dtéann de shnáithí i ndual a ndúchais, ní bheadh i ngach glúin díobh ach daoine gan bun fréimhe, gan tuiscint ar a n-oidhreacht, gan aon ionannas soaitheanta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I dteannta leis an nGaeilge tá teanga idirnáisiúnta ag teastáil uainn agus tarlaíonn go bhfuil an Béarla againn sa tír seo le fada.  Tuigfear mar sin nach ag <Col N="38" /> iarraidh an Béarla a ruaigeadh atáimid ach ag iarraidh an Ghaeilge a neartú i gcaoi go mbeidh sí slán feasta.</P>
    <P>Bhí an-áthas ormsa gur ar mo chrannsa a thit sé Plean Gníomhaíochta don Ghaeilge 1983-1986 a chur i láthair an phobail go foirmiúil mí Aibreáin seo caite.  Is fada a bhíomar ag feitheamh le córas faoina bhféadfaí an teanga a chur chun cinn ar bhonn náisiúnta pleanáilte agus tá moladh agus buíochas ag dul do Bhord na Gaeilge a d'ullmhaigh an plean. Tá spriocanna leagtha amach i gcaoi go mbeidh dreamanna éagsúla ag obair as lámha a chéile agus comhoibriú agus tacaíocht le fáil ó réimsí éagsúla an phobail.</P>
    <P>Ní miste a mhíniú nach plean cuimsitheach atá i gceist ach plean oibre teoranta ceithre bliana a bhfuil cuid mhaith de na spriocanna ann aontaithe leis na daoine agus na heagrais a bheidh á gcur i bhfeidhm.  Ó tharla nach raibh deis ann na spriocanna a aontú roimh ré i ngach uile chás, lean an obair sin ar aghaidh agus bíonn an bord i gcomhairle go rialta le daoine agus le heagrais éagsúla i dtreo go mbeidh barr feabhais agus foirfeachta á chur ar an bplean.</P>
    <P>Ba chúis sásaimh ar leith domsa gur ghlac an Rialtas leis an bplean agus gur chuir siad ráiteas amach a léirigh an cúram atá orthu féin.  Seo cúpla abairt as an ráiteas sin:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Glacann an Rialtas leis gur gá, i dtreo go mairfidh an teanga, féachaint chuige go mbeidh an Ghaeilge á húsáid mar ghnáthmheán cumarsáide ag go leor daoine lena chinntiú go mbeidh sí slán feasta.  Dearbhaíonn siad mar sin go bhfuil de chúram orthu timpeallacht a chruthú a thacóidh dáiríre leosan a roghnaíonn an Ghaeilge mar phríomhtheanga nó mar theanga bhunúsach ina saol laethúil.</P>
    <P>Tuigimid uile go bhfuil obair mhór le déanamh chun timpeallacht shásúil den chineál atá riachtanach a chruthú agus go mbeidh tacaíocht de dhíth ó gach aon dream sa tír chun na torthaí is fearr a bhaint amach.  Baineann an obair sin le mórchuspóir tábhachtach náisiúnta atá chomh fairsing agus chomh hiltaobhach le saol an phobail fhéin.  Ní foláir do gach <Col N="39" /> uile dhream páirt ghníomhach a ghlacadh san obair &mdash; an Rialtas, Tithe an Oireachtais, na páirtithe polaitíochta, an córas Stáit ar fad, ar a n-áirítear Ranna Rialtais agus eagrais Stát-tionscanta, muintir na Gaeltachta, na heagrais Ghaeilge, eaglaisí, comhlachtaí gnó, ceardchumainn, eagrais fheirmeoireachta, institiúidí oideachais, lucht siamsaíochta agus drámaíochta, foilsitheoirí, nuachtóirí, iriseoirí agus soláthróirí seirbhísí den uile chineál.</P>
    <P>Is cúis bróid dúinn uile gur glacadh go maith tríd is tríd leis an bplean agus is é atá uainn anois ná brú ar aghaidh oiread is féidir linn leis an obair i gcaoi go mbeidh toradh fónta ar ár saothar agus i dtreo go sroichfear na spriocanna a shonraítear sa phlean.  Beidh an Stát go mór i gceist sna hiarrachtaí a bheidh ar siúl chun an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn agus tuigim go bhfuil socruithe á gcur i bhfeidhm ag an Roinn Oideachais agus ag Roinn na Seirbhíse Poiblí d'fhonn na spriocanna atá ceaptha dóibh a bhaint amach.  Tig liom a rá freisin ó thaobh mo Roinne féin go bhfuil an Bhuíon Chomhordaithe a luaitear faoi mhír 1.1 den phlean i mbun oibre.  Agus, ar ndóigh, tá Bord na Gaeilge ar a ndícheall le féachaint chuige go mbeidh comhghuaillíocht fheidhmiúil ó gach uile dhream d'fhonn go bhféadfar dul chun cinn suntasach a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Is gnó casta, fadálach é beartas teanga a cheapadh, a fhorbairt agus a fheidhmiú, agus beidh stuaim thar an gcoiteann agus foighne as cuimse ag teastáil chun na torthaí is fearr a bhaint amach.</P>
    <P>Obair ghríosaithe agus spreagtha is mó a bheidh ar siúl chun tuilleadh Gaeilge a chur á labhairt ag an bpobal.  Is beag duine sa tír seo anois nár fhoghlaim Gaeilge uair éigin ach, ó tharla nach mbíonn cleachtadh ag a bhformhór ar í a úsáid, cailleann siad a ngreim uirthi agus is leasc leo í a labhairt.  Chun iad sin a mhealladh ní foláir deiseanna taitneamhacha a chur ar fáil dóibh chun feidhm a bhaint as an teanga agus, de réir a chéile, tiocfaidh feabhas ar a gcumas labhartha i gcaoi nach fada go mbeidh líofacht acu. Caithfear an bhá atá go fairsing ag an bpobal leis an teanga, ach nach ndéantar <Col N="40" /> beart dá réir go minic, a shaothrú ar dhóigh go mbeidh fonn orthu iarracht phearsanta leanúnach a dhéanamh le go mbeidh an Ghaeilge á húsáid chomh minic agus is féidir.</P>
    <P>Is eol daoibh uile an tionchar is féidir a bheith ag an Seanad agus ag an Dáil ar shlí nó ar shlí eile ar shaol na tíre seo.  Is eol daoibh freisin an tábhacht thar cuimse a bhaineann leis an dea-shampla agus an treoir cheart nuair a bhíonn gá leo.  Tá daoine ann a cheapann go bhféadfadh Tithe an Oireachtais níos mó a dhéanamh ar mhaithe leis an nGaeilge agus tá faitíos orm gur deacair é sin a shéanadh.  Tuigim, ar ndóigh, go mbíonn cúraimí go leor i réimsí éagsúla de shaol na tíre le comhlíonadh ag ionadaithe tofa agus nach minic a bhíonn an deis acu aire mar ba mhaith leo a thabhairt don Ghaeilge. Tuigim chomh maith gur mór an spéis phearsanta atá ag Seanadóirí agus ag Teachtaí áirithe i gceist na Gaeilge agus nach gcailleann siad aon deis ar bith chun í a chur chun cinn ina saol féin.  Ach sílim go mbíonn daoine ag dúil le heiseamláir chinnte ó Thithe an Oireachtais san obair thábhachtach náisiúnta a bhaineann le cur chun cinn na Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>Mar chéad chéim chun an Ghaeilge a chur ar aghaidh sna Tithe seo tá nósmhaireachtaí simplí áirithe molta sa phlean a dheimhneodh go mbeadh ábhairín éigin Gaeilge á úsáid go rialta, ó lá go lá agus ó sheachtain go seachtain, sa Dáil agus sa Seanad.  Níl ansin, ar ndóigh, ach an tús agus ba cheart go mbeifí in ann i bhfad níos mó ná sin a dhéanamh ach dul i mbun oibre le fonn agus le fuinneamh.</P>
    <P>Is iad na Seanadóirí féin is fearr a thuigeann céard is féidir a bhaint amach sa Teach seo agus tá dóchas agamsa go dtiocfaidh méadú fiúntach ar an méid Gaeilge a bheidh le cloisteáil anseo go rialta ón lá seo amach.  Ar an mbealach sin is fearr a léireofar don phobal nach bhfuil aon easpa dáiríreachta ag baint leis an tairiscint thábhachtach atá á plé againn.</P>
    <P>Is é mo thuairimse gur maith is fiú comhchoiste de chuid an Oireachtais a bhunú mar atá beartaithe &mdash; ní amháin chun an Plean Gníomhaíochta don Ghaeilge 1983-1986 a bhreithniú ach <Col N="41" /> chun monatóireacht a dhéanamh go rialta ar an dul chun cinn faoin bplean.  Táim cinnte nach miste bheith ag brath ar an gComhchoiste chun moltaí maithe agus comhairle chiallmhar a chur ar fáil dúinn.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom deis a bheith agam teacht ar ais arís agus na pointí a ardaíodh go dtí seo agus na pointí a ardófar sa chuid eile den díospóireacht a fhreagairt sula mbeidh deireadh leis an díospóireacht seo.  Tá mé faoi chomaoin agat an deis sin a thabhairt dom.</P>

      <P>Is cúis áthais dom i dtosach labhairt ar an tairiscint seo faoi Plean Gníomhaíochta don Ghaeilge ó 1983 go dtí 1986 agus faoi staid na Gaeilge i gcoitinne.  Is cúis áthais dom freisin go ndearnadh Seanad Éireann a ath-ghairm in aon turas leis na ceisteanna práinneacha seo a phlé.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh díospóireacht rathúil againn agus go dtiocfar dá thoradh ar mholtaí, nó beartas éigin, a rachaidh chun leas na Gaeilge agus a bheas ina ábhar dóchais do gach duine ar spéis leis an teanga agus an náisiúntacht.</P>
      <P>Is léir nach féidir an plean seo a phlé go mion san achar aimsire atá againn anseo Cuirim fáilte roimhe agus tá súil agam go mbeidh dea-thoradh agus rath ar a dtiocfaidh as ins an Teach seo agus i dTeach eile an Oireachtais agus ins an tír tré chéile.  Tá go leor ag baint leis an bplean atá le moladh.  Is beag, go deimhin, nach bhfuil sé ar fad le moladh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ar an gcéad dul síos, tá plean á thairiscint dúinn.  Is plean gníomhaíochta é.  Is é sin, tá intinn ag lucht riartha an phlean gníomh dá réir a dhéanamh agus an plean a chur ar bun.  Tá moltaí fiúntacha sa bplean.  Gealltar dúinn go gcuirfear na moltaí sin i bhfeidhm taobh istigh de spriocanna áirithe agus is cúis mhisnigh agus ábhar dóchas dúinn é sin.  Ta sé sin ar fad go breá ach tá tréith amháin le sonrú sa bplean a chuireann duine in amhras faoi.  Ins an réamhfhocal, cuir i gcás, agus in áiteanna eile léirítear míchinnteact faoi mholtaí agus spriocanna éagsúla.  Cén fath, cuir i gcás, go ndeirtear a leithéid seo: &ldquo;dá mbeadh sé ina chuspóir&rdquo;; &ldquo;dá gcuirfí chuige i &ldquo;gceart&rdquo;; &ldquo;ba chuspóir in-shroiste é-dá... Ní thuigim seo agus ba mhaith liom míniú a <Col N="42" /> fháil ar an leagan choinníollach de chuid mhaith cásanna mar sin.  Cen fáth nach í an aimsir fháistineach atá i gceist in áit an leagain choinníolligh?  Ní thuigim é ach tá suil agam nach bhfuil aon chúis ar leith leis.</P>
    <P>D'iarr an tAire orainn ins an ráiteas breá, misniúil, croíúl a thug sé dúinn aon cheisteanna atá againn a chur chuige agus go ndéanfadh sé gach iarracht iad a fhreagairt. Tá mé cinnte go mbeidh sé in ann é sin a dhéanamh.  An chéad cheist atá agam le cur ar an Aire ná, an plean Rialtais é plean gníomhaíochta Bhord na Gaeilge?  Is é sin, an bhfuil lán-tacaíocht an Rialtais ag gabháil leis?  An bhfaighidh an Bord lán-tacaíocht ón Rialtas é a chur i bhfeidhm?  An gcuirfear an t-airgead ar fáil le moltaí agus spriocanna uile an phlean a chur i bhfeidhm mar atá geallta dúinn ins an bplean?  Muna bhfuil freagraí dearfacha ar na ceisteannaí seo ar fail ní dóigh liomsa go n-éireoidh leis an bplean mar atá sé leagtha síos ar a laghad. Ba mhaith liom go dtabharfadh an tAire freagra ar na ceisteannaí chomh fada agus is féidir leis, freagraí a bheas ina gcúis mhisnigh dúinn ar fad agus a chuirfidh áthas orainn ar fad mar gheall ar an bplean seo uile.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion today.  I am also delighted to find that Seanad Éireann was called especially to debate the present state of the Irish language, our culture and the Gaeltacht generally.  The Irish language and the Gaeltacht are in a crisis situation.  If this debate helps to focus attention on that situation it will have served its purpose well.  I am sure that it will focus attention due to the fact that this House has been called specially and that so many valuable and searching contributions have already been made.  I am sure more contributions of that nature will be made on the present state of the Irish language. I urge the Minister seriously to consider the present state of crisis in regard to Irish and to plead with his Government to give the entire cultural revival movement the attention and support it deserves.</P>
    <P>As has already been stated, there has been a serious decline in the position of the Irish language for quite some time. <Col N="43" /> This decline did not come quickly.  It has been an on-going process over a number of years.  As Senator McGuinness has already stated, this decline is easily traceable to the abolition of the preparatory colleges quite some time ago.  Under the system of these colleges students who already had a good knowledge of Irish were recruited.  During the years of their preparatory course they were living and being trained in an exclusively Irish atmosphere.  The instruction was entirely in Irish and they passed through their four to five years' preparatory course into the training colleges with an excellent knowledge of the language.  Not only had they an excellent knowledge of the language but they were also fired with enthusiasm and a desire to speak the language and impart is to others.  Having been trained as teachers, those young trainees were ideally equipped not only to teach the language efficiently but also to inculcate in others a love for it.</P>
    <P>There is another facet which shows a decline.  In 1970 there were only 52 primary schools outside the Gaeltacht teaching through the medium of Irish, already a very serious decline.  However, in 1972 the number had fallen to 24.  This shows a downgrading of the language generally and a lack of interest in its promotion and use.  Ach mar a deartar sa seanfhocal Ghaeilge, &ldquo;Is mó an pian is giorra an chabhair&rdquo;.  The concern and dissatisfaction of parents with the present position is reflecting itself in the initiative being taken by them to set up their own all-Irish schools, both primary and post-primary, where the medium of instruction for all subjects is in the first language, thus securing a good grounding in the language.</P>
    <P>Four of these schools were opened in the following centres last September at the commencement of the present school year &mdash; Scoil Raiftéire i gCaisleán an Bharraigh i gContae Mhuigh Eó; Scoil Mhichíl Uí Chiósoig, Inis, i gContae an Chlár; Scoil Sheán Uí Riordáin, Baile an Chollaig i gContae Corcaigh; agus Scoil Chiaráin in Eochaill i gContae Corcaigh. These are four all-Irish primary schools opened by people who are concerned <Col N="44" /> about the present position of the language.</P>
    <P>It might surprise Senators also to learn that in Derry city a similar all-Irish school was initiated at the beginning of September. That school is funded, wholly and totally, by the Minister for Education in Stormont.  There is another such school in Belfast.  If that can be done in those areas more can and will be done, I have no doubt, throughout the country before very long.</P>
    <P>A similar type of school has also been opened elsewhere.  This is a welcome phenomenon as a result of provisions made by the Minister for Education, Deputy John Wilson, in 1978.  This type of primary school, modelled on Scoil Lorcáin, in Monkstown, Dublin, in the establishment of which the Leader of the Seanad, Senator Dooge played an important part, is also thriving.  The work done in these primary schools might be continued at post-primary level.  It will be necessary to make adjustments in the facilities and provisions at present available to the handful of primary and post-primary schools serving the parents who wish to have this type of education available for their families.  The number of these schools is so small at present that only 2 per cent of the pupils attending post-primary schools attend them, as compared with 30 per cent in the early decades of the State.  The organisation catering for these schools have had consultations with the Minister of State at the Department of Education, Deputy Creed, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Dukes, in relation to improving the situation in this sector of the educational system.  They have asked for an increase in the capitation grants for the private schools and the funds for the Christian Brothers and nuns still teaching through Irish, and a pupil-teacher ratio similar to that prevailing in vocational schools.  There are only 20 of these post-primary schools in existence at present. Therefore the cost to the Exchequer would not be very great.  In view of the very special role of the Gael-Scoileanna, both at post-primary level and otherwise in the advancement of the Irish language, I sincerely appeal to the Minister to <Col N="45" /> approve the increases in the capitation grants sought by the people who were with him on a deputation recently.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of the Gaeltacht, the cradle of the Irish language, as it has been named and recognised.  I understand the position of the Gaeltacht reasonably well, I was brought up there and I understand the outlook and the difficulties of the people of the Gaeltacht. The sad fact is that the Gaeltacht, in area and otherwise, is shrinking.  The areas within which people speak Irish, totally and habitually, are declining.  So also are the number of people speaking wholly Irish in the Gaeltacht.  That is a sad fact, and a fact to be deplored.</P>
    <P>Many families are beginning to speak English rather than Irish to their children. They have their own reasons for that.  They feel they have not got the support from the State they deserve, and that the language movement &mdash; and I do not wish to imply any political under-or overtones here &mdash; was not supported as strongly or as forcefully as it might have been.  They feel also that they are in a secondary position in so far as they have not got an all-Irish television service or the same services as people have in other areas.  That is their opinion, and it would be very difficult to dispute it.</P>
    <P>For that reason to a great extent they have lost confidence in the Irish revival movement.  They find, for instance, that some of the factories established in the Gaeltacht areas are administered through the medium of English.  I regret to have to say that, but these are the complaints I have heard.  If I am wrong I will be glad to admit it.  These people in the Gaeltacht areas feel a sense of frustration for many other reasons.  They find at times that courts held in the Gaeltacht are held through the medium of English. We have had protests in that regard in certain Gaeltacht areas not so very long ago.</P>
    <P>Radio na Gaeltachta was of the greatest assistance and was one of the greatest steps forward in support of the language for very many years.  Radio na Gaeltachta is doing a very fine job.  It has shown that an all-Irish system can be introduced and operated.  Unfortunately that service is <Col N="46" /> broadcasting for a limited number of hours only per day.  Comhairle Radio na Gaeltachta and Foireann na Gaeltachta maintain that they could provide an all-day broadcasting service, such as Radio Éireann, if they were provided with the necessary funds and the personnel to do so.  I believe that is correct.</P>
    <P>RTE have been referred to already today.  Their promotion of Irish and Irish programmes within their programming schedules is like a recurring decimal. Everybody who complains about the non-advancement of Irish complains about Radio Telefís Éireann.  Radio Telefís Éireann deserve blame because of their lack of commitment to their statutory duty to promote the Irish language in their programming.  They deserve criticism and they may expect it from any quarter.  In 1972, for instance, they gave a firm commitment that at least one all-Irish programme per day would be transmitted from Radio Telefís Éireann.  That has not happened.  Therefore it is no wonder if people complain about their lack of commitment to the language.  Recently news in Irish was transmitted on RTE 1 but it has now been transferred to RTE 2.  That is a retrograde step because RTE 1 is the main channel.  This indicates a downgrading of the language.  Until recently there were news headlines in Irish on RTE 2.  They are no longer broadcast on that channel at 4 p.m.  That is a pity.  However, the position is not without hope.</P>
    <P>A good many all-Irish primary schools have been established by people concerned about the present state of the language.  Similarly, great efforts are being made to carry that endeavour forward and to provide post-primary schools that will absorb the pupils from all-Irish primary schools.  In addition, all-Irish kindergartens are being established throughout the country.  I appeal for support for these pre-schools.  They should be encouraged to inculcate into young people at the earliest age a love for the Irish language.</P>
    <P>We often hear appeals to the GAA and local authorities to support the Irish language.  I believe the GAA and other voluntary bodies could give very valuable <Col N="47" /> support to the advancement of Irish if they supported and encouraged preschool establishments to form all-Irish naíscoileanna, because here, not only a linguistic foundation but a foundation for a love and commitment to the language can be laid.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made already to a bill of rights.  I believe, and many others believe, that the present situation in regard to the Irish language requires a serious effort to find a remedy.  Connradh na Gaeilge have not been slow in doing that.  They have prepared this draft bill of rights in support of the Irish language. We all know that the purpose of a bill of rights is to ensure that the language would get full support and that every Department of State and central Government would be obliged to implement the statutory obligations laid down by the Constitution.  The Irish Constitution says that the first official language is Irish but that English will be regarded and accepted as the second language.</P>
    <P>We hope that support for the bill of rights will be forthcoming as a result of this debate.  It may require further examination and detailed analysis, but I believe we should support Connradh na Gaeilge's application to have this bill of rights accepted, supported and put into effect.  If we do that we will be doing a good day's work for the promotion and advancement of Irish.  This bill of rights has been circulated to local authorities throughout the country and six or seven have endorsed it.  We hope support for it will gather momentum and that it will be accepted and eventually put into operation.</P>
    <P>Tá go leor eile a d'fhéadfaí a rá ar an tairiscint seo inniu ach ba mhaith liom a rá arís go bhfáiltím go croíúil roimh an mholadh atá romhainn comhchoiste eadar-pháirtí a bhunú le iarracht a déanamh beartas fiúntach a dhéanamh ar son dul chun cinn na Gaeilge ar gach bealach sna scoileanna, i measc an phobail agus i measc Tithe an Oireachtais féin.  Creidim go bhfuil dualgas orainne, Seanadóirí, agus Teachtaí Dála, Baill Oireachtais trí chéile, taca a thabhairt do <Col N="48" /> phobal na hÉireann maidir le Gaeilge agus le cur chun cinn na Gaeilge mar gan an treoir sin agus gan an dea-shampla ní hionadh go mbeadh lag-mhisneach ar na daoine ar fud na tíre.  Ní hionadh go mbeadh lag-mhisneach ar na daoine atá ag iarraidh an Ghaeilge a fhóghlaim agus feabhas a chur ar a gcuid Gaeilge chomh maith agus is féidir leo.  Whenever I hear a discussion on the Irish language at any level or in any particular circumstance I always recall the advice given by Pádraig Mac Piarais: One does not have to praise Irish; speak it; one does not need to run down foreign games; play Irish games. That was very sound advice on both aspects and had that advice been implemented to the best of people's ability for many years, the State and the position of the language would be on a better footing today than it is.  Molaim arís go gcuirfear an coiste eadar-pháirtí seo ar bun agus tá súil agam go dtiocfaidh dá réir gníomh fónta agus polasaí fónta ón Rialtas agus go bhfaighidh sé lán-tacaíocht ó na páirtithe go léir.</P>

      <P>Bhí mé as láthair tamall agus an díospóireacht seo ar siúl, mar bhí orm dul go dtí an chéad cruinniú den Chomhchoiste um Chomhair le Tíortha Forbarthacha.  Is oth liom go raibh mé as láthair.  Tá moladh mór tuillte ag Bord na Gaeilge mar gheall ar an bplean seo atá ullmhuithe acu do na blianta 1983 go dtí 1986.  Sílim go bhfuil sé in am dúinn féachaint ar an dul ar aghaidh nó an easpa dul ar aghaidh atá déanta againn ó cuireadh tús le hathbheochan na Gaeilge trí scór bliain ó shin.  Tá 60 bliain imithe ó cuireadh tús sa Stát seo ar Ghaeilge a mhúineadh sna scoileanna.  Mar sin is beag duine sa tír san am i láthair nach bhfuil a bheag nó a mhór de Ghaeilge aige.  D'fhéadfá taisteal ó cheann ceann na tíre lá ar bith sa bhliain agus a bheith cinnte nach gcloisfeá oiread is focal amháin Gaeilge á labhairt i rith an lae. Sílim, dá bhrí sin, gur theip orainn sa chuspóir a leagamar amach dúinn fein nuair a bunaíodh an Stát seo.  Is é an cuspóir céanna a bhí ag gach Rialtas dá raibh i réim sa 60 bliain sin, an Ghaeilge a athbheochan mar theanga an phobail. Caitheadh na milliúin punt ag iarraidh an <Col N="49" /> obair sin a dhéanamh agus chaith na múinteoirí agus na daltaí mór-chuid ama ag gabháil don Ghaeilge agus is é an toradh atá againn anois ná go bhfuil an Ghaeltacht féin ag dul i laghad agus nach bhfuil an teanga á labhairt sa Ghalltacht fiú amháin ag na daoine go bhfuil Gaeilge acu.  Os rud é go bhfuil sé sin fíor tá sé in am dúinn féachaint isteach sa scéal agus a fháil amach más féidir cén fáth gur theip orainn.  Sin í díreach an obair atá a déanamh ag Bord na Gaeilge agus sin é an cospóir atá romhainn inniu sa díospóireacht seo féachaint isteach sna moltaí atá déanta dúinn, don phobal agus don Rialtas, ag Bord na Gaeilge, an Ghaeilge a athbheocan nó deireadh a chur leis an meath atá tagtha ar an Ghaeilge.  Má éiríonn linn agus má éiríonn le Bord na Gaeilge athrú a dhéanamh ar an modh oibre i dtreo is go mbeidh toradh níos fearr againn i rith 60 bliain eile ná mar atá againn taréis na 60 bliain atá caite beidh obair mhór déanta ag an Rialtas nó ag Tithe an Oireachtais nó ag Bord na Gaeilge, is cuma.  Má déantar an obair i slí nua agus má bíonn toradh níos fearr de bharr iarracht nua beimid go léir sásta.  Má leanaimid ar aghaidh sa slí céanna is a bhíomar leis na blianta, is féidir linn a bheith cinnte go leanfaidh meath na Gaeilge agus go dtiocfaidh an lá nach mbeidh oiread is focal amháin á labhairt in aon áit sa tír.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a good thing that Bord na Gaeilge have examined the situation of the Irish language at present and suggested methods for improving our approach to the revival of the language.  It is 60 years since the State was founded and it has been stated by every Government, without exception, since that the revival of the Irish language was one of their principal objectives and aims.  For that reason the teaching of the Irish language in the schools, from infant classes in primary schools to university level, was taken in hand and a lot of effort, work and expense put into it.  The result has not been successful.  Sixty years ago teaching Irish commenced as part of the primary school curriculum which means that almost everybody under 65 years of age has learned some Irish in school.  Some were more proficient than others and <Col N="50" /> made greater headway because they may have had a better flair for languages, had better teachers or because there was a more encouraging atmosphere at home. The fact is that everybody learned some Irish.  We have now reached the stage when one can travel for a day or a week from one end of the country to the other and not hear one solitary word of our native language spoken.  That must be a mark of failure to some degree.</P>
    <P>It is true to say that there are thousands of people with a good knowledge of the language.  They can write it, read it and understand it but for some reason or another they have no desire whatever to speak it.  The biggest failure made in the revival programme has been the failure to encourage people to speak the language or as much of it as they know, or at least some.  If we had succeeded in generating the proper motivation in the school programme, then everybody would take it as second nature that they should speak some phrases or words of their native language every day in the year, but that is not the case.  By some means or another we must have built up a dislike of the language or certainly we did not generate a great love for it.  Mistakes were made in the early days that we should be careful to avoid now.  We should set about developing a new spirit of motivation.  It was wrong, in my opinion, to make Irish the spoken language of the school in Gaeltacht areas from the first day the child went to school.  For instance, a young boy named, say Malachy McEvoy would be known by that name at home but on his first day at school he suddenly gets a new identity, by becoming Maoilsheachlann MacAbhui. I reckon that little boy would be confused.  We could have a boy called, say, Patrick Joseph Reynolds, who became Pádraig Seosaimh Mac Raghnaill thus creating confusion in the child.  He was suddenly deposited in a strange environment and the little vocabulary he had built up and all the association of ideas that he had were suddenly changed.</P>
    <P>We went on and insisted on teaching subjects through the medium of Irish.  In the forties and before that the teachers, if they wanted to keep in favour with the <Col N="51" /> Department, taught Irish and history and geography through the medium of Irish. We had the absurd situation of proceeding from the known to the unknown through the medium of the unknown. That built up a sort of dislike for the Irish language and that has survived to this day because the parents of those who are now attending school themselves went through that sort of process in the schools.</P>
    <P>Last week at an interview board appointing vocational teachers of French and Irish most of the candidates said they found it easier to generate a love for French than they did for Irish.  That is a point we will have to take note of.  We will have to set about developing a love for our own langauge and a determination to use it as far as is possible.  In my opinion, a number of reasons militated against the language being spoken on a wide scale.  One was an over-insistence in the early years on obair scríofa or written work to the neglect of obair beal, or the spoken language.  The insistence on rapid progress in obair scríofa was tied up with a demand to be an expert on grammar. We reached the stage when a person speaking Irish was so grammar conscious that he was annoyed out of his wits if he made one single grammatical mistake in an Irish sentence but the same person could talk for half an hour in English and make a hundred mistakes and not be conscious of them.  There was an overemphasis on grammar and on written work and at second level education we proceeded to treat Irish as if it were a dead language.  We held the intermediate certificate and leaving certificate examinations on written Irish the same as we did on Latin and Greek.  Irish was treated in the same way as the dead classics.</P>
    <P>There was no real emphasis on encouraging the people to speak the language they were learning, to take it as a living language, to take it as a language that was meant to be used not only just in the schoolroom but in the playgrounds and in their own homes.  It was segregated as an examination subject just like Latin or Greek.  Even the greatest enthusiasts among classical scholars did not think <Col N="52" /> that they were compelled to have conversations in Greek or Latin with their colleagues or with their parents when they went home except an odd time at meetings of the hierachy.  We treated Irish in that way.</P>
    <P>Some years ago it was decided that a percentage of the marks in the leaving certificate be given for proficiency in speaking the language.  That was a progressive move.  I think that the percentage mark awarded for fluency in the language was too low.  A greater emphasis must be placed on speaking the language and if we succeed in having our people speak the language in the course of everyday activities, at business or at pleasure, I believe the written end of it will look after itself.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see in the plan drawn up by Bord na Gaeilge references to greater emphasis on the spoken language.  I hope that will be the system that will be adopted and that those who decide what sort of examinations our students must pass will give an increased allocation of marks to fluency in the oral examination and probably an oral comprehension test as well, and less emphasis on the written language until we come to the day when people will use their native language on a number of occasions every day, not just regarding it as something that must be done when the Irish professor comes and then on the football field or hurling field they drop the Irish language and go back to speaking English.  I believe that kind of approach will do more to revive the language as a spoken language.  It should be our main aim and not have our eye directed on producing literature.  If our people speak the language, the written language will develop and people's talents, as dramatists or short-story writers will develop once they have the competence to convey their thoughts in the language of our people.</P>
    <P>I hope that those who are in a position to implement these qualities will bear these thoughts in mind but I am not optimistic they will go so far as to adopt them.</P>
    <P>We go a part of the way: we get Irish names for some offices and some boards <Col N="53" /> we set up and then we lose sight of what we are at.  One can read in the newspaper that &ldquo;An Taoiseach, An Tánaiste and Minister for the Environment were received by the President in Aras an Uachtaráin&rdquo;.  Irish is used for An Taoiseach and An Tánaiste but not in referring to the Minister for the Environment. Likewise, we describe the President's residence as Aras an Uachtaráin but we continue to refer to the occupant as President.  We have Bord na Móna, Bord na gCon, Córas Iompair Éireann and many more.  We have Bord Soláthair Leictreachais but the letters ESB got a grip and hold on.  Ten years ago the health boards were set up &mdash; na Boird Sláinte &mdash; but they came to be known as health boards.  Clinics were set up and they came to be known as clinics whereas we should have followed the policy of putting the Irish names only on these institutions and new buildings.  RTE are blamed, sometimes without justification, for not being as sensible as they should be.  The former Senator Cranitch, fear a dhein a lán ar son na Gaeilge, a few years ago said here that people with quite a good knowledge of the Irish language had difficulty in understanding the newsreaders. I am not faulting the newsreaders. Their blas is perfect, their Irish is good and their grammar is excellent, but people of leaving certificate standard Irish have difficulty in keeping up with the newsreaders to such a degree that they are embarrassed in the presence of others when they cannot give a quick translation of what they have heard.  It would be a good idea if RTE flashed on to the screen the words of the text at the same time as it is being read as is done in English for the deaf.  This would help people learning the language to understand the news and it would remove the embarrassment from students of 17 or 18 whose parents are astonished when they cannot translate immediately what they have heard.</P>
    <P>For people who are anxious to refresh their Irish, the adult education classes run by the vocational education committees throughout the country provide a great opportunity.  People who spent a lot of time in their youth learning Irish <Col N="54" /> and who for one reason or another did not practice it but who would like to do so now, especially if they have young families whom they would like to help in that regard, should go to the adult education classes.  These classes are very good and they could play a big part in reviving Irish in the hearts and minds and on the tongues of people who were quite good at it ten, 15 or 20 years ago but who have ceased to use it and who are embarrassed to use whatever Irish they have now.</P>
    <P>Mar fhocal scoir, is cúis áthais dom a rá anseo go dtabharfaidh an Rialtas gach tacaíocht don bplean seo atá ullmhuithe dúinn ag Bord na Gaeilge.  Tá a fhios agam féin le fada an lá go bhfuil an-suim ag an Aire sa Ghaeilge agus táim cinnte go ndéanfaidh sé a dhícheall cabhrú le Bord na Gaeilge agus le gach duine go bhfuil beartaithe aige athbheochain na Gaeilge a chur chun cinn.</P>

      <P>Tá sé chomh maith domsa i dtús báire píosa sa phlean Bhord na Gaeilge a léamh amach, píosa beag as roinn 4 faoin Stáit.  Deir sé gur nádurtha an rud é go mbeadh daoine ag dúil le eiseamláir éigin ó Thithe an Oireachtais den phatrún dhá-theangach a mbeadh coinne leis i measc an phobail.</P>
      <P>Tá an ceart acu.  Ba cheart go mbeadh dúil ag daoine go dtabharfaimís an deáshampla ó thaobh dá-theangachais de, agus mar sin féin chun a chruthú gur tír dá-theangach atá i gceist againn agus chun a fháil amach an féidir ár ngnáth ghnó a dhéanamh trí Ghaeilge amháin. Níl mé ach chun a labhairt as Gaeilge chun a fháil amach an féidir leis na meáinchumarsáide agus daoine mar siúd an méid atá le rá agam a chur os comhair an phobail gan mise ag tabhairt aistriúcháin dóibh agus cruthóidh sin rud éigin faoi cé chomh láidir is atá an teanga nó cé dáiríre is atá polasaithe na meáinchumarsáide faoi dhá-theangachas, pé scéal é.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá stair agus stair bhrónach athbheochan na Gaeilge leagtha amach ag a lán daoine tráthnóna, faoin dóchas a bhí ann i dtús báire, faoin iarracht dáiríre a deineadh ó bunaíodh an Stát chun an <Col N="55" /> Ghaeilge a thabhairt chun cinn.  An deáthoil a bhí ann.  Is cuimhin liomsa cé chomh dáiríre is a bhí daoine, fiú amháin nuair a bhí mé óg &mdash; agus ní fada uainn an lá sin &mdash; faoin Ghaeilge i measc a lán daoine, agus tá sé ann fós.  Bhí a lán Airí Oideachais ann a bhí i ndáiríre faoin Ghaeilge agus bhí a lán Rialtas ann agus a lán Taoisigh ann a bhí dáiríre faoin Ghaeilge.  Caithfear a rá ag an deireadh go bhfuil teipthe ag a lán a bhí i gceist acu siúd.  Tá comharthaí dóchais ann ach go ginearálta tá teipthe orthu siúd.  Má léim amach na fíricí atá sa phlean seo: i 1891, 30 bliain roimh bunú an Stáit bhí 19 faoin gcéad de dhaonra na gcontaetha atá anois sa Phoblacht ina gcainteoirí Gaeilge, sin 30 bliain roimh bunú an Stáit agus gan aon Ghaeilge á múineadh sna scoileanna agus mar sin cainteoirí dúchais is mó nó beagnach ina n-iomlán a bhí iontu siúd; agus anois, an méid daoine gur féidir cainteoirí dúchais a thabhairt orthu, timpeall ar a haon faoin gcéad sa Ghaeltacht agus thart ar 3 faoin gcéad eile taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht. Táimid taréis dul ón stát ina raibh thar ar 20 faoin gcéad den phobal ina gcainteoirí dúcháis go dtí an stát anois nach bhfuil ach 1 faoin gcéad den phobal fágtha mar chainteoirí dúchais.  Taispeánann an fhíric sin go bhfuilimid beagnach tagtha go deireadh na Gaeilge mar theanga beo. Is as sin a thagann an plean agus is é is mó a thaitníonn liomsa faoi phlean seo Bhord na Gaeilge ná cé chomh réadúlach agus chomh practiciúil agus atá sé, agus tá sé leagtha amach ag Bord na Gaeilge gurb é sin a bhí i gceist acu nuair a scríobh siad an plean seo.  Plean gearrthéarmach atá acu, plean do thrí nó ceithre bliana atá i gceist acu chun tosach a chur le beart fíordheacair a bhaint amach, is é sin rud nár deineadh, is é mo thuairim, ariamh in iarthar na hEorpa &mdash; b'fhéidir go ndearnadh in áiteacha eile é &mdash; agus sin teanga atá beagnach marbh a thabhairt chun beatha arís agus caithfidh mé a rá gur fiú é sin a dhéanamh agus beidh mé ag caint faoi sin a thuilleadh arís.  Caithfidh mé a rá gur beart mór a bheidh déanta againn má éiríonn linn an Ghaeilge a thabhairt chun beatha arís agus níl sé go ró-shláintiúil faoi láthair.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="56" /> Tá sé soiléir chomh maith ón bplean nach bhfuil sé i gceist ag éinne anois an Béarla a scriosadh sa tír seo, mar tá sé fíor-réadúlachas a aithint go bhfuil dhá theanga sa tír seo, gur tír agus pobal dhátheangach atá i gceist againn agus dá bhféadfaimís a leithéid sin a bhaint amach beimís go léir sásta.  Tá a lán rudaí sna moltaí gur chóir dúinn a léamh, a phlé agus a chur i bhfeidhm.  Tá, mar shampla, an aithne atá tugtha do na gléasáin Ghaeilge agus don bun-phobal Gaeilge atá fágtha sa tír; an 4 faoin gcéad de phobal na tíre atá fós ag labhairt na Gaeilge mar theanga dhúchais.  Caithfimid a aithint gurb iad siúd is bonn do athbheochan na Gaeilge agus leathnú úsáide na Gaeilge agus is iad siúd is mó gur gá dúinn cabhrú leo agus tacaíocht a thabhairt dóibh.  Tá trácht sa phlean chomh maith faoi taoiseacht agus cé chomh tábhachtach is atá sé taoiseacht a thabhairt do phobal na tíre seo agus caithfimid mar sin deireadh a chur leis an ghnáth trácht faoin Ghaeilge a dhéanaimidne na polaiteoirí &mdash; sin an t-aitheantas oifigiúil a thabhairt don teanga agus deireadh a chur leis nuair a thagann aon rud dáiríre os ar gcomhair.  Má táimid dáiríre faoin teanga caithfimid an teanga a úsáid go dáiríre, agus an t-aon phíosa garbh atá sa phlean seo ná na focail gharbha atá dírithe i dtreo Rialtais i ndiaidh Rialtais á rá go bhfuil siad neodrach anois faoin teanga agus a leagadh amach gur fíor má tá tú neodrach faoin teanga agus í chomh lag agus atá sí go bhfuil tú ag cur i gcoinne na teanga.  Ní féidir a bheith neodrach agus an teanga chomh lag agus atá sí.</P>
    <P>Tá tosach déanta againn, tá súil agam, agus ag an Rialtas agus ag an Aire chun an taoiseachas sin a thaispeáint agus an díospóireacht seo a chur ar siúl.  Tá sa plean anailíse réasúnta maith ar na cúiseanna go bhfuil úsáid na Gaeilge sa Ghaletacht ag dul i laghad i gcónaí agus caithfimid a aithint gur deacair an Ghaeltacht a choimeád beo agus an brú atá ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta idir cúrsaí tráchta, tionsclaíochta agus rudaí mar siúd.  Mar sin i measc na moltaí atá leagtha amach tá a lán rudaí, rudaí praicticiúla, rudaí réadúlacha gur cóir a dhéanamh chun cabhrú le muintir na <Col N="57" /> Gaeltachta sa chaoi is go mbeidh siad ábalta a bheith cinnte nach gcuirfear aon deacracht i mbealach páistí na Gaeltachta ó thaobh fostaíochta de, mar shampla, cúrsaí gnó, oideachas, go gcaithfear a chinntiú nach bhfuil aon deacrachtaí i mbealach aos óg na Gaeltachta os rud é gur Gaeilge a úsáideann siad ina ngnáth-shaol agus má tá deacrachtaí ann mar sin agus má thuigeann muintir na Gaeltachta go bhfuil úsáid na Gaeilge ag cur isteach orthu ina ngnáth-shaol ní féidir linne an Ghaeilge a choinneáil beo sa Ghaeltacht.  Pé deacrachtaí atá ann caithfear iad a chur amach as an mbealach. Tá moltaí, mar shampla, faoi athriarachán, atheagrú rialtais áitiúil agus atheagrú na mbord sláinte sa chaoi is go mbeidh &mdash; mar adeirtear sa tuarascáil&mdash; córas rialtais áitiúil faoi leith ar bun sa Ghaeltacht; sa chaoi is go mbeidh ionad agus ceannáras ag gach aonad rialtas áitiúil san Ghaeltacht, go mbeidh rialtas áitiúil dá gcuid féin ag muintir na Gaeltachta, go mbeidh boird sláinte dá gcuid féin ag muintir na Gaeltachta, agus go mbeidh aonad dá gcuid féin ag aon bhrainse de riarachán an Stáit san Ghaeltacht. Caithfimid a chinntiú go n-aithnítear an Ghaeltacht mar áit spesialta i cultúr agus i bhforbairt na tíre agus cabhrú le muintir na Gaeltachta chun an sprioc sin a bhaint amach.</P>
    <P>Tá moltaí faoi leith sa tuarascáil seo faoi chúrsaí raidio agus teilifíse agus an moladh is tábhachtaí&mdash;caithfidh mé a rá an moladh is costasaí atá ann &mdash; faoi stáisiún teilifíse lán Ghaelach a chur ar fáil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus do mhuintir na Gaeilge chomh maith, an 25 faoin gcéad adeireann go bhfuil Gaeilge réasúnta maith acu agus pé duine sa Teach seo go bhfuil seans aige féachaint ar SRC an stáisiún teilifíse sa Bhreatain Bhig ina ndeintear cláracha de trí huaire Breatnais, caithfidh tú bheith buartha nach féidir linne, agus Rialtas dár gcuid féin againn, an rud céanna a chur ar siúl anseo.  Chuir sé beagáinín fearg ormsa nuair a cuireadh ráiteas amach ó RTE go raibh i gceist acu cuid mhaith de na cláracha Breatnaise a cheannach ó SRC agus dubbing a chur orthu, agus fuair mé amach ansin gur dubbing Béarla a bhí i gceist acu i gcóir na cláracha a deineadh <Col N="58" /> do mhuintir labhartha na Breatnais sa Bhreatain Bhig Bheadh sé chomh h-éasca dóibh Gaeilge a chur ar na cláracha siúd ná Béarla.  Is masla de shaghas éigin, i mo thuairim, teanga Ceilteach amháin a thógaint amach agus Béarla a chur isteach ina háit.  Ní bheadh sé róchostasach agus mar sin aontaím go láidir le moladh Bhord na Gaeilge go gcuirfí seirbhís teilifíse i nGaeilge amach. B'fhéidir gur féidir rud éigin a dhéanamh le RTE 2 anois os rud é gur féidir le cuid mhaith den tír seo féachaint ar stáisiúin Sasanacha anois; b'fhéidir gur féidir trí nó ceithre uaire a chloig a chur amach ar RTE 2.  Níl mé cinnte faoi sin ach caithfear seirbhís lán-Ghaelach teilifíse a chur ar fáil is é sin an meán cumarsáide is mó tionchar sa tír agus ní féidir linne teanga a choimeád beo gan seirbhís teilifíse ina bhfuil an teanga sin láidir agus níl dóthain cláracha Gaeilge ar sheirbhís Béarla de ghnáth.  Caithfear seirbhís teilifíse dá gcuid féin a chur ar fáil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus do mhuintir na Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>Tá a lán lán rudaí eile sa phlean, rudaí inmholta ach níl mé chun iad a léamh amach.  Caithfidh mé cúpla rud a rá. Maidir le gluaiseacht na gaelscoileanna, bhí baint agam le muintir Bhaile Munna deich mbliain ó shin nuair a chuaigh siad ag lorg scoil lán-Ghaelach dá gcuid bpáistí san áit uafásach sin amuigh i Ballymun.</P>
    <P>Chuir sé ionadh ormsa, agus chuir sé ionadh ar mhuintir Bhaile Munna chomh maith, cé chomh deacair is a bhí sé cead a fháil ón Roinn Oideachais scoil lán-Ghaelach a chur ar siúl amuigh ansin.  Pé deacracht gurb fhéidir a chur i gcoinne ar iarracht sin, cuireadh ina choinne é. Pé moill gur féidir a bheith ann, bhí sé ann.  Cailleadh gach aon dea-thoil a bhí ag muintir Bhaile Munna sa Roinn Oideachais go h-an-sciobtha.  Thuig siad go h-an-sciobtha nach raibh ard-mheas ag an Roinn Oideachais ar scoileanna lánGhaelacha. Do b'é sin an tuiscint a tháinig do mhuintir Bhaile Munna agus, de réir mar a chuala mé, is mar sin atá sé amuigh i Léim an Bhradáin chomh maith &mdash; gur deacair cead a fháil scoil lán-Ghaelach a chur ar fáil.  Bhí sé anshuimiúil an rud a tharla ansin mar a dúirt duine éigin amuigh ansin: &ldquo;Tá páistí <Col N="59" /> againn agus tá siad ag féachaint ar UTV, tá siad ag léamh an <i>Daily Mirror</i> agus ag leanúint peile sa Bhreatain.  Caithfimid rud éigin a dhéanamh chun chruthú dóibh nach i Sasana atá cónaí orthu&rdquo;.  B'as sin a tharla an ghluaiseacht amuigh i mBaile Munna, i measc gnáth-phobal Bhaile Átha Cliath chun scoil lán-Ghaelach a chur ar fáil dá gcuid páistí.  Céard a tharla?  Moill i ndiaidh moill, agus tá an scoil sin ar siúl anois agus tá sé go láidir go fóill agus ag dul i méid.  Siad gnáthmhuintir Bhaile Átha Cliath a chuir an scoil sin ar fáil.  Níorbh iad na polaitheoirí, na státseirbhísigh, nó fiú amháin na heagraisí Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>Níl na naí-scoileanna tosnaithe ach le cúig nó sé bliana nó mar sin agus is iontach an ghluaiseacht iad.  Tá sé éasca do pháiste óg, dó nó trí nó ceithre theangacha a fhoghlaim le chéile.  B'fhéidir go bhfuil spéis pearsanta faoi leith agam faoi láthair os rud é go bhfuil mo iníon óg ag dul go dtí naí-scoil.  Tá sé ag cur ionadh orm an méid Gaeilge atá dá fhoghlaim aici gan stró agus í ag baint taitneamh iontach ón naí-scoil sin.  Is cúis mór dóchais dúinn go bhfuil an méid sin naí-scoileanna timpeall na tíre agus go bhfuil an uimhir ag dul i méid i gcónaí agus líon na scoileanna sin ag dul i méid leis.</P>
    <P>Tá ganntanais ann chomh maith sa chóras oideachais, go mór mhór sna coláistí teicneolaíochta agus áiteanna mar siúd.  Ní féidir le mac léinn Gaeilge a fhoghlaim i gceann de na coláistí réigiúnacha sin mar níl seirbhís ar bith fiú amháin más mian leis: níl múinteoireacht Gaeilge ar bith iontu, fiú amháin ins na saotharlanna teangacha chun Gaeilge a fhóghlaim.  Ba chóir go mbeadh múinteoir éigin i ngach ceann de na ceardcholáistí réigiúnacha, sna coláistí teicneolaíochta, a bheadh ábalta cúrsanna Gaeilge a chur ar fáil.  Níl mé ag caint ar chúrsanna Gaeilge éigeantacha, ach go mbeadh cúrsa Gaeilge ar fáil do mhac léinn ar bith ins na coláistí teicneolaíochta, áiteanna ina bhfuil 50 faoin gcéad dár mic léinn anois sa tríú céim oideachais.  Ba cheart dóibh bheith in ann an Ghaeilge a fhoghlaim agus an Ghaeilge atá acu a choimeád beo.</P>
    <P>D'fhéadfainn leanúint ar aghaidh faoi <Col N="60" /> na moltaí atá sa phlean ach tá sé ar eolas ag an Aire, sé mo thuairim, de ghlan mheabhair agus ag cuid mhaith de Baill an Tí chomh maith.  Ach d'fhéadfaimis i dTithe an Oireachtais rud a dhéanamh. D'fhéadfaimis i Seanad Éireann rud beag a dhéanamh, mar shampla díospóireachtaí ní faoin Ghaeilge nó an Ghaeltacht nó faoi rud a bhaineann leo, ach faoi rud dáiríre a chur ar siúl trí Ghaeilge uair sa mhí nó gach dá mhí.  Ní fiú dúinn bheith ag caint faoin Ghaeltacht nó an Ghaeilge i gcónaí, agus sin rud a deirtear faoi lucht na Gaeilge i gcónaí, &mdash; is cuma cén ábhar a thosnaíonn siad ag caint faoi, i ndeireadh na dála bíonn siad ag caint faoin Ghaeilge agus an Ghaeltacht.  Ní hé sin atá i gcéist agam. Ba mhaith liom Gaeilge a úsáid chun ceisteanna dáiríre a bhaineann le gnáthchúrsaí an tsaoil a phlé anseo as Gaeilge chun a chruthú gur rud dáiríre, gnáthrud, é teanga na tíre seo a úsáid.</P>
    <P>Chomh maith, caithfimid ceisteanna a fhreagairt.  Rinne an tSeanadóir O'Mahony iarracht air sin nuair a d'fhiafraigh sé an fiú é an dá mhilliún punt nó mar sin atá i gceist ag Bord na Gaeilge chun an plean seo a chomhlíonadh.  An fiú é domsa, agus an méid cainte a bhíonn ar siúl agam i gcónaí faoi bhochtanas agus eile, agus dífhostaíocht agus rudaí mar siúd, bheith ag caint faoi athbheochaint na teanga agus réim nua don teanga?  Tá mé cinnte nár fiú é mar sé mo thuairim go gcaithfimid creidiúint a bheith ionainn féin go seasfaimid leis an teanga.  Má tá rud éigin bunúsach mí-cheart leis an tír seo sé nach creidimid ionainn féin i gcúrsaí tionsclaíochta, talmhaíochta, iascaireachta: bíonn muid ag brath ar na multinationals.  Níl muid ábalta cúrsaí talmnaíochta na tíre a fhorbairt go sásúil mar ní creidimid ionainn féin.  Sé mo thuairim gur sampla eile den easpa creidiúna sin nach féidir linn an teanga a choimeád beo.  Sé an chreidiúint is fearr ab fhéidir linn bheith ionainn féin ná an chreidiúint gur féidir an teanga a choinneáil beo.</P>
    <P>Ach tá comharthaí eile dóchais, agus sé an comhartha is mó dochais domsa ná an feabhas atá tar éis teacht ar staid an cheoil sa tír seo.  Bhí ceol ár dtíre beagnach <Col N="61" /> marbh thart ar 20 bhliain ó shin agus anois tá sé láidir agus beo, agus is iad aos óg na tíre ba chúis leis sin.  Tar éis an méid a rinne RTE agus an Comhaltas agus eile, i ndeireadh na dála, b'iad aos óg na tíre a ghlac leis an gceol, thug siad fúthu féin é, thuig siad é agus sa chaoi sin tá ard-mheas ar an teanga tugtha don aos óg de bharr an spéis atá acu sa cheol. Anois, tá suim acu chomh maith sa teanga.  Munar tugadh an ceol chun cinn bheadh sé i bhfad níos deacra an teanga a thabhairt chun cinn.</P>
    <P>Ach ó thaobh an aosa óig de, ní maith leo an cur-i-gcéill a bhíonn i gceist i gcúrsaí teanga.  Ní maith leo na geallúintí briste faoin teanga; ní maith leo an éiginteacht a bíodh ann faoin teanga, agus is é mo thuairim nach maith leo an cosúlacht caomhnach a bhaineann le lucht na Gaeilge de ghnáth.  Tá an ceart acu.  Níl aon bhaint ag an teanga leis an gcaomhnachas agus faoi fiúntais na sean aoise.  Níl aon bhaint ann.  Mar adúirt mé cheana anseo nuair a léigh mé as Brian Merriman, ní mar sin a bíodh sé agus ní mar sin a bheidh sé go deo agus má léann daoine Mairtín Ó Cadhain tuigfidh siad sin agus má léann tú Seán Ó Ríordáin tuigfidh tú nach bhfuil aon bhaint ag an gcaomhnachas leis an teanga agus sin rud gur féidir linn a rá leis an aos óg gur féidir leo a thuiscint.</P>
    <P>Tá a lán le déanamh.  Mar shampla, tá níos mó cainteoirí dúchais i nGaeilge na hAlban in Albain anois ná mar atá de chainteoirí dúchais na tíre seo sa tír seo. Tá i bhfad níos mó cainteoirí dúchais sa Bhreatnais sa Bhreatain Bhig ná mar atá sa tír seo.  Cúis náire dúinn gur seans maith go bhfuil níos mó cainteoirí dúchais go bhfuil cónaí orthu i Sasana ná a bhfuil cónaí orthu sa tír seo anois.  Molaim Bord na Gaeilge as an méid atá déanta acu.</P>
    <P>Iarraim ar an Rialtas an t-airgead agus na daoine atá ag teastáil don phlean seo a thabhairt chun críche a chur ar fáil. Iarraim ar an Aire bheith cruinn linn nuair atá sé ag freagairt na ceisteanna. An mbeidh an t-airgead ar fáil agus an mbeidh na daoine ar fáil chun an phlean seo a thabhairt chun críche?  Mar adúirt Seán Ó Ríordáin, ná fan le ham tráthúil, ná fan le huair faoi leith, mar má fhanaimid a thuilleadh ní bheidh aon teanga <Col N="62" /> ann le hathbheochan.  Molaim an rún seo ach i ndeireadh na dála caithfidh mé cúpla ceisteanna a chur faoi agus b'fhéidir go mbeidh an tAire ábalta iad a fhreagairt. Cad atá le tarlú do na comharchumainn sna Gaeltachtí?  Tá siad go léir, de réir mar a chuala mé, beagnach briste, agus ma thiteann na comharchumainn as a chéile titfidh na Gaeltachtaí as a chéile, mar tá a lán daoine ag braith orthu anois.</P>
    <P>Cad atá le tarlú do na nuachtáin Ghaeilge agus do na nuachtáin Ghaeltachta? An mbeidh siad ann?  An mbeidh siad neamhspleách, agus an mbeidh siad ábalta leanúint leis an job a bhí le déanamh acu.  Conus mar atá cúrsaí le <i>Amárach?</i>  An mbeidh sé beo nó an mbeidh sé marbh?  Níor éirigh go maith le <i>Amárach.</i>  Ná bacaimís le forced marriages idir <i>Amárach</i> agus <i>Inniu.</i>  Is féidir le <i>Amárach</i> job iontach maith a dhéanamh ina aonar agus ba chóir don Rialtas cabhrú le <i>Amárach</i> mar tá gá mór ann do nuachtáin don Ghaeltacht amháin mar tá an Ghaeltacht beo agus daoine ann gur féidir leo iad a léamh.</P>
    <P>I ndeireadh na dála molaim Bord na Gaeilge.  Is é mo thuairim gur plean réadúil, practiciúil atá i gceist acu ach tá dá rud ag teastáil: tá airgead ag teastáil agus tá daoine ag teastáil uathu.  Tá súil agam go dtabharfaidh an Rialtas an dá rud siúd dóibh.</P>

      <P>Ar an gcéad dul síos is mian liom a rá nach dtógfaidh sé an méid seo ama uaim mo dhearcadh féin a aimsiú toisc go bhfuil an méid seo ráite ag Seanadóirí a labhair go dtí seo.  Tá sé tábhachtach, creidim féin, cúlra na tuarascála seo a mheas.  Mar a dúirt Seanadóir amháin, bhí a lán ócáidí ann ar thaispeain Rialtas imní faoi ghéarchéim na Gaeilge agus géarchéim na Gaeltachta.  Tá sin fíor agus im thuairim ba é an Tuarascáil ab fhearr ná an ceann a foilsíodh i 1926, an coimisiún a raibh Risteard Ó Maolchatha mar Chathaoirleach air.  Tá sé suimiúil súil a chaitheamh siar air anois go raibh costas £625 ag baint leis &mdash; í a chur i gcló agus na léarscáileanna go léir a bhí ann chomh maith a chur i gcló.  Dúirt mé uair amháin eile sa Teach eile gur tháinig na tuarascál eile níos costasaí ach b'fhéidir nach raibh an fiúntas céanna ag baint leo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="63" /> Caithimid a choinneáil i gcuimhne i gcónaí gur thugamar faoin am seo, sna fichidí, sna dachaidí, sna seascaidí, 10 mbliana ó shin agus arís táimid ag tosnú ar an tasc arís.  Tá sé tábhachtach nach dteipfidh orainn an uair seo; go mbeimid ionraiciúil an uair seo; go mbeimid i ndáiríre faoin rud atá romhainn.  Tuigim go maith an méid adúirt an Seanadóir Ó Riain.  Dúirt sé go raibh sé chun labhairt i nGaeilge ar fad mar teist ar na hiriseoirí, an mbeadh siad in ann spás ceart a thabhairt dó sna nuachtáin.  Nuair a bhí mé féin mar urlabhraí ar chúrsaí Gaeilge agus Gaeltachta san Teach eile is iomaí uair a labhair mé i nGaeilge ar fad agus caithfidh mé a rá nach raibh an toradh leis ó thaobh na nuachtán de.</P>
    <P>Tá sé tábhachtach go mbeimís i ndáiríre faoin Ghaeltacht.  Ceapaim féin go bhfuil daoine ag obair san phroifisiún sin atá an-fhial ar fad do chúis na Gaeilge agus a bhfuil suim acu inti.  Tá daoine eile ann agus níl sé ar a gcumas an Ghaeilge fiú amháin a thuiscint.  Tá daoine eile ann fós agus tá leisciúlacht ag baint leo agus ba cheart go ndearfaí sin, mar adúirt mé, gan faitíos agus tá mé i ndáiríre faoi.</P>
    <P>Is cuimhin liom chomh maith nuair a toghadh mé don chéad uair do Chomhairle Chontae na Gaillimhe agus Bardas na Gaillimhe 10 mbliana ó shin i 1974, agus tháinig daoine isteach don Bhardas agus go háirithe do Chomhairle Chontae na Gaillimhe agus bhí Gaeilge acu.  Thosaigh siad ag caint i nGaeilge ar feadh cúpla mí agus tar éis sin, toisc gur cuireadh brú orthu go minic ó dhaoine ón a bpáirtí féin, stop siad.  Anois tar éis dóibh 10 mbliana nó mar sin a chaitheamh ar an gcomhairle, níl sé de nós acu, iad sin atá ina gcainteoirí dúchais fiú amháin, an Ghaeilge a úsáid toisc nach bhfuil áiseanna ann.  Níl aon chóras aistriúchain ann ná aon rud eile.  Tá a lán cur-i-gcéill faoi chúrsaí Gaeilge agus Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Tá sé ar intinn agam féin na pointí ginearálta seo a lua ar dtús.  Tá tábhacht ar leith ag baint le pointí áirithe a rinne an Seanadóir Ó Riain agus is é sin go bhfuil daoine san tír seo a cheapann gur leo féin an Ghaeilge agus gluaiseacht na hathbheochana, lucht caol-aigeantach, agus ní hé amháin go gcloínn siad le <Col N="64" /> fiúntais sean-aimseartha ach tá sórt meoin chaola nimhneacha acu.</P>
    <P>D'fhreastal mé ar chruinniú 20 bliain ó shin i gCathair na Gaillimhe agus mé ag déanamh iarracht an Ghaeilge a fhóghluim.  Is cuimhin liom gur cuireadh moladh os comhair an chruinnuithe go mba cheart go mbeadh sórt club ann do lucht na Gaeilge ionas go mbeadh seans acu cúpla deochanna a ól le chéile agus an Ghaeilge á labhairt.  Sheas fear suas agus dúirt sé go mba cheart central heating a fháil ar dtús, agus labhair duine eile: Más rud é go bhfuil imid fuar cuirimis ár gcótaí móra orainn.  Bhí lucht na hathbheochana i bhfábhar cótaí móra chun freastal ar an bhfuacht ach ní raibh siad i bhfábhar central heating.  An tseachtain seo caite bhí mé ag freastal ar chruinniú i gCathair na Gaillimhe agus chuir sé áthas orm an méid tacaíochta a bhí ar fáil don Ghaeilge san Ghaeltacht.  Chuir se imní orm, a Chathaoirligh, an seanargóint a chloisteáil, go raibh cúis na Gaeilge fite fuaite isteach i gcearnóg chúng amháin den saol, is é sin go raibh sé, ní amháin daingnithe isteach i ndearcadh fealsúnachta amháin i ndearcadh spioradálta amháin.  Ceapaim féin go mba cheart dúinn ón uair seo athbheocainn leathan a chur os ár gcomhair chun na daoine óga a thabhairt linn.  Tuigim go bhfuil an pointe sroiste agam go mba cheart dúinn, dár ndóigh, sos a thógaint don tae.  Más mian leat, is féidir liom an sos a mholadh agus déanfaidh mé iarracht tosnú arís ag a seacht.</P>

      <P>Nuair a bhris muid bhí mé ag caint ar chomh tábhachtach agus atá sé go mbeadh gluaiseacht na hathbheochana leathan, ach go háirithe go mbeadh sé in ann an t-aos óg a thabhairt leis.  Ní maith liom cur leis an méid atá ráite agam faoin ábhar seo ach ceapaim go bhfuil sé tábhachtach deireadh <Col N="65" /> a chur le aon chaolaigeantas a bhí ag baint le gluaiseacht na Gaeilge.  Chun an fhírinne a rá, ní raibh sé fíor riamh go raibh an caolaigeantas sin mar bhunús leis an nGaeilge nó saol na Gaeltachta féin.  Shleamhnaigh sé sin isteach, ceapaim féin.</P>
      <P>Rinne Seanadóirí eile tagairt do na scríbhneoirí agus na filí a bhí lachach, leathan san méid a scríobh siad faoi na hábhair a thóg siad orthu féin a phlé.  Ní hé amháin nach leor é, ach ní ceart é go gceapfadh dream beag ar bith gur leo féin amháin atá oidhreacht na Gaeilge.  Rud nár luaigh éinne go dtí seo ach b'fhéidir Seanadóir amháin ná an tábhacht atá ag baint le rud eile, agus sé sin go bhfuil cuid mhór den náisiún Gaelach thar lear.  Tá tábhacht ag baint leis sin mar bhí ar chuid mhaith acu na limistéir Ghaeltachta a fhágáil agus ceapadh gur teanga an bhochtanais a bhí sa Ghaeilge.  Roimh an bhliain 1800 bhí an Ghaeilge imithe go mór i léig mar ghnáththeanga na daoine. Ag deireadh na haoise sin deineadh iarracht í a thabhairt ar ais.  Ach nílimid sásta glacadh leis an fhírinne gur thug muintir na hÉireann a gcúl ar an nGaeilge ar bhealach ach gur deineadh iarracht í a thabhairt ar ais.  Taobh istigh de 200 bhliain rinneadh cúpla iarracht ar a laghad é sin a dhéanamh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sin é an fáth a dúirt mé agus mé ag cur tús leis an méid atá le rá agam go bhfuil sé an-thábhachtach ar fad go mbeadh muid i ndáirire an uair seo.  Nuair a léim san tuarascáil atáimid ag plé faoi ghéarchéim na Gaeilge tá faitíos orm nach bhfuil sé faiseanta na laethanta seo bheith ag plé le cúis na Gaeilge ró-mhór. Nuair a tháinig mise go Gaillimh don chéad uair 20 bliain ó shin nó mar sin bhí a lán Gaeilge dá úsáid ag ócáidí poiblí. Rinne mé tagairt roimhe seo d'úsáid na Gaeilge ar ghnáthchruinnuithe de Chomhairle Chontae na Gaillimhe agus na constaicí a cuireadh roimh na camteoirí dúchais a rinne iarracht óráidí a thabhairt as Gaeilge.  Tá an scéal níos measa fós faoi Bhardas na Gaillimhe.  Sna seachtóidí, mar shampla, bhí sé de nós ag Méara na Gaillimhe ar gach ócáid phoiblí an Ghaeilge a úsáid i dtosach, go háirithe ar ócáidí móra ar nós Lá le Pádraig agus <Col N="66" /> mar sin de.  Na laethanta seo ní bhíonn an Ghaeilge le cloisint ar ócáidí mar sin. Ní bhíonn an teanga le cloisint ag gnáthchruinnithe de Bhardas na Gaillimhe. Bhí sé droch-bhéasach úsáid a dhéanamh den teanga agus cuireadh brú ar an duine sin aistriú don Bhéarla chomh sciobtha agus a b'fhéidir.</P>
    <P>Ní maith liom seo agus tá súil agam go dtiocfaidh an lá nuair a bheidh sé i bhfad níos éasca ag daoine a ngnó a dhéanamh trí Ghaeilge, más mian leo.  Táim sásta glacadh le haidhm bhunúsach Bhoird na Gaeilge agus na Seanadóirí a chuir an rún seo os ár gcomhair faoi dhátheangachas. Nuair a chuala mé faoin dátheangachas den chéad uair bhí mé amhrasach faoi ar bhealach: cheap mé go raibh contúirt ann go raibh daoine ag iarraidh sleamhnú ón bhun-aidhm, an Ghaeilge a chur ar ais. Mar a dúirt mé, tá mé sásta seans a thabhairt don scéim dátheangachais seo ach caithfidh tú a choinneáil san áireamh i gcónaí go bhfuil an Ghaeilge féin i bhfad níos laige ná an teanga eile.  Mar sin caithfimid áiseanna breise a chur ann chur seans ceart a thabhairt don Ghaeilge.  Ní féidir leat bheith ag caint faoi dhátheangachas nuair atá tú ag tabhairt na buntáistí ar fad don teanga atá láidir, atá in úsáid go forleathan, i bhfad níos mó ná an Ghaeilge.  Cuireann sé déistin orm na constaicí a cuirtear ar dhaoine a dteastaíonn uathu a ngnó a dhéanamh tré mheán na Gaeilge leis na heagraisí Stáit agus na comhlachtaí Stáit.  Ní maith liom léamh sna nuachtáin go bhfuil sé deacair ar dhaoine fiú amháin rudaí éagsúla a fháil tré mheán na Gaeilge, agus go gcuirtear fineáil orthu nuair nach bhfuil siad in ann ticéidí agus foirmeacha agus mar sin de a fháil as meán na Gaeilge.  I bpaipéir a foilsíodh i nGaillimh sna 1890's bhí tagairt do na daoine aisteacha a tháinig isteach go Cathair na Gaillimhe ón nGaeltacht.  Níl sé ach mar chúis náire dúinn go bhfuilimid ag cur na constaicí céanna ar dhaoine a theastaíonn uathu a gcuid gnó a dhéanamh trí Gaeilge.  Aontaím go mór leis an Seanadóir a mhol an rún seo agus leis an tuarascáil atá os ár gcomhair go mba cheart go mbeadh fo-oifig i ngach Roinn Stáit chun go mbeadh sé ar chumas mhuintir na Gaeltachta a gcuid gnó a dhéanamh <Col N="67" /> as Gaeilge.  Tá sin ag dul dóibh mar cheart agus tá sé sin glactha ag an Teach seo agus ag an Aire.  Sílim go bhfuil sum thar barr ag an Aire atá anseo anocht go mbeadh an ceart sin glactha.</P>
    <P>Beidh mé ag aistriú ar an mBéarla sar i bhfad mar ní maith liom go mbeinn drochbhéasach dóibh siúd nach bhfuil Gaeilge acu.  Nuair a bhí mé sa Teach eile níor chuir sé aon áthas orm bheith ag caint as Béarla faoi chúrsaí Gaeilge agus na Gaeltacha.  Tá súil agam go dtiocfaidh an lá sar i bhfad nuair a bheidh sé in ár gcumas ár dteanga féin a úsáid sna Tithe seo agus go mbeidh na cuntais faoir sna nuachtáin agus mar sin de.</P>
    <P>Rinneadh tagairt do chúrsaí cumarsáide, teilifís agus raidio, agus do choincheap de chomhluadar sa Ghaeltacht. Chun an fhírinne a rá, caitfidh tú a ghlacadh leis an choincheap de chomhluadar Gaelach agus mar sin de.  Ní féidir leat bheith i ndáiríre faoi chomhluadar Gaelach muna bhfuil tú sásta gach áis nua-aimseartha a chur ar fáil don chomhluadar sin.  Conas is féidir bheith ag caint faoi chomhluadar Gaelach nuair a chuireann tú iachall ar mhuintir Chois Fharraige, mar shampla, freastal ar oifigí i gCathair na Gaillimhe agus a ngnó a dhéanamh trí mheán an Bhéarla?  Conas is féidir bheith ag caint faoi chomhluadar Gaelach nuair a chuireann tú ar fáil dóibh teilifís i mBéarla amháin agus nuair atá seirbhís teoranta raidio ina dteanga féin ar fáil dóibh?  Tá sé de pholasaí ag mo pháirtí go bhfuil níos mó gá anois tús a chur le bunús seirbhís teilifíse don Ghaeltacht, chomh maith le huaireanta craolta raidio na Gaeltachta a leathnú, mar tuigeann chuile dhuine atá ag plé le cursaí craolacháin agus cumarsáide nuair a tharlaíonn sé nach bhfuil níos mó ná i gcónaí an raidio ag iomaíocht le teilifís. Caithfidh tú glacadh leis sin, agus má táimid i ndáiríre faoin rud atá os ár gcómhair, tá geallúintí dearfacha ag teastáil.  Caithfimid a chur in áireamh i gcónaí nach le Bord na Gaeilge an tuarascáil seo, go bhfuil sé glactha ag an Rialtas.  Táimid ag caint faoi phlean gearr-thréimhseach an Rialtais.</P>
    <P>Tá sé leagtha amach go beacht i gceann <Col N="68" /> de na haltanna cén costas atá ag baint leis an phlean seo bliain i ndiaidh bliana.  An mbeidh an t-airgead ar fáil i mbliana agus sa bhliain seo chugainn?  Is ceart dúinn freagra a fháil ar sin.  Tá gach duine beagnach ag moladh gach rud atá sa tuarascáil seo agus níor mhaith liom féin aon locht a fháil uirthi, ach caithfidh mé tagairt a dhéanamh don alt ar bharr leathanach 27 den tuarascáil, agus léifidh mé as Béarla é.  Baineann sé leis an Roinn Oideachais:</P>
    <P>The Department of Education undertakes to enter into consultation with the relevant educational bodies with a view to implementation as far as feasible and to the extent that falls within its competence, and subject to available resources, the following recommendations.</P>
    <P>Tá trí choinníollacha ann &mdash; chomh maith agus is féidir, chomh maith agus a mbaineann sé le agus chomh fada agus a mbíonn an t-airgead ar fáil.  Ceapaim go bhfuil níos mó ag teastáil, go mba chóir dúinn níos mó a fháil ón Roinn Oideachais.  Is ag an bpointe seo is cóir dom aistriú don Bhéarla.</P>
    <P>The finest report published on the matter of the Irish language and the Gaeltacht was the 1926 report under the chairmanship of Risteárd Ó Maolchatha.  That report made reference to the history of the Irish language within the educational system.  It wrote about the time when the Irish language was not permitted within the school system except in additional hours after the official hours of the school system.  It referred to the early difficulties about the training of teachers and so forth.</P>
    <P>It is time that we got a better commitment than we have received from the Department of Education.  I do not accept these three conditional phrases &mdash; as far as feasible, subject to available resources, or as far as falls within their competence.  Let us be perfectly clear. Successive Senators spoke about the importance that attaches to the teaching of Irish in the schools.  Anybody who is serious about the Irish language knows that a great responsibility falls within the realm of education with regard to the <Col N="69" /> prospects for the Irish language.  It is time that we all stopped being conditional &mdash; as far as is possible and as much as I can and as much as I shall be able to afford. It would be better to bury the corpse quickly, rather than have that long wake. I know that Bord na Gaeilge in preparing this report which has become the official plan of the Government in the short-term had to balance a number of different approaches within it.  No doubt there were varying feelings as to what might or might not be appropriate.  I know there are others who wish to speak, but in the time remaining to me I want to be as clear as possible.</P>
    <P>The Joint Oireachtas Committee should be established.  If this committee is established, I want to place a warning before Members of this House.  They will not be thanked historically for indulging in yet another exercise in half commitment to the restoration of the Irish language or, according to our changed aim, to the establishment of a bilingual community within which the Irish language would have a chance of being spoken. Surely that task cannot be begun unless those people for whom Irish is their first language can transact their business with the State and semi-State bodies in the perfect assurance that provision will be made for them.  Will there be funds available this year or next year to implement the programme that has been laid before us?  An immense blow will be dealt to the whole question of the language and the movement to restore and strengthen it if money is not made available.</P>
    <P>There are also other sides to it.  Goodwill alone will not help the Irish language in an institutional sense.  We will have positively to discriminate in favour of the language in the manner in which we transact our business in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  This means asking questions about the adequacy of the facilities for the use of Irish in all our deliberations. This concept of community about which I have been speaking has no meaning whatsoever unless it can be defined in terms of boundaries.  If one regards the several Irish communities as existing for a whole host of purposes, one is not honouring that concept of community if it is <Col N="70" /> not made possible for its members to transact all their business with every agency of the State through the language that is their first language.</P>
    <P>In relation to education we need to say &mdash; and here I want to address the Minister very particularly &mdash; that we want to discriminate positively in favour of the language. May I give an example of what I have in mind?  Where centrally decided measures of a budgetary or of an organisational kind are taken, this evening we want to hear that allowances will be made for the specific conditions in the Gaeltacht and in education.  I will give an example of schizophrenia in this regard. We have built our whole case against the imposition of the super levy in relation to milk, at the level of the European Community, on the basis that it is a general measure, and that we have much to lose because of the state of the phase of development in our dairying industry.  We are asking for an exception to be made in the case of the Irish economy.  If you want to take that argument and apply it internally in relation to matters of the language, if you are going to say that you have an embargo on public service appointments, for example, you cannot say that that must have an equal implication on the areas of the State's activities that are strong and the area of the State's activities that are weak or in a developmental phase.</P>
    <P>Bord na Gaeilge were established for a specific task that came after our embargo on public service appointments, and very specifically, in relation to staff, their needs must be excepted from the general embargo.</P>
    <P>I cannot see how on the one hand the Government can place this report before us in the Seanad and ask us to accept its provisions and, at the same time, wave on with every blessing any notion of the curtailment of staff to do the work.</P>
    <P>I have spoken already about the whole question of the media.  Where you have television in competition with radio, of course television will win out and there is an importance attached to making a start to a television service.  Then you will have television and radio within the Gaeltacht communities and you will have an <Col N="71" /> opportunity for the language to strengthen itself.</P>
    <P>Reference has not been made up to now to the Local Broadcasting Bill.  Here I want to ask a very specific question of the Minister for the Gaeltacht.  I know he is interested in this matter.  No doubt he will want to develop his viewpoint.  The Local Broadcasting Bill, as I read it, contains a number of quite serious dangers to the Gaeltacht.  In its draft form there is no specific provision for the protection of the Gaeltacht in so far as you could, for example, have people who are motivated by commercial profit alone making an application for a licence in a densely populated area on the verge of any one of the Gaeltachts.  They could broadcast anything they liked in English, be it of any value in English or otherwise, and this would be rained in on people for whom Irish was their language.  This is not in the sense that I am anxious to stop people listening to anything they want to; I am making the point that, if the Government take it as an aim in accepting this proposal from Bord na Gaeilge, then surely it is their responsibility as well to make a number of very specific provisions in relation to the protection of this purpose which precedes the publication of the draft Bill in relation to local broadcasting.  Will there be a member from Roinn na Gaeltachta or from the eagraisí Ghaeilge on the board that will decide on the licences?  Will there be specific criteria to be fulfilled in relation to matters to do with the language?  Let us hope we will not have any of the tokenism that, as long as a few minutes a day are devoted to broadcasts in Irish, the commitment to the language will have been met.</P>
    <P>This raises a further question.  If the Government are serious about the language and are inviting a new beginning to be made, they must watch what they are doing in their other legislation to make sure that that aim is not contradicted. Nobody can be happy with the treatment of the language nationally. Very often the Irish language speaking community has become too small.  It is often too narrow, and it has sometimes retreated into itself.  Here we are visited <Col N="72" /> with a contradiction.  While this is true of some of the organisations involved in restoring the language, one survey after another shows that there is great goodwill towards the language among all age groups, and that it is not located in rural areas only but that it is present in urban areas right across our community.</P>
    <P>This is one of our last efforts in relation to the language.  It is important that we be sincere about it.  I should say an important word about two separate things.  I mentioned the 1926 report.  It is very interesting.  It did not go without notice to the Executive Council of the day.  In 1928 the Government published a volume on the Government policy on the 1928 recommendations.  In a curious way you find that this report is broken down under almost the same headings as Bord na Gaeilge's report of last summer.  They began by saying they wanted to group their recommendations under five headings: Irish-speaking districts, educational facilities, the use of Irish in administration, economic conditions and general recommendations.  They went on to make 82 of them.  They ranged across the whole spectrum of life and yet, despite these recommendations being made in 1928, we are still making lesser versions of them in 1983.</P>
    <P>We have not come to terms with the full implications of what has happened in relation to the loss of the Irish language as a spoken language.  Neglected in our discussion so far this afternoon and this evening, for example, has been the whole dimension of colonialism.  Quite frankly, the Irish people have been colonised and, as a colonised people, like any of the other colonies of France or any other country, they have an ambiguous relation to the language, that thing they are not willing to use every day, that thing they are not willing to let die.</P>
    <P>From 1800 to the present you could trace a cycle of interest in the language: on the one hand letting it go because people of consequence do not speak this language any more.  The people who speak the language are the broken colonised people.  On the other hand, it is hardly let go before people express a concern to retain it and then, gradually, <Col N="73" /> as the effort to retain it is delivered into policy that is indulged half-heartedly, it is time to let the language go again, and then it is time to make another attempt to bring it back.</P>
    <P>All of this raises the question as to what we are about in this circumstance. There is no point in indulging ourselves in the belief that just now there is a well of goodwill towards the language that has only to be tapped and everything will be fine.  In truth it is not cynicism that makes me say that learning from our past mistakes and our past lack of commitment is an important part of what we are doing at the moment.  For example, we had the Gníomh don Ghaeltacht report.  I will not bore this House with the list of all the reports we have had about the language and the Gaeltacht.  This rather large 1926 volume, complete with maps, cost £622 to publish, text and maps.  Thousands have been spent on reports since and the language has decreased in use and in commitment.  Seán de Fréine wrote in his book <i>The Great Silence, 1965</i> that the most probable explanation of language changes is, in a nutshell, that when people change their language they do so not because it is insufficient for their needs but because their society is.</P>
    <P>I want to say a word about the intermixing of two separate projects within Irish political experience, one in relation to the language, one in relation to the Gaeltacht.  The better reports have always recognised that the important bun-chloch of any attempt to rivive the Irish language was that you provided conditions in the Gaeltacht which were on a level with other parts of the country, and that you provided a social and economic infrastructure that enables the people to live their lives with a reasonable degree of security from want.  That is correctly stated: you make secure the Gaeltacht communities that exist as the basis of your language policy.</P>
    <P>The other problem was the restoration of the language.  While they are connected in this way, I believe there is a distinction between the two.  The strategy that is most appropriate in the short-term for making the Gaeltacht conditions in the socio-economic times secure are not <Col N="74" /> necessarily exactly the same as the measures that are most appropriate for the language.  It is, for example, possible to create an industrialisation within the Gaeltacht community that will damage the language.  Equally, it is possible to have a language policy that will make any industrialisation impossible.  What has to happen is that these two separate aims have to be tailored one in recognition of the requirements of the other.  I got no welcome in the sixties and seventies when recommending to the different development authorities who took upon themselves curam chun na Gaeltachaí a fhorbairt that they should base their development projects on natural resources.  The idea was that we would industrialise at a faster rate than the IDA if necessary, and without often examining the linguistic impact of some of these industrialisation strategies.  Now we have a resource-based industrialisation strategy which I believe is far more appropriate for the Gaeltacht areas.  As I emphasised, there are two separate projects and while one scheme has to be tailored in concert with the other, they can be confused at our peril.</P>
    <P>I have, on many occasions, spoken about the Irish language and I want to return briefly to one other theme.  I always had in mind the attitude which many people within the revival movement had towards socialism and radicals. They suggested that it was a natural project of the revival movement, that it would revive that version of Ireland that was conservative and would accord to some mythical values that never really prevailed. I was conscious all the time I have been meeting people from the Gaeltacht that their experience and their history was not one of timid conservatism.  It was one of generous independence in a number of matters.  Only last night, for example, when women from the Gaeltacht were discussing their lives in the Gaeltacht and matters relating to sex, one of them said, in the most beautiful way, that they would of course listen to the priest but, &ldquo;an créatúr, ní bheadh an taithí ná an t-eolas aige&rdquo;&mdash; he would neither have the experience nor the knowledge, but of course they would listen to him.  That was <Col N="75" /> generous spirited independence from authority sources however conservative they may be.</P>
    <P>The history of the language and the inheritance that is the Gaelic world &mdash; I refer to the Gaelic world because it goes much broader than the language in terms of culture and experience, in terms of the folklore that lies behind the Gaeltacht communities &mdash; is one of generosity and independence and it is a much more complex and pluralistic thing than many people would like us to believe.  It is not that we are embarking on a journey back to the Ark; it is important that we say that this new movement, to which this debate will be such an important contribution, is part of a more generous approach towards the revival of the language.</P>
    <P>Many of the people who went abroad &mdash; the Irish speakers to whom Senator Brendan Ryan referred &mdash; who find themselves on the building sites and in the midst of urban communities in Britain are part of the Irish nation.  What right have middle class, comfortable people left at home with their version of the language, and not having half succeeded in it, to give lectures about Irish and Irish speaking when thousands of people, over 50 per cent, from the Gaeltacht communities, between the ages of 15 and 24 in any year in the sixties and seventies had to take the boat to England?  It is not accidental that the songs written in that period are amhráin an mbád, amhráin an beet and so on.  Many years ago I spent Christmas with people working on the beet campaign in Shropshire.  For two generations they had left areas like Carraroe to live with their language in the most appalling conditions in the land of the coloniser, and it was native Governments who had not made the provisions in their own communities so that they might have security from want, that they might have employment, adequate housing and basic infrastructures.  That is not a matter for pride on our part.  This new movement I speak about has to be a comprehensive one.  I worry that we will debate it today and other days, and that even the best-minded Minister in the <Col N="76" /> world will make a reply and make a commitment, but the Cabinet has to make money available for this task now.</P>
    <P>Let us say that in hard times the depth of the Government's commitment will be seen and that despite a hard economic atmosphere &mdash; ganntanas airgid &mdash; people will still at this stage be willing to make a commitment and then that commitment will appear all the more.  If that commitment is made, there will be a public response, and that public response has to be genuine.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the manner in which traditional music has been revived. I welcome that, although I am not as sanguine about what it tells us as some of the other speakers are.  There is goodwill towards the language.  There are younger, broad-minded, energetic people involved in the revival movement now who will bring it a lot further than it has been brought before.  I am not knocking the efforts of those people who are fial don Ghaeilge sna Gaeltachtaí, who are loyal to the language and the community. I am saying that new projects have to be cast in the temper of their times, and it is important that the way in which we proceed now will be one that will bring young people with us.  It is important that the language be used in every network of communication through which we operate.  It is no joy for me to say that when I was a student at University College, Galway, there was more language in use as a teaching medium than there is now.  One of the reasons for that was the manner in which some of the attitudes towards the language were put into effect.  At one time, offensively, a friend, who is now dead &mdash; charity forbids me mentioning his name &mdash; told me that a very prominent Irishman who was a colleague of his was only half an Irishman because he did not speak Irish.  That kind of attitude did no good to Ireland, to the language or to the Gaeltacht.  Of course it is a marvellous enrichment for anybody to be able to speak the traditional language of his nation &mdash; and it is right to think about it as the language of one's nation because lous enrichment for anybody to be able as the language of one's nation because it goes beyond territory &mdash; but it is equally <Col N="77" /> wrong to exclude people on the basis of their inability to speak the language.</P>
    <P>I worry only about our own timidity.  I spoke about colonisation.  In every institutional feature of our lives we had aped Britain.  One of my predecessors in this House, representing Trinity College, the late Senator Owen Sheehy-Skeffington, once spoke about our immense patriotism, that we had painted the pillar boxes green with the crowns underneath the green paint, incongruously, but that in every other matter we had taken on board the worst institutional features of the coloniser.  It is true of everything we do from the drafting of statutes to the procedures of this House, to the manner in which our courts are run, to the manner in which our authorities are structured, to the manner in which we organise our local government, and so on.  We were not able to deliver in institutional reform different aspects of our own liberation. The colonisation from which we suffered had gone deeper into us than we were willing to accept.  The language revival movement has to take cognisance of that.  You cannot divorce advancing the cause of the language from a recognition of what the difficulties are, and the difficulties are real.</P>
    <P>I support all the positive proposals that have been made by other Senators about the implementation of this report.  I spoke about the importance of having a broad view of the matter.</P>
    <P>Speakers mentioned the pre-school movement available for those who are lán-Ghaelach and, of course, there is a great importance attached to that.  Children have a natural curiosity and that can be built on.  However, is there much point in standing up here and saying one welcomes the pre-school movement which provides the facility for Irish to be spoken by small children and at the same time make it impossible for an adequate and comprehensive range of primary and second level facilities to be available in the Gaeltacht?  Can anybody stand up and say we have been fair to the people of the Gaeltacht in relation to secondary education or in relation to third level education? In relation to second level education, for example, is it not true to say <Col N="78" /> that we have demanded from the people of the Gaeltacht the same requirements for catchment areas for second level schools as we have in any other part of the country?</P>
    <P>Where are the special provisions we have made in relation to quotas or catchment areas?  They are not there.  At the same time as we are proclaiming that it is our special aim to restore the language, we are not willing to follow that through into every other Department of State. That is why I refer to the mealy-mouthed commitment in this report, although everyone has been glowing about it.  I am sorry I am the only person who has to strike this note.  I regard alt a h-aon, leathanach 27, as somewhat mealy-mouthed. I hope the Government, having accepted this report, will impose their will consistently across the different Departments of State so as to achieve the objective they have taken upon themselves. No doubt there will be people who will reply and say that I have misconstrued the contribution of the Department of Education.  All I have to say to that is that I am a little long in the tooth now to be accused of naivety but I know caution, extra caution, and killing with kindness when I see it.</P>
    <P>We should consider moving sub-offices of the different Departments of State, both central and local, into the Gaeltacht so that people might be able to transact their business through the medium of the Irish language.  It is time for us also to bear in mind what a Gaeltacht community might be.  Here again there are different forms of Gaeltacht communities, there is not any one Gaeltacht community. New forms of community will arise that will be informed by the urban experience.  Death is a slow cross that creeps up on us all one day after another. There is no way we will keep the consuming public happy in relation to institutional participation and the media and, at the same time, do something that will hurt a little such as the revival of the language.</P>
    <P>That is one of the points missing from the speeches so far.  It is not going to be as easy as some people think.  The atmosphere is favourable.  The report is there. <Col N="79" /> The institutional possibility exists.  However, if like in relation to local radio we are going to meet the demand, quite frankly there is a cost associated with it. It is far more than a monetary cost.  There are other costs associated with it as well. There are, for example, the civil servants who will have to take it on themselves to become proficient in Irish.  There are the teachers, for example, who might have to take some aspect of retraining on themselves.  There are people like myself, who used to lecture one time through Irish in University College, Galway, and who would like to do so again at some stage in the future.  The one thing that weighs heavy on all of us is a cynical commitment to the Gaeltacht and to the Irish language. I spent most of my time &mdash; this has been going through my speech again and again &mdash; telling myself that if we do take the language and its revival on board we do not have to take all the other musty stuff in the national wardrobe as well. We do not.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we have opportunities this time.  Iad san a chuir an rún seo os ár gcomhair inniu, an tráthnóna seo, táimid go léir faoi chomaoin dóibh as ucht an méid a rinne siad mar dá mba rud é gur thug sé seans dos na Seanadóirí go léir oráidí breátha mar a chlois muid a thabhairt os ar gcomhair inniu, sin amháin, b'fhiú é.  Molaim go mór iad agus tá súil agam, nuair a thabharfaidh an tAire freagra ar an díospóireacht seo go mbeidh sé in ann na geallúintí atá ag teastáil a thabhairt agus tar éis sin go mbeimid go léir sásta cabhrú leis agus leis an Rialtas chun an aidhm fiúntach seo a bhaint amach.</P>

      <P>Ar dtús ba mhaith liom agus ba cheart dom a rá go bhfuil suim mhór agamsa san ábhar seo.  Is dóigh liom freisin go bhfuil an suim céanna ag gach Seanadóir san Teach seo agus ag cuid mhór des na daoine san tír againn freisin.  Tá fhios agam áfach go bhfuil níos mó ná suim in easnamh orainn sula mbeidh an teanga Ghaeilge ina teanga labhartha ag muintir na tíre seo go léir.  Dá bhrí sin tá fáilte mór agam don phlean gníomhaíochta don Ghaeilge, <Col N="80" /> míle naoi gcéad ochtó is a trí-míle naoi gcéad ochtó is a sé, atá curtha le chéile ag Bord na Gaeilge.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Action Plan for Irish, 1983-1986, a four year plan which is subdivided under four headings.  Part 1, dealing with the Gaeltacht, covers more than five pages while part 2 on the community covers 11 pages.  Part 3 on education is dealt with in ten pages and part 4, the State, covers six pages.  In addition, there are six introductory pages describing the plan, towards a bilingual society (1983-2000) and focal points of policy.  The plan is not a general or comprehensive one for the restoration of Irish.  It is a limited four-year action programme with achievable targets agreed or subject to agreement by the participating parties and it is intended that progress will be monitored on a yearly basis.  This is a very desirable and satisfactory feature of it.</P>
      <P>The important work for the language already being carried out by individuals, organisations and agencies, including Bord na Gaeilge, will continue parallel with the plan.  Over the next four years Bord na Gaeilge will implement and expand policies to achieve certain basic targets based on language strategies considered necessary over the next two decades. An important factor is the additional funding necessary and estimates are included.  The urgency of the problem is accepted.  Because the present position of the Irish language is so precarious, the main objective is survival.  It is also accepted now that the work of restoration will be a long and slow process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Between 25 per cent and 30 per cent of the population claim to know Irish reasonably well.  It is interesting to ponder on the amount of knowledge that is covered by the definition &ldquo;reasonably well&rdquo;.  The objective is a bilingual society and it is an important part of that policy to arrest the decline of Irish as a community language in the Gaeltacht.  It seems appropriate to ask at this point: what is the cause of such widespread use of English among Gaeltacht children going to and coming from school and in schoolyards and playgrounds?  In 1891 about 19 per cent of the population of the 26 Counties spoke Irish while in 1981 the <Col N="81" /> figure is down to 1 per cent.  Any large scale improvement such as is envisaged will require a receptive atmosphere and commitment from the whole community. A reasonable expectation in return would be employment prospects through Irish for their children and, particularly, in the public service.  Favourable attitudes towards Irish may be developed with a better understanding of the way in which it has served for so long to give expression to the mind and life experience of the Irish people.  Without a more positive acceptance immediately of the need for Irish as well as English to be obvious and widespread, it will not be possible to achieve a successful bilingual policy.</P>
    <P>The educational sector cannot restore the language on its own, but it is most important that Irish should be taught properly and professionally.  Is it being taught properly and professionally in all schools and at all times?  There is, I believe, a view that the intermediate and leaving certificate programmes of Irish are causing distaste for the language among the majority of students.</P>
    <P>Irish language networks are required, forming nucleus Gaeltachtaí all over the country, with all-Irish schools at the heart of such Gaeltachtaí.  Perhaps it would be possible to circularise every home in the country, giving ten basic precepts why Irish should be restored, with all-party support for such a programme.</P>
    <P>An indication of the gigantic task involved is the acknowledgement that at this stage only emergency measures will ensure that the Gaeltacht areas will survive, even at their present strength, until the end of the century.  The involvement of all State agencies is most important, as well as many others.  These include the Garda Síochána, Army, medical, including nursing staffs, trade unions, AnCO, CERT, Youth Employment Agency and so on.  People must be given a reason and an opportunity to save the language.  Irish language centres are required in cities and towns to give the revival of the spoken language at this time relevance and to provide opportunities to use Irish freely and openly in everyday affairs. Bold and imaginative steps are needed to give the 25 per cent plus of the population <Col N="82" /> who have sufficient Irish an opportunity to use the language naturally in everyday affairs, thus making a significant contribution to revival.</P>
    <P>The value of the media and entertainment is realised and proposals are made for the establishment of an entertainment agency particularly catering for young people.  A comprehensive Irish language programme is recommended, to be implemented by the Government through broadcasting and television.  The point is made that RTE, in their early years, played a central role with regard to the Irish language but over the years there has been an increasing slippage. From a personal point of view, I would say that any programmes in Irish must be welcomed but naturally some will be more successful than others.  I feel that the series &ldquo;Labhair Gaeilge Linn&rdquo; was particularly successful.</P>
    <P>In the area of education and Irish in the national schools, many trainee teachers take only short courses in professional Irish.  These courses are inadequate for the training of Irish language teachers.  I have heard suggestions that the preparatory colleges be reopened with all-party approval.</P>
    <P>Voluntary organisations, in this revival effort, are and will always be required. Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge should be reviewed, revitalised and re-organised as a forum of opinion and action for the language revival.  Only a major and determined initiative now can ensure survival and revival of the Irish language.  It is interesting to ponder if the danger point can be passed by 1993, the centenary of the establishment of the Gaelic League.</P>
    <P>Dealing specifically with the Gaeltacht, part 1 of the plan lists on page 7 the anglicising influences.  There are six and are as follows:</P>
    <P>&mdash;The daily impact of a television service transmitting perhaps 95 per cent of its programme content in English;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the extent to which central and local government agencies still conduct their business in the Gaeltacht through English (thereby diminishing the standing of Irish and conveying the <Col N="83" /> impression of a lack of policy at central government level for its enhancement);</P>
    <P>&mdash;the linguistic effects of industrialisation;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the undermining of Irish as the community language of the Gaeltacht by the gradual influx of English speaking residents;</P>
    <P>&mdash;certain inadequacies in the present educational arrangements;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the extent ot which young people in the Gaeltacht have had to rely on commercial entertainment in English.</P>
    <P>There are many questions we could ask with regard to these that allow no easy answer.  For example, is it possible or even desirable to arrest and/or reverse these influences?  How do you combat No. 3 in practice, the linguistic effects of industrialisation?  In consolidating the Gaeltacht by providing employment, the success achieved has resulted in the inflow of mainly English-speaking residents, often management and technical personnel, increasing the number of English-speaking homes in the Gaeltacht. This is now a matter of serious concern.</P>
    <P>Measures envisaged in the plan to counteract these anglicising influences include community action, with leadership coming from the Gaeltacht people themselves, having effective backing from State agencies and local government bodies.  I understand that for over 40 years County Galway VEC conducted its business with schools, Gaeltacht and Galltacht, through the medium of Irish. This example should be followed by all the other vocational education bodies.</P>
    <P>Radio na Gaeltachta has proved its usefulness over the last ten years and it should be further developed in providing a 32-county national service.  The possibilities which the proposed local radio will provide should be maximised with regard to Irish.  It is a good proposal that a co-ordinating group be set up in every Gaeltacht area.  This group could become an action group as well.</P>
    <P>With regard to the section on the community, it is worthwhile commenting that the public responds actively when it is <Col N="84" /> faced with an actual necessity.  The public will respond actively to the necessity for the revival when it has an informed awareness of the necessity.  It is the function and the duty of the State and all of its agencies to inform the public of this necessity.  It is important to have a concerted effort, of which everyone is aware, thus providing an encouraging environment for the use of Irish.  An interesting question to ask is: how did Israel succeed in the restoration of the Israeli language in less than 30 years?  Are Israel's methods worth adopting for the purpose of restoring the Irish language?</P>
    <P>There is a proposal in the plan for an Irish language television service to commence by 1987.  There are two questions in relation to that.  Has the proposal any hope whatever of implementation?  Will it fall a victim to some economic axe?</P>
    <P>Suggestions for encouragement by the Department of Education include the proposal that all national teachers and all teachers of Irish in post-primary schools in the towns should be encouraged to lead the people of the respective towns in the appreciation and restoration of Irish.  It follows that every teacher in Ireland should be a teacher of Irish. &ldquo;Féile Drámaíochta na Scol&rdquo; should be revived and, if necessary, revitalised and every county should enter at least one play in the all-Ireland competitions.</P>
    <P>There are some questions that also need answers regarding education. Firstly, even though an oral examination in Irish is now an integral part of the leaving certificate, why does it happen that a vast number of leaving certificate school leavers are unable to take part in a simple conversation in Irish for any length of time?  Secondly, how did the preparatory schools of the twenties, thirties, forties and fifties succeed in turning out students who had near perfect command of spoken English, that is, students who came from the native-speaking parishes of Galway, Kerry and Donegal?</P>
    <P>Page 25 of the plan states:</P>
    <P>At primary level, syllabi and courses in Irish will be determined with a view to strengthening the ability of <Col N="85" /> pupils to speak and communicate in the language.</P>
    <P>This is very praiseworthy.  But some, if not all, of the essays for the intermediate certificate, as set out in <i>Prós na Meán Teistiméirachta,</i> have a negative effect in strengthening the ability of post-primary pupils to speak and communicate in the Irish language.  Are the intermediate and leaving certificate courses geared for the benefit of prospective graduates or towards bilingualism for the Irish people? Which is the priority, Irish literature or a sound basic knowledge of spoken and written Irish?</P>
    <P>A diploma course, as recommended in the last paragraph on page 25, is long overdue.  It was the practice in the forties and fifties that trainee teachers doing the Ceárd Teastas course would get practice in teaching a subject through Irish.  This practice, if lapsed, should be revived.</P>
    <P>The plan recommends a network of all-Irish primary schools.  The logical follow-up to this plan is the establishment of an all-Irish post-primary school in each catchment area.  There is the question of cost; but the loss of the language is the greatest loss of all, as the Jews would tell us.</P>
    <P>Last March public representatives were circularised with Géarcheím na Gaeilge, which was published by Connradh na Gaeilge and which was summarised in a bilingual sheet accompanying the report.  I should like to quote a few extracts from this bilingual sheet.  First, in relation to An Ghaeltacht; there are the following observations:</P>
    <P>The following facts are clear pointers to the continuing decline of the Gaeltacht:</P>
    <P>A. the number of Irish speakers in the Gaeltacht fell by 7.4% between 1961 and 1971.</P>
    <P>B. The percentage of Irish speakers as part of the population of the Gaeltacht has fallen from 86.6% in 1961 to 83.3% in 1971.</P>
    <P>C. Less than 50% of Gaeltacht children attending National Schools qualify for the £10 Grant paid by Roinn na Gaeltachta <Col N="86" /> to children of school-going age living in the Gaeltacht and whose home-language is Irish.</P>
    <P>They would urge a rescue plan for the Gaeltacht which would contain the following elements:</P>
    <P>(a)  The encouragement of all parents in the Gaeltacht to rear their children through Irish.</P>
    <P>(b) No further closure of Gaeltacht schools and the development of a special curriculum suitable to the particular needs of Gaeltacht children.</P>
    <P>(c) That linguistic factors be taken into account when planning applications are being dealt with.</P>
    <P>(d) The broadcasting of wide range of Irish language television programmes on a regular basis.</P>
    <P>(e) A substantial increase in the sum paid within the £10 grant scheme administered by Roinn na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>(f) The redrawing of the Gaeltacht's boundaries.</P>
    <P>(g) The granting of effective and wide-ranging powers to Údarás na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>In relation to Irish in the educational system the point was made that the teaching on a national scale was very haphazard and that the following proposals should be adopted if the relevant authorities are genuinely in favour of promoting Irish in the educational system:</P>
    <P>All-Irish primary schools will be set up on a regular basis throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Every teacher of Irish will have fluency in the language.</P>
    <P>A national system of all-Irish kindergartens will be set up.</P>
    <P>It will be ensured that every child will be learning Irish effectively.</P>
    <P>Greater emphasis will be placed on teaching the spoken language, especially in second-level schools.</P>
    <P>Other subjects will be taught through the medium of Irish.</P>
    <P>All-Irish education will be made available at every level to Gaeltacht people.</P>
    <P>A special section will be set up within <Col N="87" /> the Department of Education to develop all-Irish education.</P>
    <P>The various schemes by which adults can learn Irish will be developed.</P>
    <P>There is a brief extract about the media from which I quote:</P>
    <P>As far back as 1972 the RTÉ Authority declared that it aimed to broadcast at least one substantial programme in Irish per night.  But any step since then has unfortunately been in the wrong direction, despite the foundation (with Connradh na Gaeilge's active assistance) of RTE 2.</P>
    <P>This situation has been deplored by various organisations, Government Ministers and judges even.</P>
    <P>We demand that RTÉ broadcast as a short-term measure, one substantial programme in Irish each night.</P>
    <P>We believe that an all-Irish television station is needed and that RTÉ should immediately begin planning its establishment.  The neglect of RTÉ with regard to children's programmes in Irish is a national scandal.  The Irish language organisations have suggested many types of such programmes to RTÉ; we are convinced that action in this area is urgently required.</P>
    <P>Very basic changes are also required with regard to radio broadcasting.  One example is the need to broadcast Irish language programmes during the day.</P>
    <P>There are further points that I feel should be mentioned in relation to any debate on Irish.  There are two Departments concerned with Irish, the Departments of the Gaeltacht and Education, but no satisfactory report is published on their activities. In particular there is no report on the number of children in each of the Gaeltacht areas who qualify for and get the £10 grant.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Gaeltacht were established for the purpose of reviving the confidence of the people and of helping the Gaeltacht, but quite a few people would claim that the result has been the opposite.  Two stiúraitheoirí are employed wholetime in each of the three Gaeltachtaí.  There is no report on what <Col N="88" /> they do or what the achievements in these areas are.  Since the establishment of the Department too small a percentage of expenditure has reached the Gaeltacht. The percentage of Gaeltacht Estimates unexpended is among the highest in supply services.  Inflation has been allowed to phase out and neutralise the value of the most important substantive help &mdash; for example, the subsidy to <i>Amárach,</i> which ceased this year, and maintenance grants for students in the Gaeltacht, while grants for the Irish colleges have not been increased for the past four years although the costs have increased very considerably.  The Gaeltacht Estimates were 0.31555 per cent of the national expenditure in 1978.  That was down to 0.08364 per cent in 1982.  These figures represent £3,155 per million and £836 per million.</P>
    <P>In the Department of Education it is the general belief that there are three Ministers who do most if not all of their work through English and that this has permeated through the Department. Most of the work of the Department is now done through English.  Some years ago more than 300 first-level and second level schools outside the Gaeltacht areas were teaching through Irish and almost all have been liquidated.  The Department compulsorily closed large numbers of Gaeltacht schools and transported Irish-speaking pupils to English schools.  The Department have consistently refused to provide second-level schools for half of the Gaeltacht pupils who got first-level education through Irish.  First-and second-level Gaeltacht schools are not giving pupils a speaking knowledge of Irish.</P>
    <P>In what is considered an act of whitewash, the Department of Education asked the Department of the Gaeltacht for their view on closing Gaeltacht schools.  Any educationalist knows that the Irish bilinguals integrated with English unilinguals result in the use of English as the medium.  It is therefore required that every native Irish speaker be guaranteed first-level education in Gaeltacht schools with two-thirds to three-quarters of the pupils being native Irish speakers.  All Gaeltacht students <Col N="89" /> should be similarly organised into Gaeltacht schools at second-level.  Similar third-level and professional education should be guaranteed.</P>
    <P>All services in central and local government and semi-State bodies should be available to the public in the language of the public's choice, to English speakers in English and Irish speakers in Irish. This situation has not obtained for the last four years.  This basic right was denied to the Irish speakers since Mr. Ryan decreed that public servants did not need to be competent in Irish and publicly asked all professional bodies to adopt the same view.  That was the end of service in Irish for the Gaeltacht people.  Substitute arrangements are simply whitewash in the opinion of some people.  For example, the Irish speaking unit in the Revenue Commission is staffed by clerical officers and junior executives who can make no decisions and are really only interpreters for the deciding officers.  It is felt that in this area there should be officers at least at inspector level.</P>
    <P>The final debasement of Irish language was the Supreme Court decision in the Ó Monacháin case that in spite of the 1924 Act and the Constitution the Government may appoint non-Irish speaking district justices for Gaeltacht courts, holding their courts solely in English, and native speakers have no right to have the case heard in Irish but only the same rights as other foreigners to present their case through interpreters.  This is exactly the position established by conquerors when English laws extended to all Ireland in 1603.  There are some with a very great love of the Irish language who would say that if the judgment of the Supreme Court is not in accordance with law the judges should be impeached.  If that were the case every Government and Parliament since Independence would stand impeached for betrayal of the Irish nation.</P>
    <P>The absolute priority is the preservation of the Gaeltacht.  No living language can exist without it.  The official Gaeltacht is estimated to have a population of 70,000 but surveys by <i>Amárach</i> and Desmond Fennell show that the number of <Col N="90" /> habitual Irish speakers is only 30,000. This small number must immediately be guaranteed first, second and third-level education through Irish, as well as <i>ad hoc</i> and vocational training.  People should be able to deal with the health services through Irish.  There are hospitals in some Gaeltacht areas where Irish is not spoken and old people are reluctant to go there.</P>
    <P>A planning authority to formulate plans to suit Gaeltacht requirements is most important.  Another necessity is a fully competitive, funded newspaper in Irish, as is extensive development of Radio na Gaeltachta and the television service.  A restructuring of Roinn na Gaeltachta is necessary so that it can command the confidence of the people of the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the teachers of Irish through the years.  Perhaps some scheme could be devised to enable grants to the unemployed for the study of Irish.  There could be some monitoring of their progress in the language.</P>
    <P>The plan mentions that religious groups could be of considerable assistance in the restoration of the Irish language. Perhaps Irish should be used more frequently in the celebration of the Mass. Some might say it would be better to use a language which the people would know, but for many years Latin was used.  I should like to pay tribute to An Réalt, a section of the Legion of Mary which did considerable work for the Irish language.</P>
    <P>Some incentive might be given to encourage people to use the Irish form of their names and addresses.  Senator McGuinness referred earlier to the Ordnance Survey maps.  I see no reason why these maps could not be published solely in Irish.  Arrangements are being made to publish bilingual maps.  The original names were in Irish.  When the Ordnance Survey were founded in 1836 they set about deciding on place names and the final choice was made from anglicised names, ignoring the fact that 90 per cent of the people were still using the Irish version.  There is a good case to be made for having maps solely in Irish.  It would be of great assistance in the drive for bilingualism.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="91" /> I agree with Senator O'Brien that in using Irish we should be careful not to embarrass people.  I agree with his idea of having captions in Irish on the television screen as the news is being read.  I met a taxi driver once who told me that he had taken a dislike to Irish because Irish speakers used it to embarrass him. He said that foreign tourists would not do such a thing.</P>
    <P>The newspapers use a fair amount of Irish but they often include very difficult words and I am inclined to leave aside an article because of that.  Articles could be written without using such difficult words but where it is necessary to use them they could be listed at the end of the article with a translation.  This would encourage people to read articles in Irish.</P>
    <P>I notice in this funding for additional activities 1983 to 1986 that very modest sums are involved &mdash; £250,000 extra in 1983, £757,000 extra in 1984, £275,000 extra in 1985 and £233,000 extra in 1986 and I do not think there should be any problems about providing them.  I notice that in 1985 and 1986, for whatever reason, there is no provision for the intensive courses.  I feel this is a mistake because four or five years ago I availed of the intensive Irish course.  It is a six weeks course &mdash; four hours each night and three hours on a Saturday morning. There were over 20 in the class I attended.  I did a round journey of nearly 90 miles for all of that time and I was not late on one occasion and everybody else was as committed as I was.  I could not speak highly enough of the teachers.  At the end of the course you have a fairly good working knowledge of Irish but what can you do with it?  The plan in that respect will create the environment and it will give that encouragement.  I welcome the proposal to set up an all-party committee to consider the plan, to review the present position of the language, both in the Gaeltacht and outside it, and to make recommendations to the Government on an all-Irish policy for the future.</P>
    <P>Ag deireadh críochnófaidh mé lán de dhóchas go n-éireoidh linn an Ghaeilge a shabháil mar theanga labhartha le cuidiú <Col N="92" /> an phlean seo ar fud na tíre go léir agus go deo deo fosta.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne1" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá a lán ráite anseo inniu i dtaobh na Gaeilge agus trí Ghaeilge.  Is dócha go bhfuil i bhfad níos mó ráite inniu trí Ghaeilge ná mar a labhradh ó thángamar le chéile anseo i mí Feabhra nó Márta.  De réir dealraimh tá Gaeilge ag a lán daoine sa Seanad ach tá sé faoi cheilt.  Chuir sé ionadh an domhain orm nuair a tháinig mé anseo don chéad uair agus tháinig an Príomh-Chléireach isteach agus dúirt sé an phaidir trí Ghaeilge agus ní raibh morán Gaeilge le cloisteáil as sin amach anseo sa Seanad. Ni dóigh liom go bhfuilimid ag déanamh ár ndóthain ar chor ar bith ar son na Gaeilge sa Seanad anseo agus cé nach raibh mé fós sa Dáil ní dóigh liom go bhfuil siad ag déanamh go leor ansin ach an oiread.</P>
      <P>Cuireann sé ionadh orm bheith ag éisteacht le daoine atá an-chliste agus go bhfuil an-taithí acu ar an Ghaeilge agus an Ghaeltacht a bheith ag cur an béim anseo ar airgead.  Bheadh go leor Gaeilge sa tír seo gan punt ar bith a chaitheamh anois dá dtosnódh daoine ag labhairt na Gaeilge atá acu agus is é mo thuairim má thugann an Rialtas seo £20 milliún gach bliain go ceann 10 mbliana muna bhfuil suim ag na daoine agus muna bhfuil dea-thoil ag na daoine ní bheidh focal breise Gaeilge á labhairt nó le cloisteáil. Tá seo go hiontach go bhfuil an plean seo againn.  Tá a lán rudaí maithe ann agus beidh a lán rudaí nua sa tír má chuirtear i bhfeidim é.  Ach an mbeidh Gaeilge le cloisteáil sa tír &mdash; sin an cheist?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá an plean seo roinnte suas ó thaobh oideachais de, an chéad rud.  Tá múinteoirí na tíre seo ag múineadh Gaeilge leis na blianta.  Deirtear anois nach bhfuil na múinteoirí atá ann faoi láthair chomh maith leis na seanmhúinteoirí. B'fhéidir go bhfuil sé sin ceart.  Níl a fhios agam.  Ní aontaím leis mar tá mé sórt prejudiced is dócha, ach cén fáth nach bhfuil Gaeilge le cloisteáil anois os rud é go raibh na seanmhúinteoirí chomh maith sin?  Bhí daoine ag caint faoi na coláistí ullmhúcháin anseo, go raibh daoine sna coláisti ullmhúchain ar fad cúig bliana ag labhairt <Col N="93" /> na Gaeilge nuair a bíodh siad ag feitheamh le dul isteach sna coláistí.  Bhí a lán dóibh ann.  Níl an Ghaeilge le cloisteáil; níl na daoine á labhairt ar fud na tíre agus is dócha go raibh na múinteoirí sin ag múineadh sna scoileanna ar fud na tíre.</P>
    <P>Is é mo thuairim féin go bhfuil i bhfad níos mó suime ag na muinteoirí ón Ghalltacht i labhairt na Gaeilge agus i múineadh na Gaeilge ná mar atá ag na daoine a tháinig ón Ghaeltacht.  Caithfidh mé a rá go bhfuil i bhfad níos mó suime ag na daoine ón Ghalltacht go bhfuil Gaeilge acu an Ghaeilge a labhairt ná mar atá ag na daoine a thagann ón Ghaeltacht. Nuair a thagann siad isteach sa Ghalltacht sílim féin go bhfuil náire orthu an Ghaeilge a labhairt ach tá sé an-deacair comhrá a bheith leo agus níl puinn maitheasa bheith ag caint faoi airgead agus a leithéid agus foirgnimh agus gach sórt cúnaimh chun an Ghaeilge a chur ar aghaidh muna bhfuil na daoine go bhfuil an Ghaeilge acu toilteanach í a labhairt. Ní féidir liom é sin a rá minic go leor.  Dá mbeadh suim ag na tuismitheoirí sa Ghaeilge, dá mbeadh an cúlra ceart sa bhaile, bheadh Gaeilge ag cuid is mó de na daoine sa tír mar tá Gaeilge ag na páistí ag dul abhaile ón scoil.  Bíonn ionadh orm nuair a théim isteach i siopa uaireanta agus bíonn páistí istigh ann agus deirim rud éigin trí Gaeilge leo. Féachann siad orm agus ionadh an domhain orthu go bhfuil Gaeilge taobh amuigh den scoil.  Ceapann an chuid is mó de na páistí nach bhfuil an Ghaeilge le cloisteáil ach taobh istigh den scoil agus sin an áit cheart don teanga sin.  Má bhíonn daoine sa bhaile ag caint leis na páistí, má bhíonn suim acu, b'fhéidir nach mbeadh Gaeilge acu ach má tá suim acu, leanfaidh na páistí ar aghaidh ag labhairt trí Ghaeilge taobh amuigh den scoil.  Go minic nuair a bhím ag caint ar an telefón le daoine, má thagann páiste don telefón cuirim ceist ar an bpáiste an bhfuil a dhaidí sa bhaile nó rud éigin agus go minic bíonn áthas an domhain orm go ndeir siad &ldquo;Ó <Col N="94" /> tá;&rdquo; uaireanta eile deireann siad &ldquo;he is&rdquo; agus bíonn sort scanradh orthu go bhfuil Gaeilge ag teacht tríd an telefón nuair nár chóir dó bheith ann chor ar bith.</P>
    <P>Bhí daoine ag caint faoin státseirbhís an tseachtain seo caite.  Bhí mé ag caint le Roinn anseo agus dúirt an cailín liomsa i nGaeilge cén Roinn a bhí ann agus ní maith liom a rá cé acu Roinn a bhí ann agus dúirt mise an bhfuil an tAire ann. De réir dealraimh chuir sí a bos ar an nguthán mar dúirt sí &ldquo;an tAire&rdquo; agus dúirt duine éigin in aice léi &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; agus tháinig sí ar ais chugam.  Níl a fhios agam an raibh mise i mbrionglóid nó cad a bhí ar siúl ach bhí ionadh an domhain orm nach mbeadh eolas go leor ag duine ar an nguthán chun an focal sin a thuiscint.</P>

      <P>Earlier today there was some discussion about when we should sit to complete this motion.  My understanding is that it would be the general wish not to continue tomorrow morning but to leave this debate over to be concluded next week and to sit for that purpose, among others, on Wednesday next.  If we do wish next week to take the Bill which is No. 1 on today's Order Paper in Committee and Final Stages, to complete this motion and also to allow three hours' debate for a Private Member's motion proposed by the Fianna Fáil Party, I would suggest, a Chathaoirligh, that we should meet somewhat earlier than usual.  My suggestion would be that we should adjourn now until 11.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 19 October.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.30 p.m. until 11.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 19 October 1983.</P>
